It translates the level of knowledge of the autochthones and immigrants communities on the vegetable biodiversity exploitation. The interest of this study relates to the ethnobotany aspects, mainly the parts used, the mode of use and the effects induced on the behaviour of the individuals, following their catch. Though several of these plants are largely used in traditional pharmacopoeia, the reasons of the catches go from the voluntary facts for the psychotropic ones, with accidental for the food ones. The use of the exotic plants (decorative) reveals secondary or primary uses ignored by Congolese populations. Have regard to the severity of the intoxications induced by these plants, particularly Datura cf. fastuosa, Tetracarpidium conophorum and Dioscorea spp., the new behaviours are observed within the communities, on their management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDatura 3aDioscorea 3abiodiversity 3aethnobotany 3aflora 3aimmigration 3aintroduced plants 3apoisonous plants 3avegetables 3aRepublic of the Congo1 aKoubouana, F.1 aApani, E.1 aMotom, M.1 aMakita-Madzou, J. -P.0 tPhytotheÌrapie.g2012 Feb., v. 10, no. 1 p.19-24dSpringer-Verlagx1624-85977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10298-012-0684-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012800166300001800294520085400312592002801166650001401194650002101208650001201229650001301241650001101254650002501265650003101290650002001321650001901341653001701360653002501377653001601402653001301418653001901431700002401450700002901474700003201503700001901535700005901554700001801613773014301631856008501774852000901859655001201868IND60598886020180816000000.0180702e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059888602DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b041352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Biwen10aTrialkylamine-Catalyzed Aldolization of Unprotected 1,3-Dihydroxyacetone (DHA) toward C–C Bond-Linked Tetraol Surfactants  ap. 2630-2640.  aThe aldolization of unprotected 1,3-dihydroxyacetone (DHA) was studied under mild conditions (20 °C) in a mixture of water/EtOH using hydrocinnamaldehyde as a model substrate. It was shown that trimethylamine is the most effective base for this transformation, giving the corresponding aldol with up to 98% selectivity and 82% yield. The method was extended to a range of (biobased) aldehydes to give α-hydroxyketones with 29–70% isolated yields. These α-hydroxyketones were reduced under hydrogen using 5%-Ru/Al₂O₃ in EtOH at 100 °C to give tetraols with 79–97% isolated yields. The physicochemical properties of these tetraols were studied (CMC, Krafft point, PIT-slope method), and these studies revealed that this new class of C–C bond-linked nonionic surfactants exhibits high effectiveness, reducing the surface tension of water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3achemical bonding 3aethanol 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3anonionic surfactants 3aphysicochemical properties 3asurface tension 3atrimethylamine 0aAldolization 0a1,3-Dihydroxyacetone 0aSurfactants 0aTetraols 0aTrialkylamines1 aBelmessieri, Dorine1 aOntiveros, Jesús Fermin1 aAubry, J.-M.q(Jean-Marie),1 aChen, Guo-Rong1 aDuguet, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9425-74501 aLemaire, Marc0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 2 p.2630-2640dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b041353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011300171300001600284520140000300592002801700650001301728650001401741650002001755650001501775650002401790650001001814650001101824650001701835650003901852650002101891650003001912650002301942650001501965650001601980650001301996653000802009653001202017653000802029653000902037653000902046653000902055653005002064653003602114653003402150653002002184653002402204653001102228700002902239773007702268856008502345852000902430655001202439IND60567391220221116173744.0170628e20170801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.04.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlieva, Roza R.10aVariability of fluorescence spectra of coelenteramide-containing proteins as a basis for toxicity monitoring  ap. 425-431.  aNowadays, physicochemical approach to understanding toxic effects remains underdeveloped. A proper development of such mode would be concerned with simplest bioassay systems. Coelenteramide-Containing Fluorescent Proteins (CLM-CFPs) can serve as proper tools for study primary physicochemical processes in organisms under external exposures. CLM-CFPs are products of bioluminescent reactions of marine coelenterates. As opposed to Green Fluorescent Proteins, the CLM-CFPs are not widely applied in biomedical research, and their potential as colored biomarkers is undervalued now. Coelenteramide, fluorophore of CLM-CFPs, is a photochemically active molecule; it acts as a proton donor in its electron-excited states, generating several forms of different fluorescent state energy and, hence, different fluorescence color, from violet to green. Contributions of the forms to the visible fluorescence depend on the coelenteramide microenvironment in proteins. Hence, CLM-CFPs can serve as fluorescence biomarkers with color differentiation to monitor results of destructive biomolecule exposures. The paper reviews experimental and theoretical studies of spectral-luminescent and photochemical properties of CLM-CFPs, as well as their variation under different exposures – chemicals, temperature, and ionizing radiation. Application of CLM-CFPs as toxicity bioassays of a new type is justified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnidaria 3abioassays 3abioluminescence 3abiomarkers 3abiomedical research 3acolor 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aionizing radiation 3amonitoring 3atemperature 3atoxicity 0aCLM 0aCLM-CFP 0aGFP 0aDMSO 0aHOMO 0aLUMO 0aCoelenteramide-containing fluorescent protein 0aMulticolor fluorescent bioassay 0aPrimary photochemical process 0aProton transfer 0aProtein destruction 0aObelin1 aKudryasheva, Nadezhda S.0 tTalanta.g2017 Aug. 01, v. 170 p.425-431dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2017.04.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245008200170300001600252520162200268592002801890650001801918650001701936650001501953650001301968650001301981650001301994650001702007650001102024650001402035650001602049700002002065700002302085700002102108773009402129856005502223852000902278655001202287IND4501431320221122002458.0150416e199906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450143132DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00376.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Jae Kyun11aAStudy of Deleterious Gene Structure in Plants Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo  ap. 376-386.  aThe characteristics of deleterious genes have been of great interest in both theory and practice in genetics. Because of the complex genetic mechanism of these deleterious genes, most current studies try to estimate the overall magnitude of mortality effects on a population, which is characterized classically by the number of lethal equivalents. This number is a combination of several parameters, each of which has a distinct biological effect on genetic mortality. In conservation and breeding programs, it is important to be able to distinguish among different combinations of these parameters that lead to the same number of lethal equivalents, such as a large number of mildly deleterious genes or a few lethal genes. The ability to distinguish such parameter combinations requires more than one generation of mating. We propose a model for survival data from a twoâgeneration mating experiment on the plant species Brassica rapa, and we enable inference with Markov chain Monte Carlo. This computational strategy is effective because a vast amount of missing genotype information must be accounted for. In addition to the lethal equivalents, the twoâgeneration data provide separate information on the average intensity of mortality and the average number of deleterious genes carried by an individual. In our Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we use a vector proposal distribution to overcome inefficiency of a singleâsite Gibbs sampler. Information about environmental effects is obtained from an outcrossing experiment conducted in parallel with the twoâgeneration mating experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica rapa 3aMarkov chain 3aalgorithms 3abiometry 3agenetics 3agenotype 3alethal genes 3amodels 3amortality 3aoutcrossing1 aLascoux, Martin1 aNewton, Michael A.1 aNrdheim, Erik V.0 tBiometrics.g1999 June, v. 55, no. 2 p.376-386dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0006-341X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0006-341X.1999.00376.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012900169300001800298520115100316592002801467650001501495650002501510650001401535650002301549650001901572650004901591650001501640650001801655650001301673650001301686650001401699650001701713650001101730650001701741650002701758653001501785653001901800653003101819653003601850700001801886700001901904700005401923700001601977700005501993773014302048856008502191852000902276655001202285IND60598886920221121224316.0180702e20180328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059888692DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b041672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xueyao10aMetal-Free Mesoporous SiO2 Nanorods as a Highly Efficient Catalyst for the Baeyer–Villiger Oxidation under Mild Conditions  ap. 5868-5876.  aThe development of efficient and environmentally friendly catalysts for oxidative reaction is of great importance in applied catalysis. In this work, a simple and environmentally benign approach for highly selective preparation of ε-caprolactone by oxidation of cyclohexanone has been carried out, which employed metal-free mesoporous silica (mSiO₂) nanorods as catalyst under atmospheric pressure. The metal-free silica catalyst was applied for the first time in the Baeyer–Villiger (B–V) oxidation reaction. It showed efficient catalytic performance for the B–V oxidation of various cyclic ketones and aliphatic ketones with O₂/benzaldehyde as oxidant. The catalyst could be easily separated from the reaction system by filtration and reused several times without significance loss of activity. Moreover, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of the reaction were obtained, indicating the existence of benzoyloxyl radical. The mechanism study of the reaction demonstrated that the super large surface area diluted the concentration of radicals and the adsorption of radicals could protect the radical species from inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aatmospheric pressure 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acyclohexanones 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afiltration 3afree radicals 3ananorods 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3asilica 3asurface area 3asustainable technology 0aMetal-free 0amSiO2 nanorods 0aBaeyer−Villiger reaction 0aEPR spectra·of mechanism study1 aYang, Honglei1 aYang, Guangxue1 aLi, Shuwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9511-25551 aWang, Xiang1 aMa, Jiantai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3133-76960 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Mar. 28, v. 6, no. 5 p.5868-5876dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b041673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016100165300001800326520131800344592002801662650001201690650001601702650001501718650001501733650001401748650002501762650002201787650001301809650001501822650001301837650002101850650002301871650001301894650001001907650002101917653001401938653002501952653002501977653002302002653001902025700005602044700006702100773014302167856008502310852000902395655001202404IND60598887420221121224336.0180702e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059888742DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b041782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhai, Rui10aExtent of Enzyme Inhibition by Phenolics Derived from Pretreated Biomass Is Significantly Influenced by the Size and Carbonyl Group Content of the Phenolics  ap. 3823-3829.  aIn the current biorefinery concept, hydrothermal-based pretreatments such as steam pretreatment are often used to first open up the plant cell wall structure and increase the accessibility of the cellulose component to cellulase enzymes. However, this pretreatment process also generates water-soluble phenolics that are strongly inhibitory to the cellulase enzymes, therefore limiting the efficiency of the enzymatic hydrolysis of the pretreated biomass. Although some earlier work assessed the influence of phenolics on cellulose hydrolysis, the characteristics of the phenolics that most influenced inhibition have not yet been elucidated. As biomass-derived phenolics are heterogeneous monomer/oligomeric/polymeric aromatic compounds that have diverse functional groups and varied molecular size, the current work investigated the influence of the major structural properties of the pretreatment-derived phenolics, such as their molecular weight and the nature of their hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, on enzyme inhibition.

Sequencing functionally relevant regions of the short wavelength sensitive type 1 (SWS1) opsin gene that is responsible for modulating the extent of SWS1 UV sensitivity in birds allows predictions to be made about the visual system’s UV sensitivity in species where direct physiological or behavioral measures would be impractical or unethical. Here, we present SWS1 segment sequence data from representative species of three avian lineages for which visually based cues for foraging and communication have been investigated to varying extents. We also present a preliminary phylogenetic analysis and ancestral character state reconstructions of key spectral tuning sites along the SWS1 opsin based on our sequence data. The results suggest ubiquitous ultraviolet SWS1 sensitivity (UVS) in both paleognaths, including extinct moa (Emeidae), and parrots, including the nocturnal and flightless kakapo (Strigops habroptilus), and in most, but not all, songbird (oscine) lineages, and confirmed violet sensitivity (VS) in two suboscine families. Passerine hosts of avian brood parasites were included both UVS and VS taxa, but sensitivity did not co-vary with egg rejection behaviors. The results should stimulate future research into the functional parallels between the roles of visual signals and the genetic basis of visual sensitivity in birds and other taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3aeggs 3aforaging 3agenes 3ahosts 3amating behavior 3aopsin 3aparasites 3aparrots 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3asongbirds 3awavelengths 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimals 2aAvian Proteinsxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aColor Visionxradiation effects 2aCues 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aExtinction, Biological 2aFeeding Behaviorxradiation effects 2aPalaeognathaexgenetics 2aParrotsxgenetics 2aPasseriformesxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aRod Opsinsxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSpecies Specificity 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aVision, Ocularxradiation effects1 aHuynen, Leon1 aBrennan, Patricia L.

By this method, we can readily regulate the Ni–Fe proportion and change the embedded guest anions into the LDH under our in situ synthetic condition by just using different nickel salts to prepare Ni–Fe LDH. It is found that the Ni–Fe ratio and the embedded guest anions can dramatically influence the corresponding OER catalytic performance. An excellent OER activity that delivering overpotentials of about 210 and 240 mV to reach 10 and 100 mA cm–² current densities in 1.0 M KOH was achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanions 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3afoams 3airon 3anickel 3aoxygen production 3apotassium hydroxide 3asalts 0aWater oxidation 0aNoble-metal-free 0aLayered double hydroxide 0aNanomaterial 0aElectrocatalysis1 aWang, Chuan-Jun1 aHou, Chun-Chao1 aFu, Wen-Fu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8631-31331 aChen, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6689-89230 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 01, v. 6, no. 3 p.2893-2897dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b041993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245012300179300001600302520117700318592002801495650001601523650001101539650001201550650001001562650002001572650001101592650001501603650001801618650001701636653001301653653001801666653002501684653002901709653001701738653001401755700002901769700002801798700003801826700002501864700006301889773007701952856008902029852000902118655001202127IND60567393620221116174323.0170628e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltenhofen, Stefani10aTebuconazole alters morphological, behavioral and neurochemical parameters in larvae and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio)  ap. 483-490.  aIn this study, we evaluated the effects of tebuconazole on morphology and exploratory larvae behavior and adult locomotion. Furthermore, we analyzed the effects of this fungicide on AChE activity and gene expression in zebrafish larvae and in the adult zebrafish brain. Tebuconazole (4 mg/L) increased the ocular distance in larvae and reduced the distance travelled, absolute turn angle, line crossing and time outside area in exposed larvae. Moreover, adult zebrafish that were exposed to this fungicide (4 and 6 mg/L) showed a decrease in distance travelled and mean speed when compared to the control group. However, tebuconazole did not alter the number of line crossings or time spent in the upper zone. Tebuconazole inhibited AChE activity at concentrations of 4 mg/L for larvae and 4 and 6 mg/L in the adult zebrafish brain. However, this fungicide did not alter AChE gene expression in the adult zebrafish brain but increased AChE mRNA transcript levels in larvae. These findings demonstrated that tebuconazole could modulate the cholinergic system by altering AChE activity and that this change may be associated with the reduced locomotion of these animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3aanimals 3abrain 3agene expression 3alarvae 3alocomotion 3amessenger RNA 3atebuconazole 0aBehavior 0aAcetylcholine 0aAcetylcholinesterase 0aMorphological parameters 0aTebuconazole 0aZebrafish1 aNabinger, Débora Dreher1 aWiprich, Melissa Talita1 aPereira, Talita Carneiro Brandão1 aBogo, Maurício Reis1 aBonan, Carla Denise1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9715-62440 tChemosphere.g2017 Aug., v. 180 p.483-490dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.04.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245008500179300001600264520173600280592002802016650001402044650001402058650002702072650002702099650001302126650000902139650001702148650001002165650001102175650001602186650002302202650001102225650001602236650001002252651001802262773009302280856005502373852000902428655001202437IND50067684520221120224514.0130706e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006768452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00018.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassall, Christopher10aTime stress and temperature explain continental variation in damselfly body size  ap. 894-903.  aBody size is among the most important biological variables but despite much measurement of this trait, the factors driving its variation are not fully understood. Here, I describe variation in body size in the damselfly Calopteryx maculata to establish whether variations in growth and development observed in response to experimental manipulation of temperature and time stress in the laboratory can be scaled‐up to variation among natural populations. Nine hundred and seven specimens of C. maculata males were collected from 34 sites across the species’ entire range in North America during the summer of 2010. A general measure of body size was derived from a series of wing and leg measurements. I compare the fit of models based on latitude (Bergmann’s rule), temperature (the temperature–size rule) and seasonal effects (a combination of temperature and time stress) using Akaike’s information criterion (AIC). The U‐shaped relationship between size and latitude was best explained by a seasonality model containing both photoperiod and temperature. The presence of both these terms suggests that time stress dominates in the southern part of the range, reducing body size by accelerating development. However, the temperature–size rule dominates in the northern part of the range, increasing body size closer to the northern range margin. The best‐fit model of geographic variation in size is in accordance with previous laboratory studies of temperature and photoperiod in damselflies and theoretical work, indicating that the findings from such studies can be applied to natural populations. These findings are likely applicable to any species with complex life histories inhabiting seasonal environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZygoptera 3abody size 3ageographical variation 3agrowth and development 3alatitude 3alegs 3alife history 3amales 3amodels 3aphotoperiod 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atemperature 3awings 3aNorth America0 tEcography.g2013 Aug., v. 36, no. 8 p.894-903dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.00018.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003300113040001800146100001900164245005900183300001800242500000900260520181200269592002802081650002002109650002302129650001702152650002002169650001502189650002602204650002602230650001902256650002502275650001602300650003302316650002402349650002802373773012402401852000902525856011202534856008002646961001302726655001202739IND4363582220221119063449.0191226e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436358222DNAL7 a10113/115432hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2003.14042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, John M.10aRecalcitrant Problems in Environmental Instrumentation  ap. 1404-1407.  aepub  aFrontiers in any science are generally defined by measurement limitations, and that is especially true in environmental biophysics. Among the more persistent issues are surface–atmosphere exchange, soil water and solute fluxes, plant water status, and plant/soil nutrient status. Measurement of surface–atmosphere exchange is particularly critical to global climate change research. Despite advances in instrumentation, accuracy of flux measurements, particularly eddy covariance, remains unacceptable, partly because the underlying assumptions of stationarity and surface homogeneity are so restrictive. Even when these assumptions are valid, the method appears to systematically underestimate for reasons that are not yet well understood. Similarly, soil water and solute fluxes cannot yet be measured accurately and routinely, hampering water quality research. Recent advances in tension lysimetry offer hope for improvement, but most field experiments still rely on modeling of water and solute flow, supported by indirect measurements of ancillary variables, e.g., soil water content, soil water potential, and solute concentration, at discrete points in time and space. A third area of ongoing concern is that of plant water status. The major uncertainty here concerns which property should be measured. Nearly all of the effort over the past 30 yr has been directed at measuring water potential, but water potential measurements are equilibrium measurements, and plants operate in dynamic environments. Furthermore, many physiological processes appear to be more related to relative water content than to water potential. Finally, more accurate and more timely (e.g., in situ) measurements of plant/soil nutrient status are sorely needed to take advantage of the promise of precision agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant nutrition 3asoil water content 3agas exchange 3ainstrumentation 3abiophysics 3aplant-water relations 3aenvironmental science 3asoil fertility 3asoil water potential 3ameasurement 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3asoil water movement 3asoil-plant interactions0 tAgronomy journal.g2003 Nov., v. 95, no. 6 p.1404-1407dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/115433Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2003.14043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02925naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003300113040001800146100001700164245005700181300001800238500000900256520158200265592002801847650002301875650002301898650001301921650001501934650001701949650001901966650001201985650002801997650002002025650002002045650001102065650001002076650001502086650002302101651001702124773012402141852000902265856011202274856008002386961001302466655001202479IND4363583620221119063434.0191226e200311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436358362DNAL7 a10113/115462hdl7 a10.2134/agronj2003.15042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, A.

Evapotranspiration (ET) was measured using the Bowen ratio energy balance method on three grasslands at Mandan, ND: a nongrazed mixed-grass prairie (prairie), a grazed mixed-grass prairie (grazed prairie), and a grazed western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii (Rybd) Löve] site (western wheatgrass). Measurements were made from 24 April to 17 October (the growing period) in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Peak ET rates generally coincided with periods of peak biomass production and occurred between early July and early August. Peak biomass averaged 1097 kg ha⁻¹ for the prairie, 1227 kg ha⁻¹ for grazed prairie, and 1725 kg ha⁻¹ for western wheatgrass, and peak leaf area index averaged 0.38 for the prairie, 0.44 for grazed prairie, and 0.59 for western wheatgrass. Growing period (175 d) ET averaged 489 mm for the prairie, 455 mm for the grazed prairie, and 497 mm for the western wheatgrass while growing period precipitation averaged 320 mm. Evapotranspiration of grazed prairie was 7% less than nongrazed prairie and 8% less than western wheatgrass. Evapotranspiration of the nongrazed prairie and the grazed western wheatgrass were similar. The ratio of the latent heat of ET to net radiation averaged 0.25 for grazed prairie and 0.28 for prairie, suggesting that grazing changed the canopy structure and energy budget components that affected ET. These results suggest that in a semiarid environment, proper grazing of prairie grasslands conserves soil water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPascopyrum smithii 3aevapotranspiration 3aprairies 3aarid lands 3aforage crops 3awater quantity 3agrazing 3adry matter accumulation 3aleaf area index 3asolar radiation 3acanopy 3alight 3acrop yield 3asoil water content 3aNorth Dakota0 tAgronomy journal.g2003 Nov., v. 95, no. 6 p.1504-1509dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/115463Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2003.15043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03363naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245011000176300001600286520203000302592002802332650002302360650001202383650002002395650001802415650001602433650000902449650001602458650001502474650001802489650001502507651001002522653004202532653002002574653005902594700001802653700002002671700002402691700001602715773010202731856008702833852000902920655001202929IND60567395720221116174022.0170627e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDalla Libera, Nico10aGeostatistics as a tool to improve the natural background level definition: An application in groundwater  ap. 330-340.  aThe Natural Background Level (NBL), suggested by UE BRIDGE project, is suited for spatially distributed datasets providing a regional value that could be higher than the Threshold Value (TV) set by every country. In hydro-geochemically dis-homogeneous areas, the use of a unique regional NBL, higher than TV, could arise problems to distinguish between natural occurrences and anthropogenic contaminant sources. Hence, the goal of this study is to improve the NBL definition employing a geostatistical approach, which reconstructs the contaminant spatial structure accounting geochemical and hydrogeological relationships. This integrated mapping is fundamental to evaluate the contaminant's distribution impact on the NBL, giving indications to improve it. We decided to test this method on the Drainage Basin of Venice Lagoon (DBVL, NE Italy), where the existing NBL is seven times higher than the TV. This area is notoriously affected by naturally occurring arsenic contamination. An available geochemical dataset collected by 50 piezometers was used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of arsenic in the densely populated area of the DBVL. A cokriging approach was applied exploiting the geochemical relationships among As, Fe and NH4+. The obtained spatial predictions of arsenic concentrations were divided into three different zones: i) areas with an As concentration lower than the TV, ii) areas with an As concentration between the TV and the median of the values higher than the TV, and iii) areas with an As concentration higher than the median. Following the BRIDGE suggestions, where enough samples were available, the 90th percentile for each zone was calculated to obtain a local NBL (LNBL). Differently from the original NBL, this local value gives more detailed water quality information accounting the hydrogeological and geochemical setting, and contaminant spatial variation. Hence, the LNBL could give more indications about the distinction between natural occurrence and anthropogenic contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3aarsenic 3adata collection 3ageostatistics 3agroundwater 3airon 3apiezometers 3aprediction 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aItaly 0aLocal Natural Background Level (LNBL) 0aCokriging (COK) 0aArsenic and Drainage Basin to the Venice Lagoon (DBVL)1 aFabbri, Paolo1 aMason, Leonardo1 aPiccinini, Leonardo1 aPola, Marco0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.330-340dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245015500214300001600369520197400385592002802359650002102387650002202408650002402430650001002454650001602464650002902480650001602509650001902525650001302544650002902557650001302586650002502599650001802624650001502642650001902657650002402676650000902700650001802709650002402727650001402751653002802765653002802793653004102821653002402862653001602886700001502902700001502917700001702932700001502949773010202964856008703066852000903153655001203162IND60567395920221116174142.0170627e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRezaei Rashti, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2639-754710aAssessment of N2O emissions from a fertilised vegetable cropping soil under different plant residue management strategies using 15N tracing techniques  ap. 479-487.  aCombined application of plant residues and N fertilisers strongly affect soil mineral N dynamics and N2O emissions depending on the quality of the plant residues, their application methods and other management strategies. We investigated the effect of combined application of two vegetable plant residues (cauliflower and sweet corn) and 15N fertiliser on N dynamics and N2O emission in a glasshouse pot study. The experiment was conducted under two residue management practices (soil incorporation vs surface mulching) over 98days with growing basil (Ocimum basilicum) plants. We also assessed the efficacy of applying the nitrification inhibitor, 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) to the plant residues, for reducing N loss and mitigating N2O emissions. Application of plant residues, both on the soil surface or into soil, resulted in net N mineralisation and increased cumulative N2O emission compared with the application of N fertiliser alone. Soil surface mulching of sweet corn decreased total and residue-induced cumulative N2O emission compared with the incorporation method, while it showed opposite effect on N2O emissions from cauliflower residue. The application of DMPP with sweet corn residue reduced total, residue- and fertiliser-induced N2O emissions; however its application with cauliflower residue did not show any mitigating effect on the N2O emissions. The residue application methods and the use of DMPP did not significantly affect 15N recovery by the basil plants. In contrast, soil incorporation of these residues doubled the microbial immobilisation of applied 15N into soil organic matter. Linear regression analysis of N2O emission during the experimental period indicated that in the treatments without DMPP application, soil NO3−-N concentration was the most important factor in controlling the magnitude of N2O emissions, while the application of DMPP changed the dominant regulating factor from NO3−-N to NH4+-N concentration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOcimum basilicum 3aammonium nitrogen 3aapplication methods 3abasil 3acauliflower 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouses 3amineralization 3amulching 3anitrification inhibitors 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3aphosphates 3aplant residues 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3asoil minerals 3asoil organic matter 3asweetcorn 0aCrop residue management 0aNitrification inhibitor 0a3,4-Dimethylpyrazol phosphate (DMPP) 0aNitrous oxide (N2O) 0a15N tracing1 aWang, W.J.1 aChen, C.R.1 aReeves, S.H.1 aScheer, C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.479-487dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03620naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245015200164300001200316520200200328592002802330596005902358596005902417596007202476650002602548650001902574650001502593650002402608650001002632650000902642650001702651650001602668650004302684650002002727650002202747650001102769700002402780700001602804700001602820700001202836700001402848700001302862700005802875773011302933856008303046852000903129655001203138IND60719592720221120103500.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071959272DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04457-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Tianqi10aRNA sequencing analysis of altered expression of long noncoding RNAs associated with Schistosoma japonicum infection in the murine liver and spleen  ap. 601.  aBACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a chronic, debilitating infectious disease caused by members of the genus Schistosoma. Previous findings have suggested a relationship between infection with Schistosoma spp. and alterations in the liver and spleen of infected animals. Recent reports have shown the regulatory role of noncoding RNAs, such as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), in different biological processes. However, little is known about the role of lncRNAs in the mouse liver and spleen during Schistosoma japonicum infection. METHODS: In this study, we identified and investigated lncRNAs using standard RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). The biological functions of the altered expression of lncRNAs and their target genes were predicted using bioinformatics. Ten dysregulated lncRNAs were selected randomly and validated in reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) experiments. RESULTS: Our study identified 29,845 and 33,788 lncRNAs from the liver and spleen, respectively, of which 212 were novel lncRNAs. We observed that 759 and 789 of the lncRNAs were differentially expressed in the respective organs. The RT-qPCR results correlated well with the sequencing data. In the liver, 657 differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted to target 2548 protein-coding genes, whereas in the spleen 660 differentially expressed lncRNAs were predicted to target 2673 protein-coding genes. Moreover, functional annotation showed that the target genes of the differentially expressed lncRNAs were associated with cellular processes, metabolic processes, and binding, and were significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, the cell cycle, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and pathways in cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that numerous lncRNAs were differentially expressed in S. japonicum-infected liver and spleen compared to control liver and spleen; this suggested that lncRNAs may be involved in pathogenesis in the liver and spleen during S. japonicum infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a31672550cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31472187cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFD0501306-3cKey Technologies Research and Development Program 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3abioinformatics 3acell cycle 3ainfectious diseases 3aliver 3amice 3apathogenesis 3aproteolysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aschistosomiasis 3asequence analysis 3aspleen1 aGiri, Bikash Ranjan1 aLiu, Jingyi1 aDu, Pengfei1 aLi, Xue1 aLi, Xuxin1 aLi, Shun1 aCheng, Guofeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5249-10650 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.601-601dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04457-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03748naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245017800214300001800392520199900410592002802409650002602437650002502463650002102488650001902509650001802528650001502546650002102561650002102582650001402603650001902617650001802636650001102654650001502665650001902680650000902699650001902708650001102727650001502738650002002753650001802773650001802791650002202809653002102831653000802852653001502860653001802875653001502893653001602908700002302924700002302947773010402970856008703074852000903161655001203170IND60567396220221116174039.0170627e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdyel, Tanveer M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5940-540610aStorm event-scale nutrient attenuation in constructed wetlands experiencing a Mediterranean climate: A comparison of a surface flow and hybrid surface-subsurface flow system  ap. 1001-1014.  aAmong different Water Sensitive Urban Design options, constructed wetlands (CWs) are used to protect and restore downstream water quality by attenuating nutrients generated by stormwater runoff. This research compared the nutrient attenuation ability during a diverse population of storm events of two CWs: (a) a hybrid CW with multiple alternating surface flow (SF) and laterite-based subsurface flow (SSF) compartments, and (b) a single stage SF CW. Within-storm variability, nutrient concentrations were assessed at 2 to 3-h intervals at both the main inlet and outlet of each CW. Dissolved oxygen concentrations of the surface waters were also monitored at 10-min intervals using high frequency in situ sensors. Nutrient loads into the CWs were observed to be higher when a high rainfall event occurred, particularly after longer antecedent dry conditions. Longer hydraulic retention times promoted higher attenuation at both sites. However, the relative extent of nutrient attenuation differed between the CW types; the mean total nitrogen (TN) attenuation in the hybrid and SF CW was 45 and 48%, respectively. The hybrid CW attenuated 67% total phosphorus (TP) loads on average, while the SF CW acted as a net TP source. Periodic storm events transitioned the lentic CW into a lotic CW and caused riparian zone saturation; it was therefore hypothesized that such saturation of organic matter rich-riparian zones led to release of TP in the system. The hybrid CW attenuated the released TP in the downstream laterite-based SSF compartments. Diel oxygen metabolism calculated before and after the storm events was found to be strongly correlated with water temperature, solar exposure and antecedent dry condition during the pre-storm conditions. Furthermore, the SF CW showed a significant relationship between overall nutrient load attenuation and the change in oxygen metabolism during the storm perturbation, suggesting oxygen variation could be a useful proxy indicator of CW function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMediterranean climate 3aconstructed wetlands 3adissolved oxygen 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3ametabolism 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aoverland flow 3aoxygen 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3arain 3ariparian areas 3astorms 3astormwater 3asubsurface flow 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awater temperature 0aDissolved oxygen 0aEMC 0aMetabolism 0aNutrient load 0aSaturation 0aStorm event1 aOldham, Carolyn E.1 aHipsey, Matthew R.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.1001-1014dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03865naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006000153245013700213300001600350520225900366592002802625650002002653650002302673650001902696650001302715650001302728650001502741650001802756650001902774650000902793650002202802650001502824650001202839650001802851650002302869650002302892650001502915650001502930651002902945653002302974653003102997653001803028653002103046653003303067700006103100773010203161856008703263852000903350655001203359IND60567396320221116174346.0170502e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKellner, Elliott1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6428-009710aImproving understanding of mixed-land-use watershed suspended sediment regimes: Mechanistic progress through high-frequency sampling  ap. 228-238.  aGiven the importance of suspended sediment to biogeochemical functioning of aquatic ecosystems, and the increasing concern of mixed-land-use effects on pollutant loading, there is an urgent need for research that quantitatively characterizes spatiotemporal variation of suspended sediment dynamics in contemporary watersheds. A study was conducted in a representative watershed of the central United States utilizing a nested-scale experimental watershed design, including five gauging sites (n=5) partitioning the catchment into five sub-watersheds. Hydroclimate stations at gauging sites were used to monitor air temperature, precipitation, and stream stage at 30-min intervals during the study (Oct. 2009–Feb. 2014). Streamwater grab samples were collected four times per week, at each site, for the duration of the study (Oct. 2009–Feb. 2014). Water samples were analyzed for suspended sediment using laser particle diffraction. Results showed significant differences (p<0.05) between monitoring sites for total suspended sediment concentration, mean particle size, and silt volume. Total concentration and silt volume showed a decreasing trend from the primarily agricultural upper watershed to the urban mid-watershed, and a subsequent increasing trend to the more suburban lower watershed. Conversely, mean particle size showed an opposite spatial trend. Results are explained by a combination of land use (e.g. urban stormwater dilution) and surficial geology (e.g. supply-controlled spatial variation of particle size). Correlation analyses indicated weak relationships with both hydroclimate and land use, indicating non-linear sediment dynamics. Suspended sediment parameters displayed consistent seasonality during the study, with total concentration decreasing through the growing season and mean particle size inversely tracking air temperature. Likely explanations include vegetation influences and climate-driven weathering cycles. Results reflect unique observations of spatiotemporal variation of suspended sediment particle size class. Such information is crucial for land and water resource managers working to mitigate aquatic ecosystem degradation and improve water resource sustainability in mixed-land-use watersheds globally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaquatic ecosystems 3agrowing season 3aland use 3amanagers 3amonitoring 3aparticle size 3apollution load 3asilt 3aspatial variation 3astormwater 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3asuspended sediment 3atemporal variation 3avegetation 3aweathering 3aMidwestern United States 0aSuspended sediment 0aLaser particle diffraction 0aParticle size 0aLand use impacts 0aExperimental watershed study1 aHubbart, Jason A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0305-59930 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.228-238dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007200153245011500225300001800340520122700358592002801585650001201613650002301625650002001648650002101668650002901689650001601718650001901734650001301753650001201766650001301778650002501791650001801816650002801834650002301862650001401885650002001899650001201919653001501931653004301946653001301989653002002002653002002022700002402042700001502066773010402081856008702185852000902272655001202281IND60567396420221116174335.0170628e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Engil Isadora Pujol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6355-118X10aNitrogen utilization and environmental losses in organic greenhouse lettuce amended with two distinct biochars  ap. 1169-1176.  aThe potential of biochar to prevent nitrogen (N) losses and improve plant performance were studied across various levels of N input for two growing seasons in mesocosms simulating an organic lettuce production system. A silt loam soil was amended with pine chip (PC) and walnut shell (WS) biochar (10tha−1) in combination with five organic N fertilization rates (0, 56, 112, 168, and 225kgNha−1). The N output through harvest, leachate, and N2O emissions were measured to assess N utilization and environmental losses of biochar-amended soils. For both biochars, only at the 100% N fertilization rate was lettuce biomass production improved with significant increases in N use efficiency (NUE); however, only PC biochar decreased N losses via leaching (at 100% N fertilization rate) and seasonal N2O emissions (at 50% N fertilization rate). Thus, due to increases in plant biomass and decreases in N losses, PC biochar significantly decreased the ratio of N lost over N exported in biomass. Findings from this study suggest that both WS and PC biochars can improve organic lettuce production but only at 225kgNha−1. Decreases in N losses via leachate and N2O emissions vary with fertilization level and biochar type.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3abiomass production 3acrop production 3afertilizer rates 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouses 3agrowing season 3aleaching 3alettuce 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3anutrient use efficiency 3aorganic production 3aphytomass 3asilt loam soils 3awalnuts 0aAmendments 0aNitrogen use efficiency, nitrous oxide 0aLeachate 0aOrganic farming 0aVegetable crops1 aConz, Rafaela Feola1 aSix, Johan0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.1169-1176dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245012600208300001400334500001100348500001900359520151100378592002801889596003301917596003201950650001701982650001501999650002502014650001502039650002302054650001502077650001502092650001602107651001902123651001702142700002302159773010102182856008302283852000902366655001202375IND60719593220221120093554.0220130e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071959322DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-020-01319-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEggertsen, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7295-424X10aKnowledge gaps and management recommendations for future paths of sustainable seaweed farming in the Western Indian Ocean  ap. 60-73.  aReview  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFarming of eucheumatoid seaweeds is a widespread, promising activity and an important livelihood option in many tropical coastal areas as for example in East Africa, Western Indian Ocean (WIO). Compared to other types of aquaculture, seaweed farming has generally low impact on the environment. Nonetheless, there are potential direct or indirect negative effects of seaweed farming, such as introduction of alien species and changes in local environmental conditions. Although farming has been practiced in this region during several decades, the knowledge concerning the actual environmental impacts from faming non-native eucheumatoid haplotypes and consequently how to manage farming activities to mitigate those is highly limited. In this review, we provide a summary of the current scientific knowledge of potential direct and indirect negative environmental effects linked to eucheumatoid seaweed farming such as alterations of benthic macrophyte habitats and loss of native biodiversity. Furthermore, we highlight knowledge gaps that are of importance to address in the near future, e.g., large-scale ecosystem effects and farms as potential vectors of pathogens. We also provide a number of feasible management recommendations to be implemented for a continued development of environmentally sustainable seaweed farming practices in the WIO region, which includes spatial planning of farms to avoid sensitive areas and farming of native haplotypes of eucheumatoids instead of introduced specimens.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015-05848cVetenskapsrådet  a2014-3264cVetenskapsrådet 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3ahaplotypes 3aintroduced species 3alivelihood 3amacroalgae 3amacrophytes 3aEastern Africa 3aIndian Ocean1 aHalling, Christina0 tAmbio.g2021 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.60-73dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-020-01319-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245016000176300001600336520104400352592002801396596004501424650001701469650001401486650001301500650002101513650002601534650001101560650002301571650002001594650001501614650001101629650001701640650000901657651001301666700001601679700003201695773010301727856008301830852000901913655001201922IND60719593320221120093619.0220130e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071959332DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-020-01339-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFletcher, Michael-Shawn14aThe loss of an indigenous constructed landscape following British invasion of Australia: An insight into the deep human imprint on the Australian landscape  ap. 138-149.  aIndigenous people play an integral role in shaping natural environments, and the disruption to Indigenous land management practices has profound effects on the biosphere. Here, we use pollen, charcoal and dendrochronological analyses to demonstrate that the Australian landscape at the time of British invasion in the 18th century was a heavily constructed one—the product of millennia of active maintenance by Aboriginal Australians. Focusing on the Surrey Hills, Tasmania, our results reveal how the removal of Indigenous burning regimes following British invasion instigated a process of ecological succession and the encroachment of cool temperate rainforest (i.e. later-stage vegetation communities) into grasslands of conservation significance. This research provides empirical evidence to challenge the long-standing portrayal of Indigenous Australians as low-impact ‘hunter-gatherers’ and highlights the relevance and critical value of Indigenous fire management in this era of heightened bushfire risk and biodiversity loss.  aPublisher supplied data  aIN170100063cAustralian Research Council 3abiodiversity 3abiosphere 3acharcoal 3adendrochronology 3aecological succession 3ahumans 3aindigenous peoples 3aland management 3alandscapes 3apollen 3arain forests 3arisk 3aTasmania1 aHall, Tegan1 aAlexandra, Andreas Nicholas0 tAmbio.g2021 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.138-149dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-020-01339-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245012300215300001600338520102600354592002801380596005101408650001701459650001201476650002501488650002701513650001901540650001201559650001401571650001301585650000901598650001301607650001101620650001401631650001301645651001301658700002401671700002301695700001901718700002501737773010301762856008301865852000901948655001201957IND60719593620221120093515.0220130e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071959362DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-020-01343-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohansson, Maria Ulrika1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8032-607510aEcosystem restoration in fire-managed savanna woodlands: Effects on biodiversity, local livelihoods and fire intensity  ap. 190-202.  aEthiopia aims to restore 15 million ha degraded forests and woodlands, but effects on the potentially contrasting goals of long-term carbon storage, biodiversity and sustainable livelihoods are unknown. To quantify the effects of grazing exclusion on vegetation and fire behaviour, we established six 30 × 30 m fenced exclosures with grazed controls, in a mesic wooded savanna. Experimental burns were done after 1.5 years. Tree seedlings were few but more common inside fences. Field layer cover and biomass increased inside fences, and grass species increased in numbers and cover. Fire intensity was higher inside fences, killing shrubs and saplings but not mature trees. Interviews confirmed that overgrazing has resulted in “cool fires”, causing shrub encroachment. High-intensity fires occurred in the 1980s after a zoonotic disease killed most livestock. Short-term increase in carbon storage through fire and grazing exclusion may lead to loss of pasture, and in the long-term increased wildfire risk.  aPublisher supplied data  a231-2013-1973cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3aecological restoration 3afire intensity 3agrasses 3alivestock 3apastures 3arisk 3asavannas 3ashrubs 3awildfires 3azoonoses 3aEthiopia1 aAbebe, Firew Bekele1 aNemomissa, Sileshi1 aBekele, Tamrat1 aHylander, Kristoffer0 tAmbio.g2021 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.190-202dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-020-01343-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245012700169300001600296520121400312592002801526650004801554650005101602650005001653650004901703650005001752650000801802650002301810650001001833650001301843650003001856650003001886650003001916650004501946650002201991700002302013700001902036700003002055700001902085773011102104856004802215852000902263655001202272IND4465876520221120082334.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446587652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-011-9812-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaleron, Malgorzata10aPolymorphism analysis of housekeeping genes for identification and differentiation of Clavibacter michiganensis subspecies  ap. 341-354.  aThe utility of polymorphism analysis was determined for differentiation of the following subspecies of the Gram-positive plant pathogenic bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis: C. m. subsp. michiganensis, C. m. subsp. sepedonicus, C. m. subsp. insidiosus C. m. subsp. nebraskensis, and C. m. subsp. tessellarius. Specific primers designed for amplification of the housekeeping genes recA, rpoB, and rpoD generated 827-, 1037-, and 862-bp DNA fragments, respectively. PCR products obtained from 40 C. michiganensis strains were analysed using RFLP with four restriction endonucleases, and those PCR products with specific RFLP patterns were sequenced. The genotypes discriminated after PCR–RFLP were specific for each subspecies and also allowed for differentiation of C. m. subsp. michiganensis strains. Sequence analysis of the recA, rpoB, and rpoD gene fragments also distinguished C. michiganensis subspecies and was useful for phylogenetic analysis of all subspecies. For rapid, inexpensive, and effective differentiation of the five subspecies in this research, we recommend the amplification of recA and/or rpoD gene fragments and digestion of the PCR products with the restriction endonuclease FnuDII.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. insidiosus 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus 3aClavibacter michiganensis subsp. tessellarius 3aDNA 3agene amplification 3agenes 3agenotype 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis1 aWaleron, Krzysztof1 aKamasa, Joanna1 aPrzewodowski, Wlodzimierz1 aLojkowska, Ewa0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2011 Oct., v. 131, no. 2 p.341-354dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-011-9812-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02000naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245014600206300001600352500001100368500001900379520096400398592002801362650001901390650002301409650001101432650000901443700002001452700002001472773010301492856008201595852000901677655001201686IND60719593720221121054535.0220130e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071959372DNAL7 a10.1007/s13280-020-01342-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGinbo, Tsegaye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2450-623610aInvesting in climate change adaptation and mitigation: A methodological review of real-options studies [Erratum: April 2022, v.51(4); p.1090]  ap. 229-241.  aReview  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUncertain future payoffs and irreversible costs characterize investment in climate change adaptation and mitigation. Under these conditions, it is relevant to analyze investment decisions in a real options framework, as this approach takes into account the economic value associated with investment time flexibility. In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature adopting a real option approach to analyze investment in climate change adaptation and mitigation, and examine how the uncertain impacts of climate change on the condition of the human environment, risk preferences, and strategic interactions among decisions-makers have been modeled. We found that the complex nature of uncertainties associated with climate change is typically only partially taken into account and that the analysis is usually limited to decisions taken by individual risk neutral profit maximizers. Our findings call for further research to fill the identified gaps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aeconomic valuation 3ahumans 3arisk1 aDi Corato, Luca1 aHoffmann, Ruben0 tAmbio.g2021 Jan., v. 50, no. 1 p.229-241dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl28633x0044-74477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-020-01342-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245013100179300001600310520123300326592002801559650001701587650000901604650001301613650001001626650001101636650001401647650002001661650001801681650001701699650002101716653002301737653001801760653002301778653001601801653001701817700003601834700002101870700002201891700006501913773010201978856008702080852000902167655001202176IND60567397220221116174249.0170502e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyngouna, Vasiliki I.10aCotransport of human adenoviruses with clay colloids and TiO2 nanoparticles in saturated porous media: Effect of flow velocity  ap. 160-167.  aThis study focuses on the effects of two clay colloids (kaolinite, KGa-1b and montmorillonite, STx-1b) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs) on human adenovirus transport and retention in water saturated porous media at three different pore water velocities (0.38, 0.74, and 1.21cm/min). Transport and cotransport experiments were performed in 30-cm long laboratory columns packed with clean glass beads with 2mm diameter. The experimental results suggested that the presence of KGa-1b, STx-1b and TiO2 NPs increased human adenovirus inactivation and attachment onto the solid matrix, due to the additional attachment sites available. Retention by the packed column was found to be highest (up to 99%) in the presence of TiO2 NPs at the highest pore water velocity, and lowest in the presence of KGa-1b. The experimental results suggested that adenoviruses would undergo substantial aggregation or heteroaggregation during cotransport. However, no distinct relationships between mass recoveries and water velocity could be established from the experimental cotransport data. Note that for the cotransport experiments, collision efficiency values were shown to be higher for the higher flow rate examined in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aclay 3acolloids 3aglass 3ahumans 3akaolinite 3amontmorillonite 3ananoparticles 3aporous media 3atitanium dioxide 0aHuman adenoviruses 0aClay minerals 0aTiO2 nanoparticles 0aCotransport 0aPorous media1 aChrysikopoulos, Constantinos V.1 aKokkinos, Petros1 aTselepi, Maria A.1 aVantarakis, Apostolos1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4411-37390 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.160-167dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007700156300001600233520164400249592002801893650001301921650002201934650001701956650001301973650002401986650001402010650001102024651001002035700001802045700001602063773013802079856004102217852000902258655001202267IND50062755220221120144856.0130323e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006275522DNAL7 a10.1007/BF028428112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAihua, Wang10aEarly development of Chondrus ocellatus holm (Gigartinaceae, Rhodophyta)  ap. 129-133.  aChondrus is an economically important red algae widely used for food and biochemical purpose. It early development is crucial for the culture and seedling propagation. We chose tetraspores and carpospores ofChondrus ocellatus as examples for experiment of the culture, induction and release in laboratory condition, aiming to understand early development of C. ocellatus and to apply in seedling production. Mature C. ocellatus were collected in Qingdao, China, from Nov. to Dec. 2004. After the gametophyte and tetrasporophyte were brushed and washed with sterilized seawater, the algal materials were treated in 1.5% KI for 20 min, then were dried for 1h to stimulate the releasing of spores. After the spores released overnight, it were cultured in PES medium, incubated at 18 °C, 10±2 μmol/(m²·s¹) in 12∶12h (light: dark). The observation and recording under microscope were carried out. Continuous observation of the early development showed that both tetraspore and carpospore are similar to each other. In general, three stages of the early development were shown being division, discoid crust and seedling stages. To the division stage, the most obvious feature was the increasing of cell number; during the discoid crust stage, the discoid crust had a three-dimensional axis, and it began to differentiate into two types of cells: the basal cells and the apical cells; and to the seedling stage, several protuberances-like appeared on the discoid crusts and formed juvenile seedlings. Carpospores and tetraspores exhibited a similar development process that included division stage, discoid crust stage and seedling stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChondrus 3aearly development 3agametophytes 3aseawater 3aseedling production 3aseedlings 3aspores 3aChina1 aJicheng, Wang1 aDelin, Duan0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2006 June, v. 24, no. 2 p.129-133dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02842811  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010200169300001600271500001500287520132200302592002801624650001701652650001501669650001601684650001801700650001001718650001001728650001501738650001701753650001601770650001401786650001001800650001101810650002701821650001201848650001501860650001801875651002801893651001201921651001301933653002101946653002401967653001201991653001002003700001902013700002202032700002402054773007802078856008102156852000902237655001202246IND50061656020221123001355.0160511e20121227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006165602DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-012-0135-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrištofík, Ján10aArthropods (Acarina, Coleoptera, Siphonaptera) in nests of hoopoe (Upupa epops) in Central Europe  ap. 155-161.  a2019-12-04  aIn 1993–1995 and 2009–2011, during investigation of reproduction biology of hoopoe, 63 nests of this species were collected after fledging of the chicks in Slovakia and Austria and their arthropod fauna was analyzed. Altogether 5,481 individuals and 34 species of mesostigmatic mites were found in 82.5% of the nests examined. The nidicolous mite Androlaelaps casalis was most abundant and frequent, representing 91.7% of all individuals. The richest in species were saprophilous mites (64.7% of all recorded species), while ectoparasites of the genera Dermanyssus and Ornithonyssus represented only 0.4% of all mites. Only 8 beetle species represented by 65 individuals were found in 18 nests. The dominant trophical group were carnivores (mainly nidicolous Gnathoncus buyssoni) with almost identical representation in (86.2%), followed by a similar representation of necrophags (10.8%). Unlike nests of other birds, the typical nidicolous species Haploglossa puncticollis and the fungivors were absent due to the dry character of studied countryside and placement of the nests in boxes situated in vineyard cottages. Only one species of fleas, Ceratophyllus gallinae — parasitizing first of all in the passeriform birds and being particularly abundant in the cavity nesting birds was recorded in hoopoe nests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndrolaelaps 3aColeoptera 3aDermanyssus 3aectoparasites 3afauna 3anests 3aparasitism 3areproduction 3asaprotrophs 3avineyards 3amites 3achicks 3aCeratophyllus gallinae 3anesting 3acarnivores 3aOrnithonyssus 3aCentral European region 3aAustria 3aSlovakia 0anidicolous fauna 0amesostigmatic mites 0abeetles 0abirds1 aMašán, Peter1 aŠustek, Zbyšek,1 aNuhličková, Soňa0 tBiologia.g2012 Dec. 27, v. 68, no. 1 p.155-161dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-012-0135-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245006500181300001600246520129600262592002801558650001901586650001301605650001801618650000901636650001501645650001601660650001201676650001101688650001301699650002601712650001101738650003401749650003501783773010801818856004801926852000901974655001201983IND4487609520221120224333.0120727e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448760952DNAL7 a210694372pmid7 a10.1007/s10739-010-9255-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraun, Robyn10aAccessory Food Factors: Understanding the Catalytic Function  ap. 483-504.  aDespite the practical knowledge throughout the nineteenth century that citrus fruit cured scurvy, and that rickets and beriberi were diseases caused by poor diet, it was not until 1901 that animal feeding experiments led one investigator to propose the existence of ‘accessory food factors,’ a lack of which was determined to be the cause of some illnesses (Hopkins, 1949. In Joseph Needham and E. Baldwin (eds.), Hopkins and Biochemistry, 1861–1947: Papers Concerning Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins, O.M., P.R.S., with a Selection of His Addresses and a Bibliography of His Publications. Cambridge: W. Heffer and Sons Ltd). The discovery of vitamins has long been considered as a delayed discovery. This delay has been attributed to the power of the germ theory in physiology at the time. While the germ theory and theories of auto-intoxication certainly played a role in delaying the discovery of vitamins, I argue further that it is important to consider the difference made to physiology by understanding the vitamins’ catalytic function. The profound difference made to physiology by the vitamins’ catalytic function suggests that a vitamin concept had previously been systematically inaccessible to researchers working within the conceptual framework of Bernardian physiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal feeding 3aberiberi 3acitrus fruits 3adiet 3aphysiology 3aresearchers 3arickets 3ascurvy 3avitamins 2aHistory, 19th Century 2aHumans 2aNutritional Sciencesxhistory 2aVitaminsxhistoryxphysiology.0 tJournal of the history of biology.g2011 Aug., v. 44, no. 3 p.483-504dSpringer-Verlagx0022-50107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10739-010-9255-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245011300174300001600287520130300303592002801606650001901634650001901653650003001672650002101702650001401723650001001737650001001747650002101757650002101778650001201799650001601811650002301827650001401850650001201864650001301876650001101889650001301900653002101913653002901934653001601963653003001979653002302009653001202032700001702044700002002061700002002081773010202101856008702203852000902290655001202299IND60567398320221116174400.0170627e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGee, Kathleen F.10aEffect of naphtha diluent on greenhouse gases and reduced sulfur compounds emissions from oil sands tailings  ap. 916-924.  aThe long-term storage of oil sands tailings has resulted in the evolution of greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2) as a result of residual organics biodegradation. Recent studies have identified black, sulfidic zones below the tailings-water interface, which may be producing toxic sulfur-containing gases. An anaerobic mesocosm study was conducted over an 11-week period to characterize the evolution of CH4, CO2 and reduced sulfur compounds (RSCs) (including H2S) in tailings as it relates to naphtha-containing diluent concentrations (0.2, 0.8, and 1.5% w/v) and microbial activity. Our results showed that RSCs were produced first at 0.12μmol°RSCs/mL MFT (1.5% w/v diluent treatment). RSCs contribution (from highest to lowest) was H2S and 2-methylthiophene>2.5-dimethylthiophene>3-methylthiophene>thiofuran>butyl mercaptan>carbonyl sulfide, where H2S and 2-methylthiophene contributed 81% of the gas produced. CH4 and CO2 production occurred after week 5 at 40.7μmolCH4/mL MFT and 5.9μmolCO2/mL MFT (1.5% w/v diluent treatment). The amount of H2S and CH4 generated is correlated to the amount of diluent present and to microbial activity as shown by corresponding increases in sulfate-reducers' Dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB) gene and methanogens' methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide production 3acarbonyl sulfide 3aemissions 3agases 3agenes 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amethane 3amethanogens 3amicrobial activity 3aoil sands 3astorage 3asulfites 3asulfur 3atoxicity 0aGreenhouse gases 0aReduced sulfur compounds 0aMethanogens 0aSulfate reducing bacteria 0aOil sands tailings 0aDiluent1 aPoon, Ho Yin1 aHashisho, Zaher1 aUlrich, Ania C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.916-924dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.1073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03940naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002700181245021100208300001800419506007600437520164100513592002802154506003702182650001502219650002702234650002902261650002102290650001702311650002102328650001002349650003902359650001002398650001102408650001402419650002502433650000902458650003102467650001302498650001202511650007202523650001402595650004102609650002302650650003802673650003602711650000902747650002202756650003202778650005902810650003602869650000902905650002502914650003102939700001702970700001702987700001803004700002103022700002703043773013203070856004303202852000903245655001203254IND4488228320221207081127.0120515e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448822832DNAL7 a224309782pmid7 aPMC33707482pmcid7 a10.1128/AAC.06335-112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Christopher J.10aPegylation of Antimicrobial Peptides Maintains the Active Peptide Conformation, Model Membrane Interactions, and Antimicrobial Activity while Improving Lung Tissue Biocompatibility following Airway Delivery  ap. 3298-3308.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAntimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have therapeutic potential, particularly for localized infections such as those of the lung. Here we show that airway administration of a pegylated AMP minimizes lung tissue toxicity while nevertheless maintaining antimicrobial activity. CaLL, a potent synthetic AMP (KWKLFKKIFKRIVQRIKDFLR) comprising fragments of LL-37 and cecropin A peptides, was N-terminally pegylated (PEG-CaLL). PEG-CaLL derivatives retained significant antimicrobial activity (50% inhibitory concentrations [IC50s] 2- to 3-fold higher than those of CaLL) against bacterial lung pathogens even in the presence of lung lining fluid. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed that conformational changes associated with the binding of CaLL to model microbial membranes were not disrupted by pegylation. Pegylation of CaLL reduced AMP-elicited cell toxicity as measured using in vitro lung epithelial primary cell cultures. Further, in a fully intact ex vivo isolated perfused rat lung (IPRL) model, airway-administered PEG-CaLL did not result in disruption of the pulmonary epithelial barrier, whereas CaLL caused an immediate loss of membrane integrity leading to pulmonary edema. All AMPs (CaLL, PEG-CaLL, LL-37, cecropin A) delivered to the lung by airway administration showed limited (<3%) pulmonary absorption in the IPRL with extensive AMP accumulation in lung tissue itself, a characteristic anticipated to be beneficial for the treatment of pulmonary infections. We conclude that pegylation may present a means of improving the lung biocompatibility of AMPs designed for the treatment of pulmonary infections.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiocompatibility 3acell culture 3achemical bonding 3aedema 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3alungs 3amodels 3apathogens 3aprotein conformation 3arats 3arespiratory tract diseases 3atoxicity 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCell Line 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCircular Dichroism 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aLungxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPeptidesxchemical synthesisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence1 aBeck, Konrad1 aFox, Marc A.1 aUlaeto, David1 aClark, Graeme C.1 aGumbleton, M.q(Mark),0 tAntimicrobial agents and chemotherapy.g2012 June, v. 56, no. 6 p.3298-3308dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0066-48047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AAC.06335-11  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008600128300001400214520107900228592002801307650000801335650001801343650001501361650001601376650001201392650001601404650001701420650001701437650001301454650001601467650003101483650001901514650001401533650001101547650001401558650002601572651001001598700001901608700001901627700001501646700001801661700001701679700001601696773017401712852000901886655001201895IND4501149920221120224344.0150420e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450114992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiu-Jiu10aLaceyella sediminis sp. nov., a thermophilic bacterium isolated from a hot spring  ap. 38-42.  aA thermophilic bacterium, designated strain RHA1T, was isolated from a sediment sample collected from a hot spring in Tengchong county, Yunnan province, south-west China, and was characterized by using a polyphasic approach. Based on its phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics, strain RHA1T was affiliated to the genus LACEYELLA: The strain formed white aerial and yellowâwhite substrate mycelia, bearing single endospores on short sporophores. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. Whole-cell hydrolysates contained ribose and glucose. The major fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0 (62.39 %) and anteiso-C15 : 0 (17.55 %). The predominant menaquinone was MK-9. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain RHA1T was 47.9 mol%. Based on DNAâDNA hybridization data, chemotaxonomic characteristics and differential physiological properties, strain RHA1T is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Laceyella, for which the name Laceyella sediminis sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain is RHA1T ( = DSM 45263T = CCTCC AA 208058T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3achemotaxonomy 3aendospores 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3ahot springs 3ahydrolysates 3amenaquinones 3amycelium 3anew species 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apeptidoglycans 3aphylogeny 3aribose 3asediments 3athermophilic bacteria 3aChina1 aLin, Lian-Bing1 aZhang, Lan-Lan1 aZhang, Jin1 aTang, Shu-Kun1 aWei, Yun-Lin1 aLi, Wen-Jun0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2012 Jan., v. 62, no.

This paper aims to define these limits on the basis of environmental and socioeconomic factors, and additionally seeks to investigate the effects of urbanisation and economic development on STH transmission, and estimate numbers at-risk of infection with Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm in 2010. METHODS: A total of 4,840 geo-referenced estimates of infection prevalence were abstracted from the Global Atlas of Helminth Infection and related to a range of environmental factors to delineate the biological limits of transmission. The relationship between STH transmission and urbanisation and economic development was investigated using high resolution population surfaces and country-level socioeconomic indicators, respectively. Based on the identified limits, the global population at risk of STH transmission in 2010 was estimated. RESULTS: High and low land surface temperature and extremely arid environments were found to limit STH transmission, with differential limits identified for each species. There was evidence that the prevalence of A. lumbricoides and of T. trichiura infection was statistically greater in peri-urban areas compared to urban and rural areas, whilst the prevalence of hookworm was highest in rural areas. At national levels, no clear socioeconomic correlates of transmission were identified, with the exception that little or no infection was observed for countries with a per capita gross domestic product greater than US$ 20,000. Globally in 2010, an estimated 5.3 billion people, including 1.0 billion school-aged children, lived in areas stable for transmission of at least one STH species, with 69% of these individuals living in Asia. A further 143 million (31.1 million school-aged children) lived in areas of unstable transmission for at least one STH species. CONCLUSIONS: These limits provide the most contemporary, plausible representation of the extent of STH risk globally, and provide an essential basis for estimating the global disease burden due to STH infection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAscaris lumbricoides 3aTrichuris trichiura 3aat-risk population 3aburden of disease 3achildren 3aenvironmental factors 3agross domestic product 3ahelminthiasis 3ahookworms 3apeople 3arisk 3arural areas 3asocioeconomic factors 3asurface temperature 3aurbanization 2aAnimals 2aAscariasisxepidemiology 2aAscaris lumbricoides 2aClimate 2aEcosystem 2aHookworm Infectionsxepidemiology 2aHumans 2aRisk Factors 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aSoilxparasitology 2aTrichuriasisxepidemiology 2aTrichuris 3aAsia1 aBrooker, Simon J0 tParasites & vectors.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.81-81dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-5-813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245007200182300001800254520171300272592002801985650001302013650002302026650001202049650002302061650001402084650001102098650002302109650002702132653001202159653001902171653000802190653001302198653002302211700002002234700006202254773010402316856008702420852000902507655001202516IND60567399720221120040744.0170628e20171115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.1272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuttle-Raycraft, Shaylah10aSuspended solid concentration reduces feeding in freshwater mussels  ap. 1160-1168.  aWe examined the effect of TSS concentration on the clearance rates (CR) of newly transformed juvenile and adult Lampsilis fasciola, L. siliquoidea, Ligumia nasuta, and Villosa iris, as increased total suspended solids (TSS) are thought to interfere with feeding processes. Mussel CR were measured in aerated (or swirled for juveniles) chambers at TSS concentrations up to 15mgL−1 for laboratory-transformed juveniles, and up to 100mgL−1 for adult mussels. The CR of one-week old animals increased with TSS concentration, likely due to ontological differences in feeding (pedal vs. suspension feeding) and gill development, but CR decreased monotonically with TSS concentration in older animals (two-, three- and four-week old juveniles). The CR of adult mussels were significantly lower at TSS concentrations ≥8mgL−1, which represented a threshold in CR. Although this threshold occurred at similar concentrations across the four species, the decline in CR was largest in L. fasciola (46% compared to no-TSS control), and smallest in V. iris (21%). Differences among species are likely related to differences in the TSS and substrate found in their source rivers given that greater decline occurred for species in rivers with relatively lower TSS. The decrease in CR as TSS increased is consistent across marine and freshwater bivalves, at both juvenile and adult stages. The decrease in feeding was five times greater in juvenile compared to adult bivalves, which indicates how the vulnerability to environmental stressors differ across life stages. These results demonstrate that TSS reduces suspension feeding rates in freshwater unionids, therefore TSS should be managed to ensure their survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola 3aLampsilis fasciola 3aelderly 3afreshwater mussels 3ajuveniles 3arivers 3asuspension feeding 3atotal suspended solids 0aUnionid 0aClearance rate 0aTSS 0aJuvenile 0aSuspended sediment1 aMorris, Todd J.1 aAckerman, Josef D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4550-490X0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Nov. 15, v. 598 p.1160-1168dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.1273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245014400214300001600358520173100374592002802105650001802133650002302151650001602174650001202190650001202202650001102214650001102225650001502236650001002251650002302261650001702284650002502301650001502326651001102341653002002352653001802372653001602390653003402406653002202440700002402462700002202486700001802508700002002526773010602546856008702652852000902739655001202748IND60567399920221120040852.0170628e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056739992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThiebault, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3104-162510aTemporal dynamics of human-excreted pollutants in wastewater treatment plant influents: Toward a better knowledge of mass load fluctuations  ap. 246-255.  aThe occurrence of 25 drug target residues (illicit drugs or pharmaceutically active compounds) was investigated during 85 consecutive days in the influents of a wastewater treatment plant in the Region Centre-Val de Loire, France. This long tracking period allowed a better understanding of the patterns affecting the occurrence of this type of contaminants. Among them, 2 were never detected (i.e. heroin and amphetamine). Concerning illicit drugs two patterns were found. Cocaine and ecstasy median loads varied considerably between weekdays and weekend days (i.e. 18.3 and 35.9% respectively) whereas cannabis and heroin (based on 6-mono-acetylmorphine loads) loads were within the same order of magnitude with a significant statistical correlation with pharmaceuticals such as acetaminophen or ketoprofen.The consumption of selected drugs was back-calculated from the loads. Among illicit drugs the highest consumption was found for cannabis with a median consumption of 51mg·day−1·inhabitant−1 (inh) whereas the median consumption for cocaine (based on benzoylecgonine loads) and ecstasy was 32 and 6mg·day−1·103·inh−1 respectively.The highest consumption values of pharmaceutically active compounds (PACs) were found for acetaminophen and acetylsalicylic acid with 108.8 and 34.1mg·day−1·inh−1 respectively, in good agreement with national sales data. A statistically significant weekly pattern was found for several PACs such as metoprolol and trimethoprim, but with the opposite pattern to that of illicit drugs. The variations in daily PAC loads could provide information about the mobility of people in the catchment, especially on the basis of daily taken PACs (i.e. to treat chronicle diseases).  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaminophen 3aactive ingredients 3aamphetamine 3aaspirin 3acocaine 3aheroin 3apeople 3apollutants 3asales 3atemporal variation 3atrimethoprim 3awastewater treatment 3awatersheds 3aFrance 0aPharmaceuticals 0aIllicit drugs 0aConsumption 0aWastewater-based epidemiology 0aTemporal dynamics1 aFougère, Laëtitia1 aDestandau, Emilie1 aRéty, Maxime1 aJacob, Jérémy0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 596-597 p.246-255dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.04.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002400094040001800118100002200136245014600158300001600304500001900320520072200339592002801061650000801089650003201097650001901129650001001148650001001158650001701168650001401185650001701199650001801216650001501234653001401249653000801263653001501271653001101286700002701297700001701324700005601341700001501397773013901412856007001551852000901621655001201630IND60719597120221120174441.0201202e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071959712DNAL7 a10.1645/19-1962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKesik, Harun Kaya12aA Case-Study of the Molecular Diagnosis of Echinococcus multilocularis in Wild Boar with Comments on Its Public Health Significance in Turkey  ap. 730-734.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEchinococcus multilocularis is a parasite species of zoonotic importance which can be fatal to humans and causes Alveolar Echinococcosis (AE). This report describes the development of a cyst from the liver of a wild boar and molecular confirmation of its identification. The cyst material was obtained from the liver of a wild boar killed by hunters. Genomic DNA was extracted from the germinal layer of the cyst material, and 875 bp mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene fragment was amplified by PCR and sequenced. A BLAST search matched 100% with published Echinococcus multilocularis sequences. This study confirms the occurrence of E. multilocularis in a wild boar for the first time in Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEchinococcus multilocularis 3aechinococcosis 3agenes 3aliver 3amitochondria 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3apublic health 3awild boars 0aWild Boar 0aPCR 0aSequencing 0aTurkey1 aKilinc, Seyma Gunyakti1 aCelik, Figen1 aSimsek, Sami1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3567-326X1 aAhmed, H.,0 tJournal of parasitology.g2020 Dec. 1, v. 106, no. 6 p.730-734dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/19-1963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012200169300001600291520133100307592002801638650001101666650001401677650001401691650001601705650001101721650001201732650002301744650001201767650001001779650001601789650000901805653002301814653002501837653002501862653001401887653002301901700002401924700001901948700002201967773017501989856008202164852000902246655001202255IND60567400120221118025347.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056740012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rbe.2017.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Jessica A.10aMorphological traits, allometric relationship and competition of two seed-feeding species of beetles in infested pods  ap. 243-247.  aPair-wise competition produces asymmetric consequences for the interacting species, resulting in reduction of species fitness at the individual scale; however, little is known of the effects of competition on the allometric patterns of insects. In this study, we explored how competition, by means of pod infestation, affects the development of female and male individuals in the co-occurring bruchine beetles Merobruchus terani and Stator maculatopygus. We found differences between M. terani and S. maculatopygus in all morphometric traits, but no significant differences between males and females in either species. We also found, with an increasing degree of pod infestation, a positive trend in the pronotum, elytron and body weight of M. terani and a negative trend in morphological traits and body weight of S. maculatopygus. A negative allometry was maintained, suggesting that with increasing body weight, the body structures did not increase proportionally. On the other hand, we found that increasing the degree of pod infestation produced a wider variation in the individuals’ body size than in low levels of infestation. Finally, we discuss how pod infestation can trigger competition between species, with both positive and negative impacts, even though the species function similarly in resource exploitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStator 3aallometry 3abody size 3abody weight 3aelytra 3afemales 3agender differences 3ainsects 3amales 3amorphometry 3apods 0aMerobruchus terani 0aStator maculatopygus 0aSenegalia tenuifolia 0aBruchinae 0aNegative allometry1 aMonteiro, Angelo B.1 aMaia, Laís F.1 aFaria, Lucas D.B.0 tRevista Brasileira de entomologia.g2017 July,  Sept., v. 61, no. 3 p.243-247dElsevier Editora Ltda.aSociedade Brasileira de EntomologiawJournal:22106x0085-56267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbe.2017.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100005500135245007800190300001600268500001900284520139900303592002801702650001401730650001801744650002401762650001101786650002101797650003001818650001601848650001801864650001401882650001501896650001701911650001201928651001701940653002501957700001801982700002002000700002002020773014002040856006902180852000902249655001202258IND60719597220221120164310.0201202e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071959722DNAL7 a10.1645/20-642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAli, Medhat1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1695-977210aEctoparasites and Intestinal Helminths of Pigeons in Medina, Saudi Arabia  ap. 721-729.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe prevalence of ectoparasites and intestinal helminths of different pigeon taxa in Medina, Saudi Arabia, with special emphasis on the feral pigeon, Columba livia domestica (Columbiformes: Columbidae), was evaluated. Fifty-four pigeons were examined externally for ectoparasites and 28 feral pigeons were examined for helminths. Two ectoparasites were recorded on feral C. l. domestica (Harami) pigeons, including the shaft louse Menopon gallinae (Phthiraptera: Menoponidae), and the pigeon fly, Pseudolynchia canariensis (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), with 100 and 88.90% prevalence, respectively. Ectoparasites were also collected from 5 other breeds of C. l. domestica (Pakistani, Farensi, Turki, Kori, and Qatifi). Menopon gallinae infected Pakistani, Farensi, and Turki pigeons with 100% prevalence. A third ectoparasite, the brown poultry louse, Goniodes dissimilis (Psocodea: Philopteridae), infected Farensi, Turki, and Kori pigeons at rates of 100, 50, and 50%, respectively. Qatifi pigeons were not infected with any ectoparasites. Two types of intestinal helminths were recovered from feral pigeons: cestodes of Raillietina spp. (Cyclophyllidea: Davaineidae) and nematodes of Ascaridia sp. (Ascaridida: Ascaridiidae) (with 10.71 and 3.57% prevalences, respectively). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to shed light on the parasites of pigeons in Medina, Saudi Arabia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscaridia 3aColumba livia 3aGoniodes dissimilis 3aMedina 3aMenopon gallinae 3aPseudolynchia canariensis 3aRaillietina 3aectoparasites 3ahelminths 3aintestines 3aparasitology 3apigeons 3aSaudi Arabia 0aIntestinal Helminths1 aIbrahim, Reda1 aAlahmadi, Saeed1 aElshazly, Hayam0 tJournal of parasitology.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 106, no. 6 p.721-729dAmerican Society of ParasitologistswJournal:jnl45570x0022-33957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1645/20-643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245010400160300001600264520155400280592002801834650001601862650001301878650001601891650002301907650000901930650002501939650002601964650002601990650004102016650001002057650001102067650001502078650001602093650001602109650001702125650000902142650001402151650001302165650002302178650004402201650001302245653004102258653003502299653002002334700005202354700001502406700001702421700001202438700001802450700005402468700001802522773014502540856008002685852000902765655001202774IND60681174220221119044447.0200115e20191226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068117422DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b066302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qin10aUntargeted Metabonomics of Genetically Modified Cows Expressing Lactoferrin Based on Serum and Milk  ap. 686-696.  aMetabolites of serum and milk from genetically modified (GM) cows and contrast check (CK) cows were comparatively investigated. Serum and milk were collected from genetically modified (GM) cows and contrast check (CK) cows, and then, they were analyzed using ultraperformance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Although the level of some blood biochemical indexes for GM cows was shifted up or down, they were generally in normal physiological condition. Serum samples from lactoferrin GM cows exhibited reduced levels of amino acids and elevated levels of indoleacetate, α-keto acids, long-chain fatty acids, etc. GM milk possessed elevated levels of pentose and amino sugar metabolites, including arabitol, xylulose, glucuronate, and N-acetylgalactosamine. Interestingly, some essential nutrients, such as certain unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA)), and some necessary rare sugars were significantly upregulated. Compared to the CK group, a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis was conducted based on the increased or decreased metabolites identified in the serum and milk samples of the GM group. The results showed that the GM cows were in healthy condition and their milk has improved benefits for customers. The milk from genetically modified cows was found to be a promising milk source for producing recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) for human beings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3aarabitol 3ablood serum 3aconsumers (people) 3acows 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adocosapentaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenes 3ahumans 3aketo acids 3alactoferrin 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amilk 3anutrients 3apentoses 3atransgenic animals 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3axylulose 0arecombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) 0agenetically modified (GM) cows 0anutritive value1 aChen, Xu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2131-98651 aXie, Zixin1 aLiu, Xiaofei1 aFu, Wei1 aHuang, Kunlun1 aXu, Wentao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8572-82571 aLin, Xiangmei0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Dec. 26, v. 68, no. 2 p.686-696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b066303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02262naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245012700168300001600295520101000311592002801321650002401349650001501373650002401388650002101412650002201433650002601455650000901481650005801490650003001548650002601578700002101604700001801625700002001643700002501663773009901688856008001787852000901867655001201876IND60082988820221119044308.0141101e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008298882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2010.08.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemon, Douglas D.12aA high-performance liquid chromatography assay for quantification of cardiac myosin heavy chain isoform protein expression  ap. 132-135.  aStress signaling in the myocardium results in enhanced expression of fetal β-myosin heavy chain (β-MyHC) and reduced expression of adult α-myosin heavy chain (α-MyHC), with the net outcome of diminished myofibrillar ATPase activity and impaired contractility. Pharmacological approaches aimed at preventing this myosin isoform “switch” could provide therapeutic benefit to patients with heart failure. Myosin isoform protein expression is typically quantified using gel electrophoresis methods, which are time-consuming and prone to variability. Here we describe a facile, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for rapidly determining the relative amounts of full-length α- and β-MyHC in rat hearts. The assay was validated using cardiac tissues from rats in which a key transcriptional regulator of MyHC expression, the thyroid hormone receptor, was pharmacologically manipulated. This novel assay should facilitate drug discovery efforts focused on the MyHC axis.  aPublisher supplied data 3agel electrophoresis 3amyocardium 3amyosin heavy chains 3aprotein isoforms 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3athyroid hormone receptors 3atranscription factors1 aPapst, Philip J.1 aJoly, Kristin1 aPlato, Craig F.1 aMcKinsey, Timothy A.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 408, no. 1 p.132-135dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2010.08.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03069naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014300178300001400321520130900335592002801644650002901672650001601701650001001717650001401727650002501741650001701766650001401783650001701797650001301814650004101827650001201868650004301880650001301923650004301936650001201979650002301991650001102014653001902025653002402044653000902068653002902077653002002106700004302126700002902169700003502198700002302233700002902256700002702285773010802312856008602420852000902506655001202515IND60560563320221118051341.0190410e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2016.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Luciana Silva10aBehavior of yeast inoculated during semi-dry coffee fermentation and the effect on chemical and sensorial properties of the final beverage  ap. 26-32.  aPulped Mundo Novo and Ouro Amarelo coffee beans were inoculated with Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CCMA 0200 and CCMA 0543) during semi-dry coffee fermentation and compared with a non-inoculated control. Samples were collected throughout the fermentation process (12days) to evaluate the persistence of the inoculum by Real-Time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Also, the chemical composition of the beans was determined by HPLC and GC–MS and the roasted beans were sensorial evaluated using the cupping test. S. cerevisiae CCMA 0543 had an average population of 5.6logcell/g (Ouro Amarelo cultivar) and 5.5logcell/g (Mundo Novo cultivar). Citric, malic, succinic and acetic acid were found in all samples, along with sucrose, fructose, and glucose. There were 104 volatile compounds detected: 49 and 55 in green and roasted coffee, respectively. All coffee samples scored over 80 points in the cupping test, indicating they were specialty-grade. Inoculation with the CCMA 0543 strain performed better than the CCMA 0200 strain. This is the first time that qPCR has been used to assess the persistence of the inoculated strains populations during coffee processing. Strain CCMA 0543 was the most suitable as an inoculant due to its enhanced persistence during the process and number of volatile compounds produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetic acid 3abeans 3abeverages 3achemical composition 3acoffee beans 3acultivars 3afermentation 3afructose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglucose 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainoculum 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asucrose 3avolatile compounds 3ayeasts 0aCoffee cupping 0aCoffee fermentation 0aqPCR 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0aStarter culture1 aMiguel, Maria Gabriela da Cruz Pedrozo1 aEvangelista, Suzana Reis1 aMartins, Pamela Mynsen Machado1 avan Mullem, Joshua1 aBelizario, Maisa Honorio1 aSchwan, Rosane Freitas0 tFood research international.g2017 Feb., v. 92 p.26-32dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2016.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245005800205300001600263506007600279520117700355592002801532506003701560650002301597650001901620650002401639650001001663650001201673650002201685650001101707650002001718650001901738650002601757650002001783700002001803700001901823700001801842700001801860700001801878700001801896700002201914700001801936700002401954773009901978856008002077852000902157655001202166IND60082989020221207050726.0141101e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008298902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2010.09.0152doi7 aPMC31809312pmcid7 a208504092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhenling10aMass balance analysis of contaminated heparin product  ap. 147-156.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA quantitative analysis of a recalled contaminated lot of heparin sodium injection U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) was undertaken in response to the controversy regarding the exact nature of the contaminant involved in the heparin (HP) crisis. A mass balance analysis of the formulated drug product was performed. After freeze-drying, a 1-ml vial for injection afforded 54.8±0.3mg of dry solids. The excipients, sodium chloride and residual benzyl alcohol, accounted for 11.4±0.5 and 0.9±0.5mg, respectively. Active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) represented 41.5±1.0mg, corresponding to 75.7wt% of dry mass. Exhaustive treatment of API with specific enzymes, heparin lyases, and/or chondroitin lyases was used to close mass balance. HP represented 30.5±0.5mg, corresponding to 73.5wt% of the API. Dermatan sulfate (DS) impurity represented 1.7±0.3mg, corresponding to 4.1wt% of API. Contaminant, representing 9.3±0.1mg corresponding to 22.4wt% of API, was found in the contaminated formulated drug product. The recovery of contaminant was close to quantitative (95.6–100wt%).

The success of FID is based on the fact that it can be fashioned into a versatile screening assay for assessing the relative binding affinities of compounds to nucleic acids. FID is a tagless approach; the target RNAs and the ligands or small molecules under investigation do not need to be modified in order to be examined. In this study, a modified FID assay for screening RNA-binding ligands was established using 3-methyl-2-((1-(3-(trimethylammonio)propyl)-4-quinolinylidene)methyl)benzothiazolium (TO-PRO) as the fluorescent indicator. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) results provide direct evidence that correlates the reduction in fluorescence intensity observed in the FID assay with displacement of the dye molecule from RNA. The assay was successfully applied to screen a variety of RNA-binding ligands with a set of small hairpin RNAs. Ligands that bind with moderate affinity to the chosen RNA constructs (A-site, TAR [transactivation response element], h31 [helix 31], and H69 [helix 69] were identified.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afluorescence 3atranscriptional activation1 aChow, Christine S.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 408, no. 2 p.269-276dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2010.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010900178300001400287520145500301592002801756650001401784650001801798650001901816650001501835650002301850650001101873653001201884653002201896653002201918653003201940653003101972653001702003700002102020700006602041700001802107700002402125700003102149700001902180773010802199856008602307852000902393655001202402IND60560563720221118051245.0190410e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2016.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchouteten, Joachim J.10aComparison of response formats and concurrent hedonic measures for optimal use of the EmoSensory® Wheel  ap. 33-42.  aThe study of emotional and sensory profiling with food products is gaining momentum in the field of sensory research. These methods can be applied in order to obtain a broader consumer perspective on product performance beyond traditional hedonic measurements (Jiang, King, & Prinyawiwatkul, 2014; Varela & Ares, 2012). The EmoSensory® Wheel, a recently introduced method which combines emotional and sensory assessment in a wheel questionnaire format is one example of conducting such a task in a consumer-friendly way. However, little is known about its performance compared to a traditional list-based questionnaire format. This comparison is undertaken in this study for two product categories (chocolate and yogurt). Further, two methodological issues are addressed by (i) comparing the use of Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) and rate-all-that-apply (RATA) response formats and (ii) examining whether the method impacts on the concurrent hedonic product assessment for two product categories (chocolate and yogurt). Although both questionnaire formats showed similar findings, more consumers preferred the wheel questionnaire format. Regarding the latter, CATA and RATA scaling yielded similar performance and no influence on the concurrent hedonic assessment was found. This study lends further support for combining emotional and sensory measurements using the EmoSensory® profile, which is of interest for food scientists and the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3achocolate 3afood industry 3aquestionnaires 3ascientists 3asensory evaluation 3ayogurt 0aEmotion 0aAttribute scaling 0aConsumer research 0aCheck-All-That-Apply (CATA) 0aRate-All-That-Apply (RATA) 0aHedonic bias1 aGellynck, Xavier1 aDe Bourdeaudhuij, Ilse1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9969-75971 aSas, Benedikt1 aBredie, Wender L.P.1 aPerez-Cueto, Federico J.A.1 aDe Steur, Hans0 tFood research international.g2017 Mar., v. 93 p.33-42dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2016.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02096naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245010700175300001600282520100800298592002801306650001101334650002601345650001901371650002401390650000901414650001801423650002601441650001401467700002301481700002401504700002901528773010001557856008001657852000901737655001201746IND60082989820221119043006.0141101e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008298982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2010.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondratova, Valentina N.10aTube gel isotachophoresis: A method for quantitative isolation of nucleic acids from diluted solutions  ap. 304-308.  aThe technique of isotachophoresis is intended for separation of molecules having different electrophoretic mobilities in a nonhomogeneous electric field. Since the mobility of nucleic acids in water solutions is uniform and does not depend on their size (because of a uniform distribution of negatively charged phosphate groups along the molecule), isotachophoresis will concentrate rather than separate them in the mobile borderline zone between the rapid (Cl⁻) and the slow (β-alanine⁻) anions. This idea served as the basis for elaboration of a novel method for isolation of nucleic acids from diluted solutions. Advantages of the method include quantitative yield (regardless of molecule size), high degree of concentration, and the ability to visually monitor the process. The method may find applications in nucleic acid isolation from highly degraded forensic and clinical samples, from bodily fluids in particular, and thereby promote development of this important direction of diagnostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3adiagnostic techniques 3aelectric field 3agel electrophoresis 3agels 3anucleic acids 3aquantitative analysis 3asolutions1 aBotezatu, Irina V.1 aShelepov, Valery P.1 aLichtenstein, Anatoly V.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 408, no. 2 p.304-308dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2010.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245015900161300001800320520133300338592002801671650001701699650001601716650001401732650002801746650003101774650002101805650001901826650001001845650001301855650002401868650002401892650001401916650001101930650001101941650001101952650002201963650002401985653002802009653003902037653001902076653000802095653000802103700001502111700001702126700001502143700001302158700005602171700005702227773013902284856007802423852000902501655001202510IND60681175620221119044443.0200115e20191120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068117562DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b131822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Wenjing10aTrifunctional of Phosphorus-Doped NiCo₂O₄ Nanowire Materials for Asymmetric Supercapacitor, Oxygen Evolution Reaction, and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction  ap. 2763-2772.  aNowadays, transition-metal oxides are regarded as the most potential materials for the supercapacitor and electrocatalyst. However, the poor electrical conductivity and insufficient active sites limited their development in various fields. Herein, we report the method of phosphorous-doped NiCo₂O₄ (named as P-NCO) prepared by the two-step strategy: the NiCo₂O₄ nanostructure is grown on the nickel foams by hydrothermal treatment and subsequently phosphatized in a tube furnace. Successfully, the rich oxygen vacancies and the P element introduced into the NiCo₂O₄ structure obviously improve the electrical conductivity, and the resulting P-NCO NWs/NF material shows an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 2747.8 F g–¹ at 1 A g–¹ and a prominent rate performance (maintain 50% at 100 A g–¹). Furthermore, the assembled P-NCO NWs/NF//RGO asymmetric supercapacitor has an energy density of 28.2 W h kg–¹ even at a high power density of 7750.35 W kg–¹. After 10,000 cycles, the capacitance still also has an 88.48% retention rate. As an electrocatalyst, P-NCO NWs/NF has an excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (55 mV at 10 mA cm–²) and oxygen evolution reaction (300 mV at 10 mA cm–²) activities in 1 M KOH solution. This study provides an effective strategy to prepare multifunctional materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acapacitance 3acatalysts 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy density 3afoams 3afurnaces 3ahot water treatment 3ahydrogen production 3ananowires 3anickel 3aoxides 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apotassium hydroxide 0atrifunctional materials 0aphosphorus-doped NiCo2O4 nanowires 0asupercapacitor 0aOER 0aHER1 aShi, Zijun1 aHou, Yongdan1 aMa, Dongni1 aBai, Xue1 aGao, Yanfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3382-077X1 aYang, Nianjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5558-23140 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Nov. 20, v. 12, no. 2 p.2763-2772dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b131823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03661naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245010800172300001400280520226300294592002802557650001202585650001502597650001702612650001502629650001302644650001002657650001302667650001402680650001402694650001702708650002002725650001302745651001002758651002602768653001802794653002602812653002702838653003202865653002102897700001702918700002102935700001802956773010802974856008803082852000903170655001203179IND60560565220221118051305.0180831e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.11.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiessling, Tim10aWho cares about dirty beaches? Evaluating environmental awareness and action on coastal litter in Chile  ap. 82-95.  aCoastal litter is a source of environmental, economic and health-related problems in many parts of the world, but local responses are not necessarily related to the severity of the impacts. In particular, it is unclear how environmental perception of community members and government bodies relate to active engagement on coastal pollution. The present study analyses the coastal litter situation and evaluates the willingness of citizens to engage at four sites (three regions of mainland Chile, and Easter Island; henceforth Rapa Nui) that feature differences in culture, economy sectors and landscape characteristics. Data on coastal litter were obtained from citizen science campaigns and assessments of large litter accumulations on beaches and rocky shores. The willingness to engage was evaluated qualitatively, considering municipal planning documents and the perception of residents on coastal litter and general waste management. We found very large quantities of litter in northern Chile, posing a hazard to marine wildlife and human health, and moderate quantities in the other regions. The region with the most severe case of coastal pollution does not feature the highest engagement, possibly a result of underlying factors such as an unsustainable economy and few possibilities for the population to connect with the natural environment. On mainland Chile, municipal engagement is low to moderate while on Rapa Nui there exist integrated waste-management strategies that address coastal pollution. Inhabitants of Rapa Nui seem to have a better conduct in the coastal environment (picking up litter, littering less), and show more engagement in waste-reduction strategies (recycling, volunteering for beach clean-ups). We suggest that the unique cultural history of the island, a landscape that allows meaningful interaction with nature and an economy based on sustainable tourism and high international visibility facilitates engagement on environmental issues. We advise managers to consider respective underlying variables, to create environments that allow contact with nature (e.g. public access to parks), and to encourage bottom-up initiatives, preferably by local actors (e.g. by promoting already engaged individuals or organisations).  aPublisher supplied data 3abeaches 3aecotourism 3ahuman health 3alandscapes 3amanagers 3aparks 3aplanning 3apollution 3arecycling 3avolunteerism 3awaste reduction 3awildlife 3aChile 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aMarine litter 0aWillingness to engage 0aSocio-economic factors 0aPro-environmental behaviour 0aWaste management1 aSalas, Sonia1 aMutafoglu, Konar1 aThiel, Martin0 tOcean & coastal management.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 137 p.82-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.11.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245012100199300001800320520137700338592002801715650002401743650001401767650002301781650001501804650002101819650001601840650001301856650002401869650001401893650001101907650001401918650003101932650001301963650001101976653002001987653002502007653001502032653000802047700001502055700005602070700001602126700001702142700001802159700001202177700001502189700001702204700005502221773013902276856007802415852000902493655001202502IND60681176320221119044523.0200115e20191218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068117632DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b145982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Jiehua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1100-902X10aInterface Nanoengineering of PdNi-S/C Nanowires by Sulfite-Induced for Enhancing Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution  ap. 2243-2251.  aThe interfacial structural design of materials in nanoscale is a promising approach to regulate the physicochemical properties of materials and further optimize material properties for a variety of potential applications. Herein, PdNi-S/C nanowires with inductive sulfite has been successfully crafted through hydrothermal synthesis and applied as a superior hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. Based on the autocatalytic mechanism, PdNi alloy nanoparticles were synthesized by controlling reduction kinetics with the presence of formic acid. Meanwhile, the sulfite is selected as an effective inductive agent to form PdNi-S/C nanowires with amorphous interfaces. The morphology, composition, and electronic structure of the synthesized PdNi-S/C were studied in detail. The PdNi-S/C manifests excellent HER performance in alkaline solution with an overpotentials of 67 mV at current density of 10 mA cm–², a Tafel slope of 69.4 mV dec–¹, and significantly long-term durability. The improvement of HER performance of the PdNi-S/C is attributed to the one-dimensional nanowire structure, abundant sulfur vacancies and defects, and the synergistic effect between PdNi-S nanowires with the graphite carbon. Furthermore, this present work offers a novel method for structure adjustment of materials to effectively control their property and catalytic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3aformic acid 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3ananowires 3anickel 3apalladium 3aphysicochemical properties 3asulfites 3asulfur 0asulfite-induced 0aamorphous interfaces 0aPdNi alloy 0aHER1 aLiu, Wenqi1 aZhou, Yuming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3506-35171 aLi, Tongfei1 aWang, Yanyun1 aLiang, Shuang1 aXue, Yi1 aGuo, Chang1 aZhang, Yiwei1 aHu, Yingjie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3237-86090 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 12, no. 2 p.2243-2251dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b145983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245017400161300001600335520111400351592002801465650004601493650001701539650001801556650004301574650002601617650002101643650002001664650001801684700001901702700002601721700002201747700002101769700002001790773010001810856008001910852000901990655001201999IND60082991720221120224354.0141101e20110115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008299172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2010.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauko, Lea10aGlycan profiling of monoclonal antibodies using zwitterionic-type hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry detection  ap. 235-241.  aWe present a new method for the analysis of glycans enzymatically released from monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) employing a zwitterionic-type hydrophilic interaction chromatography (ZIC–HILIC) column coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI–MS). Both native and reduced glycans were analyzed, and the developed procedure was compared with a standard HILIC procedure used in the pharmaceutical industry whereby fluorescent-labeled glycans are analyzed using a TSK Amide-80 column coupled with fluorescence detection. The separation of isobaric alditol oligosaccharides present in monoclonal antibodies and ribonuclease B is demonstrated, and ZIC–HILIC is shown to have good capability for structural recognition. Glycan profiles obtained with the ZIC–HILIC column and ESI–MS provided detailed information on MAb glycosylation, including identification of some less abundant glycan species, and are consistent with the profiles generated with the standard procedure. This new ZIC–HILIC method offers a simpler and faster approach for glycosylation analysis of therapeutic antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afluorescence 3aglycosylation 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aoligosaccharides 3apolysaccharides 3aribonucleases1 aNordborg, Anna1 aHutchinson, Joseph P.1 aLacher, Nathan A.1 aHilder, Emily F.1 aHaddad, Paul R.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Jan. 15, v. 408, no. 2 p.235-241dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2010.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245014100162300001800303520130600321592002801627650001501655650002001670650002401690650002801714650001501742650001301757650001701770650001801787650001401805650001301819650001901832650001601851650001701867650001501884650001801899653002401917653003101941653002301972653001701995653001302012700001902025700001702044700001902061700001802080700006002098700001802158700005702176773013902233856007802372852000902450655001202459IND60681177220221119044225.0200115e20191216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068117722DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b156172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Hyunmin10aRetarding Ion Exchange between Conducting Polymers and Ionic Liquids for Printable Top Electrodes in Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells  ap. 2276-2284.  aSemitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) are considered to be an influential tool for aesthetic and economic building-integrated photovoltaics, which can be fabricated by the printing technology. A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and ionic liquid (IL) composite has been considered as an electrode for ST-OSCs because of its high electrical conductivity, high transparency, and printability. However, we found that the introduction of IL into the PEDOT:PSS solution for enhancing its electrical conductivity results in (1) nonreliable printing of PEDOT:PSS/IL composite films because of gradual gelation of the mixture solution and (2) the production of chemically reactive ion pairs during ion exchange between PSS and IL, which induces the oxidation of the underlying organic semiconductors during printing. To solve these problems, we developed a sequential printing method using pristine PEDOT:PSS and IL solutions to retard ion exchange, thus preventing chemical doping of organic semiconductors by newly generated ion pairs. Finally, by using only solution processes, we demonstrate efficient ST-OSCs with a printed PEDOT:PSS/IL composite as the top electrode, exhibiting a power conversion efficiency of 6.32% at an average visible transmittance of 35.4%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrodes 3agelation 3aion exchange 3aionic liquids 3aoxidation 3apolymers 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3asulfonates 3atransmittance 0apolymer solar cells 0asemitransparent solar cell 0aconducting polymer 0aionic liquid 0aprinting1 aLee, Jong-Hoon1 aLee, Seongyu1 aJeong, Song Yi1 aChoi, Jin Woo1 aLee, Chang-Lyoul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1336-45891 aKim, Ju-Hyeon1 aLee, Kwanghee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5907-86250 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 16, v. 12, no. 2 p.2276-2284dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b156173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010900166300001400275520138400289592002801673650001501701650001601716650001201732650001601744650001301760650001601773650001801789650002101807650002801828650001801856650001201874650002401886650001001910650001901920650001801939650002601957650001401983650000901997650003302006650001402039653002602053653001102079653003302090653001202123700002602135700002002161700002002181773012602201856008402327852000902411655001202420IND60560566720221118051424.0180904e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolo, Andrea10aBiological invasion in the indoor environment: the spread of Eurotium halophilicum on library materials  ap. 34-44.  aVolumes from an archive of the University of Milan showed whitish-grey discolouration putatively caused by microorganisms. Microscopic and viability assays proved that discolouration from two volumes were characterized by a marked presence of viable fungi, demonstrating that they were mainly biological in nature. Fungal sequences were phylogenetically most closely related to Eurotium, Aspergillus, Candida, Penicillium, Alternaria, Phaeosphaeria, Capnodiales and Pleosporales taxa. SEM analysis showed that Eurotium halophilicum is dominant on the two infected volumes. Viable airborne fungal loads near the two volumes were higher than recommended maximum values, demonstrating that airborne fungi could represent a source of risk. The airborne microbial community sampled in two different seasons was composed by fungi belonging in the genera Aspergillus, Candida and Eurotium. The detection of E. halophilicum also in the archival air indicated a possible source of contamination. Fluctuations of thermo-hygrometric values were also observed in the archive in the different seasons. The occurrence of white efflorescence on the stored volumes most likely depended on the lack of both a dusting programme and air-conditioning, and insufficient ventilation in the repository, and, on the hygroscopic behaviour of the binding materials used in the manufacture of the volumes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aAspergillus 3aCandida 3aCapnodiales 3aEurotium 3aPenicillium 3aPhaeosphaeria 3aair conditioning 3aairborne microorganisms 3adiscoloration 3adusting 3aecological invasion 3afungi 3ahygroscopicity 3amanufacturing 3amicrobial communities 3aphylogeny 3arisk 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aviability 0aEurotium halophilicum 0aIndoor 0aAirborne microbial community 0aArchive1 aCappitelli, Francesca1 aVilla, Federica1 aPinzari, Flavia0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2017 Mar., v. 118 p.34-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2016.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245006800159300001800227520133300245592002801578650002201606650001501628650001101643650002401654650001101678650001301689650001501702650003101717650000801748653003401756653001801790653001101808653001801819653003401837700005301871700001301924700001901937700005601956700002002012700001702032700001802049700001502067773013902082856007802221852000902299655001202308IND60681177920221119043921.0200115e20191223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068117792DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b163212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Shuo10aEnhanced Photoresponse of Indium-Doped Tin Disulfide Nanosheets  ap. 2607-2614.  aDoping of tin disulfide (SnS₂) is an effective strategy to regulate its physical and chemical properties. In this work, In doping was used to manipulate the photoresponse behavior of SnS₂-based photodetectors. In-doped SnS₂ nanosheets were synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. It was found that the In doping concentration plays an important role in the size of the fabricated SnS₂ nanosheets. With the increase in the In doping concentration, the lateral size of samples increased from ∼210 to ∼420 nm, but the crystallinity became poor at higher concentrations. Energy dispersive X-ray-mapping results show that the In was homogeneously distributed in the samples. In addition, a red shift was observed in the binding energy of Sn and S with increased In doping concentration, which may be due to the p-type doping of In in SnS₂. After In doping, the performance of SnS₂-based photodetectors was significantly improved. The photoresponse speed of In-doped SnS₂-based photodetectors was faster than that of pristine SnS₂-based devices under the illumination of 532 and 405 nm lasers. This work develops an effective approach of In doping to enhance the photoresponse characteristics of SnS₂-based photodetectors and proves that In-doped SnS₂ has a vast potential in optoelectronic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3adisulfides 3aenergy 3ahot water treatment 3alasers 3alighting 3ananosheets 3aphysicochemical properties 3atin 0alayered metal dichalcogenides 0atin disulfide 0adoping 0aphotodetector 0aphotoresponse characteristics1 aFan, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3870-29511 aTian, He1 aZhang, Yonghui1 aZhang, Zihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0638-11181 aZhong, Mianzeng1 aLiu, Hongfei1 aWang, Mengjun1 aLi, Erping0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 23, v. 12, no. 2 p.2607-2614dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b163213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245014000160300001800300520116600318592002801484650003401512650003701546650001301583650002101596650001701617650001101634650001901645650002201664650002701686650003701713653002401750653001401774653000801788653003701796653001001833700001401843700001601857700006701873700001501940700005701955700001802012700001702030700001802047700001702065700001402082700001602096700001602112700001702128700005702145773013902202856007802341852000902419655001202428IND60681178120221119044434.0200115e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068117812DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b163432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yulong10aVariable-Energy Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy: A Nondestructive Tool to Analyze the Cathode–Solid-State Electrolyte Interface  ap. 2293-2298.  aAll-solid-state batteries are expected to be promising next-generation energy storage systems with increased energy density compared to the state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries. Nonetheless, the electrochemical performances of the all-solid-state batteries are currently limited by the high interfacial resistance between active electrode materials and solid-state electrolytes. In particular, elemental interdiffusion and the formation of interlayers with low ionic conductivity are known to restrict the battery performance. Herein, we apply a nondestructive variable-energy hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy to detect the elemental chemical states at the interface between the cathode and the solid-state electrolyte, in comparison to the widely used angle-resolved (variable-angle) X-ray photoemission spectroscopy/X-ray absorption spectroscopy methods. The accuracy of variable-energy hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy is also verified with a focused ion beam and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. We also show the significant suppression of interdiffusion by building an artificial layer via atomic layer deposition at this interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3alithium batteries 3anondestructive methods 3atransmission electron microscopy 0asolid-state battery 0ainterface 0aALD 0aX-ray photoemission spectroscopy 0aHRTEM1 aSun, Qian1 aLiu, Jingru1 aNorouzi Banis, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6144-68371 aZhao, Yang1 aWang, Biqiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3903-86341 aAdair, Keegan1 aHu, Yongfeng1 aXiao, Qunfeng1 aZhang, Cheng1 aZhang, Li1 aLu, Shigang1 aHuang, Huan1 aSong, Xiping1 aSun, Xueliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0374-12450 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 12, no. 2 p.2293-2298dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b163433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245008600206300001600292506007600308520066100384592002801045506003701073650001501110650001301125650001801138650001301156650001701169650001001186650001701196650002101213650001401234650001401248650001801262650001801280653001501298653001801313653002001331653001701351653001601368700002401384700001901408700001901427700002501446700002001471773008701491856008101578852000901659655001201668IND60560567420221207144326.0170105e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2014.06.0072doi7 aPMC42524852pmcid7 a250657072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunn, John S.10aSalmonella chronic carriage: epidemiology, diagnosis, and gallbladder persistence  ap. 648-655.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTyphoid (enteric fever) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, causing over 21 million new infections annually, with the majority of deaths occurring in young children. Because typhoid fever-causing Salmonella have no known environmental reservoir, the chronic, asymptomatic carrier state is thought to be a key feature of continued maintenance of the bacterium within human populations. Despite the importance of this disease to public health, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that catalyze carriage, as well as our ability to reliably identify and treat the Salmonella carrier state, have only recently begun to advance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3abacteria 3acarrier state 3achildren 3aepidemiology 3afever 3agall bladder 3ahuman population 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apublic health 3atyphoid fever 0aSalmonella 0atyphoid fever 0achronic carrier 0aepidemiology 0adiagnostics1 aMarshall, Joanna M.1 aBaker, Stephen1 aDongol, Sabina1 aCharles, Richelle C.1 aRyan, Edward T.0 tTrends in microbiology.g2014 Nov., v. 22 p.648-655dElsevier Ltdx0966-842X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2014.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245005900209300001600268506007600284520068400360592002801044506003701072650002201109650001601131650002001147650001001167650002801177650001201205650001601217650001901233650001101252650001301263650001201276651001001288653003301298653001701331653002301348700002101371700002101392700002201413700002301435773008701458856008101545852000901626655001201635IND60560567820221207144329.0170105e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2014.08.0082doi7 aPMC42529892pmcid7 a252643122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Tokiko10aPandemic potential of avian influenza A (H7N9) viruses  ap. 623-631.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAvian influenza viruses rarely infect humans, but the recently emerged avian H7N9 influenza viruses have caused sporadic infections in humans in China, resulting in 440 confirmed cases with 122 fatalities as of 16 May 2014. In addition, epidemiologic surveys suggest that there have been asymptomatic or mild human infections with H7N9 viruses. These viruses replicate efficiently in mammals, show limited transmissibility in ferrets and guinea pigs, and possess mammalian-adapting amino acid changes that likely contribute to their ability to infect mammals. In this review, we summarize the characteristic features of the novel H7N9 viruses and assess their pandemic potential.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aamino acids 3aavian influenza 3abirds 3aepidemiological studies 3aferrets 3aguinea pigs 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3apandemic 3aviruses 3aChina 0aavian influenza H7N9 viruses 0atransmission 0apandemic potential1 aWatanabe, Shinji1 aMaher, Eileen A.1 aNeumann, Gabriele1 aKawaoka, Yoshihiro0 tTrends in microbiology.g2014 Nov., v. 22 p.623-631dElsevier Ltdx0966-842X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2014.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245013000205300001600335506007600351520180500427592002802232506003702260650002102297650001102318650001702329650004602346650001602392650001502408650001202423650001402435650001802449700002002467700001502487700001702502773009902519856008002618852000902698655001202707IND60082993720221207121144.0141101e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008299372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2010.10.0062doi7 aPMC30060672pmcid7 a209468622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Fong Fu,10aCharacterization of mycolic acids from the pathogen Rhodococcus equi by tandem mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization  ap. 112-122.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a simple tandem mass spectrometric approach toward structural characterization of mycolic acids, the long-chain α-alkyl-β-hydroxy fatty acids unique to mycobacteria and related taxa. On collisionally activated dissociation in a linear ion trap or tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer, the [M−H]⁻ ions of mycolic acid generated by electrospray ionization undergo dissociation to eliminate the meroaldehyde residue, leading to formation of carboxylate anions containing α-alkyl chains. The structural information from these fragment ions affords structural assignment of the mycolic acids, including the lengths of the meromycolate chain and the α-branch. This study revealed that the mycolic acids isolated from pathogenic Rhodococcus equi 103 contained a series of homologous ions having C₃₀ to C₅₀ chain with 0–2 double bonds. The α-branch ranged from C₁₀ to C₁₈ with 0 to 1 double bond, in which 16:0 and 14:0 are the most prominent, whereas the meromycolate chain ranged from C₁₄ to C₃₄ with 0 to 2 double bonds. The major molecular species consisted of more than 3 isomers that differ by the lengths of the α-branch or meromycolate chain, and up to 10 isobaric isomers were identified for some minor ions. We also employed tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry with precursor ion and neutral loss scans for profiling mycolic acid with specific structure in mixtures. The tandem spectra obtained from precursor ion scans of m/z 255 (16:0-carboxylate anion) and m/z 227 (14:0-carboxylate anion) may provide a simple specific means for classification of Rhodococci species, whereas tandem spectra from neutral loss of meroaldehyde residue scans provided a simple approach to reveal the mycolic acid molecules with specific meromycolate chain in mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhodococcus equi 3aanions 3adissociation 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afatty acids 3aionization 3aisomers 3apathogens 3aspectrometers1 aSoehl, Kristina1 aTurk, John1 aHaas, Albert0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 409, no. 1 p.112-122dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2010.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245011700167300001600284520096400300592002801264650001501292650001901307650001501326650002501341650001101366700001801377700002001395700002301415773009901438856008001537852000901617655001201626IND60082993820221121050056.0141101e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008299382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2010.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeno, Katsuyuki13aAn activated medium with high durability and low nonspecific adsorption: Application to protein A chromatography  ap. 123-129.  aActivated media allow the user to easily synthesize a variety of affinity media.

The PC groups function as suppressors of nonspecific protein adsorption, whereas the NHS groups are able to covalently bind to the primary amino groups of ligands. Because protein A affinity medium is the most frequently used affinity medium, we prepared protein A media in which a recombinant protein A was bound to the NHS groups of the activated media and evaluated its utility.

In this work, we constructed a series of two-dimensional (2D) (001) LaAlO₃/SrTiO₃ heterostructures and systematically investigated their atomic and electronic properties by means of first-principles calculations. Our results show that (1) nonstoichiometry leads to ferromagnetism at the interfaces of the systems; (2) half-metallicity can be realized by introducing slight hole-doping; and (3) a semiconductor-to-metal transition can be triggered by applying a moderate (within 3%) out-of-plane strain. Besides, based on in-depth analysis of the electronic structures, we propose that the orbital hybridization of interfacial O and Ti atoms may play a crucial role in determining the above interesting phenomena. Our findings are expected to stimulate further experimental researches on the related 2D perovskite heterostructures and to be beneficial for the design of new multifunctional electronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic equipment 3aferromagnetism 3amagnetic properties 0a2D perovskite heterostructure 0ahalf-metallicity 0asemiconductor-to-metal transition 0astrain1 aGeng, Cuihuan1 aGuo, Yao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3964-80020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 18, v. 12, no. 2 p.3134-3139dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b171403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01143naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007300168300001400241520021700255592002800472650002600500650001100526650002000537650001400557653002900571653001700600653000900617653002800626773008500654856008100739852000900820655001200829IND60560568920221118051342.0170105e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2015.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindsay, Jodi A.10aTransmission of antimicrobial resistance in resource-poor healthcare  ap. 69-70.  aInter-patient transfer of antimicrobial resistant pathogens is more common in resource-poor healthcare settings.

Thus, rupturing these oxide shells to release their LM and effectively bridge the microcapsules is critical for achieving the full potential of LM-based TIMs. While this process has been studied from an electrical perspective, such results do not fully translate to thermal applications because electrical transport requires only a single percolation path. In this work, we introduce a novel method to study the rupture mechanics of beds composed solely of LM capsules. Specifically, by measuring the electrical and thermal resistances of capsule beds during compression, we can distinguish between the pressure at which capsule rupture initiates and the pressure at which widespread capsule rupture occurs. These pressures significantly differ, and we find that the pressure for widespread rupture corresponds to a peak in thermal conductivity during compression; hence, this pressure is more relevant to LM thermal applications. Next, we quantify the rupture pressure dependence on LM capsule age, size distribution, and oxide shell chemical treatment. Our results show that large freshly prepared capsules yield higher thermal conductivities and rupture more easily. We also show that chemically treating the oxide shell further facilitates rupture and increases thermal conductivity. We achieve a thermal conductivity of 16 W m–¹ K–¹ at a pressure below 0.2 MPa for capsules treated with dodecanethiol and hydrochloric acid. Importantly, this pressure is within the acceptable range for TIM applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical treatment 3aelectronics 3aheat tolerance 3aheat transfer 3ahydrochloric acid 3aliquids 3amechanics 3apolymers 3athermal conductivity 3athiols 0aliquid metal droplets 0aliquid metal capsules 0aoxide layer 0aoxide shell 0aoxide rupture 0athermal interface materials 0achemical functionalization1 aRalphs, Matthew1 aKong, Wilson1 aHart, Matthew1 aRykaczewski, Konrad1 aWang, Robert Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3888-69060 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 12, no. 2 p.2625-2633dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b173583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006500165300001600230520077000246592002801016650001401044650001301058650001201071650002501083650002601108650001301134653002501147653001201172653001401184653001401198653001701212653001701229700006101246773010801307856008201415852000901497655001201506IND60560569620221118051530.0180904e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2016.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDragoš, Anna14aThe Peculiar Functions of the Bacterial Extracellular Matrix  ap. 257-266.  aA biofilm is a common life form where bacterial cells crowd together surrounded by an extracellular matrix (ECM). Traditionally, the ECM is considered as a structural material that glues and shields the biofilm cells. Here we describe alternative functions of the ECM, highlighting how it benefits microbes beyond the biofilms. Next to protecting free-living cells, the ECM participates in signaling, migration, and genetic exchange either being freely shared with other species or being exclusive to siblings. Considering the structural and recently discovered functions of the ECM, we also attempt to revise its role in sociomicrobiology. In the light of recent findings, the canonical view on ECM as a passive structural material of biofilms should be revisited.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesives 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aextracellular matrix 3agenetic recombination 3asiblings 0aextracellular matrix 0abiofilm 0asignaling 0amigration 0aDNA-exchange 0apublic goods1 aKovács, Ákos T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4465-16360 tTrends in microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.257-266dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2016.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009200156300001600248520090900264592002801173650003601201650002101237650001001258650001601268650001401284650002101298650003701319700002201356700002301378700001701401700002001418773013101438856007401569852000901643655001201652IND60639550920221119120234.0190502e20160201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063955092DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cs00628g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCernak, Tim14aThe medicinal chemist's toolbox for late stage functionalization of drug-like molecules  ap. 546-576.  aThe advent of modern C–H functionalization chemistries has enabled medicinal chemists to consider a synthetic strategy, late stage functionalization (LSF), which utilizes the C–H bonds of drug leads as points of diversification for generating new analogs. LSF approaches offer the promise of rapid exploration of structure activity relationships (SAR), the generation of oxidized metabolites, the blocking of metabolic hot spots and the preparation of biological probes. This review details a toolbox of intermolecular C–H functionalization chemistries with proven applicability to drug-like molecules, classified by regioselectivity patterns, and gives guidance on how to systematically develop LSF strategies using these patterns and other considerations. In addition, a number of examples illustrate how LSF approaches have been used to impact actual drug discovery and chemical biology efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon-hydrogen bond activation 3achemical bonding 3adrugs 3ametabolites 3aoxidation 3aregioselectivity 3astructure-activity relationships1 aDykstra, Kevin D.1 aTyagarajan, Sriram1 aVachal, Petr1 aKrska, Shane W.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 45, no. 3 p.546-576dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cs00628g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005700165300001600222506010400238506007600342520096700418592002801385506003701413650001301450650002101463650002601484650001201510650002401522650002901546650001101575650001201586650001301598650003101611650001901642650001801661650001201679653002001691653002401711653001801735653002601753653002801779653002201807700002101829773010801850856008201958852000902040655001202049IND60560569920221207144329.0220914e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056056992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2016.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBunse, Carina10aMarine Bacterioplankton Seasonal Succession Dynamics  ap. 494-505.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacterioplankton (bacteria and archaea) are indispensable regulators of global element cycles owing to their unique ability to decompose and remineralize dissolved organic matter. These microorganisms in surface waters worldwide exhibit pronounced seasonal succession patterns, governed by physicochemical factors (e.g., light, climate, and nutrient loading) that are determined by latitude and distance to shore. Moreover, we emphasize that the effects of large-scale factors are modulated regionally, and over shorter timespans (days to weeks), by biological interactions including molecule exchanges, viral lysis, and grazing. Thus the interplay and scaling between factors ultimately determine the success of particular bacterial populations. Spatiotemporal surveys of bacterioplankton community composition provide the necessary frame for interpreting how the distinct metabolisms encoded in the genomes of different bacteria regulate biogeochemical cycles.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3abacterioplankton 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aclimate 3acommunity structure 3adissolved organic matter 3agenome 3agrazing 3alatitude 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollution load 3asurface water 3asurveys 0aMarine bacteria 0aPopulation dynamics 0a16S rRNA gene 0aEnvironmental factors 0aBiological interactions 0aDissolved organic1 aPinhassi, Jarone0 tTrends in microbiology.g2017 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.494-505dElsevier LtdwJournal:6327x0966-842X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2016.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009800169300001400267520105900281592002801340650001301368650001201381650001501393650001901408650001401427650001401441650001001455650001901465650001001484650001401494650000901508650002001517650001601537650001601553653001401569653001401583653001501597653001201612653002001624653001401644700001701658700001601675700001901691700002401710700002301734700002001757700002101777773011301798856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60560570220221118051345.0180904e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056057022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2016.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrady, Michael P.10aAlloy Corrosion Considerations in Low-Cost, Clean Biomass Cookstoves for the Developing World  ap. 20-32.  aNearly 40% of the world cooks on open fires or inefficient biomass-fueled cookstoves. The resulting smoke is a health hazard, contributing to an estimated 4 million premature deaths per year, as well as a major source of black carbon emissions. One solution is the introduction of improved, clean-burning biomass cookstoves. One of the most challenging components is the combustor, which must operate at high temperatures (often ≥600°C) in the presence of highly corrosive species released from biomass fuel combustion, yet be sufficiently low cost to permit widespread adoption. The present work reports the development of accelerated corrosion test screening protocols employing highly corrosive salt and water vapor species, specifically designed to evaluate alloys for clean biomass cookstove combustors, and corrosion findings for a range of commercial and developmental alloys. A new Fe-Cr-Si base alloy that offers promise for improved corrosion resistance at lower cost than state-of the art FeCrAl and stainless steel alloys is also reported.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acombustion 3acooking stoves 3acorrosion 3aemissions 3afires 3ahealth hazards 3asalts 3ascreening 3asoot 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3awater vapor 0acookstove 0acorrosion 0acombustion 0abiomass 0astainless steel 0aoxidation1 aBanta, Kelly1 aMizia, John1 aLorenz, Nathan1 aLeonard, Donovan N.1 aYamamoto, Yukinori1 aDeFoort, Morgan1 aKeiser, James R.0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2017 Apr., v. 37 p.20-32dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2016.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009000162300001800252520189000270592002802160650000802188650002502196650001402221650001902235650002602254650001702280650001302297650001702310650002202327650001202349650001202361650001902373650001602392650002502408650001102433650001802444650001602462653003002478653001802508653002702526653001902553700005502572700002002627700006402647700005402711700002202765700003902787773013902826856007802965852000903043655001203052IND60681181220200401000000.0200115e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068118122DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b178202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKertik, Aylin10aHigh-Performance CO₂-Selective Hybrid Membranes by Exploiting MOF-Breathing Effects  ap. 2952-2961.  aConventional CO₂ separation in the petrochemical industry via cryogenic distillation or amine-based absorber–stripper units is energy-intensive and environmentally unfriendly. Membrane-based gas separation technology, in contrast, has contributed significantly to the development of energy-efficient systems for processes such as natural gas purification. The implementation of commercial polymeric membranes in gas separation processes is restricted by their permeability–selectivity trade-off and by their insufficient thermal and chemical stability. Herein, we present the fabrication of a Matrimid-based membrane loaded with a breathing metal–organic framework (MOF) (NH₂-MIL-53(Al)) which is capable of separating binary CO₂/CH₄ gas mixtures with high selectivities without sacrificing much of its CO₂ permeabilities. NH₂-MIL-53(Al) crystals were embedded in a polyimide (PI) matrix, and the mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs) were treated at elevated temperatures (up to 350 °C) in air to trigger PI cross-linking and to create PI–MOF bonds at the interface to effectively seal the grain boundary. Most importantly, the MOF transitions from its narrow-pore form to its large-pore form during this treatment, which allows the PI chains to partly penetrate the pores and cross-link with the amino functions at the pore mouth of the NH₂-MIL-53(Al) and stabilizes the open-pore form of NH₂-MIL-53(Al). This cross-linked MMM, with MOF pore entrances was made more selective by the anchored PI-chains and achieves outstanding CO₂/CH₄ selectivities. This approach provides significant advancement toward the design of selective MMMs with enhanced thermal and chemical stabilities which could also be applicable for other potential applications, such as separation of hydrocarbons (olefin/paraffin or isomers), pervaporation, and solvent-resistant nanofiltration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aartificial membranes 3abreathing 3acarbon dioxide 3acoordination polymers 3acrosslinking 3acrystals 3adistillation 3aenergy efficiency 3aisomers 3amethane 3ananofiltration 3anatural gas 3aoil and gas industry 3aolefin 3apervaporation 3atemperature 0ametal−organic framework 0across-linking 0amixed-matrix membranes 0agas separation1 aWee, Lik H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7343-38331 aSentosun, Kadir1 aNavarro, Jorge A.

Until recently, most [¹⁸F]-radiotracers were generated by the direct attachment of ¹⁸F to a carbon in the organic backbone of the radiotracer. The past decade has witnessed the emergence of a new strategy based on the formation of an ¹⁸F-group 13 element bond. This approach, which is rooted in the field of fluoride anion complexation/coordination chemistry, has led to the development of a remarkable family of boron, aluminium and gallium [¹⁸F]-fluoride anion complexing agents which can be conjugated with peptides and small molecules to generate disease specific PET radiotracers. This review is dedicated to the chemistry of these group 13 [¹⁸F]-fluorides anion complexing agents and their use in PET. Some of the key fluoride-binding motifs covered in this review include the trifluoroborate unit bound to neutral or cationic electron deficient backbones, the BF₂ unit of BODIPY dyes, and AlF or GaF₃ units coordinated to multidentate Lewis basic ligands. In addition to describing how these moieties can be converted into their [¹⁸F]-analogs, this review also dicusses their incorporation into bioconjugates for application in PET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aboron 3acarbon 3adyes 3afluorides 3agallium 3aligands 3amoieties 3apeptides 3apositron-emission tomography1 aVabre, Boris1 aGabbaï, François.

The crystallized PC chains rearrange into a network of spherulites (spherical semicrystalline domains); the overall surface is rough on the micrometer-scale, while the spherulites themselves consist of nanoscale features. It was confirmed via conventional spectroscopic and high-resolution microscopic investigation that such hierarchical roughness is key to the development of superhydrophobic PC and the substantial enhancement upon PDMS molding. Thus, the prepared PDMS surface has excellent superhydrophobicity with an optimized contact angle of 172 ± 1° and a sliding angle of <1°, superior to those prepared from more elaborate techniques, such as plasma sputtering and laser etching. More importantly, the knowledge acquired regarding the structural transition and superhydrophobicity development would be beneficial to engineering and evaluating templates for many other polymeric nanostructures and functional surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3acrystallization 3ahydrophobicity 3ananomaterials 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3aroughness 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 0asuperhydrophobicity 0apolycarbonate 0ananocontact molding 0aspherulites1 aNg, Cliff L.

Polyphenols are the main active substances that contribute to the antioxidant activity of Lonicera japonica. For studying on the effect of chromosome doubling and harvest time on the dynamic accumulation of the main active substances and antioxidant capabilities of L. japonica, the polyphenol composition contents (7 phenolic acids and 3 flavonoids) and the antioxidant capacity in buds and flowers of diploid and tetraploid L. japonica at six different growth stages were determined by HPLC-DAD and three common antioxidant assays (FRAP, OH RSC and DPPH ARP), and the correlation between the dynamic accumulation of the polyphenol components and antioxidant capacity was also analyzed in current research. The results indicated that the content of the most determined phenolic acids and flavonoids and the antioxidant capacity in most of the growth stages from tetraploid plants were significantly higher than those in the diploid plants. Furthermore, the changes in the antioxidant activity presented a significant positive correlation with the variations in the chlorogenic acid, rutin, hyperoside, luteoloside in the two ploidy levels of L. japonica plants. The higher yields of chlorogenic acid (158.97, 164.00, 199.85 mg), luteoloside (5.44, 4.03, 6.31 mg), hyperoside (1.15, 1.06, 1.30 mg) and total flavonoids (9.87, 8.67, 11.10 mg) from 100 buds or flowers in tetraploid plants occurred during the S3–S5 stages, and these stages also exhibited higher antioxidant activities. Therefore, the stages of S3–S5 are recommended as the best time for harvesting high-yield, high-quality tetraploid Flos Lonicerae Japonicae.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aLonicera japonica 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abuds 3achlorogenic acid 3achromosomes 3adevelopmental stages 3adiploidy 3aflowers 3aharvest date 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolism 3aphenolic acids 3apolyphenols 3arutin 3atetraploidy 0aLonicera japonica 0aPolyploidy 0aPolyphenols 0aAntioxidant activity 0aHPLC-DAD 0aChemometrics1 aLi, Yanqun1 aBai, Mei1 aDeng, Yali1 aLiang, Guangxin1 aWu, Hong0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2017 Mar., v. 112 p.87-96dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2016.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245014400199300001800343520150200361592002801863650002301891650001501914650001401929650003001943650001501973650001501988650001702003650001102020650003702031650002802068650001302096650001302109650002402122650001102146650001602157650001502173650001402188650003702202653001002239653003202249653002502281653002602306653002702332700005502359700001402414700001702428700001902445700001702464700005602481773013902537856007802676852000902754655001202763IND60681182620221119044424.0200115e20191226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068118262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b183022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Dezhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1018-596410aAtomic-Scale Intercalation of Graphene Layers into MoSe₂ Nanoflower Sheets as a Highly Efficient Catalyst for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction  ap. 2460-2468.  aMoSe₂ is an efficient catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and can potentially replace conventional catalysts composed of noble metals such as Pt. The HER activity of MoSe₂ originates mainly from the edge sites of Se atoms, but the low concentration of Se exposed to the electrolyte hampers the performance. Hence, activating a larger portion of the basal plane of Se atoms is an effective way to improve the HER properties. Herein, a 3D hierarchic nanoflower structure comprising MoSe₂ with atomic-scale interlayered graphene layers in the nanosheets is designed and prepared to improve the electron conductivity and decrease the proportions of inactive basal planes. Raman scattering, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy verify effective insertion of graphene layers in MoSe₂, and the HER characteristics are improved as exemplified by a small overpotential of 175 mV at 10 mA cm–², small Tafel slope of 58 mV dec–¹, and excellent durability with only small deterioration of 10 mV after 10,000 cycles. First-principles density functional theory and finite element method calculations corroborate the experimental results, revealing better conductivity and hydrogen adsorption/desorption ability rendered by the graphene layers. Our results reveal a new and effective strategy to optimize the structure and composition and reduce the hydrogen adsorption energy barrier in the pursuit of high-efficiency non-noble metal catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3adurability 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afinite element analysis 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ametals 3ananoflowers 3ananosheets 3aselenides 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aMoSe2 0ahydrogen evolution reaction 0asandwiched structure 0aintercalated graphene 0atheoretical derivation1 aHuang, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2371-57221 aLuo, Yang1 aTang, Kaiwei1 aRuan, Qingdong1 aWang, Guomin1 aChu, Paul K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5581-48830 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 26, v. 12, no. 2 p.2460-2468dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b183023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03876naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245008400161300001800245520205300263592002802316650002702344650003702371650001202408650001702420650002202437650001402459650002302473650003002496650001402526650001902540650001802559650001902577650001802596650001402614650001302628650001602641650002102657650003702678650003102715650001102746653002302757653001302780653003902793653003202832700001702864700005702881700001602938700001602954700001702970700005602987700001703043773013903060856007803199852000903277655001203286IND60681183020221119044356.0200115e20191216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068118302DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b184902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yunlong10aBiogenic Pt/CaCO₃ Nanocomposite as a Robust Catalyst toward Benzene Oxidation  ap. 2469-2480.  aFabricating the highly dispersive and stable Pt nanoparticles (NPs) on an economical and environmentally friendly support is of great concern in the field of catalysis. Herein, a waste eggshell was used as the support to prepare supported Pt catalysts through a plant-mediated biosynthesis method, in which the Pt precursor was reduced to Pt NPs by employing Cacumen platycladi (CP) leaf extract. The temperature and atmosphere for thermal treatment of such eggshell-supported Pt catalysts were assessed to understand their effects on catalytic performance toward the oxidation of benzene. The optimal Pt/eggshell-Ar (calcined at 400 °C in Ar) demonstrated that the temperature required for 90% benzene conversion (T₉₀%) was as low as 178 °C (80 000 mL g–¹ h–¹) and could operate steadily for at least 300 h of onstream reaction. The structure of the catalyst after reaction is much the same as that of the unreacted one. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetry (TG), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that Pt NPs were evenly distributed on the eggshell supports, and the calcination conditions had important influences on the residual CP leaf extract, the average Pt NPs size, and the ratio of Pt⁰/Pt²⁺ over the catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the interactions between Pt NPs and porous CaCO₃ could promote benzene activation adsorbed onto the Pt NPs. In addition, biogenic Pt catalysts were proved to overtake the chemically reduced counterparts in the field of catalytic performance; furthermore, both biogenic and chemically reduced Pt NPs supported on the eggshell demonstrated preferable catalytic activity than that of commercial 5Pt/C (com-Pt/C) catalysts. Collectively, immobilizing biogenic noble metal active components on the eggshell-based support could be a promising approach for the preparation of supported noble metal catalysts with excellent catalytic performance toward catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatycladus orientalis 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abenzene 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium carbonate 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aegg shell 3aheat treatment 3aleaf extracts 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aplatinum 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avolatile organic compounds 3awastes 0abiogenic synthesis 0aeggshell 0ahighly dispersive Pt nanoparticles 0acatalytic benzene oxidation1 aSun, Yuejuan1 aYang, Da-Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3509-28251 aDai, Jiajun1 aLiu, Zhilin1 aChen, Yisong1 aHuang, Jiale1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9069-57391 aLi, Qingbiao0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 16, v. 12, no. 2 p.2469-2480dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b184903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009400162300001600256520202100272592002802293650001602321650001602337650001202353650002102365650001902386650001402405650001202419650001202431650000902443650001302452650003002465650001302495650001202508650001902520650000802539700002502547773013202572856007402704852000902778655001202787IND60639553620221119120119.0190502e20160215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063955362DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cs00720h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPräsang, Carsten10aReactivity in the periphery of functionalised multiple bonds of heavier group 14 elements  ap. 900-921.  aHeavier group 14 multiple bonds have intrigued chemists since more than a century. The synthesis of stable compounds with double and triple bonds with silicon, germanium, tin and lead had considerable impact on modern ideas of chemical bonding. These developments were made possible by the use of bulky substituents that provide kinetic and thermodynamic protection. Since about a decade the compatibility of heavier multiple bonds with various functional groups has moved into focus. This review covers multiply bonded group 14 species with at least one additional reactive site. The vinylic functionalities of groups 1 and 17, resulting in nucleophilic and electrophilic disila vinyl groups, respectively, are the most prevalent and well-studied. They have been employed repeatedly for the transfer of heavier multiple bonds to yield low-valent group 14 compounds with novel structural motifs. Vinylic functionalities of groups 2 to 16 and a few σ-bonded transition metal complexes are experimentally known, but their reactivity has been studied to a lesser extent. Donor-coordinated multiple bonds are a relatively new field of research, but the large degree of unsaturation as isomers of alkynes (as well as residual functionality in some cases) offers considerable possibility for further manipulation, e.g. for the incorporation into more extended systems. Heavier allyl halides constitute the major part of heavier multiple bonds with a functional group in allylic position and some examples of successful transformations are given. At present, remote functionalities are basically limited to para-phenylene functionalised disilenes. The reported use of the latter for further derivatisation might encourage investigations in this direction. In summary, the study of peripherally functionalised multiple bonds with heavier group 14 elements is already well beyond its infancy and may be an instrumental factor in awakening the potential of group 14 chemistry for applications in polymers and other materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3aalkynes 3achemical bonding 3aderivatization 3agermanium 3ainfancy 3aisomers 3alead 3amoieties 3aorganic halogen compounds 3apolymers 3asilicon 3athermodynamics 3atin1 aScheschkewitz, David0 tChemical Society reviews.g2016 Feb. 15, v. 45, no. 4 p.900-921dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cs00720h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245010200176300001300278520118500291592002801476650001401504650001101518650001001529650001901539650001301558650001401571650001501585650002701600650002201627650001501649650002201664650001401686650002101700650001901721650000901740653002001749653001401769653001901783653001801802653001301820653001301833700003001846700002401876773013001900856008602030961000902116852000902125655001202134IND60560572520221118051417.0190410e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056057252DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(15)60106-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTORRI, Silvana Irene10aBiosolid Application to Agricultural Land—a Contribution to Global Phosphorus Recycle: A Review  ap. 1-16.  aPhosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient required for plant development. Continuous population growth and rising global demand for food are expected to increase the demand for phosphate fertilizers. However, high–quality phosphate rock reserves are progressively becoming scarce. Part of the increased pressure on P resources could be alleviated by recycling P present in biosolids. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of P in biosolid–amended soils, the effects of residual biosolid–borne P in soils, the way in which microorganisms may control P dynamics in biosolid–amended soils and the environmental implications of the use of biosolids as a source of P. Further research is needed to maximize biosolid–borne P uptake by crops and minimize its loss from biosolid–amended soils. The analysis of the microbiological control of P dynamics in biosolid–amended soils indicates interactions of biosolid P with other nutrients such as carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), suggesting that harmonization of the current regulation on the use of biosolids in agriculture, mainly based on total N and pollutant contents, is needed to better recycle P in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosolids 3acarbon 3acrops 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aplant development 3apollutants 3apopulation growth 3arecycling 3aresidual effects 3arock phosphate 3asoil 0aanthropogenic P 0aphosphate 0aP availability 0aP biogeocycle 0aP uptake 0arunoff P1 aCorrêa, Rodrigo Studart,1 aRenella, Giancarlo,0 tPedosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.1-16dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(15)60106-03Available from publisher's site  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245008400152300001800236520118800254592002801442650002101470650001901491650001601510650002101526650001301547650001301560650002201573650001901595650001901614650002001633700001801653700001301671773013401684856007401818852000901892655001201901IND60639553920221119120030.0190502e20160531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063955392DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cs00729a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, You10aMetal-free carbonaceous electrocatalysts and photocatalysts for water splitting  ap. 3039-3052.  aWater splitting driven by sunlight or renewable resource-derived electricity has attracted great attention for sustainable production of hydrogen from water.

There is growing concern that antibiotics are losing their effectiveness due to an increased antibiotic resistance in bacteria. During the last twenty years, consumption of antibiotics has increased rapidly in China, which has been cited as one of the world's worst abusers of antibiotics. This review summarizes the current state of antibiotic contamination in China's three major rivers (the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Pearl River) and illustrates the occurrence and fate of antibiotics in conventional municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). The analytical data indicate that traditional WWTPs cannot completely remove these concerned pharmaceuticals, as seen in the large difference between the distribution coefficient (Kd) and the uneven removal efficiency of various types of antibiotics. Although constructed wetlands (CWs) offer a potential way to remove these antibiotics from water supplies, knowledge of their mechanisms is limited. There are four main factors affecting the performance of CWs used for the treatment of antibiotics in water supplies, the types and configurations of CWs, hydraulic load rates, substrates, and plants and microorganisms. Further researches focusing on these factors are needed to improve the removal efficiency of antibiotics in CWs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3aconstructed wetlands 3adrugs 3amunicipal wastewater 3aplants (botany) 3arivers 3awastewater treatment 3awater supply 3aChina 3aYangtze River 3aYellow River 0aantibiotic contamination 0abiological degration 0amunicipal treatment plant 0apollutants 0awater supplies1 aWang, Bo,1 aGAO, Yongxia1 aLiu, Wen,1 aZhao, Xiaoli,1 aHuang, Xiaofeng,1 aYU, Jianghua0 tPedosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.42-51dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60295-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245008600174300001400260520145700274592002801731650002201759650002101781650002901802650002601831650002301857650001901880650001201899650002501911650001601936650001201952650002301964650002201987650001902009650002002028650002002048650001502068650002102083650001602104653002302120653002402143653002302167653003502190653001402225653002702239700002702266700002202293700002202315700002002337700001802357700001902375773013102394856008602525852000902611655001202620IND60560573120221118051356.0190410e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056057312DNAL7 a10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60298-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBONANOMI, Giuliano10aFrequent Applications of Organic Matter to Agricultural Soil Increase Fungistasis  ap. 86-95.  aSoil–borne plant pathogens are among the most important limiting factors for the productivity of agro–ecosystems. Fungistasis is the natural capability of soils to inhibit the germination and growth of soil–borne fungi in the presence of optimal abiotic conditions. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of different soil managements, in terms of soil amendment types and frequency of application, on fungistasis. For this purpose, a microcosm experiment was performed by conditioning a soil with frequent applications of organic matter with contrasting biochemical quality (i. e., glucose, alfalfa straw and wheat straw). Thereafter, the fungistasis response was assessed on four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Botrytis cinerea, Pyrenochaeta lycopersici and Trichoderma harzianum). Conditioned soils were characterized by measuring microbial activity (soil respiration) and functional diversity using the BIOLOG EcoPlatesTM method. Results showed that irrespective of the fungal species and amendment types, frequent applications of organic matter reduced fungistasis relief and shortened the time required for fungistasis restoration. The frequent addition of easily decomposable organic compounds enhanced soil respiration and its specific catabolic capabilities. This study demonstrated that frequent applications of organic matter affected soil fungistasis likely as a result of higher microbial activity and functional diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aPyrenochaeta lycopersici 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aagricultural soils 3aagroecosystems 3aalfalfa 3afunctional diversity 3agermination 3aglucose 3amicrobial activity 3aorganic compounds 3aorganic matter 3aplant pathogens 3asoil amendments 3asoil fungi 3asoil respiration 3awheat straw 0abiological control 0adisease suppression 0amicrobial activity 0amicrobial functional diversity 0aorganic C 0asoil–borne pathogens1 aGAGLIONE, Salvatore A.1 aCESARANO, Gaspare1 aSARKER, Tushar C.1 aPASCALE, Marica1 aSCALA, Felice1 aZOINA, Astolfo0 tPedosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 27, no. 1 p.86-95dElsevier LtdaSoil Science Society of ChinawJournal:jnl4085839x1002-01607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1002-0160(17)60298-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02211naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008000158300001800238520113200256592002801388650002101416650001001437650001701447650001001464650001901474650002101493650002301514650001901537650001201556650002101568700002601589700001701615773013401632856007401766852000901840655001201849IND60639554420221119120221.0190502e20160314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063955442DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cs00754b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Mengmeng10aWater-soluble perylenediimides: design concepts and biological applications  ap. 1513-1528.  aWater-soluble perylenediimides (PDIs) with high fluorescence intensity, photostability and biocompatibility have been successfully prepared and applied in the biological field. In this tutorial review, we briefly focus on the synthetic strategies for the preparation of water-soluble PDIs by incorporating ionic or non-ionic substituents with multiple polar groups into the bay-region, imide- or ortho-positions of PDIs. These ionic/non-ionic substituents can suppress π–π aggregation and shield the inner perylene chromophores, thus contributing to the water solubility which is essential for biological applications. The optical properties, absorption and emission maxima above 500 nm, minimize the autofluorescence background of cells and provide access to imaging in living cells. The biological applications of water-soluble PDIs are discussed from simple (basic) to complex (advanced) processes, including biosensing in vitro studies, imaging and gene/drug delivering in living cells, tissues and the whole body. The promising future of designed multi-functional water-soluble PDIs will be highlighted in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3ain vitro studies 3aoptical properties 3aphotostability 3atissues 3awater solubility1 aMüllen, K.q(Klaus),1 aYin, Meizhen0 tChemical Society reviews.g2016 Mar. 14, v. 45, no. 6 p.1513-1528dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5cs00754b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02008naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100006100190245011400251500002200365520094100387592002801328653002201356653002101378653000801399653001901407653001601426653001901442700001901461700002301480773007501503856008301578852000901661655001201670IND60567380120221118232403.0170711s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056738012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cotox.2017.03.0052doi7 aPMC58938552pmcid7 a296580092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMease, Kirsten M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3790-228910aBiomarkers for Nonclinical Infusion Reactions in Marketed Biotherapeutics and Considerations for Study Design  aPre-press version  aThe observation of an infusion reaction (IR) in a nonclinical study can cause concern among investigators and regulators in the development of biotherapeutics. Biomarkers can be informative to determine whether the reactions are immune-mediated or test-article related and if there is a potential risk to human subjects. IRs encompass a broad range of adverse events with a variety of triggers; the focus of this paper is IRs due to cytokine release syndrome or immune complex formation and the associated biomarkers. Such reactions generally do not preclude clinical development or marketing approval, because it is widely accepted that immune-mediated reactions in nonclinical species are not predictive of human outcomes. Several US approved products (from 2004–2016) have documented IRs in nonclinical species. This review article discusses recent examples, the biomarkers evaluated, and implications for study design and conduct.  aPublisher supplied data 0aInfusion reaction 0acytokine release 0aADA 0aimmune complex 0anonclinical 0abiotherapeutic1 aKimzey, Amy L.1 aLansita, Janice A.0 tCurrent Opinion in Toxicology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x2468-20207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cotox.2017.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011400172300001800286520193800304592002802242650001702270650002202287650002302309650001102332650002502343650001702368650002002385650002002405650002902425650001902454650001402473650002302487650001002510650002502520653002002545653002002565653003602585653003402621653003102655653002502686700001702711700002602728700007102754773014302825856008502968852000903053655001203062IND60598875320180816000000.0180702e20180404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059887532DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b037692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Cecilia10aGate-to-Gate Energy Consumption in Chemical Batch Plants: Statistical Models Based on Reaction Synthesis Type  ap. 5784-5796.  aEnergy consumption in the chemical industry is an important operating cost and environmental impact factor and reducing it is also explicitly mentioned as one of the key principles of green chemistry. Energy consumption has thus been included in diverse process design and evaluation tools as a key metric. However, measurements of energy consumption at the process equipment level are scarce, especially in fine chemical production typically performed in multiproduct and multipurpose batch plants. In this work, we present a shortcut approach based on statistical models, such as probability density functions (PDF) and classification trees, for estimating steam consumption which typically represents the highest energy utility consumption in batch plants. The output of these models is in the form of intervals derived from PDF interquartile ranges and as classes derived from the classification trees, respectively. The validation results (i.e., goodness of fit, cross validation, and case studies) show that the models provide satisfactory interval estimations of steam consumption for benchmarking chemical reaction types and performing uncertainty analysis. The models can be primarily used at early design stages for screening purposes, the reaction type being the minimum needed input information, allowing in the case of classification trees also an analysis of the most influencing predictor variables (i.e., reaction type and operating parameters) upon the steam consumption. This study also demonstrates the use of the PDF statistical models to a previously published case study for the production of the intermediate substance 4-(2-methoxyethyl)-phenol, which can be produced from seven different synthesis routes. The ranking of the synthesis routes according to the PDF models shows similar trends to that of an Energy Loss Index proxy indicator which however requires more detailed chemical and process information.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achemical industry 3achemical reactions 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3agate-to-gate 3agreen chemistry 3aoperating costs 3aprobability distribution 3aprocess design 3ascreening 3astatistical models 3asteam 3auncertainty analysis 0aGreen chemistry 0aBatch processes 0aEnergy consumption benchmarking 0aLife cycle energy inventories 0aEarly design phase metrics 0aClassification trees1 aHauner, Ines1 aHungerbühler, Konrad1 aPapadokonstantakis, Stavros1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7774-01920 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Apr. 04, v. 6, no. 5 p.5784-5796dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b037693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01539naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245010000168300001600268520050900284592002800793650001200821650001500833650001200848650001400860650001000874653002700884653001500911653001100926653003000937653001400967700002200981773010001003856007701103852000901180655001201189IND60115197120221121235708.0141124e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011519712DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReichert, Michael S.10aBehavioral strategies and signaling in interspecific aggressive interactions in gray tree frogs  ap. 520-530.  aLay SummaryWhat happens when animals of 2 different species dispute a resource?

Owing to its low cost, abundance, and aromatic structure, lignin has great potential as a feedstock for value-added polymeric products. In this work, we condensed carboxylic acid precursors with monolignols to generate reactive dimers for polymer synthesis. Three different aromatic ester dimers, each corresponding to a different monolignol, were synthesized and characterized. The dicarboxylic acid dimers were converted to the corresponding diacid chloride in situ with thionyl chloride, and a series of poly(ester–amides) were synthesized via interfacial polymerization of these diacid chlorides with seven different aliphatic or aromatic diamines. The thermal properties (decomposition, glass transition temperature, and melting temperature) and hydrolytic stability in acidic and neutral aqueous conditions of the resulting polymers were studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3achlorides 3adiamines 3adicarboxylic acids 3afeedstocks 3aglass transition temperature 3alignin 3amelting point 3apetroleum 3apolymerization 3athermal properties 3avalue added 0aLignin 0aBiomass 0aHydroxycinnamate esters 0aMonolignol 0aPoly(ester amide)s1 aKasko, Andrea M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2355-62580 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 3 p.3659-3668dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b037843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013000173300001800303520124900321592002801570650001601598650002201614650001201636650001601648650001301664650000901677650001901686650001801705650001401723650002201737650001601759650003101775653001201806653001401818653001901832653001301851653000901864700002201873700002501895700006101920700006301981773014302044856008502187852000902272655001202281IND60598875820221119072434.0180702e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059887582DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b037852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaduskar, Saurabh10aFive Rules for Measuring Biomass Pyrolysis Rates: Pulse-Heated Analysis of Solid Reaction Kinetics of Lignocellulosic Biomass  ap. 1387-1399.  aPyrolytic conversion of lignocellulosic biomass utilizes high temperatures to thermally fragment biopolymers to volatile organic compounds. The complexity of the degradation process includes thousands of reactions through multiple phases occurring in less than a second. In this work, the requirements are established for measuring the reaction kinetics of high temperature (>400 °C) biomass pyrolysis in the absence of heat and mass transfer limitations. Additionally, experimental techniques must heat and cool biomass samples sufficiently fast to elucidate the evolution of reaction products with time while also eliminating a substantial reaction during the heating and cooling phases, preferably by measuring the temperature of the reacting biomass sample directly. These requirements are described with the PHASR (pulse-heated analysis of solid reactions) technique and demonstrated by measuring the time-resolved evolution of six major chemical products from loblolly pine pyrolysis over a temperature range of 400 to 500 °C. Differential kinetics of loblolly pine pyrolysis are measured to determine the apparent activation energy for the formation of six major product compounds including levoglucosan, furfural, and 2-methoxyphenol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus taeda 3aactivation energy 3abiomass 3abiopolymers 3afurfural 3aheat 3alignocellulose 3amass transfer 3apyrolysis 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds 0aBiomass 0aPyrolysis 0aLignocellulose 0aKinetics 0aWood1 aFacas, Gregory G.1 aPapageorgiou, Costas1 aWilliams, C.

The series of anions also reflect the Hofmeister series of ILs. The results reveal that the LCST of the PVCL increases with increasing IL concentration. Interestingly, the results are the reverse of the PNIPAM with the same ILs where the LCST of PNIPAM decreases linearly with increase in the IL concentration following the Hofmeister series. Herein, we observed that the increase in the LCST of PVCL follows the order of ILs as, HSO₄– < CH₃COO– < Cl– < Br– < I– < SCN–. This is the reverse order for Hofmeister series anions effect on the polymer. Furthermore, the different kind of interactions occur between ILs and PVCL observed using UV-absorbance, fluorescence, and FTIR spectroscopy. The predicted mechanism suggest that the ILs act as bridge between water and PVCL, because the solvation of the polymers is increased leading to increase in the LCST of the polymer. Moreover, DLS and FESEM techniques were employed to examine the morphological changes in the PVCL at different temperature in the presence of various concentrations of the ILs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetates 3aanions 3abromides 3acations 3achlorides 3afluorescence 3aiodides 3aionic liquids 3apolymers 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfates 3atemperature 3athiocyanates 0aPoly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) 0aIonic liquids (ILs) 0aPhase separation 0aLower critical solution temperature (LCST) 0aHofmeister series1 aKumar, Awanish1 aNarang, Payal1 aVenkatesu, Pannuru1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8926-28610 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Jan. 02, v. 6, no. 1 p.1400-1410dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b037903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01673naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011000162300001600272520049500288592002800783650002000811650001100831650001300842650001400855650001000869650001200879653001200891653001300903653002000916653001500936653001800951653002100969653002300990700002101013700002401034700001901058773010001077856007701177852000901254655001201263IND60115197920221121235653.0141124e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011519792DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZandberg, Lies10aJackdaw nestlings can discriminate between conspecific calls but do not beg specifically to their parents  ap. 565-573.  aLay SummaryAble but not willing: jackdaw nestlings can distinguish between adults’ calls but do not beg specifically to their parents. By playing back recorded calls we found that nestling jackdaws can recognize their own species’ calls and discriminate between calls made by different adults but are equally likely to beg when they hear the calls of parents or other jackdaws. Recognizing voices likely allows youngsters to follow parents and form relationships after leaving the nest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorvus monedula 3aadults 3achildren 3anestlings 3anests 3aparents 0abegging 0aCorvidae 0aCorvus monedula 0afood calls 0aparental care 0asocial cognition 0avocal recognition.1 aJolles, Jolle W.1 aBoogert, Neeltje J.1 aThornton, Alex0 tBehavioral ecology.g2014 May, v. 25, no. 3 p.565-573dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/aru0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01557naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245010500168300001600273520051800289592002800807650001200835650002000847650002300867650001900890650001200909653002300921653001100944653001500955653001300970653001400983653002400997773010001021856007701121852000901198655001201207IND60115198020221121235800.0141124e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011519802DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReichert, Michael S.10aPlayback tests and studies of animal contest dynamics: concepts and an example in the gray tree frog  ap. 591-603.  aLay SummaryWhen animals have disputes, what determines the outcome?

A transcendental logarithmic stochastic frontier production function model is used to perform a quantitative analysis on the large yellow croaker production technique efficiency of different forms of industry organisation, with the farming household as the basic production unit. The findings indicate that the average production technology efficiency of the farming households is 84.33% and room for improvement remains; and there are significant differences between the production technique efficiency of farming households from different regions and under different forms of organisation. An analysis of the factors that affect farming household production technique efficiency found that capital input has a greater effect than labour input. Family participation and the number of individuals involved in the rearing of large yellow croakers, participation in technical training, and joining a closely-knit industry organisation all have a significant positive effect on increasing the production technique efficiency. These empirical results provide a basis and practical reference for optimising the development of the large yellow croaker farming industry, enhancing the degree of closeness of the organisations in the industry, and improving aquaculture performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarimichthys crocea 3abreeding 3acapital 3acities 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afish culture 3ahouseholds 3alabor 3amodels 3aproduction functions 3aproduction technology 3aquantitative analysis 3aquestionnaires 3arearing 3atechnical training 3aChina 0aIndustry organisation 0aFarming performance 0aLarge yellow croaker farming industry1 aGao, Jian1 aLiu, Yiyang0 tAquaculture and fisheries.g2017 May, v. 2, no. 3 p.134-139dElsevier B.V.aShanghai Ocean UniversitywJournal:23559x2096-17587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaf.2017.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245009800166300001600264520046300280592002800743650002600771650002200797650001000819650001200829650002000841650001200861650001400873650001200887653003000899653001700929653001400946653002100960653001600981653001700997653003001014653001701044653001801061700002301079700002001102700002301122773010001145856007701245852000901322655001201331IND60115198220221121235727.0141124e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011519822DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoble, Daniel W.A.10aMaternal and additive genetic effects contribute to variation in offspring traits in a lizard  ap. 633-640.  aLay SummaryMothers are more important than genes in directing the early development of lizards.

This work describes the synthesis of ultrasmall NiFe-phosphate (NFP) nanoparticles incorporated α-Fe₂O₃ nanoarrays photoanode via a facile dip-coating and annealing process to demonstrate combined effects on enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. The NFP uniformly decorating on the surface of hematite nanorods not only could improve water oxidation kinetics and charge separation efficiency, but also could suppress the charge recombination in company with the surface states passivation. Furthermore, the phosphate (P) in the NFP nanoparticles could also play a synergistic effect on promoting the multiproton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process for the PEC water oxidation. All of these lead to ∼140 mV cathodic shift of onset potential, ∼2.3-fold enhancement of the photocurrent and excellent long-term stability at 1.23 VRHE in 0.1 M KOH solution for α-Fe₂O₃/NFP photoanode. Along with these advantages, the NFP nanoparticles may possess new opportunities for modulating PEC water oxidation performances in hematite and other metal oxide photoanodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3ahematite 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3apotassium hydroxide 3asynergism 0aHematite 0aPhotoanode 0aNiFe-phosphate 0aSynergistic effects 0aSolar water splitting1 aZhao, Yong1 aWang, Kaifang1 aHe, Dongying1 aYao, Rui1 aLi, Jinping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2628-03760 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 6, no. 2 p.2353-2361dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b038043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01753naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245006200164300001600226520055000242592002800792650002500820650001500845650001900860650001000879650001100889650002300900650001700923653001500940653001600955653002500971653002300996653002101019653001801040700002201058700002301080700002101103700002101124773010001145856007701245852000901322655001201331IND60115198420221122115338.0141124e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011519842DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Masaru10aUrban and colorful male house finches are less aggressive  ap. 641-649.  aLay SummaryWe experimentally tested the aggressiveness of differently colored male house finches within an urban–rural context.

As Leishmania infection in susceptible BALB/c mice have ascribed to a polarized TH2 response, this study aim to investigate the T1/ST2 (the receptor for IL-33), as a typical TH2 marker in the postulation that a shift towards a beneficial TH1 response would occur in the absence of ST2. For this, ST2 knockout (ST2−/−) and WT BALB/c mice were experimentally infected in the retro-orbital sinus with L. infantum. We showed that ST2−/− animals displayed better control of parasite burden in both spleen and liver tissues at different time points of chronic phases, and reduced spleenomegaly and hepatomegaly compared with the wild-type (WT) mice. This was associated with increased in the IFN-γ levels and expression by CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. The inflammatory response encompasses transaminases (AST and ALT) releases and NO productions were remarkably lower in ST2−/− mice compared with WT. These data suggest that, ST2−/−) exert protection against L. infantum infection and probably shift the immune response toward TH1 induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aLeishmania infantum 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3aliver 3amice 3anitric oxide 3aparasites 3aspleen 3atissues 0aLeishmania infantum 0aVisceral leishmania 0aBALB/c 0aST2 0aIL-331 aSales, Manuela1 aSacramento, Laís1 aCosta, Diego L.1 aSouza, Djalma de1 aCarregaro, Vanessa1 aSilva, Joao Santana da0 tActa tropica.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245008700160300001600247520155800263592002801821650002101849650001101870650001401881650001901895650001201914650000901926650002001935650001001955650001601965650001001981650002501991650001402016650001702030653000902047653001802056653002502074653001502099653001502114700001602129773010102145856007702246852000902323655001202332IND60115199220221120125706.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011519922DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKappus, Sara10aSex ratio does not influence sex change despite its effect on reproductive success  ap. 827-833.  aThe sex ratio of adults in a population affects the reproductive value of being either a male or female and thus may be a cue for sex change in sequentially hermaphroditic species. We examined the effect of the sex ratio on reproduction and sex change of the reef fish, Lythrypnus dalli, and predicted that the sex ratio would influence the reproductive success for a given body size and thus the probability of sex change. We varied adult sex ratios on artificial patch reefs, monitored egg production over 20 days, and examined rates of sex change. We found no evidence that sex ratio influenced the size at which individuals change sex despite its influence on relative reproductive success. The sex ratio influenced the average reproductive success of males but not females, with males having both a higher probability of mating and higher per capita reproductive success on strongly female-biased reefs. However, females did not capitalize by changing sex to male more frequently. Female per capita reproductive success did not vary with changes in the sex ratio or female density, suggesting that females were not limited by male or resource availability. Male to female sex change was rare, suggesting that, although physiologically possible, this behavior may be uncommon in natural populations. Overall, our results indicate that the sex ratio may not be a good predictor of the reproductive value of sex change for a given individual and that body size alone may provide sufficient information regarding reproductive potential for a given sex.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLythrypnus dalli 3aadults 3abody size 3aegg production 3afemales 3afish 3ahermaphroditism 3amales 3aprobability 3areefs 3areproductive success 3asex ratio 3asex reversal 0agoby 0ahermaphrodite 0areproductive success 0asex change 0asex ratio.1 aFong, Peggy0 tBehavioral ecology.g2014 July, v. 25, no. 4 p.827-833dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/aru0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245014600183500002200329520166000351592002802011650001102039650001702050650001302067650001102080650001002091650001902101650001502120650001202135650001802147650001302165650001702178650001702195650001802212650001302230653002602243653001802269653001502287653001202302653001102314653000702325700002702332773005802359856008902417852000902506655001202515IND60567382620221118232027.0170731s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056738262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBennacef-Heffar, Nouara10aBeneficial effects of Heparin and L Arginine on dermonecrosis effect induced by Vipera lebetina venom: involvement of NO in skin regeneration  aPre-press version  aIt is well known that snake venoms such as Viperidae caused severe local effects such as hemorrhage, myonecrosis and dermonecrosis which can lead to permanent tissue loss or the disability. The aim of this study is to evaluate the skin regeneration using heparin and L-arginine as well as the dermonecrotic effects induced by Vipera lebetina venom (VLV). To better understand the toxic effects induced by VLV and to prevent or treat these effects, we evaluate the local effects and the skin regeneration with or without drugs. The evaluation of NO as a marker of angiogenesis was also undertaken to understand its involvement in tissue wound healing and skin regeneration after envenomation. Obtained results showed that this venom is able to induce severe necrosis characterized by haemorrhage, hair follicles’ destruction, glandular structure and increased of the thickness (acanthosis) in the epidermo-dermic junction. Inflammatory cells were also observed in the dermis. Pretreatment with heparin or L arginine seemed to decrease the induced dermonecrotic after one and two weeks improving the skin regeneration. The high level of NO could be involved in this regeneration, since it participates in the skin homeostatic functions’ regulation and the maintenance of the skin protective barrier integrity against microorgansims. Nitric oxide plays also a key role in wound healing; it acts as a potent mitogenic stimulus to keratinocytes during skin repair and enhances the hair follicles and sebaceous gland structure that appeared after two weeks of treatment. Thus, these drugs could be used in therapeutic approach for dermonecrotic skin repair.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVipera 3aangiogenesis 3aarginine 3adermis 3adrugs 3ahair follicles 3ahemorrhage 3aheparin 3akeratinocytes 3anecrosis 3anitric oxide 3asnake venoms 3atissue repair 3atoxicity 0aVipera lebetina venom 0adermonecrosis 0aL-arginine 0aheparin 0aRepair 0aNO1 aLaraba-Djebari, Fatima0 tActa tropica.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2017.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245013800207500002200345520138900367592002801756650001501784650001301799650002301812650001801835650002601853650002301879650001101902650004401913650001601957653004901973653000902022653002502031653002402056653002802080653003402108700002402142773006902166856008002235852000902315655001202324IND60567382920221118231924.0170731s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056738292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuruki, Kenichiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6775-467010aDetermination of thiol-to-protein ratio and drug-to-antibody ratio by in-line size exclusion chromatography with post-column reaction  aPre-press version  aAn in-line size-exclusion (SE) ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)- 5,5-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) method to quantify thiols in monoclonal antibodies (mAb) when manufacturing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) was developed. The mAbs are separated on an SE-UHPLC column and monitored with a UV detector at a wavelength of 280 nm. Eluents are channeled into a reaction coil and mixed with DTNB to form 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB). Thiol concentration is calculated using absorption at 412 nm. Using optimized conditions, partially reduced mAbs can be separated from low-molecular weight contaminants and undergo the DTNB reaction. The standard curve of L-cysteine had good linearity between 100 and 1000 μM. The selectivity, linearity, repeatability, and robustness of this method were evaluated. The calculated free-SH:protein ratios of partially reduced mAbs were consistent between in-line SE-UHPLC-DTNB and conventional methods. The SE-UHPLC-DTNB method showed time- and temperature-dependent changes in the free-SH:protein ratio of mAbs during reduction. The changes in drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of ADCs during the conjugation reaction were also evaluated. This method is an inexpensive and versatile alternative to conventional methods of estimating the free-SH:protein ratio of mAbs and the DAR of ADCs. This method also minimizes assay time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acysteine 3agel chromatography 3amanufacturing 3amonoclonal antibodies 3anitrobenzoic acids 3athiols 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 3awavelengths 0aUltra-high-performance liquid chromatography 0aDTNB 0aPost-column reaction 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aAntibody-drug conjugate 0aProcess analytical technology1 aToyo'oka, Toshimasa0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2017.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245007900165300001600244520138000260592002801640650001201668650001701680650001201697650001001709650002001719650001401739650001401753650001201767650002501779650000901804653001901813653001601832653002601848653001501874700002001889700002201909700002001931773010101951856007702052852000902129655001202138IND60115199920221123001156.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011519992DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeyssier, Aimeric10aPartners’ personality types and mate preferences: predation risk matters  ap. 723-733.  aMate choice is known as an important behavior allowing females to choose the best mate to increase their reproductive success. To estimate male quality, females can use multiple traits. Among those, recent studies have shown that male personality traits could play an important role in mate choice as they are often linked to major life-history traits and can be heritable. However, because the relationships between life-history traits and personality traits are context dependent, females are expected to choose male personality types according to the mating context. In this study on common lizards (Zootoca vivipara), we examined the role of personality traits in female mate choice and mating behavior after experimentally manipulating the predation risk experienced by females prior to mating. We showed that females not exposed to predator cues preferred males with high-activity level, a heritable behavior. When females are exposed to predator cues prior to mating, this preference was reversed. High-activity levels generally increase competitive abilities and survival but could be detrimental when predators are present. Our results suggest that female common lizards choose males based on their personality types and can modify their preferences according to their environmental context in order to produce offspring that are better adapted to their environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3afemales 3alife history 3alizards 3amales 3amating behavior 3apredation 3apredators 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3arisk 0acommon lizards 0amate choice 0apace-of-life syndrome 0apredation.1 aBestion, Elvire1 aRichard, Murielle1 aCôté, Julien,0 tBehavioral ecology.g2014 July, v. 25, no. 4 p.723-733dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/aru0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245017500173300001600348520201200364592002802376650002202404650001902426650001302445650001202458650002602470650001902496650002202515700002602537700002502563700002402588700004102612700002002653700003402673700002502707773009302732856005502825852000902880655001202889IND50067683720221121015405.0130706e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006768372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-0587.2012.00020.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatiño, Jairo10aAccounting for data heterogeneity in patterns of biodiversity: an application of linear mixed effect models to the oceanic island biogeography of spore‐producing plants  ap. 904-913.  aThe general dynamic model of oceanic island biogeography describes the evolution of species diversity properties, including species richness (SR), through time. We investigate the hypothesis that SR in organisms with high dispersal capacities is better predicted by island area and elevation (as a surrogate of habitat diversity) than by time elapsed since island emergence and geographic isolation. Linear mixed effect models (LMMs) subjected to information theoretic model selection were employed to describe moss and liverwort SR patterns from 67 oceanic islands across 12 archipelagos. Random effects, which are used to modulate model parameters to take differences among archipelagos into account, included only a random intercept in the best‐fit model for liverworts and in one of the two best‐fit models for mosses. In this case, the other coefficients are constant across archipelagos, and we interpret the intercept as a measure of the intrinsic carrying capacity of islands within each archipelago, independently of their size, age, elevation and geographic isolation. The contribution of area and elevation to the models was substantially higher than that of time, with the least contribution made by measures of geographic isolation. This reinforces the idea that oceanic barriers are not a major impediment for migration in bryophytes and, together with the almost complete absence of in situ insular diversification, explains the comparatively limited importance of time in the models. We hence suggest that time per se has little independent role in explaining bryophyte SR and principally features as a variable accounting for the changing area and topographic complexity during the life‐cycle of oceanic islands. Simple area models reflecting habitat availability and diversity might hence prevail over more complex temporal models reflecting in‐situ speciation and dispersal (time, geographic connectivity) in explaining patterns of biodiversity for exceptionally mobile organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarrying capacity 3adynamic models 3ahabitats 3aislands 3amosses and liverworts 3aphytogeography 3aspecies diversity1 aGuilhaumon, François1 aWhittaker, Robert J.1 aTriantis, Kostas A.1 aGradstein, S.

Antipredator behavior includes proactive responses to long-term variation in risk (e.g., grouping patterns) and reactive responses to short-term variation in risk (e.g., intense vigilance). In a 3-year field study, we measured variation in antipredator responses and the foraging costs of these responses for 5 ungulates (zebra, wildebeest, Grant’s gazelle, impala, and giraffe) that comprised more than 90% of the prey community available to the 2 locally dominant predators, lions and spotted hyenas. Using a model-selection approach, we examined how vigilance and group size responded to attributes of the predator, prey, and environment. We found that 1) the strength of antipredator responses was affected by attributes of the predator, prey, and environment in which they met; 2) grouping and vigilance were complementary responses; 3) grouping was a proactive response to the use of dangerous habitats, whereas vigilance was a reactive response to finer cues about predation risk; 4) increased vigilance caused a large reduction in foraging for some species (but not all); and 5) there was no clear relationship between direct predation rates and the foraging costs of antipredator responses. Broadly, our results show that antipredator responses and their costs vary in a complex manner among prey species, the predators they face, and the environment in which they meet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAepyceros melampus 3aCrocuta crocuta 3aGiraffa camelopardalis 3aPanthera leo 3aantipredatory behavior 3aforaging 3agazelles 3agroup size 3ahabitats 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3aprey species 3arisk 3awildebeest 3azebras 0aantipredator response 0aforaging 0agroup size 0arisk effects 0avigilance.1 aSchuette, Paul1 aChristianson, David0 tBehavioral ecology.g2014 July, v. 25, no. 4 p.773-784dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/aru0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245010500205300001600310506007600326520185200402592002802254506003702282650001902319650001402338650001402352650001202366650001402378650001002392650001202402650001302414650001202427650002502439650001302464653003402477653002802511653001202539653003002551653002202581653002402603653002102627700002802648700001702676773010102693856007702794852000902871655001202880IND60115200220221207141420.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011520022DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0522doi7 aPMC40959462pmcid7 a250246372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubuc, Constance10aVariance in male lifetime reproductive success and estimation of the degree of polygyny in a primate  ap. 878-889.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe degree of polygyny is predicted to influence the strength of direct male–male competition, leading to a high variance in male lifetime reproductive success and to reproduction limited to the prime period of adulthood. Here, we explore the variance in male lifetime reproductive success and reproductive time in an anthropoid primate forming multimale–multifemale groups. Males of this species form dominance hierarchies, which are expected to skew reproduction toward few high-ranking males. At the same time, however, females mate with multiple males (polygynandry), which should limit the degree of polygyny. Using 20 years of genetic and demographic data, we calculated lifetime reproductive success for the free-ranging rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) population of Cayo Santiago for subjects that died naturally or reached senescence. Our results show that 1) male lifetime reproductive success was significantly skewed (range: 0–47 offspring; males reproducing below average: 62.8%; nonbreeders: 17.4%), 2) variance in male lifetime reproductive success was 5 times larger than in females, and 3) male lifetime reproductive success was more influenced by variation in fecundity (60%) than longevity (25%), suggesting that some direct male–male competition takes place. However, the opportunity for selection (i.e., standardized variance in male lifetime reproductive success) is low compared with that in other large mammal species characterized by a high degree of polygyny. Moreover, male reproductive life extended much beyond the prime period, showing that physical strength was not required to acquire mates. We conclude that rhesus macaques exhibit a moderate degree of polygyny and, therefore, low levels of direct male–male competition for fertile females, despite the fact that males form linear dominance hierarchies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMacaca mulatta 3aadulthood 3afecundity 3afemales 3alongevity 3amales 3amammals 3apolygyny 3aprogeny 3areproductive success 3avariance 0alifetime reproductive success 0amale–male competition 0amammals 0aopportunity for selection 0areproductive skew 0areproductive timing 0arhesus macaques.1 aRuiz-Lambides, Angelina1 aWiddig, Anja0 tBehavioral ecology.g2014 July, v. 25, no. 4 p.878-889dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/aru0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012000165300001800285520177400303592002802077650004402105650001502149650002202164650001402186650002002200650002302220650002202243650002002265650001702285650003902302650002802341650001702369650004402386650002102430650001102451650003702462650000902499650002102508653002602529653001702555653003102572653001402603653002802617700001702645700001402662700006002676700005702736700006102793773014302854856008502997852000903082655001203091IND60598878320221119072504.0180702e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059887832DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b038552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Haoze10aSynthesis of Novel Fluorescent Cellulose Derivatives and Their Applications in Detection of Nitroaromatic Compounds  ap. 1436-1445.  aA series of fluorescent cellulose derivatives (AC-AET-DMANMs) with different degrees of substitution (DS) were successfully prepared. First, allyl cellulose (AC) was synthesized from cellulose in NaOH/urea aqueous solution, and then 2-aminoethanethiol (AET) was introduced onto the cellulose backbone via a thiol–ene click reaction. Finally, the fluorescent groups were introduced by the reaction of the AET-modified AC with 4-dimethylamine-1,8-naphthalic anhydride (DMANA). The structure and fluorescent properties of AC-AET-DMANMs were characterized by elemental analysis and FT-IR, ¹H NMR, UV–vis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. AC-AET-DMANM with lower DSDMANM (referring to the DS of naphthalimide groups, ≤0.25) was soluble in DMSO. AC-AET-DMANM of DSDMANM ≤ 0.09 displayed stable fluorescence in DMSO and even in the solid state. The emission of AC-AET-DMANM in DMSO quantitatively and sensitively responded to 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNH) by fluorescence quenching, and the limits of detection were determined to be 1.4 × 10–⁷ and 9.9 × 10–⁸ mol/L, respectively. Moreover, a water-soluble fluorescent derivative (AC-AET-DMANM-2W) was prepared by a further thiol–ene click reaction between AC-AET-DMANM-2 and AET. It can also be applied in the detection of TNP and DNH in aqueous media with the detection limits of 2.5 × 10–⁸ and 3.2 × 10–⁸ mol/L, respectively. The quenching mechanism is attributed to the photoinduced electron transfer and resonance energy transfer of the fluorescent cellulose derivatives to TNP/DNH molecules. The results illustrate a high applicability of the novel fluorescent cellulose derivatives to the detection of specific chemical entities in aqueous/nonaqueous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanhydrides 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3adetection limit 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3anitroaromatic compounds 3anitrophenols 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asodium hydroxide 3asolids 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3aurea 3awater solubility 0aCellulose derivatives 0aFluorescence 0aThiol−ene click reaction 0aDetection 0aNitroaromatic compounds1 aWang, Fangyu1 aYu, Lisha1 aSugimura, Kazuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2394-14201 aZhou, Jinping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5340-05751 aNishio, Yoshiyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9630-12860 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Jan. 02, v. 6, no. 1 p.1436-1445dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b038553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245006100165300001600226520115300242592002801395650002201423650001501445650001201460650001101472650001101483650001601494650001501510650001701525650001601542653001301558653001601571653002501587653001301612653002101625653001901646700002101665700003401686700001801720700002101738773010101759856007701860852000901937655001201946IND60115201320221118174923.0141124e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011520132DNAL7 a10.1093/beheco/aru0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, Faye J.10aDominant aggression as a deterrent signal in paper wasps  ap. 706-715.  aLow-level social aggression is a conspicuous feature of cooperative animal societies, but its precise function is usually unclear. One long-standing hypothesis is that aggressive displays by dominant individuals serve to reduce uncertainty about relative strength and deter subordinates from starting fights that they are unlikely to win. However, most formal theoretical models of this idea do not consider how the credibility of deterrent signals might change over time in social groups. We developed a simple model of dominant aggression as a deterrent signal, which takes into account how credibility changes over time and how selection should act on receiver memory. We then carried out an experimental test of the predictions of our model on a field population of the paper wasp, Polistes dominulus. The match between our theoretical and empirical results suggests that low-level social aggression can help to maintain the stability and productivity of cooperative associations in this species. Moreover, our work suggests that rates of aggression in animal societies and the robustness of social memories are likely to be intimately related.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolistes dominula 3aaggression 3aanimals 3amemory 3amodels 3apaper wasps 3aprediction 3asocial class 3auncertainty 0aconflict 0acooperation 0acooperative breeding 0afighting 0asocial evolution 0asocial memory.1 aDonaldson, Lynda1 aJohnstone, R.

To study the effect of relatedness on group dynamics, we manipulated the clonal composition of pea aphid groups (2 pure clonal groups and 1 mixed group) under laboratory conditions and allowed the individuals to cluster together freely on a leaf. We found variation between the clones in both the speed at which individuals joined the group and the aggregation level, where mixed colonies showed intermediates. Experimental and simulation results showed a nonrandom distribution of aphids in mixed colonies between the center and the periphery area, suggesting that one of the clones exhibits selfish herd behavior. In a second set of experiments, aphid groups were exposed to a single parasitoid female. Interestingly, we found that aphids from pure colonies were more likely to react by falling from the plant than individuals in mixed colonies. Our results revealed unexpected kin recognition abilities by nonsocial aphids, which make aphid colony dynamics more complex than previously thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aaggregation behavior 3aclonal variation 3aclones 3adefensive behavior 3afemales 3aherds 3akin recognition 3aparasitoids 0aantipredatory behavior 0aaphid 0agroup dynamic 0agroup living 0aparasitoid 0apredation risk 0aselfish herd.1 aRouyar, Angéla1 aHance, Thierry0 tBehavioral ecology.g2014 July, v. 25, no. 4 p.901-908dOxford University Pressx1045-22497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/aru0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01013naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005600128300001600184520028000200650002000480650002000500650001900520650002600539700001900565773008300584852000900667930003300676945001300709946001300722655001200735IND2037578420221120063114.0940228s1993    ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203757842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNettles, M.F.10aFactors affecting response to mailed questionnaires  ap. 171-176.  aThe purpose of this study was to examine the effect of manipulation of six factors on response rate in a questionnaire mailed to hospital foodservice directors.

However, the skin color of Red Norland is not as red as desired, particularly after extended storage. In 2004 three Red Norland tubers which appeared to have zones of darker skin color were discovered. Plants were grown from sprouts taken from both the light and dark colored zones of these tubers. The change in skin color was stable through several generations of vegetative propagation; otherwise the plants and tubers were comparable to Red Norland. This suggests that the color change was due to a chimeral mutation in the epidermis. In field trials conducted in 2005 and 2006 over 30 lines derived from the chimeral tubers were assessed for skin color, yields, tuber conformation and sensitivity to common (Streptomyces scabies) and powdery scab (Spongospora subterranea). Lines with acceptable yield and tuber configuration as well as enhanced scab resistance and/or superior red skin color were evaluated in replicated trials conducted from 2007 to 2009. Several lines were identified that had superior red skin color relative to Red Norland. Several of the new lines also appeared more resistant to common scab than Red Norland. Yield potential of the selected lines was comparable to Red Norland and when adjusted for grade out due to excessive common scab, yields of several of the chimeral lines were superior to Red Norland. This study suggests that chimeras may represent a method for rapid, low cost improvement of skin color and common scab resistance of potato, while maintaining desirable agronomic characteristics. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aSpongospora subterranea 3aStreptomyces scabiei 3aagronomic traits 3achimerism 3acolor 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3amutation 3apotatoes 3aprairies 3arapid methods 3ashelf life 3atubers 3avegetative propagation1 aElsadr, Hanny1 aMcArthur, Mary-Lee0 tAmerican journal of potato research.g2011 June, v. 88, no. 3 p.199-206dThe Associationx1099-209X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12230-010-9181-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03169naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011100165300001800276520206100294650001202355650001202367650001902379650001102398650003002409651001702439653003002456653002302486653000902509700001802518700001802536773011502554852000902669856008502678930003302763946001102796655001202807IND4437813120221120055127.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443781312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-009-0555-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Ruiqiang 10aInterdecadal shift in the relationship between the East Asian summer monsoon and the tropical Indian Ocean  ap. 1059-1071.  aIn this work, the authors investigate changes in the interannual relationship between the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and the tropical Indian Ocean (IO) in the late 1970s. By contrasting the correlations of the EASM index (EASMI) with the summer IO sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) between 1953-1975 and 1978-2000, a pronounced different correlation pattern is found in the tropical IO. The SSTA pattern similar to the positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) shows a strongly positive correlation with the EASMI in 1953-1975. But in 1978-2000, significant negative correlation appears in the northern IO and the IOD-like correlation pattern disappears. It is indicated that the summer strong IOD events in 1953-1975 can cause a weaker-than-normal western North Pacific (WNP) subtropical high, which tends to favor a strong EASM. In 1978-2000, the connection between the summer IOD and the WNP circulation is disrupted by the climate shift. Instead, the northern IO shows a close connection with the WNP circulation in 1978-2000. The warming over the northern IO is associated with the significant enhanced 500 hPa geopotential height and an anomalous anticyclone over the WNP. The change in the IO-EASM relationship is attributed to the interdecadal change of the background state of the ocean-atmosphere system and the interaction between the ENSO and IO. In recent decades, the tropical IO and tropical Pacific have a warmer mean SST, which has likely strengthened (weakened) the influence of the northern IO (IOD) on the EASM. In addition, due to the increase in the ENSO variability along with the higher mean equatorial eastern Pacific SST in 1978-2000, the influence of ENSO on the East Asian summer circulation experiences a significant strengthening after the late 1970s. Because the warming over the northern IO is associated with the significant warming in the equatorial eastern Pacific, the strengthened ENSO-EASM relationship has likely also contributed to the strengthened relationship between the northern IO and the EASM in 1978-2000. 3aEl Nino 3aclimate 3amonsoon season 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aIndian Ocean 0aEast Asian summer monsoon 0aInterdecadal shift 0aENSO1 aHa, Kyung-Ja 1 aLi, Jianping 0 tClimate dynamics.g2010 June, v. 34, no. 7-8 p.1059-1071dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-009-0555-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03211naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245012600183300001600309500001500325520140700340650002801747650002701775650002301802650002101825650001601846650001401862650001201876650002301888650002301911650001201934650002001946650001201966650001301978650003501991650002102026650003802047650005102085650003702136650001402173650003102187650002802218653002102246700002502267700001802292700002202310700001902332700002302351700002502374700001502399700002002414773007302434852000902507930003302516945002502549946001102574655001202585IND4377751220221120040105.0060209e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437775122DNAL7 a162931192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A cross between two genetically different broiler dam lines that originated from the White Plymouth Rock breed was used to produce a three-generation population. This population was used for the detection and localization of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting PHS-related traits. Ten full-sib families consisting of 456 G2 birds were typed with 420 microsatellite markers covering 24 autosomal chromosomes. Phenotypic observations were collected on 4202 G3 birds and a full-sib across family regression interval mapping approach was used to identify QTL. There was statistical evidence for QTL on chicken chromosome 2 (GGA2), GGA4 and GGA6. Suggestive QTL were found on chromosomes 5, 8, 10, 27 and 28. The most significant QTL were located on GGA2 for right and total ventricular weight as percentage of body weight (%RV and %TV respectively). A related trait, the ratio of right ventricular weight as percentage to total ventricular weight (RATIO), reached the suggestive threshold on this chromosome. All three QTL effects identified on GGA2 had their maximum test statistic in the region flanked by markers MCW0185 and MCW0245 (335-421 cM). 3aquantitative trait loci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic resistance 3abroiler breeders 3achromosomes 3aphenotype 3aascites 3achromosome mapping 3adisease resistance 3astrains 3agenetic markers 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aChromosome Mappingxveterinary 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHypertension, Pulmonaryxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPoultry Diseasesxgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 0abroiler chickens1 aCrooijmans, R.P.M.A.1 aBovenhuis, H.1 aVereijken, A.L.J.1 aVeenendaal, T.1 aPoel, J.J. van der1 aArendonk, J.A.M. van1 aPakdel, A.1 aGroenen, M.A.M.0 tAnimal genetics.g2005 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.468-476x0268-91467nnas  aDNAL  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/24  aNon-US 7aarticle03590naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245016100187300001800348520141300366650002501779650000801804650001601812650001101828650001501839650001501854650002301869650001001892650001501902650001201917650001301929650001301942650001401955650001401969650001501983650002401998650003902022650004802061650001802109650005602127650002802183650003802211650001702249650003302266650002802299650002902327650001302356650001602369650003302385650003802418650002302456650003102479653002702510653003702537653000902574700001502583700001602598700002002614773011302634852000902747856009202756930003302848946001102881655001202892IND4425789620221120033724.0090911e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442578962DNAL7 a195003012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03930.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Qing-Bo10aAtECB2, a pentatricopeptide repeat protein, is required for chloroplast transcript accD RNA editing and early chloroplast biogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana  ap. 1011-1023.  aChloroplast biogenesis is a complex process in higher plants. Screening chloroplast biogenesis mutants, and elucidating their molecular mechanisms, will provide insight into the process of chloroplast biogenesis. In this paper, we obtained an early chloroplast biogenesis mutant atecb2 that displayed albino cotyledons and was seedling lethal. Microscopy observations revealed that the chloroplast of atecb2 mutants lacked an organized thylakoid membrane. The AtECB2 gene, which is highly expressed in cotyledons and seedlings, encodes a pentatricopeptide repeat protein (PPR) with a C-terminal DYW domain. The AtECB2 protein is localized in the chloroplast, and contains a conserved HxExnCxxC motif that is similar to the activated site of cytidine deaminase. The AtECB2 mutation affects the expression pattern of plastid-encoded genes. Immunoblot analyses showed that the levels of photosynthetic proteins decreased substantially in atecb2 mutants. Inspection of all reported plastid RNA editing sites revealed that one editing site, accD, is not edited in atecb2 mutants. Therefore, the AtECB2 protein must regulate the RNA editing of this site, and the dysfunctional AccD protein from the unedited RNA molecules could lead to the mutated phenotype. All of these results indicate that AtECB2 is required for chloroplast transcript accD RNA editing and early chloroplast biogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA 3aRNA editing 3aalbino 3abiogenesis 3acotyledons 3acytidine deaminase 3agenes 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3amutation 3aproteins 3ascreening 3aseedlings 3athylakoids 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aChloroplastsxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Insertional 2aMutation 2aRNA Editing 2aRNA, Chloroplastxmetabolism 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aThylakoidsxultrastructure 0achloroplast biogenesis 0apentatricopeptide repeat protein 0aaccD1 aJiang, Yan1 aChong, Kang1 aYang, Zhong-Nan0 tPlant journal.g2009 Sept., v. 59, no. 6 p.1011-1023dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03930.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090911b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02210naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012000126300001400246520139000260650000901650650001301659650001301672650001601685650001301701650002301714700001701737773008601754852000901840930003301849945001301882946001301895655001201908IND2047145120221120033809.0950804e199502  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204714512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerry, B.W.10aUse of grilling and combination broiler-grilling at various temperatures for beef loin steaks differing in marbling  ap. 65-74.  aBeef loins from 10 carcasses of Small minus marbling (USDA Select grade) and 10 carcasses of Slight minus marbling (USDA Choice grade) were used in the study. Steaks were cooked to 67C by either simultaneous broiler-grilling or by grilling alone. Temperature settings during cooking of either 204 or 232C were used in each cooking system. Broiler-grilled steaks took less time to reach 67C, but also had more cooking loss and a more well-done appearance. These results were most likely influenced by the higher cooking temperature around steaks subjected to broiler-grilling compared to grilling, regardless of temperature setting. Steaks cooked by grilling were more tender by both sensory and shear force measurements compared to steaks cooked by broiler-grilling. Grilling produced higher juiciness scores than broiler-grilling, but only at the 232C setting. However, temperature control settings did not influence cooking loss and degree of doneness. Higher sensory ratings for tenderness were found for Small minus steaks compared to Slight minus steaks. While both systems of cooking appear suitable for producing acceptable eating quality in steaks of low marbling, the grilling method seems preferable. Grilling, probably because of its slower cooking time, provides advantages in tenderness, juiciness and cooking yield with perhaps a more uniform and consistent cooking rate. 3abeef 3abroiling 3agrilling 3atemperature 3abody fat 3asensory properties1 aBigner, M.E.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1995 Feb., v. 8, no. 2 p.65-74x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle00959naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245013200136300001600268520012500284650002200409650002100431650002000452650002700472650001600499700001700515773007600532852000900608939003300617945000800650946001100658655001200669991614762490742620221117181851.0830309e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830022712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKierszenbaum, F.10aTrypanosoma cruzi: Deficient lymphocyte activity during experimental acute Chagas' disease in the absence of suppressor T cells  ap. 441-451.  aTrypanosoma cruzi, mice, deficient lymphocyte reactivity during acute period of disease in absence of suppressor T cells 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmune response 3acell-mediated immunity 3alymphocytes1 aBudzko, D.B.0 tParasite immunology.g1982 Nov., v. 4, no. 6 p.441-451x0141-98387nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830309c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01814naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001400133245014600147300001600293500001500309520047700324650002600801650001300827650002100840650002000861650001200881650002700893650002500920650003000945650001300975650003100988650002601019650003201045650003901077650003801116650001201154653001301166700001501179700002501194773007601219852000901295939003301304945000801337946001101345655001201356991614761330742620221117163216.0830309e198211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830022692DNAL7 a61859082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGysin, J.10aProtective antibodies against erythrocytic stages of Plasmodium falciparum in experimental infection of the squirrel monkey, Saimiri sciureus  ap. 421-430.  a2019-12-04  aPlasmodium falciparum pretection against infection by transfer of serum, ascitic fluid, or purified immunoglobulins from Saimiri sciureus after spontaneous or drug-induced cure, protective antibodies against erythrocytic stages could never be demonstrated during acute stage of infection in spite of high titers of malarial antibodies, comparative immunochemical analysis of antigens recognized by protective and non-protective antibodies revealed quantitative differences 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantigens 3apassive immunity 3aimmunoglobulins 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesximmunology 2aAntigensximmunology 2aAscitic Fluidximmunology 2aEpitopes 2aErythrocytesxparasitology 2aImmunization, Passive 2aImmunoglobulinsximmunology 2aMalariaximmunologyxparasitology. 2aPlasmodium falciparumximmunology 2aSaimiri 0aimmunity1 aDubois, P.1 aPereira da Silva, L.0 tParasite immunology.g1982 Nov., v. 4, no. 6 p.421-430x0141-98387nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830309c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle00692naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245006000136300001600196520006000212650002100272650002000293773007600313852000900389939003300398945000800431946001100439655001200450991614760370742620221123041349.0830309e198207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830022572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlayfair, J.H.L.10aWorkshop report: Suppressor cells in infectious disease  ap. 299-304.  asuppressor cells in infectious disease, workshop report 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmune response0 tParasite immunology.g1982 July, v. 4, no. 4 p.299-304x0141-98387nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830309c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03198naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100002900215245009200244300001400336520111700350650004301467650001301510650001201523650001001535650001901545650002001564650002601584650002401610650002701634650001901661650001701680650002501697650001201722650003601734650005401770650003101824650005001855650001301905650003301918650004201951650003301993650004702026650003602073650005502109650002402164700001602188700001602204700002102220700001402241700001802255773011002273852000902383856008502392930003302477945002502510946001302535655001202548IND4365047720221123041430.0041018e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436504772DNAL7 a147148682pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.1.552doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMartinez de Ilarduya, O.10aRme1 is necessary for Mi-1-mediated resistance and acts early in the resistance pathway  ap. 55-61.  aThe tomato gene Mi-1 confers resistance to root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.), potato aphid, and whitefly. Using genetic screens, we have isolated a mutant, rmel (resistance to Meloidogyne spp.), compromised in resistance to M. javanica and potato aphid. Here, we show that the rme1 mutant is also compromised in resistance to M. incognita, M. arenaria, and whitefly. In addition, using an Agrobacterium-mediated transient assay in leaves to express constitutive gain-of-function mutant Pto(L205D), we demonstrated that the rme1 mutation is not compromised in Pto-mediated hypersensitive response. Moreover, the mutation in rme1 does not result in increased virulence of pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae or Mi-1-virulent M. incognita. Using a chimeric Mi-1 construct, Mi-DS4, which confers constitutive cell death phenotype and A. rhizogenes root transformation, we showed that the Mi-1-mediated cell death pathway is intact in this mutant. Our results indicate that Rme1 is required for Mi-1-mediated resistance and acts either at the same step in the signal transduction pathway as Mi-1 or upstream of Mi-1. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3amutants 3agenes 3aplant proteins 3apest resistance 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aroot-knot nematodes 3aMacrosiphum euphorbiae 3aBemisia tabaci 3ainsect pests 3aMeloidogyne arenaria 2aAnimals 2aHemipteraxgrowth & development 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSignal Transductionxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSolanum tuberosumxparasitology 2aTylenchoideaxgeneticsxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aVirulencexgenetics1 aNombela, G.1 aHwang, C.F.1 aWilliamson, V.M.1 aMuniz, M.1 aKaloshian, I.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2004 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.55-61wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.1.553Available from publisher's Web site  a20050804b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/04/06  aOther US 7aarticle02607naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001200152245010600164300001600270520140100286650002001687650002301707650002301730650002201753650002601775650001101801650001201812650001201824650002001836650001301856651001901869653001601888700001201904700001601916700001901932773007601951852000902027856009202036930003302128945001302161946001102174655001202185IND2331038320221123041438.0030226e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233103832DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00667.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, D.10aTemporal changes in spatial patterns of soil moisture following disturbance: an experimental approach  ap. 338-347.  a1. We quantified changes in spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture over 2.5 years in a Pinus elliottii Engelm, forest, following disturbance and succession. We harvested or girdled upper canopy trees and measured three components of heterogeneity - global (non-spatial) variability, spatial dependence and temporal persistence - in replicate plots, using sample points arrayed at a fine scale (0.5-6 m) nested within a coarser scale (5-60 m). 2. Global variability increased after disturbance and then declined, eventually returning to the level recorded in an undisturbed plot. Harvesting resulted in greater, more rapid and more prolonged changes in global variability than girdling. 3. Geostatistical parameters for measuring spatial dependence were largely unaffected by disturbance. Spatial dependence was, however, quite variable across replicate plots and was stronger at the finer sampling scale. 4. Spearman rank correlations showed that the spatial pattern of soil moisture had greater long-term persistence in the undisturbed and girdled plots than in the harvested plots. 5. Some elements of spatial heterogeneity appear to vary over time in a predictable manner. Detection of temporal trends may be improved if multiple components of heterogeneity are quantified, more than one scale of observation is used, replicate plots are employed and sole reliance on geostatistics is avoided. 3aPinus elliottii 3atemporal variation 3asoil water content 3aspatial variation 3aecological succession 3acanopy 3aforests 3alogging 3adisturbed soils 3agirdling 3aSouth Carolina 0apersistence1 aMou, P.1 aJones, R.H.1 aMitchell, R.J.0 tJournal of ecology.g2002 Apr., v. 90, no. 2 p.338-347x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00667.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01745naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245013600131300001600267500002400283520080600307650001101113650000801124650001301132650001901145650002001164650001901184650000901203650001401212650001201226650004701238650002301285700002201308773006801330852000901398655001201407IND4459449020221123031029.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445944902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChavez, Dario J.10aIdentification of Markers Linked to Seedlessness in Citrus kinokuni hort. ex Tanaka and Its Progeny Using Bulked Segregant Analysis  ap. 693-697.  aIncludes references  aCitrus kinokuni ‘Mukaku kishu’ PI539530 and its progeny were studied to identify random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers associated with seedlessness. Ninety-one F1 [(Robinson op) x C. kinokuni] individuals showed a 1:1 segregation ratio between seedless and seeded phenotypes with seedless as a single dominant gene. Bulked segregant analysis was used to identify markers associated with the seedless locus. Eighteen RAPD primers were mapped into a partial linkage group (55.8 cM length) with four RAPD primers flanking the seedless locus: OPAI11-0.8 at 8.7 cM, OPAJ19-1.0 at 8.4 cM, OPM06r-0.85 at 4.3 cM, and OPAJ04r-0.6 at 6.4 cM.

Workshops were conducted in seven locations throughout Nebraska. Workshop topics included Catering Business Basics, Insurance for Your Business, Pricing for Profit, Menu Planning Perspectives, Catering Safety Issues, and Marketing Your Catering Business. A notebook which detailed information on each topic presented (202 RLH, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583-0808) was developed for the participants. Of the 170 participants attending the workshops, three-fourths were between the ages of 31-55, all had a high school education or greater and two-thirds came from communities with a population less than 10,000. A pretest given to participants indicated that pricing was an area where they had limited information. Many did not know how much to request as a deposit. In the nutrition area, foods containing cholesterol continue to confuse participants. They were unfamiliar with the food handling practices associated with foodborne illnesses, i.e. Staphylococcus. Participants plan to make numerous changes after attending the workshop as indicated in the end-of-meeting evaluations. These changes include: preplanning business practices (contracts, record keeping, budgeting, costing, pricing); improve food handling and sanitation practices; reevaluate insurance needs; develop set menus; and improve advertising. Three months following the workshop, 63 % percent of the participants were contacted by telephone. Of those in business, 59% maintained their business at its present size, 36% increased the size of their business and 5% plan to decrease their business size. Changes that participants made include: developed or revised their business plan (improved record keeping, improved budgeting practices, implemented a contract); changed their pricing practices (implemented pricing strategies); changed food handling practices (used sanitizers, increased awareness of handling foods properly, use thermometers); and reexamined menu offerings (developed a standard menu or changed menu to include more variety, healthy items or simplified their menu offerings). 3afood service 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic analysis 3anutrition education 3aNebraska 0aworkshops (programs)1 aHamouz, F.L.1 aSchnepf, M.I.1 aThayer, C.E.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1995 Feb., v. 8, no. 2 p.125-137x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19950905b19950912c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle01641naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002900133245012800162300001600290520021500306650002400521650001500545650001300560650002000573650002800593650003200621650001200653650002800665650001800693650003000711650000900741650003000750650003100780650002000811650003300831650002400864650002200888650002700910653004700937700001900984700001901003773007601022852000901098939003301107945000801140946001101148655001201159991614758790742620221123030906.0830309e198207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830022522DNAL7 a68119992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlaver-Wesseling, J.C.M.14aThe in-vitro interaction between several components of the canine immune system and infective larvae of Ancylostoma caninum  ap. 227-232.  aAncylostoma caninum, relation between adherence of complement (C3), specific IgG antibodies, and peripheral blood leucocytes to surface of infective larvae, fixation of complement occurs via alternative pathway 3aAncylostoma caninum 3acomplement 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulins 2aAncylostomaximmunology 2aAncylostomiasisximmunology 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites, Antibody 2aCell Adhesion 2aComplement C3ximmunology 2aDogs 2aEdetic Acidxpharmacology 2aEgtazic Acidxpharmacology 2aHot Temperature 2aImmunoglobulin Gximmunology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLarvaximmunology 2aLeukocytesximmunology 0aImmunity, Antibody dependent cell mediated1 aVetter, J.C.M.1 aSchoeman, E.N.0 tParasite immunology.g1982 July, v. 4, no. 4 p.227-232x0141-98387nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830309c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle01926naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011100128300001600239500001500255520102600270650002201296650002301318650003001341651001301371653002501384653003201409700001601441773008701457852000901544930003301553945001301586946001301599655001201612IND2048218020221123015800.0951012e199505  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204821802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManning, C.K.10aLabor productivity in nutrition programs for the elderly that use a commissary-satellite production system  ap. 187-200.  a2019-12-05  aUsing a group timing instrument, labor minutes per meal were determined for a commissary-satellite production system in an elderly nutrition program in Dover, Delaware. Paid and volunteer staff contributions were studied in both congregate (CM) and home delivered meal (HDM) service for the central kitchen and four satellite units. Highest productivity was achieved in the satellite unit with the most congregate meals. High HDM productivity was found in those units with a single driver or a full time position of coordinator for home delivered meals. Significant differences among the satellites were found in service activities for CM and HDM and for both paid and volunteer labor. Volunteers provided between 23% and 56% of total time used for CM and between 16% and 52% of total time used in HDM. In the central kitchen, volunteer labor comprised only 3% of total labor time per meal. Variations among satellite units of a commissary-satellite production system represent opportunities to increase labor efficiency. 3aelderly nutrition 3alabor productivity 3acommunity feeding centers 3aDelaware 0ahome delivered meals 0afood and nutrition programs1 aLieux, E.M.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1995 May, v. 8, no. 3 p.187-200x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle02449naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245011200134300001600246520155200262650002001814650000901834650002201843650001701865650001601882650001601898650001701914700001901931700001801950773008701968852000902055930003302064945001302097946001302110655001202123IND2048218220221123015710.0951012e199505  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204821822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOllinger-Snyder, P.10aMicrobiological evaluation of ground pork prepared and stored using the sous vide method of food processing  ap. 213-228.  aThe sous vide method of food processing involves placing raw or partially cooked products in a pouch, removing the air, sealing, cooking and then chilling the product for an extended time. This method provides an ideal environment for growth of some pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this study was to determine the microbiological quality of a ground pork product using the sous vide method of processing. Patties prepared with and without soy hulls were cooked at 62 or 76C and stored chilled for 0, 1, 2 and 3 weeks. Samples were monitored for Listeria spp. with aerobic plate counts (APCs) and coliform counts also being determined. Moisture, pH and fat content of ground pork were measured. For the raw product, no statistically significant difference was found for coliforms, APCs or pH for the 12 trials of the experiment. Listeria spp. were not isolated from the raw product. Statistically significant differences were only found for fat and moisture. No coliforms were found in cooked patties or in cooked patties stored over the 3-week period. However, statistically significant differences were noted for APCs. Over the 3-week storage period, pork patties prepared with and without soy hulls and cooked at the higher temperature had lower APCs than patties cooked at the lower temperature. Pork patties cooked at the lower temperature had unacceptable levels of APCs for all weeks of chilled storage. Sous vide products made under carefully controlled conditions can be of good microbiological quality, even when stored up to 3 weeks. 3afood processing 3apork 3afood microbiology 3acold storage 3aplate count 3atemperature 3afood quality1 aMatthews, M.E.1 aUnklesbay, N.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1995 May, v. 8, no. 3 p.213-228x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle02357naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245010300171300001600274520115900290650001301449650001501462650002601477650001901503650001901522650001501541650002601556650001601582650001101598650001701609650002301626651001601649653000901665653001301674700001401687773007601701852000901777856009201786930003301878945001301911946001101924655001201935IND2331038820221122184702.0030226e200204  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233103882DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00661.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKooijman, A.M.14aThe higher availability of N and P in lime-poor than in lime-rich coastal dunes in the Netherlands  ap. 394-403.  a1. Measurements of above-ground productivity, plant nutrient levels, in situ mineralization and litter decomposition in four localities differing in soil chemical conditions were used to assess the availability of N and P in Dutch coastal dune grasslands. 2. P-availability is regulated by soil chemical conditions and seems to be a key factor regulating biomass production, whereas N-availability seems to be determined by litter input from this biomass, and thus indirectly controlled by P. 3. Contrary to expectation, N-availability is much higher in acid soils (with low rates of decomposition and high soil C:N ratios) than in calcareous soils (with high decomposition and low C:N ratios). Similar results have been reported from other ecosystems and may be due to a lower microbial N-demand at low rates of decomposition, increasing the amount of N left over for the vegetation. 4. In contrast to 'conventional wisdom', low-degradable litter may be a good plant strategy to improve the ecosystem recycling of nutrients and increase their availability. This may at least partly explain the success of Ammophila arenaria in lime- and iron-poor dunes. 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3anutrient availability 3asoil fertility 3amineralization 3aacid soils 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adegradation 3acoasts 3aplant litter 3abiomass production 3aNetherlands 0alime 0aduneland1 aBesse, M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2002 Apr., v. 90, no. 2 p.394-403x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2001.00661.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02425naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245006000166300001600226520135400242650000901596650001201605650002001617650000701637650001801644650002801662650002601690650001801716650002701734650001401761651001101775700001901786773007601805852000901881856009201890930003301982945001302015946001102028655001202039IND2331722420221122144026.0030401e200208  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233172242DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00701.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSjors, H.10aCalcium and pH in north and central Swedish mire waters  ap. 650-657.  a1. We present data on calcium concentrations and pH in mire waters collected from different mire types in central and northern Sweden, compiled from published literature or calculated from field determinations of electrical conductivity and pH. 2. Measurements of electrical conductivity (after subtracting that of H(+) ions) were used to calculate the most probable Ca concentrations, but only when pH was 4.7 or higher. At lower pH the possible errors become too large. 3. The data support a continuous gradient in water chemistry, but with considerable overlap, from mineral-poor ombrotrophic bogs and minerotrophic extremely poor fens, to moderately poor fens, intermediate fens, moderately rich fens and finally to extremely rich fens, rather than a discrete division. However, for hydrological reasons, we wish to retain the separation of ombrotrophy (bog) from minerotrophy (fen). 4. The frequency histogram of pH values from central and northern Sweden shows a bimodal tendency, although a considerable number of mires still occur close to the minimum (pH 5.3). Over-sampling in species-rich areas could have contributed to the depth of this apparent minimum, but not to its position along the pH scale. 5. Changes in calcium concentrations in mire waters during the last 50 years are discussed and related to changes in pH and conductivity. 3afens 3acalcium 3amineral content 3apH 3adata analysis 3aelectrical conductivity 3afield experimentation 3ahydrogen ions 3ageographical variation 3afrequency 3aSweden1 aGunnarsson, U.0 tJournal of ecology.g2002 Aug., v. 90, no. 4 p.650-657x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00701.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20030602b20030603c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02120naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011500130300001800245500016300263500002400426520079500450650002901245650002101274650002401295650001201319650001601331650002601347650001901373650001101392650004101403650001301444700001801457700001601475700001701491773014201508852000901650856008701659655001201746IND4459447120221122144013.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445944712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacIntyre, O.J.10aApplication of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in a hydroponics system for advanced life support in space  ap. 1285-1292.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on High Technology for Greenhouse Systems - GreenSys2009, Volume 2, held June 14-19, 2009, Quebec City, Canada.  aIncludes references  aThe advantages of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria in an Advanced Life Support system on the Moon or Mars may be limited by a low partial pressure of oxygen (pO2).

Inoculation with B. japonicum was deleterious to radish productivity (22% reduction in dry weight overall) and this was slightly exacerbated by low pO2. The microbial load of the hydroponics system was not affected by inoculation, though it was reduced by low pO2. Microbial abundance declined after the first 5 days of chamber closure with no further changes after the next 10 days.

Purge losses and pH were monitored over time (6, 10, 14, 18, 22 and 26 days), across temperature and in individual and multiple steak packages (strip loin, n = 4; tenderloin, n = 7; top sirloin, n = 10). Top sirloin steaks had the greatest purge loss (%) and strip loin steaks had the lowest purge loss (%) across all treatments. In general, purge losses (%) increased and pH decreased during storage of all three steak types; however, storage temperature did not influence (P > 0.10) purge loss. Total purge loss and purge loss as a percent of steak weight was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in multiple steak packages as compared to single steak packages. Correlations between the number of steaks in a package and purge losses were highly significant (P < 0.001) across all three steak types, within a steak type, the number of steaks in a package explained 59, 75 and 89% of the variation in total purge losses in strip loin, tenderloin, and top sirloin steaks, respectively. Across all steak types, total purge loss increased quadratically as package weight increased (R2 = 0.89) emphasizing a greater total purge loss per steak in the multiple steak packages than in the individual steak packages. These data suggest that package size (steak number) has a greater influence on the amount of purge in portion sized strip loin, tenderloin and top sirloin steaks than storage time or storage temperature. 3asteaks 3aportion size 3afood storage 3atemperature 3apackaging materials 3awater content 0aweight losses 0apackage weight1 aJohnson, L.P.1 aBernkopf, D.K.1 aWilliams, S.E.0 tJournal of food service systems.g1996, v. 9, no. 2 p.93-105x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01738naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011600128300001600244520104800260650001701308650002001325773008301345852000901428930003301437945001301470946001301483655001201496IND2151409520221122092039.0980813s1997    ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND215140952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoskowitz, H.10aConcept development and optimization for foodservice. 1.

These traditional methods involve the consumer as an evaluative device to pass judgment on the concepts so developed. This paper introduces the technology of IdeaMap to restaurant concept development. IdeaMap creates a large bank of elements which can fit different restaurant concepts. Through computer presentation of concepts a consumer reacts to experimental combinations of these elements. The consumer integrates the information in the concepts. Through dummy variable regression the researcher can identify "hot buttons" for new restaurant concepts, and then synthesize new and better restaurant concepts. The approach can be used with multi-media stimuli (including pictures, videos and sounds), to increase the realism of the evaluations. Finally, the approach generates a database which enables the developer to segment consumers on the basis of the pattern of their responses to the concept elements. 3afood service 3amarket analysis0 tJournal of food service systems.g1997, v. 9, no. 3 p.157-173x0196-42837nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02634naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245010000140300002000240500001500260520157500275650001801850650002401868650002501892650001701917650002701934650002101961651001701982653003001999653002902029700001702058773011702075852000902192930003302201945002502234946001302259655001202272IND4377498320221122070124.0060130e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437749832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSi, B.C.10aWavelet coherency analysis to relate saturated hydraulic properties to soil physical properties  ap. W11424 (9 p.  a2019-12-05  aA soil property may be related to another and the relationships may change depending on the scale and location. Understanding these scale- and location-dependent relationships is important for prediction of one soil property based on another. The objective of this study is to use wavelet coherency analysis to examine whether the relationship between hydraulic properties and soil physical properties are scale- and location-dependent. Undisturbed cores were collected along a transect from the sandy loam soil of a farm field in northern Saskatchewan, Canada. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K(s)), sand content, and organic carbon content (OC) were measured on these cores, and their relationships as a function of scale and location were analyzed using wavelets. Results indicated that the wavelet coherency between K(s) and sand content is only significantly different from that of red noises at the scales around 48 m. The cross-wavelet spectrum and wavelet coherency are predominantly in phase, suggesting a positive correlation between K(s) and sand. For K(s) and OC, significant coherency exists at scales from 30 to 48 and around 80 m. At the scales of 30-48 and around 80 m the relationships are predominantly out of phase, suggesting negative correlation. Therefore relationships between K(s) and sand or K(s) and OC are not only scale-dependent but also location-dependent. Scale and location dependence have an important implication for understanding the scaling relationships between K(s) and sand and OC and for the prediction of K(s) from sand and OC. 3asand fraction 3asoil organic carbon 3asaturated conditions 3awave physics 3ahydraulic conductivity 3asandy loam soils 3aSaskatchewan 0asoil hydraulic properties 0asoil physical properties1 aZeleke, T.B.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Nov., v. 41, no. 11 p.W11424 (9 p-W11424 (9 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle02256naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001300127245012300140300002000263500001500283520106100298650002201359650002301381650001601404650001401420650002101434650001701455650001601472650002701488650002201515650001501537653002401552653001801576653002501594653002301619700001301642773009901655852000901754930003301763945002501796946001301821655001201834IND4377499620221122052705.0060130e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437749962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W11503 (5 p.  a2019-12-05  aThis note presents approximate, closed form formulas for predicting groundwater velocity variances caused by unmodeled small-scale heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity. These formulas rely on a linearization of the groundwater flow equation but do not require the common statistical stationarity assumptions. The formulas are illustrated with a two-dimensional analysis of steady state flows in complex, multidimensional trending media and compared with a first-order numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulation. This comparison indicates that despite the simplifications, the closed form formulas capture the strongly nonstationary distributions of the velocity variances and match well with the first-order numerical model and the Monte Carlo simulation except in the immediate proximity of prescribed head boundaries and mean conductivity discontinuities. The complex trending examples illustrate that the closed form formulas have many of the capabilities of a full stochastic numerical model while retaining the convenience of analytical results. 3asimulation models 3aMonte Carlo method 3auncertainty 3aequations 3agroundwater flow 3aporous media 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 0amathematical models 0acomplex media 0astatistical analysis 0aheterogenous media1 aLi, S.G.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Nov., v. 41, no. 11 p.W11503 (5 p-W11503 (5 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle04279naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193100001800210245008200228300001800310520237400328650001602702650001002718650001402728650002202742650002102764650001202785650002202797650001802819650001502837650002602852650001402878650002602892650002202918650001902940650001602959650001202975650001302987650003403000650001103034650002403045650000903069650002303078650002003101650001103121650003003132650001403162650001903176650001203195650001703207650001203224651001203236653001603248700001603264700001903280773012203299852000903421856008003430930003303510945002503543946001303568655001203581IND4397179320221122052607.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439717932DNAL7 a176869002pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-5502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Model comparison  ap. 2861-2865.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the possible superiority of a threshold-linear (TL) approach for calving day (CD) and calving success (CS) analysis in beef cattle over 2 multiple-trait (MT), censored models, considering CD at the first 3 calving opportunities. The CD observations on animals that failed to calve in the latter models were defined as cows being assigned a penalty value of 21 d beyond the last observed CD record within contemporary group (PEN model) or censored CD values that were randomly obtained from a truncated normal distribution (CEN-model). In the TL model, CD records were treated as missing if a cow failed to calve, and parameters were estimated in a TL analysis including CS traits (TLMISS-model). The models included the effects of contemporary group (herd x year of calving x mating management), age at calving, physiological status at mating (lactating or nonlactating cow), animal additive genetic effects, and residual. Field data included 6,763 calving records obtained from first, second, and third parities of 3,442 spring-calving Uruguayan Aberdeen Angus cows. Models were contrasted using a data splitting technique, analyzing correlations between predicted breeding values (PBV) for each pair of subsamples, by rank correlations between PBV obtained with the different models, and by inspecting percentage of sires selected in common using the different approaches at 10 and 25% hypothetical percentages of animals selected. Breeding value correlations of CD between the subsamples for the TLMISS approach were greater (0.67 to 0.68) than correlations for the censored MT models (0.49 to 0.54). Average correlations between PBV of CD in 1 subsample obtained by CEN (PEN, TLMISS) and PBV of CS in the other subsample were -0.53 (-0.55, -0.60) in the first calving opportunity (CO), -0.54 (-0.58, -0.63) in the second CO, and -0.50 (-0.49, -0.58) in the third CO. Rank correlations between PBV for CD in PEN and CEN were high (0.93 to 0.97), but correlations of either method with PBV of CD in TLMISS ranged from 0.50 to 0.71. Common identification of bulls for the top 10% of sires (25% of sires), when selected with PEN/CEN models or the TLMISS model, varied between 50 (44%) and 60 (52%). The use of the TL animal model for genetic evaluation seems attractive for genetic evaluation of fertility traits in beef cattle. 3abeef cattle 3aAngus 3afecundity 3asimulation models 3amodel validation 3acalving 3apregnancy outcome 3adata analysis 3aanimal age 3aenvironmental factors 3alactation 3aadditive gene effects 3agenetic variation 3abreeding value 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Genetic 2aParity 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 2aWeaning 3aUruguay 0acalving day1 aMisztal, I.1 aBertrand, J.K.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Nov., v. 85, no. 11 p.2861-2865dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-5503Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/15  aOther US 7aarticle03023naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245010900179300002000288500001500308520168300323650002902006650003002035650002002065650002002085650002402105650001802129650002202147650001502169650002902184651001302213653001802226653001602244653002902260700001802289700001502307700001902322700001602341773011602357852000902473930003302482945002502515946001302540655001202553IND4377300120221122041249.0060119e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437730012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMichael, W.J.10aIntegrating data sources to improve hydraulic head predictions: a hierarchical machine learning approach  ap. W03020 (14p.  a2019-12-05  aThis study investigates how machine learning methods can be used to improve hydraulic head predictions by integrating different types of data, including data from numerical models, in a hierarchical approach. A suite of four machine learning methods (decision trees, instance-based weighting, inverse distance weighting, and neural networks) are tested in several hierarchical configurations with different types of data from the 317/319 area at Argonne National Laboratory-East. The best machine learning model had a mean predicted head error 50% smaller than an existing MODFLOW numerical flow model, and a standard deviation of predicted head error 67% lower than the MODFLOW model, computed across all sampled locations used for calibrating the MODFLOW model. These predictions were obtained using decision trees trained with all historical quarterly data; the hourly head measurements were not as useful for prediction, most likely because of their poor spatial coverage. The results show promise for using hierarchical machine learning approaches to improve predictions and to identify the most essential types of data to guide future sampling efforts. Decision trees were also combined with an existing MODFLOW model to test their capabilities for updating numerical models to improve predictions as new data are collected. The combined model had a mean error 50% lower than the MODFLOW model alone. These results demonstrate that hierarchical machine learning approaches can be used to improve predictive performance of existing numerical models in areas with good data coverage. Further research is needed to compare this approach with methods such as Kalman filtering. 3adecision support systems 3agroundwater contamination 3afluid mechanics 3aneural networks 3asurface water level 3adata analysis 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aIllinois 0aMODFLOW model 0amethodology 0amachine learning methods1 aMinsker, B.S.1 aTcheng, D.1 aValocchi, A.J.1 aQuinn, J.J.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.W03020 (14p-W03020 (14pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle02877naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245010900177300002000286520181800306650002102124650001502145650002402160650002402184650002302208650002202231650001902253650002902272700001802301773011602319852000902435930003302444945002502477946001302502655001202515IND4377299020221122032126.0060119e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437729902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W03010 (17p.  aPhysically based models are increasingly applied to analyze contaminant transport in soil by preferential water flow. Unfortunately, in the past, preferential flow models were rarely evaluated using appropriate experimental data because of the complexity of conceptual models and limitations of measuring techniques. In this study, we designed a novel soil column experiment with advanced measurement techniques that enabled us to discriminate macropore and matrix water flow and quantify interdomain (macropore-matrix) water transfer. Experiments of drainage and upward and downward infiltration revealed hydraulic nonequilibrium between matrix and macropore domains. Cumulative interdomain water transfer could be estimated using mass balance calculations. In a hierarchical modeling approach, four numerical models of different complexity were compared to the column experiment data. As a reference model, pseudo three-dimensional axisymmetric Richards' equation (ARE) was used for inverse estimation of domain-specific hydraulic parameters. The parameters were subsequently used for performance evaluation of an equivalent continuum model with bimodal hydraulic functions (ECM) and two dual-permeability models with first-order (DPM1) and second-order (DPM2) terms for water transfer between macropore and matrix. Overall, DPM2 gave slightly more accurate domain-specific results of water flow, water contents, and pressure heads than DPM1. Although bulk soil water flow results for the ECM were least accurate, they were considered to be within acceptable range. Compared to the more comprehensive ARE approach, DPMs were found to be almost equally capable of simulating interdomain and intradomain water flow and could be considered more versatile as they allow for a variety of macropore-matrix geometries. 3aequipment design 3awater flow 3asoil water movement 3amathematical models 3aRichards' equation 3ahydrologic models 3adrainage water 3ainfiltration (hydrology)1 aMohanty, B.P.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Mar., v. 41, no. 3 p.W03010 (17p-W03010 (17pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080327b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/08/17  aOther US 7aarticle04426naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100002000211245010100231300001800332500001500350520198500365650001402350650001702364650001802381650003002399650001702429650001502446650001402461650001002475650001802485650002302503650001802526650000902544650001102553650001402564650000902578650001902587650002002606650002102626650002602647650001602673650004702689650001202736650004202748650002302790650004002813650005602853650001402909650004802923650003602971650002403007650001103031650001703042650004903059650003303108650004003141650005903181650002203240653002803262653001903290700002003309700002003329773012203349852000903471856008103480930003303561945002503594946001303619655001203632IND4397184920221121232718.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439718492DNAL7 a176868932pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2007-00802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using a 6 x 6 Latin square design, 6 diets were evaluated that contained either no supplemental fiber, beet pulp, cellulose, or blends of cellulose, fructooligosaccharides, and yeast cell wall added at 2.5% of the diet. Six ileal-cannulated dogs were fed 175 g of their assigned diet twice daily. Chromic oxide served as a digestibility marker. Nutrient digestibility, fecal microbial populations, fermentative end products, and immunological indices were measured. Total tract DM and OM digestibilities were lowest (P < 0.05) for the cellulose treatment. Crude protein digestibility was lower (P < 0.05) for the treatments containing carbohydrate blends. The cellulose treatment had the lowest (P < 0.05) concentration of bacteria, and all diets containing fermentable fiber had greater (P < 0.05) fecal bifidobacteria concentrations compared with the diets without supplemental fermentable fiber. Lactobacilli concentrations tended to be greater (P < 0.08) in treatments containing fermentable fiber compared with the cellulose treatment. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli concentrations were similar for the beet pulp treatment compared with the fermentable oligosaccharide blends. Total fecal short-chain fatty acid concentration was greater for the beet pulp treatment (P < 0.05) compared with the control and cellulose treatments. The treatments containing fermentable fiber had greater (P < 0.05) fecal butyrate concentrations compared with cellulose and control treatments. Immune indices were not affected by treatment. Our results suggest that dog foods containing blends of fermentable and nonfermentable carbohydrates produce similar physiological results as dog food containing beet pulp as a fiber source. Therefore, blends of these carbohydrates could be useful substitutes for beet pulp in dog foods. 3abeet pulp 3abutyric acid 3adigestibility 3aintestinal microorganisms 3afermentation 3acell walls 3acellulose 3afeces 3acrude protein 3adigestible protein 3adietary fiber 3adogs 3ayeasts 3apet foods 3apets 3aanimal feeding 3aimmune response 3aoligosaccharides 3anutrient availability 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBifidobacteriumxgrowth & development 2aChromium Compounds 2aColony Count, Microbialxveterinary 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aDogsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysis 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aIleumximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aImmunoglobulin Aximmunology 2aLactobacillusxgrowth & development 2aOligosaccharidesxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aRandom Allocation 0ashort chain fatty acids 0amicroorganisms1 aFastinger, N.D.1 aFahey, G.C.

W11404 (17 p.  a2019-12-05  aEstimating transpiration and water flow in trees remains a major challenge for quantifying water exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere. We develop a finite element tree crown hydrodynamics (FETCH) model that uses porous media equations for water flow in an explicit three-dimensional branching fractal tree-crown system. It also incorporates a first-order canopy-air turbulence closure model to generate the external forcing of the system. We use FETCH to conduct sensitivity analysis of transpirational dynamics to changes in canopy structure via two scaling parameters for branch thickness and conductance. We compare our results with the equivalent parameters of the commonly used resistor and resistor-capacitor representations of tree hydraulics. We show that the apparent temporal and vertical variability in these parameters strongly depends on structure. We suggest that following empirical calibration and validation, FETCH could be used as a platform for calibrating the "scaling laws" between tree structure and hydrodynamics and for surface parameterization in meteorological and hydrological models. 3aatmospheric circulation 3aturbulent flow 3acanopy 3atree crown 3afinite element analysis 3agas exchange 3aequations 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater flow 3aporous media 3abranches 3awater vapor 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 0aplant-water relations 0afinite element tree crown hydrodynamics model1 aMourad, H.1 aLaursen, T.A.1 aDrewry, D.1 aAvissar, R.1 aPoggi, D.1 aOren, R.1 aKatul, G.G.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Nov., v. 41, no. 11 p.W11404 (17 p-W11404 (17 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle04487naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100002000211245018900231300001800420500001500438520177700453650002102230650002202251650001802273650001102291650001802302650001502320650001702335650001002352650002102362650002102383650001002404650000902414650001102423650002102434650003002455650001602485650001402501650000902515650001902524650002002543650001402563650002602577650001102603650001602614650004702630650001202677650003202689650001402721650002402735650004102759650004802800650003702848650002802885650004302913650002402956650001102980650001702991650004903008650003303057650004003090650003203130650002203162650002203184653001803206653001503224653001903239700001603258700002003274700002003294773012203314852000903436856008103445930003303526945002503559946001303584655001203597IND4397184620221121225736.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439718462DNAL7 a176447892pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2007-00792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Using a 5 x 5 Latin square design with 14-d periods, adult dogs cannulated in the terminal ileum were supplemented with 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.45, or 0.65% YCW based on daily food allowance. Apparent ileal nutrient digestibility responded cubically (P = 0.07 to 0.10) to YCW supplementation. Ileal nutrient digestibility tended (P = 0.09) to be greater with YCW supplementation compared with control. Apparent total tract digestibility responded cubically (P < 0.05) to YCW supplementation. Total white blood cell and eosinophil counts tended (P < 0.09) to decrease quadratically with YCW supplementation, with the lowest counts at the 0.25% supplementation level, whereas monocyte counts decreased (P < 0.05) linearly with YCW supplementation. Serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentrations tended (P = 0.09) to respond cubically to YCW, with the lowest value at the 0.25% supplementation level. Ileal IgA tended (P < 0.09) to respond quadratically, with the greatest ileal IgA concentration at 0.25% YCW. Using serial dilution and plating enumeration techniques, fecal Escherichia coli concentrations decreased linearly (P = 0.01) with YCW supplementation, whereas Clostridium perfringens responded cubically (P = 0.09). Cubic trends were noted for E. coli (P = 0.10) and lactobacilli (P = 0.08) concentrations, as evaluated by quantitative PCR analysis. Total fecal DNA was most similar to the control treatment at 0.25% YCW. Although the effects on immunological indices appear limited, our results suggest that YCW supplementation in dogs at less than 1% may affect ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility, and the colonization of the gut by E. coli may be decreased. 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aintestinal mucosa 3adigestibility 3aadults 3adose response 3acell walls 3aspray drying 3afeces 3afeed supplements 3aEscherichia coli 3aileum 3adogs 3ayeasts 3amucosal immunity 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aeosinophils 3apet foods 3apets 3aanimal feeding 3aimmune response 3amonocytes 3anutrient availability 3adosage 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCatheterizationxveterinary 2aCell Wall 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDogsximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEosinophilsximmunology 2aEscherichia colixgrowth & development 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aIleumximmunologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aImmunoglobulin Aximmunology 2aLactobacillusxgrowth & development 2aLeukocyte Countxveterinary 2aRandom Allocation 2aYeastsxchemistry 0aadult animals 0aleukocytes 0amicroorganisms1 aGodoy, M.R.1 aFastinger, N.D.1 aFahey, G.C.

W04009 (5p.  a2019-12-05  aThe selection of the correct model for describing contaminant transport in fractured media remains a challenging problem in subsurface hydrology. In this work, the experimental data corresponding to nonsorbing tracer runs in natural fissures of Moreno et al. (1985) are analyzed. The advection dispersion equation (ADE) model yields a poor fit in the late time regions of the experimental breakthrough curves denoting the existence of "anomalous" or "non-Fickian" transport. Continuous time random walks (CTRW) are proposed for describing this kind of transport using two of the most studied forms for the transition rate probability: the asymptotic and truncated power law models. The CTRW approach produces better fits to the experimental data than the ADE model. In all the simulations a moderately dispersive transport was found which is interpreted as being as a result of the effects of the small- and intermediate-scale heterogeneities. 3asampling 3asimulation models 3aequations 3apollutants 3apollution 3amass transfer 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models1 aGiraldez, J.V.1 aLaguna, A.1 aPachepsky, Y.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Apr., v. 41, no. 4 p.W04009 (5p-W04009 (5pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02525naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245007900142300002000221520153600241650002701777650002101804650002001825650002201845650002301867650002201890650001101912650002201923700001801945700001601963773011601979852000902095930003302104945002502137946001302162655001202175IND4377291520221121172348.0060118e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437729152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWood, T.R.10aInfluence of fracture intersections under unsaturated, low-flow conditions  ap. W04017 (17p.  aRecent experimental evidence suggests that the capillary heterogeneity associated with fracture intersections can act to impose temporal and spatial structure on network-scale flows. A simple intersection between orthogonal fractures, one horizontal and the other vertical, has been shown to integrate unsaturated flows. At low flows the intersection forms a capillary barrier that accumulates water in a growing pool. Eventually, the retaining meniscus snaps, discharging a pulse of water. Here we develop a mechanistic explanation for this observed behavior and experimentally consider three perturbations to the geometry of the simple orthogonal intersection. Two of the perturbations also act as capillary barriers, while the third formed a capillary bridge across the intersection. At low flow, all of our experimental intersections imposed a temporal signal, with the nature of that signal dependent on intersection geometry and participation by the horizontal fractures in dynamic storage. At high flow a continuous fluid tendril spanned the system from inlet to outlet with water pooled above the intersection caused by a narrow fluid connection that restricted flow across the intersection. Results from all experiments suggest that pulsation is critically sensitive to small variations in the geometry of fracture intersections and storage in the horizontal fractures. When combined with dependency on supply rate, this sensitivity can generate pulsation of flow across a wide range of time periods and discharge volumes. 3aunsaturated conditions 3agroundwater flow 3afluid mechanics 3aoptical equipment 3amechanistic models 3ahydrologic models 3aoptics 3asimulation models1 aNicholl, M.J.1 aGlass, R.J.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Apr., v. 41, no. 4 p.W04017 (17p-W04017 (17pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080417b20080502c00000000  aINDdYLPe2007/08/21  aOther US 7aarticle01131naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245009000139300001600229500001500245520019000260650003100450650001300481653002200494653002200516653001800538653003400556653002700590653001000617700002200627773008100649852000900730939003300739945000800772946001300780655001200793991614743700742620221121104311.0830308e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830022822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArroyo-Begovich, A.10aLocation of chitin in the cyst wall of Entamoeba invadens with colloidal gold tracers  ap. 253-258.  a2019-12-04  aEntamoeba invadens, utilization of colloidal gold technique for staining cysts for optical microscopy as well as for locating chitin or its oligomers in cyst wall by electron microscopy 3aanimal parasites and pests 3aProtozoa 0aParasite surfaces 0aTechnique, Stains 0aanimal health 0aEntamoeba invadens (Protozoa) 0aBiochemistry, Protozoa 0acysts1 aCarabez-Trejo, A.0 tJournal of parasitology.g1982 Apr., v. 68, no. 2 p.253-258x0022-33957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830308c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01342naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002100133245011100154300001600265520013100281650002400412650001200436650005600448650001100504650001200515650002500527650003400552650001300586650003100599650003600630650004400666653001800710653002100728653002200749700001700771773008100788852000900869939003300878945000800911946001300919655001200932991614743540742620221121104236.0830308e198204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830022812DNAL7 a68046142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwartz, C.F.W.10aEffect of Schistosoma mansoni on glycogen synthase and phosphorylase from Biomphalaria glabrata (Mollusca)  ap. 236-242.  aSchistosoma mansoni-infected Biomphalaria glabrata, properties of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase from cephalopedal region 3aSchistosoma mansoni 2aAnimals 2aBiomphalariaxenzymologyxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aEating 2aFasting 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aGlycogen Synthasexmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aPhosphorylasesxmetabolism 2aSchistosoma mansonixphysiology 2aUridine Diphosphate Glucosexmetabolism 0aEnzymes, Host 0aMetabolism, Host 0aVectors, Mollusca1 aCarter, C.E.0 tJournal of parasitology.g1982 Apr., v. 68, no. 2 p.236-242x0022-33957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830308c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02423naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245006000159300002100219520148500240650001101725650001501736650002201751650002401773650001401797650001501811650002101826651001001847700001801857773011801875852000901993930003302002945002502035946001302060655001202073IND4381656320221121072724.0060703e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438165632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChetan, M.12aA hybrid linear-neural model for river flow forecasting  ap. W04402 (14 p.  aThis paper presents a novel hybrid linear-neural (LN) model formulation to effectively model rainfall-runoff processes. The central idea of the proposed model framework is that the hidden layer of an artificial neural network (ANN) model be designed with a combination of linear and nonlinear neurons. A training algorithm for the proposed model is designed based on minimum description length criteria. The advantage of the algorithm is that the final architecture of the LN model is arrived at during the training process, thus avoiding selection from a class of models. The proposed model has been developed and evaluated for its performance for forecasting the river flow of Kolar basin, in India. The values of three performance evaluation criteria, namely, the coefficient of efficiency, the root-mean-square error, and the coefficient of correlation, were found to be very good and consistent for flows forecasted 1 hour in advance by the LN model. The value of the relative error in peak flow prediction was within reasonable limits for the model. The forecasts by the LN model at higher lead times (up to 6 hours) are found to be good. A relative evaluation of LN model performance with that of an ANN model and of a multiple linear regression model indicates that the LN model effectively combines the strength of the other two, implying that the LN model seems to be well suited to exploit the information to model the nonlinear dynamics of the rainfall-runoff process. 3arivers 3aprediction 3ahydrologic models 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aalgorithms 3amodel validation 3aIndia1 aSudheer, K.P.0 tWater resources research.g2006 Apr., v. 42, no. 4 p.W04402 (14 p-W04402 (14 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20060814b20060906c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/08/14  aOther US 7aarticle01762naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002500115245008700140300001600227300003000243500001500273520077700288650001601065650002301081650001501104650001201119650001101131650002301142653001501165653001301180653002001193653001701213773008201230852001301312939003301325945000801358946001301366852000901379655001201388991614742290742620221121072757.0860318s1985    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860100282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoskowtiz, Howard R.10aMethods of organizing consumer based sensory panels for commercial product testing  ap. 181-198.  ap. 181-198. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aMethods for the economical development of a consumer-based test panels for the evaluation of flavor in commercial food products are considered.

W12407 (15 p.  a2019-12-05  aA method is herein proposed and demonstrated for the space-time optimization of monitoring networks for groundwater quality. The objective is to provide a minimum cost design algorithm that will assist in determining where and when to sample existing wells dedicated to defining, through periodic sampling, the behavior of groundwater contaminants. The method has three characteristics: (1) The combined spatial and temporal redundancy of the sampling network is considered by using a Kalman filter coupled with a stochastic transport model in which velocity and dispersion are spatially correlated random fields. (2) The sampling network is optimized using an enumerative method that minimizes a function of the estimate variance. (3) A real-time update of the estimate is obtained using again the Kalman filter. The synthetic examples presented show that for a contaminant plume in motion this method can obtain cost-effective sampling networks. 3atemporal variation 3asampling 3asimulation models 3awater quality 3agroundwater contamination 3aspatial variation 3acost effectiveness 3agroundwater 3awells 3aenvironmental monitoring 0aoptimization 0apollution1 aPinder, G.F.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Dec., v. 41, no. 12 p.W12407 (15 p-W12407 (15 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/28  aOther US 7aarticle02423naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015800129300001600287520130000303650002601603650002801629650001701657650002101674650001301695650002001708650002001728650001401748653001601762653001501778653002401793700001701817700001301834700001701847700001401864700001301878773008101891852000901972939003301981946001102014655001202025IND9304360320221121061527.0930723e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930436032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakagawara, S.10aEnhanced formation of a constitutive sesquiterpenoid in cultured cells of a liverwort, Calypogeia granulata inoue during elicitation; effects of vanadate  ap. 421-429.  aThe early cellular responses to elicitation by an abiotic elicitor, vanadate, in suspension-cultured cells of the liverwort Calypogeia granulata Inoue were investigated. The rate of production of 1,4-dimethylazulene, which is a constitutive sesquiterpenoid in intact plants and also in cultured cells of C. granulata, was more than double the control rate after treatment with vanadate. This increase was preceded by doubling of the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase increased to 1.5 to 2 times the control activities upon treatment with vanadate. Intracellular levels of glutathione (reduced form) increased to 10 times the control level within 24 h after addition of the elicitor. Furthermore, addition of hydrogen peroxide to the culture also enhanced the production of 1,4-dimethylazulene to the same extent as vanadate. We propose that treatment with the elicitor resulted in oxidative stress due to generation of active oxygen species which might act as messengers to activate the biosynthetic pathway to the formation of 1,4-dimethylazulene on the one hand, and to activation of a system for scavenging active oxygen species on the other. 3amosses and liverworts 3acell suspension culture 3abiosynthesis 3asesquiterpenoids 3avanadium 3aoxidoreductases 3aenzyme activity 3aBryopsida 0aderivatives 0aregulation 0a1,4-dimethylazulene1 aNakamura, N.1 aGGuo, Z.1 aSumitani, K.1 aKatoh, K.1 aOhta, Y.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1993 Apr., v. 34, no. 3 p.421-429x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01439naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245006200132300003000194500001500224520049700239650002900736650002000765651001100785651002000796653003400816653001800850653001700868655000900885773015600894852000901050939003301059945000801092946001301100655001201113991614741060742620221121061505.0880825s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880027912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBressani, R.10aSupplementary feeding and formulated foods--some comments  ap. 151-160. ill., charts.  a2019-12-06  aA conceptional report summarizes and discusses how dietary improvement can be achieved and how malnutrition can be prevented with supplementary feeding and formulated foods.

  1 aHaga, H.10aFlow paths, rainfall properties, and antecedent soil moisture controlling lags to peak discharge in a granitic unchanneled catchment  ap. W12410 (14 p.  aThe lag time between peak rainfall and peak discharge is an important index reflecting hydrological properties in a catchment. To characterize lag times, we studied the effects of rainfall properties, antecedent moisture conditions, and flow paths on runoff response in a forested unchanneled catchment, using a hydrometric and hydrochemical approach. Soil moisture, soil pore water pressure, and piezometric surface were monitored. Also, dissolved silica and organic carbon concentrations of spring water and subsurface water were observed. Runoff response was characterized by two types of lag times: a short lag time (<2 hours) or a long lag time (>24 hours). During events with short lag times, saturation excess overland flow was dominant, and the source area was limited to the near-spring area. During events with long lag times, saturated subsurface flow above the soil-bedrock interface was dominant, and the source area near the spring was connected to the upslope area via saturated zone above soil-bedrock interface. The spring-hillslope hydrological connection to generate peak discharges with long lag times occurred when the sum of cumulative rainfall and an antecedent soil moisture index, which was derived from initial storage of surface soil layer, was greater than 135 mm. Moreover, the time between the upslope connection of source area and subsequent peak discharge decreased with the average rainfall intensity in the time. We conclude that consideration of antecedent soil moisture conditions as well as rainfall amount and intensity is essential for understanding the regional characteristics of lag times and subsurface water movement. 3awatersheds 3astream flow 3arain 3asoil water content 3asoil pore water 3apiezometers 3asprings (water) 3agroundwater 3asilica 3adissolved organic carbon 3arunoff 3aoverland flow 3asaturated conditions 3arain intensity 3asubsurface flow 3aJapan 0alag times1 aMatsumoto, Y.1 aMatsutani, J.1 aFujita, M.1 aNishida, K.1 aSakamoto, Y.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Dec., v. 41, no. 12 p.W12410 (14 p-W12410 (14 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/28  aOther US 7aarticle02998naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002600161245009500187300002100282500001500303520177300318650002302091650001202114650002702126650001102153650001202164650001202176650002202188650001802210650002402228650002202252650001902274650001902293651001302312651001002325653001802335773011902353852000902472930003302481945002502514946001302539655001202552IND4379030120221121035646.0060324e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVicente-Serrano, S.M.13aEl Nino and La Nina influence on droughts at different timescales in the Iberian Peninsula  ap. W12415 (18 p.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper seeks to determine the impact of extreme phases of the Southern Oscillation (SO, El Nino/La Nina) on droughts in the Iberian Peninsula. For this purpose, 51 precipitation series (1910-2000) were used. A spatial classification based on monthly precipitation records was made to identify homogeneous regions and to analyze any spatial differences in the influence of these extreme phases. For each region a drought index was calculated (standardized precipitation index) at timescales of 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. El Nino and La Nina years were identified using the Southern Oscillation index (SOI), in line with studies conducted elsewhere. Mean values of the drought index were calculated each month for the four timescales during El Nino and La Nina years as well as for the year following these events. The statistical significance of any anomalies was evaluated by means of the nonparametric Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test. The results indicate that extreme phases of the SO significantly affect the occurrence of droughts in the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, spatial and temporal differences, depending on the timescale used, were identified. Large areas of the Iberian Peninsula are affected by significant negative values of SPI during the final months of La Nina years and the initial months of the following year. In contrast, other areas are affected by dry conditions during the first months of El Nino years as well as during the summers and autumns of the following year. The spatial differences in drought conditions during extreme phases of the SO are noticeable, and the drought signal is more consistent for La Nina than it is for El Nino years. Finally, the usefulness of these results for drought prediction and early warning systems is discussed. 3atemporal variation 3aEl Nino 3ageographical variation 3aoceans 3adrought 3aLa Nina 3awater temperature 3adata analysis 3aweather forecasting 3aspatial variation 3aclimate models 3aclimatic zones 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aprecipitation0 tWater resources research.g2005 Dec., v. 41, no. 12 p.W12415 (18 p-W12415 (18 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/28  aOther US 7aarticle03038naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001500161245011900176300002100295520157400316650001401890650002501904650002701929650002201956650002001978650002001998650002702018650002202045650002102067650001302088650001702101650001302118650002202131650001602153650002102169651001902190653002502209653002502234653001402259700001702273700001402290700001702304773011902321852000902440930003302449945002502482946001302507655001202520IND4379030320221121035626.0060324e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBinley, A.10aRelationship between spectral induced polarization and hydraulic properties of saturated and unsaturated sandstone  ap. W12417 (13 p.  aThere is growing interest in the use of geophysical methods for hydrological model parameterization. Empirical induced polarization (IP)-hydraulic conductivity (K) relationships have been developed, but these are only applicable to sediments in which the IP response shows limited variation with electrical current frequency. Here we examine the spectral IP response of samples taken from a UK sandstone aquifer and compare measured parameters with physical and hydraulic properties. We demonstrate the limited value of existing IP-K models due to the inherent IP frequency dependence of these samples. Our results show how the mean relaxation time, tau, is a more appropriate measure of IP response for these sediments. A significant inverse correlation between the surface area to pore volume ratio and tau is observed, suggesting that tau is a measure of a characteristic hydraulic length scale. This is supported by a measured strong positive correlation between log tau and log K. Our measurements also reveal evidence of a relationship between tau and a dominant pore throat size, which leads to postulations about the parallelism between the spectral IP behavior and unsaturated hydraulic characteristics. Additional experiments show how the relaxation time is affected by degree of fluid saturation, indicating that saturation levels must be accounted for if our empirical relationships are applied to vadose zone studies. Our results show clear evidence of the potential value of frequency-based IP measurements for parameterization of groundwater flow models. 3asandstone 3asaturated conditions 3aunsaturated conditions 3aspectral analysis 3apolarized light 3afluid mechanics 3ahydraulic conductivity 3asimulation models 3aelectric current 3aaquifers 3asurface area 3aporosity 3ahydrologic models 3avadose zone 3agroundwater flow 3aUnited Kingdom 0ahydraulic properties 0ainduced polarization 0apore size1 aSlater, L.D.1 aFukes, M.1 aCassiani, G.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Dec., v. 41, no. 12 p.W12417 (13 p-W12417 (13 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/28  aOther US 7aarticle03715naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100001900194245006500213300001400278500014200292500002400434500001500458520116400473650001201637650002701649650002101676650001601697650002801713650002001741650002801761650002201789650002201811650002301833650001401856650002201870650002701892650002501919650001001944650002301954650001701977650001801994650002202012650002502034650002002059650002502079650002202104650001202126650002502138650003402163650006102197650003002258650005602288650001502344650001002359650005802369651003102427651002902458651001102487651001802498653002102516653002802537653002302565700002102588700002902609773009302638852000902731856008802740930003302828945002502861946001102886655001202897IND4437333320221121025124.0100522e20100616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443733332DNAL7 a204445592pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL100 0aP0501 aHahn, Edwin C.10aVariation of Aujeszky's disease viruses in wild swine in USA  ap. 45-51.  aIn the special issue: 3rd Veterinary Symposium of the European Society for Veterinary Virology (ESVV) / edited by Thomas C.

Some re-emergence of infection occurred as vaccine use diminished. Sporadic outbreaks have also occurred because of the reservoir of infection in feral swine that have spread across the southern two-thirds of the country and Hawaii. In order to be able to understand the origins of re-emerging virus, sequence analysis of variable genes in pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been used to differentiate strains. Most PRV from feral swine can be distinguished from virus circulating in domestic pigs during the national epizootic. However, several feral swine isolates of PRV from south central states are closely related or identical in sequence to strains from domestic pigs. Extensive study by PCR for the presence of virus in the oral cavity of feral pigs disclosed that the viral DNA is distributed widely in tonsils salivary glands, taste buds and even mucosa in the vicinity of tusks. Clearly the virus in feral swine has multiple mechanisms of transmission to insure persistent infection and the threat of re-emergence in domestic swine continues. 3atonsils 3adigestive tract mucosa 3aAujeszky disease 3avaccination 3aSuid alphaherpesvirus 1 3arisk assessment 3aepidemiological studies 3asequence analysis 3adisease detection 3astrain differences 3abioassays 3adisease outbreaks 3amolecular epidemiology 3adisease surveillance 3aswine 3adisease reservoirs 3acircular DNA 3aferal animals 3aemerging diseases 3adisease transmission 3asalivary glands 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Viralxanalysis 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aHerpesvirus 1, Suidxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPseudorabiesxepidemiologyxtransmissionxvirology. 2aSus scrofa 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxtransmissionxvirology. 3aSoutheastern United States 3aMidwestern United States 3aHawaii 0aUnited States 0adomestic animals 0amolecular sequence data 0aSuid herpesvirus 11 aFadl-Alla, Bahaa1 aLichtensteiger, Carol A.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2010 June 16, v. 143, no. 1 p.45-51dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/07/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02323naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245010800159300002100267500001500288520117800303650001501481650002201496650002801518650001401546650000901560650001201569650001701581650001001598653002401608653002001632653002001652653002201672700002001694773011901714852000901833930003301842945002501875946001301900655001201913IND4377495620221121025015.0060130e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437749562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W11412 (15 p.  a2019-12-05  aA discrete fracture model for the flow of compressible, multicomponent fluids in homogeneous, heterogeneous, and fractured media is presented in single phase. In the numerical model we combine the mixed finite element (MFE) and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. We use the cross-flow equilibrium concept to approximate the fractured matrix mass transfer. The discrete fracture model is numerically superior to the single-porosity model and overcomes limitations of the dual-porosity models including the use of a shape factor. The MFE method provides a direct and accurate approximation for the velocity field, which is crucial for the convective terms in the flow equations. The DG method associated with a slope limiter is used to approximate the species balance equations. This method can capture the sharp moving fronts. The calculation of the fracture-fracture flux across three and higher intersecting fracture branches is a challenge. In this work, we provide an accurate approximation of these fluxes by using the MFE formulation. Numerical examples in unfractured and fractured media illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed numerical model. 3aestimation 3asimulation models 3afinite element analysis 3aequations 3aflow 3aliquids 3aporous media 3ashape 0amathematical models 0afractured media 0aGalerkin method 0aunfractured media1 aFiroozabadi, A.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Nov., v. 41, no. 11 p.W11412 (15 p-W11412 (15 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle02289naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245005300164300002100217500001500238520109700253650002301350650002201373650001601395650001101411650001601422650002301438650002001461650002001481650001501501650002501516650001301541650001001554651001301564653001501577653001001592653001501602700001501617773011901632852000901751930003301760945002501793946001301818655001201831IND4379030720221121025234.0060324e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437903072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W12421 (10 p.  a2019-12-05  aBed form evolution remains dynamic even in the special case of steady, uniform flow. Data from the sandy, braided North Loup River, Nebraska, show that roughness features on the channel bottom display a statistical steady state and robust scaling that are maintained through the collective interactions of transient (short-lived) bed forms. Motivated by such field data, and laboratory observations of bed form growth, we develop a nonlinear stochastic surface evolution model for the topography of bed load dominated sandy rivers in which instantaneous sediment flux explicitly depends on local elevation and slope. This model quantitatively reproduces laboratory observations of initial growth and saturation of bed forms from a flat surface, and also generates long-term dynamical behavior characteristic of natural systems. We argue that the variability in geometry and kinematics of bed forms in steady flow, and the existence of roughness at all wavelengths up to the largest dunes, are a consequence of the nonlinear relationship between sediment flux and topography, subject to noise. 3atemporal variation 3asurface roughness 3asandy soils 3arivers 3asteady flow 3asediment transport 3astream channels 3aphysical models 3akinematics 3astochastic processes 3aaltitude 3ashape 3aNebraska 0atopography 0aslope 0awater flow1 aMohrig, D.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Dec., v. 41, no. 12 p.W12421 (10 p-W12421 (10 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/28  aOther US 7aarticle04373naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002100176245007600197300001400273500014200287500002400429500001500453520159400468650001002062650001202072650002002084650001402104650002402118650004102142650003002183650002502213650002702238650001702265650001502282650002602297650002702323650001102350650002002361650002102381650002302402650003002425650003702455650003602492650001902528650001202547650001102559650001402570650004902584650002402633650003302657650007102690650004902761650001102810650006302821650002702884650005502911650001702966650006402983650005303047653002603100653002903126653002503155653002503180700001903205700001603224700002303240700002103263773009303284852000903377856008803386930003303474945002503507946001103532655001203543IND4437333220221121014853.0100522e20100616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443733322DNAL7 a202115312pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aSteiner, Florian10aBovine herpesvirus 5 BICP0 complements the bovine herpesvirus 1 homolog  ap. 37-44.  aIn the special issue: 3rd Veterinary Symposium of the European Society for Veterinary Virology (ESVV) / edited by Thomas C.

Thus, the C-terminal amino acid sequence (residues 643-676 of BICP0-1 vs. 655-720 of BICP0-5) is completely different. We introduced the BICP0-5 frameshift into the BoHV-1 genome cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BoHV-1 BAC) using the Red recombination system with galK selection and counterselection. Transfection of MDBK cells with the resulting BAC produced recombinant virus that replicated like wild type BoHV-1 in vitro. Attempts to exchange the entire BICP0-1 gene by the BoHV-5 homolog using the same approach failed repeatedly. Therefore, we cotransfected purified BICP0⁻/galK⁺-BoHV-1 BAC DNA with a recombination plasmid coding for BICP0-5 with or without a HA tag into MDBK cells. BoHV-1 recombinants expressing the respective proteins were characterized. In vitro, all recombinants grew to similar titers as the parental viruses, which demonstrates that BICP0-5 compensates for the growth defect of BICP0⁻/galK⁺-BoHV-1 and functionally complements BICP0-1 of BoHV-1. We conclude that BICP0 may be suitable to positively select BoHV-1 recombinants with deletions or insertions of additional genes of interest. 3agenes 3astrains 3acattle diseases 3aphenotype 3aframeshift mutation 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 5 3arecombinant proteins 3aphenotypic correlation 3apathogenesis 3apathotypes 3agenetic recombination 3acentral nervous system 3acattle 3asensory neurons 3ain vitro studies 3amicrobial genetics 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3acentral nervous system diseases 3aviral proteins 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Line 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aFrameshift Mutation 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHerpesvirus 1, Bovinexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aHerpesvirus 5, Bovinexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aImmediate-Early Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aTrans-Activatorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransfection 2aUbiquitin-Protein Ligasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aViral Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aimmediate-early genes 0aimmediate-early proteins 0aBovine herpesvirus 5 0aBovine herpesvirus 11 aZumsteg, Anita1 aVogt, Bernd1 aAckermann, Mathias1 aSchwyzer, Martin0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2010 June 16, v. 143, no. 1 p.37-44dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/07/03  aNon-US 7aarticle02442naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245006700158300002100225500001500246520135000261650002201611650001701633650002201650650001001672650002001682650002301702650001401725650001601739650001701755651001201772653001701784653001401801653001801815773011901833852000901952930003301961945002501994946001302019655001202032IND4377496820221121014735.0060130e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437749682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSauer, J.10aEconomies of scale and firm size optimum in rural water supply  ap. W11418 (13 p.  a2019-12-05  aThis article is focused on modeling and analyzing the cost structure of water-supplying companies. A cross-sectional data set was collected with respect to water firms in rural areas of former East and West Germany. The empirical data are analyzed by applying a symmetric generalized McFadden (SGM) functional form. This flexible functional form allows for testing the concavity required by microeconomic theory as well as the global imposition of such curvature restrictions without any loss of flexibility. The original specification of the SGM cost function is modified to incorporate fixed factors of water production and supply as, for example, groundwater intake or the number of connections supplied. The estimated flexible and global curvature correct cost function is then used to derive scale elasticities as well as the optimal firm size. The results show that no water supplier in the sample produces at constant returns to scale. The optimal firm size was found to be on average about three times larger than the existing one. These findings deliver evidence for the hypothesis that the legally set supplying areas, oriented at public administrative criteria as well as local characteristics of water resources, are economically inefficient. Hence structural inefficiency in the rural water sector is confirmed to be policy induced. 3asimulation models 3awater supply 3aeconomic analysis 3afarms 3apolicy analysis 3aeconomies of scale 3autilities 3arural areas 3awater policy 3aGermany 0aoptimization 0afirm size 0abusiness size0 tWater resources research.g2005 Nov., v. 41, no. 11 p.W11418 (13 p-W11418 (13 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle04941naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100002300193245010400216300001800320500001500338520248700353650001202840650001002852650001802862650003002880650001402910650002702924650001002951650001202961650001002973650003102983650003003014650001803044650001003062650001403072650001903086650002103105650002003126650001403146650001703160650002203177650002803199650002603227650004703253650001203300650001503312650003203327650001403359650003703373650002203410650005603432650005003488650003303538650001203571650002203583650001503605650002403620650001203644653002203656700001503678700001703693700001403710700001903724700002403743700001603767700001603783700001803799773012203817852000903939856008003948930003304028945002504061946001304086655001204099IND4397991120141224000000.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439799112DNAL7 a177097832pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-7772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A control diet (AH) containing 103 g of neutral detergent-soluble fiber/ kg of DM included alfalfa hay as main source of fiber. Another diet (B-AP) was formulated by replacing half of the alfalfa hay with a mixture of beet and apple pulp resulting in 131 g of soluble fiber/kg of DM. A third diet (OH) was obtained by substituting half of the alfalfa hay with a mix of oat hulls and a soybean protein concentrate and contained 79 g of soluble fiber/kg of DM. Rabbits weaned at 25 d and slaughtered at 35 d were used to determine ileal digestibility, jejunal morphology, sucrase activity, lamina propria lymphocytes, and intestinal microbiota. Suckling 35-d-old rabbits were used to assess mucosa morphology. Mortality (from weaning to 63 d of age) was also determined. Villous height of the jejunal mucosa increased with soluble fiber (P = 0.001). Rabbits fed with the greatest level of soluble fiber (BA-P diet) showed the highest villous height/ crypt depth ratio (8.14; P = 0.001), sucrase specific activity (8,671 μmol of glucose/g of protein; P = 0.019), and the greatest ileal starch digestibility (96.8%; P = 0.002). The opposite effects were observed in rabbits fed decreased levels of soluble fiber (AH and OH diets; 4.70, 5,848 μmol of glucose/g of protein, as average, respectively). The lowest ileal starch digestibility was detected for animals fed OH diet (93.2%). Suckling rabbits of the same age showed a lower villous height/crypt depth ratio (6.70) compared with the B-AP diet group, but this ratio was higher than the AH or OH diet groups. Lower levels of soluble fiber tended (P = 0.074) to increase the cellular immune response (CD8+ lymphocytes). Diet affected IL-2 production (CD25+, P = 0.029; CD5+CD25+, P = 0.057), with no clear relationship between soluble fiber and IL-2. The intestinal microbiota biodiversity was not affected by diets (P >= 0.38). Rabbits fed the B-AP and AH diets had a reduced cecal frequency of detection compatible with Campylobacter spp. (20.3 vs. 37.8, P = 0.074), and Clostridium perfringens (4.3 vs. 17.6%, P = 0.047), compared with the OH diet group. Moreover, the mortality rates decreased from 14.4 (OH diet) to 5.1% (B-AP diet) with the increased presence of soluble fiber in the diet. In conclusion, increased levels of dietary soluble fiber improve mucosal integrity and functionality. 3arabbits 3afeeds 3adigestibility 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aweanlings 3acell-mediated immunity 3acecum 3ajejunum 3avilli 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase 3adietary fiber 3aileum 3ahistology 3aanimal feeding 3afeed formulation 3aimmune response 3amortality 3afood animals 3aintestinal crypts 3aneutral detergent fiber 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDetergents 2aDietary Fiberxpharmacology 2aDigestion 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aIleumxmetabolism 2aIntestinal Mucosaxcytologyximmunologyxpathology. 2aJejunumxenzymologyxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aLymphocyte Countxveterinary 2aRabbits 2aRandom Allocation 2aSolubility 2aSucrasexmetabolism 2aWeaning 0aintestinal mucosa1 aGarcia, J.1 aChamorro, S.1 aEiras, P.1 aRebollar, P.G.1 aPérez de Rozas, A.1 aBadiola, I.1 aBlas, C. de1 aCarabaño, R.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Dec., v. 85, no. 12 p.3313-3321dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-7773Available from publisher's Web site  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/12  aOther US 7aarticle03737naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176100001600193245014700209300001800356500001500374520144400389650002301833650001801856650002201874650001601896650002301912650001001935650002001945650001101965650001901976650002301995650002502018650002302043650002202066650001402088650001502102650001602117650004702133650001202180650004602192650001402238650003002252650003402282650004902316650001702365650000902382650002702391650002202418650003702440650001602477653001702493653001602510653002402526700001602550700001802566700001902584700001702603700001602620700001902636700001502655700001502670773012202685852000902807856008002816930003302896945002502929946001302954655001202967IND4397992720221121014757.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439799272DNAL7 a177855992pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-7412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aClark, J.H.10aEffects of dry matter intake restriction on diet digestion, energy partitioning, phosphorus retention, and ruminal fermentation by beef steers  ap. 3383-3390.  a2019-12-04  aTwo experiments were conducted to determine the effects of DMI restriction on diet digestion, ruminal fermentation, ME intake, and P retention by beef steers. In Exp. 1, twelve Angus x steers (average initial BW = 450 ± 18 kg) were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 diets that were formulated to promote a 1.6-kg ADG at intake levels corresponding approximately to 100% (ad libitum, AL), 90% (IR90), or 80% (IR80) of ad libitum DMI. In Exp. 2, twelve crossbred steers (average initial BW = 445 ± 56 kg) fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 diets that were formulated to promote a 1.6-kg ADG at AL or IR80. All diets delivered similar total NE, MP, Ca, and P per day. During both experiments, fecal DM output by IR80 was less (P = 0.20) among treatments during both experiments, whereas P retention was similar (P >= 0.46) among treatments during Exp. 1. Total VFA and the molar proportion of acetate of AL were greater (P <= 0.03) than that of IR80 during Exp. 2; however, IR80 had a greater (P = 0.03) molar proportion of propionate. Under the conditions of these studies, restricting DMI while holding NE, ruminally degradable protein, and MP intakes constant decreased fecal DM output and changed ruminal fermentation patterns in finishing steers. Improvements in performance associated with programmed-feeding regimens of the type studied here do not appear to be related to changes in diet digestion or ME intake. 3arestricted feeding 3aenergy intake 3aenergy metabolism 3abeef cattle 3anutrient retention 3afeces 3aliveweight gain 3asteers 3apropionic acid 3arumen fermentation 3ametabolizable energy 3aad libitum feeding 3adry matter intake 3aexcretion 3aphosphorus 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDigestion 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aMale 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aWeight Gain 0afood animals 0afeed intake 0aenergy partitioning1 aOlson, K.C.1 aSchmidt, T.B.1 aLinville, M.L.1 aAlkire, D.O.1 aMeyer, D.L.1 aRentfrow, G.K.1 aCarr, C.C.1 aBerg, E.P.0 tJournal of animal science.g2007 Dec., v. 85, no. 12 p.3383-3390dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-7413Available from publisher's Web site  a20080313b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/02/12  aOther US 7aarticle03170naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002500185245005700210300001400267500014200281500002400423500001500447520091500462650003101377650002301408650001301431650004101444650001701485650002701502650001701529650002801546650002201574650003001596650002501626650002201651650001801673650002301691650002701714650002501741650001201766650008301778650004701861650002301908650003101931651001101962651001101973651001201984651001801996651001402014651001802028653002502046653002302071653001802094700001902112700001902131700001902150700002002169773009302189852000902282856008802291930003302379945002502412946001102437655001202448IND4437333520221121014857.0100522e20100616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443733352DNAL7 a202070862pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aP0501 adas Neves, Carlos G.10aCervid herpesvirus 2 infection in reindeer: A review  ap. 70-80.  aIn the special issue: 3rd Veterinary Symposium of the European Society for Veterinary Virology (ESVV) / edited by Thomas C. Mettenleiter.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHerpesviruses of the genus Varicellovirus are known to infect and cause disease in a variety of ruminant species, but the impact of cervid herpesvirus 2 (CvHV2) in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) is mostly unknown. Reindeer is a circum-polar species with a total estimated number of more than 5 million animals. Mortality may reach high values, as in northern Norway, especially in calves (37%; 2005-2006), and disease can potentially account for some of this mortality. CvHV2 has been isolated during a natural outbreak of infectious keratoconjunctivitis, indicating an etiologal link. Serological screening has shown that CvHV2 infection is prevalent in Northern Norway and experimental infection studies have demonstrated that viremia, latency and vertical transmission occur for CvHV2. The present review aims at summarizing current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and molecular virology of CvHV2. 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aabortion (animals) 3areindeer 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3awild animals 3aimmunologic techniques 3apathogenesis 3aepidemiological studies 3awildlife diseases 3aCervid alphaherpesvirus 2 3adisease surveillance 3aRangifer tarandus 3aserodiagnosis 3adisease prevalence 3ageographical variation 3akeratoconjunctivitis 2aAnimals 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxveterinaryxvirology. 2aKeratoconjunctivitis, Infectiousxvirology 2aReindeerxvirology 2aVaricellovirusxphysiology 3aNorway 3aSweden 3aFinland 3aArctic region 3aGreenland 3aNorth America 0aCervid herpesvirus 2 0aliterature reviews 0acomplications1 aRoth, Swaantje1 aRimstad, Espen1 aThiry, Etienne1 aTryland, Morten0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2010 June 16, v. 143, no. 1 p.70-80dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/07/04  aNon-US 7aarticle03582naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245015800148300001600306520188900322650001902211650001202230650002102242650001702263650002102280650001002301650001902311650002302330650002802353650001902381650001802400650002302418650001702441650001602458650002002474650002302494650001302517650002102530650002802551650003202579650002602611650004802637650001802685650002202703650004702725650003702772653001402809653001102823700001802834773008402852852000902936930003302945945001302978946001302991655001203004IND2203522320221120232239.0000403e199908  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220352232DNAL7 a104567352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaormina, P.J.10aBehavior of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 on alfalfa sprouts during the sprouting process as influenced by treatments with various chemicals  ap. 850-856.  aThe behavior of Escherichia coli O157:H7 on alfalfa seeds subjected to conditions similar to those used commercially to grow and market sprouts as it is affected by applications of NaOCl, Ca(OCl)2, acidified NaClO(2), acidified ClO(2), Na3PO4, Vegi-Clean, Tsunami, Vortexx, or H2O2 at various stages of the sprouting process was determined. Application of 2,000 ppm of NaOCl, 200 and 2,000 ppm of Ca(OCl)2, 500 ppm of acidified ClO(2), 10,000 ppm of Vegi-Clean, 80 ppm of Tsunami, or 40 and 80 ppm of Vortexx to germinated seeds significantly reduced the population of E. coli O157:H7. With the exception of acidified NaOCl(2) at 1,200 ppm, spray applications of these chemicals did not significantly reduce populations or control the growth of E. coli O157:H7 on alfalfa sprouts during the sprouting process. Populations of E. coli on alfalfa sprouts peaked at 6 to 7 log(10) CFU/g 48 h after initiation of the sprouting process and remained stable despite further spraying with chemicals. The population of E. coli O157:H7 on sprouts as they entered cold storage at 9 +/- 2 degrees C remained essentially unchanged for up to 6 days. None of the chemical treatments evaluated was able to eliminate or satisfactorily reduce E. coli O157:H7 on alfalfa seeds and sprouts. Observations on the ability of E. coli O157:H7 to grow during production of alfalfa sprouts not subjected to chemical treatments are similar to those from a previous study in our laboratory on the behavior of Salmonella Stanley. Our results do not reveal a chemical treatment method to eliminate the pathogen from alfalfa sprouts. We have demonstrated that currently recommended procedures for sanitizing alfalfa seeds fail to eliminate E. coli O157:H7 and that the pathogen can grow to populations exceeding 7 log(10) CFU/g of sprouts produced using techniques not dissimilar to those used in the sprout industry. 3asprouts (food) 3aalfalfa 3aEscherichia coli 3afood storage 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3aseed treatment 3afood contamination 3amicrobial contamination 3afood marketing 3adisinfectants 3apopulation density 3acold storage 3asterilizing 3afood production 3achemical treatment 3aspraying 3aapplication rate 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & development 2aFood Handling 2aFood Microbiology 2aMedicago sativaxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSeedsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 0atreatment 0agrowth1 aBeuchat, L.R.0 tJournal of food protection.g1999 Aug., v. 62, no. 8 p.850-856x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080206b20080301c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle04701naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001800170245018200188300001400370500002400384500001500408520312000423650001803543650001703561650001403578650001603592650002103608650002703629650001203656650002103668650002103689650001603710650002903726650001403755650002403769650002203793650002403815650002403839650001203863650001103875653001403886773011303900852000904013856009204022930003304114945002504147946001104172655001204183IND4437332520221120222245.0100522e20100602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443733252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2010.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aLauridsen, C.10aEvaluation of the effect of increasing dietary vitamin E in combination with different fat sources on performance, humoral immune responses and antioxidant status of weaned pigs  ap. 85-94.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study investigated the influence of different fat sources and vitamin E supplementation on performance, humoral immune responses, plasma biochemical responses, mucosal fatty acid profile, and α-tocopherol status in serum and intestine of pigs after weaning (days 28-56 of age). The experiment involved a total of 180 pigs of 20 litters. Nine pigs of each litter were allotted to 9 dietary treatments in a 3×3 factorial arrangement of treatments in a randomized complete block design, which was conducted in 20 replicates. The 9 experimental groups were fed 50g/kg diet of tallow, sunflower oil, or fish oil at three different vitamin E levels (85, 150, and 300mg all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet). No effect (P>0.05) of the dietary treatments was obtained on the performance of the pigs. Seven pigs from each treatment combination (n =63) were immunised with sheep red blood cells at weaning (day 28 of age), and weekly blood samples were obtained from these pigs to determine the α-tocopherol status, antibody titres and humoral immune responses. At the end of the trial, pigs were killed and samples of mucosa, intestinal epithelium and bile were obtained. The concentration of α-tocopherol in serum decreased (P<0.001) during the first week after weaning, and dietary all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate supplementation had no influence (P>0.05) before day 42 of age. Thereafter, serum α-tocopherol concentration reflected the dietary vitamin E level and stayed above 1.5mg/L serum when pigs were fed 150 and 300mg all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet, whereas provision of 85mg all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet resulted in lower (P<0.05) serum α-tocopherol concentration. Mucosal and intestinal epithelium α-tocopherol concentration was influenced by the dietary vitamin E treatment (P<0.001) as pigs fed the 85mg all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet had lower α-tocopherol concentration than pigs fed 150 and 300mg all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet. Vitamin E supplementation had no influence (P>0.05) on the measured immune responses, serum biochemical responses or fatty acid profile of mucosal samples. When compared to tallow, pigs fed sunflower oil had higher antibody response to sheep red blood cells at days 49 (P<0.05) and 56 (P<0.05) of age, and the serum concentration of IgG was higher (P=0.01). The mucosal fatty acid composition reflected the fatty acid composition of dietary fat sources. The concentration of triglycerides (P=0.004) and cholesterol (P=0.001) was higher in pigs fed tallow than the other sources of fat. In conclusion, dietary fat source rather than vitamin E supplementation during the weaning period influenced the measured responses of the pigs, i.e. humoral immune responses, concentration of triglyceride and cholesterol in plasma, and fatty acid composition of mucosal samples. Vitamin E supplementation increased the α-tocopherol status of pigs 14 days after weaning, and a dietary concentration of 150mg vitamin E/kg diet (at the present fat level of 50g/kg diet) could be recommended to ensure a α-tocopherol status of pigs above 1.5mg/L serum. 3asunflower oil 3ablood lipids 3aweanlings 3adietary fat 3ahumoral immunity 3afatty acid composition 3aweaning 3atriacylglycerols 3aalpha-tocopherol 3acholesterol 3adietary nutrient sources 3afish oils 3avitamin supplements 3aintestinal mucosa 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 3apiglets 3atallow 0avitamin E0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2010 June 2, v. 158, no. 1-2 p.85-94dElsevier Sciencex0377-84017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2010.03.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/06/21  aNon-US 7aarticle04110naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193100001700210245012900227300001600356500001500372520221200387650001402599650001902613650001002632650002002642650001602662650002202678650002302700650001602723650002002739650001102759650002202770650001302792650002202805650002202827650001702849650002602866650004702892650001202939650002102951650003302972650002103005650003303026650000903059650001703068653002503085653002103110653001603131700001703147700001703164773011903181852000903300856008003309930003303389945002503422946001303447655001203460IND4399272720221120212046.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439927272DNAL7 a177855902pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2005-5692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In Exp. 1, a feedlot diet containing roughage was fed (traditional). In Exp. 2, a no-roughage diet was fed. Residual feed intake, a measure of feed efficiency, was calculated for both studies. In Exp. 1, six feed-efficient (low RFI) steers and six feed-inefficient steers (high RFI) were selected from a contemporary group of 80 steers, and feeding behaviors were analyzed. In Exp. 2, nine feed-efficient and eight feed-inefficient steers were selected from a contemporary group of 40 steers. There were no differences (P > 0.13) in initial or final BW or ADG between efficient and inefficient groups in either Exp. 1 or 2. In Exp. 1, DMI and average eating bouts daily differed (P < 0.001), with efficient steers consuming less feed and eating fewer times per day. In Exp. 2, efficient steers consumed less (P < 0.001) feed, and average eating bouts daily tended (P = 0.07) to be fewer in efficient animals. Limited differences were noted in feeding behavior between groups, with inefficient steers from both studies having a more variable eating pattern throughout the day. The average daily eating rate did not differ (P > 0.20) between groups in either experiment. The average number of days comprising a feeding pattern for both efficiency groups in Exp. 1 and 2 was found to be 2 to 3 d and multiples of 2 to 3 d. In Exp. 1, the feed intake pattern of efficient and inefficient steers changed once they reached a BW of approximately 391 and 381 kg, respectively. This occurred near d 47 for the efficient steers and near d 32 for inefficient steers. In Exp. 2, the feed intake pattern of both efficient and inefficient steers changed once they reached a BW of approximately 399 kg, which occurred on d 31 for the efficient steers and on d 33 for the inefficient steers. From the measured variables, there were no differences in growth and limited differences noted in feeding behavior between efficient and inefficient groups. The results of the trials suggest increased variability of feed intake throughout the day for inefficient animals. 3aphenotype 3acattle feeding 3aAngus 3afeed conversion 3abody weight 3afeeding frequency 3aad libitum feeding 3abeef cattle 3aliveweight gain 3asteers 3adiurnal variation 3agenotype 3afeed concentrates 3adry matter intake 3afeed rations 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aDietxveterinary 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aMale 2aTime Factors 0aresidual feed intake 0afeeding behavior 0afeed intake1 aKerley, M.S.1 aKolath, W.H.0 tJournal of animal science.g2008 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.180-186dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2005-5693Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle03497naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193100001900210245009800229300001600327520188900343650001202232650001402244650001902258650001202277650001802289650001802307650002102325650001602346650002002362650002002382650002602402650004702428650001202475650002102487650003702508650003802545650003202583650001702615650001202632700001602644700001602660773011902676852000902795856008002804930003302884945002502917946001302942655001202955IND4399271420221120211924.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439927142DNAL7 a179401522pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-8312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCromwell, G.L.10aAssessment of lactose level in the mid- to late-nursery phase on performance of weanling pigs  ap. 127-133.  aAn experiment involving a total of 1,320 crossbred pigs was conducted at 3 universities to assess the effects of various levels of lactose in diets during phase 3 (wk 3 and 4 postweaning) of a 4-phase starter program. Pigs were weaned at 15 to 20 d (6.2-kg initial BW) and allotted to 5 treatments. All pigs were fed a complex phase 1 diet (20% lactose) the first week postweaning followed by a complex phase 2 diet (15% lactose) the second week postweaning. Phase 3 diets containing 0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, or 10.0% lactose were fed for wk 3 and 4, and then a common, corn-soybean meal diet was fed for an additional 1 to 2 wk (phase 4). The source of lactose was Dairylac 80, which contains 80% lactose. The phase 1, 2, and 3 diets were prepared at one site. Pigs were weighed, and feed intake was determined at weekly intervals. There were 8 replications at each station for a total of 24 replications per treatment with 5 or 23 pigs per pen. As expected, ADG, DFI, and G:F were not affected (P = 0.10) during the initial 2-wk period when all pigs received the same diet. During wk 3 and 4 (phase 3) when the 5 levels of lactose were fed, ADG and ADFI increased linearly (P < 0.01) with increasing levels of lactose, but G:F was not affected (P = 0.10). Although the quadratic component was not significant, ADG and ADFI reached a numerical plateau at the 7.5% inclusion level of lactose during phase 3. Compared with pigs fed the diet without lactose, the 7.5% level of lactose resulted in 350 g of additional BW gain coupled with 420 g of additional feed consumed per pig during phase 3, and most of the additional BW gain (294 g) was maintained through the end of the 5- to 6-wk study. These results suggest that pigs respond to dietary lactose during the mid to latter phase of the nursery period and that the response was obtained under different management and facility conditions. 3apiglets 3aweanlings 3apiglet feeding 3alactose 3astarter diets 3aweaning foods 3afeed supplements 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDietxveterinary 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aLactosexchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSwinexgrowth & development 2aTime Factors 2aWeaning1 aAllee, G.L.1 aMahan, D.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2008 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.127-133dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-8313Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle04747naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179072000900188100002200197245016600219300001400385500002400399500001500423520274100438650002103179650003203200650002203232650002103254650002203275650001803297650003003315650002303345650001903368650002103387650001703408650002303425650002003448650002303468650001603491650001403507650001003521650002203531650001003553650002603563650001303589653001703602700001903619700002103638700001603659700002603675700001603701700002203717700001903739700002003758773011303778852000903891856009203900930003303992945002504025946001104050655001204061IND4437331820221120211922.0100522e20100602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443733182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2010.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aR100 0aR200 0aL600 0aL8101 ade Oliveira, A.S.10aNutrient digestibility, nitrogen metabolism and hepatic function of sheep fed diets containing solvent or expeller castorseed meal treated with calcium hydroxide  ap. 15-28.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNineteen sheep averaging 56kg of initial body weight were used in a completely randomized design to investigate the effects of feeding Ca(OH)₂-treated (40g/kg, on fresh matter basis) or untreated castorseed meal (CSM) sources on intake, total tract digestibility, hepatic function, and microbial protein synthesis and efficiency. Animals were maintained in metabolic crates for 21 days with 16 days for diet adaptation and 5 days for data and samples collection. Sheep were fed once daily experimental diets containing one of the following 5 protein supplements (150g/kg of the diet DM): (1) soybean meal (SBM); (2) solvent CSM (SCM); (3) SCM treated with Ca(OH)₂ (TSCM), expeller CSM (ECM); or ECM treated with Ca(OH)₂ (TECM). Treating SCM and ECM with Ca(OH)₂ reduced the ricin concentration in 63% leading to an average decrease from 2.46 to 1.06g/kg of BW in the ricin daily intake (P <0.001). No clinical symptoms of ricin intoxication were observed and the serum concentrations of the enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which are indicators of hepatic function, were not changed across diets (P >0.05). There was no effect of diets on intake of nutrients (P >0.05) with the exception of non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC) intake, which was greater (P =0.029) in sheep fed SBM vs. CSM diets and that of ether extract, which was lower (P =0.049) in sheep fed solvent CSM diets vs. expeller CSM diets. However, treating SCM and ECM with Ca(OH)₂ tended to increase intakes of DM, CP and NFC. Apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients was not affected by diet (P >0.05) with the exception of ether extract digestibility, which was lower in sheep fed SBM vs. CSM diets (P =0.001) but greater (P =0.023) in sheep fed solvent CSM diets vs. expeller CSM diets. Treating SCM and ECM with Ca(OH)₂ increased or tended (0.05> P >0.10) to increase the apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients with the exception NFC. Microbial protein synthesis (P =0.013) and microbial efficiency expressed either as g of microbial CP per g of CP intake (P =0.043) or as g of microbial CP per g of rumen-degradable CP intake (P =0.030) were all increased by treating SCM and ECM with Ca(OH)₂. Despite the increase (P =0.022) in the urinary excretion of urea-N (g/day) by treating SCM and ECM with Ca(OH)₂, the greater microbial efficiency reduced (P =0.021) fecal-N losses expressed as proportion of N intake numerically increasing retained-N by 21.3%. Treating SCM and ECM with 40g of Ca(OH)₂/kg did not completely denaturate ricin but increased microbial protein synthesis and the efficiency of N and energy by ruminal microbes with no detrimental effect on the hepatic function of sheep. 3anitrogen balance 3adetoxification (processing) 3anatural toxicants 3acastor bean meal 3acalcium hydroxide 3adigestibility 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aruminant nutrition 3aliver function 3aRicinus communis 3adenaturation 3achemical treatment 3afeed processing 3afeed contamination 3afeed intake 3abiodiesel 3aricin 3aprotein synthesis 3asheep 3aindustrial byproducts 3asolvents 0afeed quality1 aCampos, J.M.S.1 aOliveira, M.R.C.1 aBrito, A.F.1 aFilho, S.C.

  1 aSiviglia, A.10aEffect of bottom curvature on mudflow dynamics: Theory and experiments  ap. W11423 (17 p.  a2019-12-05  aA one-dimensional mathematical model of mudflow dynamics is formulated assuming mud to behave rheologically as a Herschel-Bulkley fluid. Novel features of the present contribution regard the propagation of mudflows over a curvilinear bottom. A set of nonlinear partial differential equations is found to govern the unsteady, nonuniform flow of such fluids. Following the approach of Huang and Garcia (1998), a depth-integrated form of the continuity equation and shear-integrated and plug-integrated forms of the momentum equations are derived. A perturbation analysis is also carried out under the assumption of "slender" flow. The leading-order problem takes the form of a kinematic wave equation. One straightforward application of this simplified model is the evaluation of the maximum run-out extension of a mud which flows over a bed with a variable topography. This solution is obtained by solving the steady state problem. Dynamics information are obtained by numerically solving the hyperbolic conservative equation by means of a free oscillating numerical method. The effects of bottom curvature either on the equilibrium solution or mudflow dynamics are analyzed. Experiments are also performed releasing a given volume of kaoline and water mixture from a reservoir into both a constant slope and an upward concave channel. Comparisons between the numerical solution and the experimental data are generally satisfactory, though suggesting limitations typical of any approach that neglects convective accelerations and assumes gradually varied flow. 3asimulation models 3asaturated conditions 3astream channels 3amud flows 3aequations 3aspatial distribution 3asoil 3aliquids 3arheological properties 3awater 3akaolin 3ashape 0amathematical models 0amud 0aslope 0areservoirs1 aCantelli, A.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Nov., v. 41, no. 11 p.W11423 (17 p-W11423 (17 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle04601naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193100002100210245013800231300001600369500001500385520255200400650002302952650001502975650002402990650002503014650001303039650002203052650002503074650002803099650001603127650002303143650000803166650001103174650002203185650001903207650002303226650001803249650002003267650002103287650002603308650004703334650001203381650003303393650002103426650003503447650002403482650002603506650000903532650002403541650002203565650001703587653001603604700001603620773011903636852000903755856008003764930003303844945002503877946001303902655001203915IND4399271920221120211813.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439927192DNAL7 a179112352pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-7012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHuntington, G.B.14aThe interaction of harvesting time of day of switchgrass hay and ruminal degradability of supplemental protein offered to beef steers  ap. 159-166.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate an interaction between harvest at 0600 (AM) vs. 1800 (PM) with high (HI) or low (LO) ruminal degradability of a protein supplement to change voluntary intake, digestion, or N retention by steers offered switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) hay. Black steers (255 ± 14 kg of BW) were blocked by BW, and then randomly assigned (5 steers each) to AM/HI, PM/HI, AM/LO, or PM/LO treatment groups. Steers were group-housed in covered, outdoor pens with individual feeding gates. After adaptation and standardization, intake was measured for 21 d followed by a digestion trial (5 d of total collection). Steers were offered 767 (LO) or 825 (HI) g/d of supplement to provide 268 g of CP/d. Compared with AM, PM had greater (P = 0.01) concentrations of total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC, 71 vs. 56 g/kg of DM), and lesser concentrations of NDF (760 vs. 770 g/kg of DM, P = 0.02), ADF (417 vs. 427 g/kg of DM, P = 0.02), and CP (55.9 vs. 58.6 g/ kg of DM, P = 0.07). Protein fractions A, B₂, and B₃ were similar for AM and PM, but HI contained more (P < 0.02) A (694 vs. 296 g/kg of protein) and less B₂ (174 vs. 554 g/kg of protein) fraction than LO. Harvest interacted with supplement to increase (P = 0.07) ad libitum digestible DMI for steers offered PM/HI (11.4 g/kg of BW daily) compared with steers offered PM/LO (10.2 g/kg of BW daily), but there was no difference for steers offered AM/LO or AM/HI (10.7 g/kg of BW). Apparent digestibilities of DM (594 vs. 571 g/kg of intake), NDF (591 vs. 562 g/kg of intake), ADF (585 vs. 566 g/kg of intake), and N (651 vs. 632 g/kg of intake) were greater (P < 0.04) for PM than for AM. Apparent digestibility of N was greater (P = 0.02) for HI (652 g/ kg of intake) vs. LO (631 g/kg of intake). Interactions between harvest and supplement for apparent digestibilities of NDF (P = 0.09) and ADF (P = 0.03) were due to no change or an increase in digestibility in response to increased ruminal degradability of supplement in steers offered PM harvest, whereas increased ruminal degradability of supplement decreased digestibility of NDF and ADF in steers offered AM harvest. Treatments did not affect hay intake (3.93 kg/d), N retained (15.8 g/d), or plasma urea N (5.25 mM) during ad libitum intake. Greater TNC in PM vs. AM harvest was not sufficient by itself to increase total voluntary DMI, but greater protein degradability interacted with harvest time to increase ruminal fiber digestibility and digestible DMI of beef steers offered PM vs. AM harvest. 3adigestible protein 3aharvesting 3aprotein supplements 3aacid detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3adry matter intake 3acarbohydrate content 3aneutral detergent fiber 3abeef cattle 3anutrient retention 3ahay 3asteers 3adiurnal variation 3aforage grasses 3arumen fermentation 3adigestibility 3aprotein content 3afeed supplements 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aMale 2aPoaceaexphysiology 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aTime Factors 0afeed intake1 aBurns, J.C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2008 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.159-166dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-7013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle02011naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100002100127245012000148300002000268500001500288520083400303650002401137650001901161650001101180650001301191650002001204650002301224650001801247650001901265650001601284650003101300653001501331653001601346653001601362700001701378700001501395773009901410852000901509930003301518945002501551946001301576655001201589IND4377498920221120212037.0060130e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437749892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

W11426 (9 p.  a2019-12-05  aRecent research has demonstrated that image processing can be applied to derive surficial median grain size data automatically from high-resolution airborne digital imagery in fluvial environments. However, at the present time, automated grain size measurement is limited to the dry exposed bed areas of the channel. This paper shows that the application area of automated grain size mapping can be extended in order to include the shallow wetted areas of the channel. The paper then proceeds to illustrate how automated grain size measurement in both dry and shallow wetted areas can be used to measure grain sizes automatically for long river lengths. For the present study, this results in a median grain size profile covering an 80 km long river which is constructed from over three million automated grain size measurements. 3aautomatic detection 3aimage analysis 3arivers 3aalluvium 3aalluvial plains 3aaerial photography 3afluvial soils 3aremote sensing 3ameasurement 3aparticle size distribution 0aautomation 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aBergeron, N.1 aLane, S.N.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Nov., v. 41, no. 11 p.W11426 (9 p-W11426 (9 px0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle04047naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072001700159072001700176072001700193100001600210245018800226300001600414520207900430650001002509650001802519650001602537650001802553650000902571650000902580650001602589650001602605650001902621650002002640650001502660650002602675650002002701650002002721650001902741650002602760650004702786650001202833650002102845650002802866650001102894650000902905650002302914650004902937650003202986650002503018700001903043700002303062700001603085700001703101773011903118852000903237856008003246930003303326945002503359946001303384655001203397IND4399271220221120200839.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439927122DNAL7 a178782712pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2006-6972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVicente, B.14aThe effects of feeding rice in substitution of corn and the degree of starch gelatinization of rice on the digestibility of dietary components and productive performance of young pigs  ap. 119-126.  aA 28-d trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of the main cereal of the diet (corn or rice), heat processing (HP) of rice, and the degree of starch gelatinization (SG) of rice on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dietary components and productive performance of pigs weaned at 25 d of age. The experimental design was a completely randomized, with 4 treatments and 8 replicates per treatment (5 pigs penned together). Control pigs were fed a complex diet without growth promoters and based on milk products, fish meal, and 50% cooked and flaked corn, with a degree of SG of 84%. Experimental groups received the same complex diet as the control group, but the corn was substituted by rice with 3 different degrees of SG; 11% that corresponded to raw rice and 52 or 76% that corresponded to cooked rice processed under 2 different conditions. Pig growth was measured at 25, 39, and 53 d of age, and ATTD was determined at 29, 39, and 53 d of age. The ATTD of all dietary components except for N increased with age (P <0.01) and were greater for the rice than for the corn diet. Heat processing of rice improved ATTD of all dietary components at 29 d of age, but no beneficial effects were observed at 39 or 53 d of age. Modifying the conditions of HP to increase the degree of SG of rice from 52 to 76% and to reduce mean particle size from 480 to 405 μm did not result in further improvement of nutrient digestibility. From 25 to 53 d of age, pigs fed rice consumed more feed (678 vs. 618 g/d; P <0.05), grew faster (466 vs. 407 g/d; P <0.01), and tended to have greater G:F (0.685 vs. 0.662; P <0.10) than pigs fed corn. In fact, from 25 to 39 d of age, pigs fed rice consumed 23% more feed (P <0.01), grew 29% faster (P <0.01), and had 5% greater G:F (P <0.05) than pigs fed corn. Feeding rice improved performance of weanling pigs, and HP of rice under mild conditions enhanced diet digestibility and productive performance of pigs. Severe processing of rice increased the degree of SG but did not further improve diet digestibility or growth performance. 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3afeed intake 3adigestibility 3arice 3acorn 3afeed grains 3arice starch 3agelatinization 3afeed processing 3aanimal age 3anutrient availability 3afeed conversion 3aliveweight gain 3aheat treatment 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDietxveterinary 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOryzaxmetabolism. 2aStarchxchemistryxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aSwinexgrowth & development 2aZea maysxmetabolism1 aValencia, D.G.1 aPérez-Serrano, M.1 aLázaro, R.1 aMateos, G.G.0 tJournal of animal science.g2008 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.119-126dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2006-6973Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle03547naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161072001700178100002100195245011200216300001600328500001500344520206800359650001202427650001702439650002102456650002102477650002602498650001302524650002002537650001502557650001802572650001402590650003602604650001502640650001602655650002302671650002502694650002202719651001602741653002002757653001102777700001702788700002002805700001902825773006902844852000902913930003302922945002502955946001302980655001202993IND4422568720221120200823.0090630e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442256872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBurkhard, Nicole10aOrganic Mulch Impact on Vegetation Dynamics and Productivity of Highbush Blueberry Under Organic Production  ap. 688-696.  a2019-12-04  aA 2-year study in Nova Scotia examined the effectiveness of thickly applied organic mulches as a method of weed control in highbush blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum L.), and assessed weed and mulch impact on crop growth, leaf nutrient concentration, yield, and quality under organic production management. Mulches, applied in-row at 20-cm depth, included pine needles (PN), manure-sawdust compost (MC), and seafood waste compost (SC). Competition from weeds negatively affected crop growth and productivity, reducing canopy volume (16% to 38%), leaf nitrogen concentration and berry yields (up to 92%), number (up to 91%), and specific weight (up to 21%). Among mulches, PN proved to be the most effective in suppressing weed growth with 55% less and 73% less aboveground weed biomass compared with the control in 2005 and 2006, respectively, although PN productivity effects were much more modest. One year after application, PN lost some efficacy at suppressing weeds but was still superior to both composts. Distribution of weed species was substantially altered by mulch treatment. Both composts prevented some weed emergence (i.e., sheep sorrel), but weed seeds germinating in composts, especially SC, experienced prolific growth likely as a result of available nutrients in composts. No detrimental effects on short-term plant productivity were noted despite high C:N ratios of PN and MC (72:1 and 48:1, respectively). Plant vigor and yield were typically higher for compost mulch treatments, especially in weed-free subplots, and composts provided more complete fertilization reflected in increased leaf tissue elemental (NPK) composition. Fruit soluble solid (sugar) content was found to be significantly lower in PN and MC compared with SC, whereas total phenolic content was unaffected by mulches. Mulch application can improve organic highbush blueberry productivity by improving soil properties, nutrient availability, and weed suppression; however, precautions should be taken to avoid excess nutrient loading and weed seed contamination of mulches. 3amulches 3aweed control 3aapplication rate 3anitrogen content 3aquantitative analysis 3acomposts 3aconifer needles 3acrop yield 3afruit quality 3apotassium 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphosphorus 3ablueberries 3aorganic production 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3avegetative growth 3aNova Scotia 0acrop production 0aleaves1 aLynch, Derek1 aPercival, David1 aSharifi, Mehdi0 tHortScience.g2009 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.688-696x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/07/24  aOther US 7aarticle03946naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198072001700215100001600232245008800248300001400336500001500350520187100365650002402236650002602260650002802286650001302314650001902327650002502346650001602371650001702387650001202404650001502416650002202431650002002453650001902473650001302492650001702505650002802522650002002550650001902570650002102589650001302610650002802623650002002651650001002671650001702681650001202698650001102710650002202721650002702743650002602770650002902796650002102825650002002846650001302866650001602879653002002895700001402915700001502929773008102944852000903025856008503034930003303119945002503152946001103177655001203188IND4370297120221120200743.0050518e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437029712DNAL7 a157477282pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299040005242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHayes, M.G.10aPotential applications of high pressure homogenisation in processing of liquid milk  ap. 25-33.  a2019-12-04  aStudies of the potential of high pressure homogenisation (HPH) for the combined pasteurisation/homogenisation of raw bovine milk were undertaken. Raw milk was preheated to 45 degrees C and HPH-treated at 150, 200 or 250 MPa; milk outlet temperature at these pressures were 67, 76.8 and 83.6 degrees C, respectively, with a holding time of approximately 20 s. Raw and commercially pasteurized and homogenized (CPH) milk samples were analysed as controls. Fat globules in HPH samples were approximately half the size of those in CPH samples, although differences were not significant (P>0.05). beta-Lactoglobulin was denatured at pressures greater than or equal to 150 MPa, although little denaturation of alpha-lactalbumin was observed. Numbers of psychrotrophic bacteria in raw milk were reduced by 2.73 log cycles by HPH at 150 MPa and were uncountable following HPH at 200 or 250 MPa. Mesophilic bacterial counts were reduced by 1.30, 1.83 and 3.06 log cycles by HPH at 150, 200 or 250 MPa, respectively. No viable Staphylococcus aureus nor coliform cells remained in any HPH milk samples. HPH did not affect the colour of milk and HPH samples did not cream during refrigerated storage. The activities of plasmin, alkaline phosphatase and lactoperoxidase in milk were all greatly reduced by HPH. Pseudomonas fluorescens, inoculated into milk (approximately 10(6) cfu/ml), was reduced to undetectable levels by HPH at 200MPa (milk inlet temperature, approximately 10 degrees C); however, Ps. fluorescens proteinase was quite resistant to HPH under such conditions. Overall, owing to the significant increase in temperature and the possibility of varying the holding time, there may be potential applications for HPH as a novel liquid milk processing technique, combining many advantages of conventional homogenization and pasteurization of milk in a single process. 3aenzyme inactivation 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3araw milk 3apasteurization 3aalkaline phosphatase 3alactalbumin 3adenaturation 3aplasmin 3aperoxidase 3acoliform bacteria 3astorage quality 3alactoglobulins 3amilk fat 3afat globules 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aenzyme activity 3ahomogenization 3ahomogenized milk 3acreaming 3apsychrotrophic bacteria 3afood processing 3acolor 3acold storage 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aLactalbuminxanalysis 2aLactoglobulinsxanalysis 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPressure 2aTemperature 0alactoperoxidase1 aFox, P.F.1 aKelly, Al.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Feb., v. 72, no. 1 p.25-33x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299040005243Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02213naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002300161245008600184300001600270500001500286520096100301650001601262650001701278650001301295650001301308650001301321650002101334650001201355650002001367650001501387650001501402650001701417650002201434650001901456650002101475651001201496653002001508700002201528700003201550773006901582852000901651930003301660945002501693946001301718655001201731IND4422568620221120191712.0090630e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442256862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Yield data (marketable fruit per tree) were collected after the fourth and fifth years. The insect control treatments were Admire (imidacloprid) applied at 12, 6, 3, or 2-month intervals; Temik (aldicarb) applied annually; Meta-Systox-R (oxydemeton-methyl) applied annually; or no insect control. Trunk diameter was significantly increased by Temik treatment at 1 and 2 years after planting. Six annual applications of Admire (at 2-month intervals) significantly increased trunk diameter 2 years after planting. None of the other treatments affected trunk diameters compared with the control. There were no trunk diameter differences among treatments at 3, 4, or 5 years after planting. Both Temik applied annually and Admire applied every other month or every 3 months significantly increased yield. 3atree growth 3ainsect pests 3aaldicarb 3adiameter 3atree age 3aCitrus aurantium 3aoranges 3aCitrus sinensis 3acrop yield 3arootstocks 3aimidacloprid 3aoxydemeton-methyl 3ainsect control 3aapplication rate 3aFlorida 0acrop production1 aRitenour, Mark A.1 aBullock, R.

  1 aLeiber, F.10aProtein composition, plasmin activity and cheesemaking properties of cows' milk produced at two altitudes from hay of lowland and high-alpine origins  ap. 65-74.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of high altitude, alpine origin of the forage and roughage-only diets on milk protein content and composition, plasmin activity and cheesemaking properties was investigated. There were four treatment groups, each consisting of six dairy cows in early to mid-lactation. Two groups were fed only with hay ad libitum either at 2000 m or at 400 m a.s.l. One group, kept in the lowlands, was pair-fed to the alpine-site group and another group received a mixed diet of silages, hay and concentrates. Two hay types, harvested either at the alpine site or in the lowlands, were offered to all cows fed with hay alone, following a change-over design in three periods each of 3 weeks. In the respective third week, milk was sampled at every milking. Hay of alpine origin significantly reduced milk protein, in particular whey proteins, which is why the casein number increased. kappa-Casein proportion in total casein was reduced and its glycosylation was increased by the alpine hay. The apparent plasminogen-derived activity was reduced when alpine hay was given, but apparent plasmin activity and rennet coagulation properties of the milk were not affected by hay type. Independent of hay type, the high altitude group showed a significantly reduced milk protein content, lower glycosylation of kappa-casein and impaired rennet coagulation properties. For several of the traits, the trend was the same in the pair-fed group. There was no effect of altitude on apparent plasmin activity. Hay-alone v. the mixed diet resulted initially in marked declines in milk protein content but did not impair cheesemaking properties. Thus the extensive diet without concentrates, typical of high-alpine conditions, contributed less to the overall effect of extensive alpine v. intensive lowland feeding systems than hay quality and altitude did. In conclusion, certain positive influences of the alpine sojourn of cows on cheese processing quality are overruled by the major adverse impact of lower milk protein content. 3acow feeding 3acheesemaking 3akappa-casein 3amountains 3amilk 3arenneting properties 3aaltitude 3arenneting 3ahypoxia 3adairy cows 3ahay 3aplasmin 3aplasminogen 3amilk protein percentage 3aprotein composition 3awhey protein 3aforage quality 3aenzyme activity 3aadverse effects 3aearly lactation 3aglycosylation 3afeed concentrates 3asilage 2aAltitude 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCheesexanalysis 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFemale 2aFibrinolysinxanalysis 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aPoaceae 0aSwitzerland 0amilk quality1 aNigg, D.1 aKunz, C.1 aScheeder, M.R.L.1 aWettstein, H.R.1 aKreuzer, M.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Feb., v. 72, no. 1 p.65-74x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299040006153Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02743naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006600126300001600192500001500208520147500223650001301698650002001711650001201731650001501743650002901758650001501787650002001802650002501822650002101847650002201868650002201890650001101912650002001923650001001943650001801953650002001971650001101991650001602002650001102018653002002029653001502049700001802064700001702082773009502099852000902194939003302203946001302236655001202249IND9304366720221120182216.0930723e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930436672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrear, D.S.10aMetabolism of flumetsulam (DE-498) in wheat, corn, and barley  ap. 178-192.  a2019-12-04  aFlumetsulam (N-[2,6-difluorophenyl]-5-methyl(1,2,4)-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-2 -sulfonamide) was metabolized by similar hydroxylation and glucose conjugation pathways in tolerant corn, wheat, and barley seedlings. Two primary monohydroxylated metabolites, N-[2,6-difluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl]-5-methyl(1, 2,4)-triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-2-sulfonamide (M 1) and N-[2,6-difluorophenyl]-5-hydroxymethyl(1,2,4)-triazolo[1, 5-a]pyrimidine-2-sulfonamide (M 2) and a dihydroxylated metabolite N-[2,6-difluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl]-5-hydroxymethyl(1,2,4)-triazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidine-2-sulfonamide (M 3) were isolated and identified by negative FAB/MS and proton NMR spectroscopy. Isolated secondary O-glucosides of metabolites M 1, M 2 and M 3 were tentatively identified by negative FAB/MS and/or beta-glucosidase hydrolysis. Microsomal cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenases responsible for flumetsulam hydroxylation were isolated from naphthalic anhydride- and ethanol-induced shoot tissues of etiolated corn, wheat, and barley seedlings. Enzyme activity required NADPH and molecular oxygen and was inhibited by carbon monoxide in the dark and by other cytochrome P450 inhibitors. Inhibition by carbon monoxide was reversed by light. Enzyme kinetic and inhibition studies suggested that different cytochrome P450 forms may be involved in flumetsulam hydroxylation at the 4-position on the 2,6-difluorophenyl ring (M 1) and the methyl group on the substituted pyrimidine moiety (M 2). 3aZea mays 3aHordeum vulgare 3aenzymes 3aabsorption 3ametabolic detoxification 3aherbicides 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3abiochemical pathways 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aTriticum aestivum 3aleaves 3acarbon monoxide 3alight 3ahydroxylation 3aenzyme activity 3aoxygen 3ametabolites 3ashoots 0alight relations 0ametabolism1 aSwanson, H.R.1 aTanaka, F.S.0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g1993 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.178-192x0048-35757nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03629naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001900181245007400200300001600274520187500290650000902165650002302174650001502197650001102212650001802223650001902241650001602260650001602276650001602292650002102308650001202329650001002341650001702351650002302368650001602391650001402407650002002421650001202441650001102453650003702464650001102501650001902512650001602531650001602547650003902563650003202602650001902634650001602653650002302669650003902692700001502731773008202746852000902828856008502837930003302922945002502955946001102980655001202991IND4371146320221120182102.0050609e200505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437114632DNAL7 a159096802pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299050008042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSchroder, A.C.14aThe influence of technical factors on differential cell count in milk  ap. 153-158.  aDifferential cell count of milk is a traditional parameter for the evaluation of udder health. The literature shows great variation in differential cell counts of the milk of healthy mammary glands: macrophages range from 0% to 80%, lymphocytes from 1.5% to 79.5%, polymorphonuclear neutrophils from 3% to 95%, and epithelial cells from 1% to 19%. We conducted three studies to seek explanations for such variation. In the first, we evaluated the impact of polyethylene and glass sampling bottles. The aim of the second study was to compare the results of differential cell counts performed by three different technicians. The third study evaluated two methods of smear preparation. When polyethylene plastic bottles were used, the macrophage population was minimized but lymphocytes remained unaffected. This was shown by an exemplary flow cytometric analysis using four monoclonal antibodies against three lymphocyte surface structures. There were significant differences in the differential cell counts of 40 smears made by three technicians despite identical operating procedures. For the sediment smear, milk was centrifuged once and the sediment spread by eye on a glass slide. For the "coffee grinder" smear method, the sample was subjected to four centrifugations and then placed on a cover glass in order to spread the sediment using centrifugal force. The coffee grinder procedure led to a reduction of lymphocytes and an enrichment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils without affecting the macrophage population. Both methods made it possible to distinguish different udder health classes. It can be concluded that differential cell counts are a useful tool for comparing and monitoring udder health only if: samples are taken in a glass bottle; smears are prepared with the identical technique; and the differential cell counts are performed by a single person. 3amilk 3asomatic cell count 3adairy cows 3audders 3aanimal health 3amammary glands 3amacrophages 3alymphocytes 3aneutrophils 3aepithelial cells 3abottles 3aglass 3apolyethylene 3aanalytical methods 3areliability 3aprecision 3abovine mastitis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Countxmethodsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometry 2aLymphocytes 2aMacrophages 2aMammary Glands, Animalxphysiology 2aMastitis, Bovinexdiagnosis 2aMilkxcytology 2aNeutrophils 2aObserver Variation 2aSpecimen Handlingxinstrumentation1 aHamann, J.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 May, v. 72, no. 2 p.153-158x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299050008043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/03/03  aNon-US 7aarticle04974naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100001700179245013700196300001600333500002400349506007600373520278800449506003703237650000803274650002503282650001103307650001703318650002503335650002803360650001603388650002203404650002303426650002403449650001003473650002403483650001903507650002503526650001403551650002003565650002303585650002403608650002703632650002503659650001603684650002203700650008103722650004503803650002403848650002803872650001403900650003203914650002703946650002303973700001903996700001604015700001804031700002104049773009904070852000904169856007804178856003204256655001204288IND4388549620221207115253.0070304e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438854962DNAL7 a172933502pmid7 aPMC28029482pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcl2882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Miao-Lun10aDivergent Evolution of the Chloroplast Small Heat Shock Protein Gene in the Genera Rhododendron (Ericaceae) and Machilus (Lauraceae)  ap. 461-475.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Evolutionary and ecological roles of the chloroplast small heat shock protein (CPsHSP) have been emphasized based on variations in protein contents; however, DNA sequence variations related to the evolutionary and ecological roles of this gene have not been investigated. In the present study, a basal angiosperm, Machilus, together with the eudicot Rhododendron were used to illustrate the evolutionary dynamics of gene divergence in CPsHSPs. METHODS: Degenerate primers were used to amplify CPsHSP-related sequences from 16 Rhododendron and eight Machilus species that occur in Taiwan. Manual DNA sequence alignment was carried out according to the deduced amino acid sequence alignment performed by CLUSTAL X. A neighbour-joining tree was generated in MEGA using conceptual translated amino acid sequences from consensus sequences of cloned CPsHSP genes from eight Machilus and 16 Rhododendron species as well as amino acid sequences of CPsHSPs from five monocots and seven other eudicots acquired from GenBank. CPsHSP amino acid sequences of Funaria hygrometrica were used as the outgroups. The aligned DNA and amino acid sequences were used to estimate several parameters of sequence divergence using the MEGA program. Separate Bayesian inference of DNA sequences of Rhododendron and Machilus species was analysed and the resulting gene trees were used for detection of putative positively selected amino acid sites by the Codeml program implemented in the PAML package. Mean hydrophobicity profile analysis was performed with representative amino acid sequences for both Rhododendron and Machilus species by the Bioedit program. The computer program SplitTester was used to examine whether CPsHSPs of Rhododendron lineages and duplicate copies of the Machilus CPsHSPs have evolved functional divergence based on the hydrophobicity distance matrix. KEY RESULTS: Only one copy of the CPsHSP was found in Rhododendron. However, a higher evolutionary rate of amino acid substitutions in the Hymenanthes lineage of Rhododendron was inferred. Two positively selected amino acid sites may have resulted in higher hydrophobicity in the region of the α-crystallin domain (ACD) of the CPsHSP. By contrast, the basal angiosperm, Machilus, possessed duplicate copies of the CPsHSP, which also differed in their evolutionary rates of amino acid substitutions. However, no apparent relationship of ecological relevance toward the positively selected amino acid sites was found in Machilus. CONCLUSIONS: Divergent evolution was found for both Rhododendron lineages and the paralogues of CPsHSP in Machilus that were directed to the shift in hydrophobicity in the ACD and/or methionine-rich region, which might have played important roles in molecular chaperone activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aFunaria hygrometrica 3aPersea 3aRhododendron 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acid substitution 3aamino acids 3acomputer software 3aconsensus sequence 3adivergent evolution 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3ahydrophobicity 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aprotein content 3asequence alignment 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChloroplastsxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Dosage 2aGenetic Variation 2aHeat-Shock Proteins, Smallxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aLauraceaexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aRhododendronxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment1 aLin, Tsan-Piao1 aLin, Min-Yi1 aCheng, Yu-Pin1 aHwang, Shih-Ying0 tAnnals of botany.g2007 Mar., v. 99, no. 3 p.461-475dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcl2883Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aob.oupjournals.org/ 7aarticle04228naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001800215245014600233300001600379500001500395520197400410650001602384650001102400650002102411650001302432650002102445650001402466650002902480650001502509650002302524650002002547650003102567650001802598650001902616650001702635650002102652650001202673650001202685650002102697650003302718650001002751650001602761650003502777650002502812650001602837650001202853650001102865650001302876650001102889650004502900650003702945650002502982650002903007650005803036650006203094653001603156700001803172700001803190700001603208773008303224852000903307856008503316930003303401945002503434946001103459655001203470IND4370298620221120155152.0050518e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437029862DNAL7 a157477382pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299040005732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Dietary treatments were initiated at approximately 4 weeks prior to expected calving dates and continued for 7 weeks post partum. Treatments prepartum consisted of 1) a basal diet (Control), 2) basal diet+150 g/d of CLA mix (CLA), or 3) basal diet+150 g/d of trans 18:1 mix (TRANS). Intakes of calcium salts of CLA and trans 18:1 mixes were adjusted to 225 g/d during the 7-week post-partum treatment period. Blood samples were collected at weeks 1, 2 and 4 post partum and plasma was harvested immediately for subsequent hormone and metabolite assays. Concentrations of insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and leptin in blood did not vary among cows fed the three diets. Plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations decreased between weeks 1 and 4 of lactation and were lower in cows fed the diet supplemented with trans 18:1 than in those fed a control diet at week 2 post partum. Periparturient fat supplementation had no detectable effects on CPT1 mRNA content in the liver. Steady-state concentration of MTP mRNA in the liver was greater in the TRANS treatment group than in the control group at week 1 post partum. Feeding trans 18:1 supplements to transition dairy cows upregulated hepatic PPARalpha mRNA content during the first month of lactation. Under the present experimental conditions, dietary CLA had minimal effects on plasma and hepatic lipid metabolite concentrations in early lactation Holstein cows. Results indicate that dietary trans fatty acids may affect liver lipid metabolism in post-partum dairy cows through alterations in PPARalpha gene expression. 3acow feeding 3aleptin 3afree fatty acids 3aHolstein 3aliver microsomes 3areceptors 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adairy cows 3atransport proteins 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3afeed additives 3astearic acid 3atriacylglycerols 3acalving 3ainsulin 3alipid metabolism 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aliver 3aperoxisomes 3acarnitine palmitoyltransferase 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDairying 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPPAR alphaxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aStearic Acidsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aTrans Fatty Acidsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 0ametabolites1 aStaples, C.R.1 aLuchini, N.D.1 aBadinga, L.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Feb., v. 72, no. 1 p.107-114x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299040005733Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03462naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002300179245011800202300001800320500002400338500001500362506007600377520154200453506003701995650002802032650001302060650001302073650000902086650001202095650001502107650002002122650001102142650002302153650002002176650003402196650000902230650001102239650003002250650002002280650002602300650002102326650006102347650003502408650005802443650002302501650001502524653001202539700002002551700002202571700002002593700002202613700001802635773010802653852000902761856007802770655001202848IND4423327920221207115539.0090718e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442332792DNAL7 a195023822pmid7 aPMC27095492pmcid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcp0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara, Masayuki10aProteome Analysis of Detergent-Resistant Membranes (DRMs) Associated with OsRac1-Mediated Innate Immunity in Rice  ap. 1191-1200.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOsRac1, a member of the Rac/Rop GTPase family, plays important roles as a molecular switch in rice innate immunity, and the active form of OsRac1 functions in the plasma membrane (PM). To study the precise localization of OsRac1 in the PM and its possible association with other signaling components, we performed proteomic analysis of DRMs (detergent-resistant membranes) isolated from rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged constitutively active (CA) OsRac1. DRMs are regions of the PM that are insoluble after Triton X-100 treatment under cold conditions and are thought to be involved in various signaling processes in animal, yeast and plant cells. We identified 192 proteins in DRMs that included receptor-like kinases (RLKs) such as Xa21, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR)-type disease resistance proteins, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, syntaxin, NADPH oxidase, a WD-40 repeat family protein and various GTP-binding proteins. Many of these proteins have been previously identified in the DRMs isolated from other plant species, and animal and yeast cells, validating the methods used in our study. To examine the possible association of DRMs and OsRac1-mediated innate immunity, we used rice suspension-cultured cells transformed with myc-tagged wild-type (WT) OsRac1 and found that OsRac1 and RACK1A, an effector of OsRac1, shifted to the DRMs after chitin elicitor treatment. These results suggest that OsRac1-mediated innate immunity is associated with DRMs in the PM.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aimmunity 3aproteome 3arice 3aanimals 3aG-proteins 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3ayeasts 3adisease resistance 3aplasma membrane 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3acold 3achitin 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aDetergentsxchemistry 2aImmunity, Innate 2aMembrane Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aOryzaximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProteomexanalysis 2aProteomics 0akinases1 aHamada, Satoshi1 aHiratsuka, Minori1 aFukao, Yoichiro1 aKawasaki, Tsutomu1 aShimamoto, Ko0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2009 July, v. 50, no. 7 p.1191-1200dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcp0773Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03431naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002900128245013700157300001400294500001500308520196600323650003502289650002102324650000802345650003002353650001002383650006802393650002802461650004902489650003302538650001902571650002002590650002102610650003302631650003302664650001802697650003702715650002402752653001402776653003002790700002102820773006702841852000902908939003302917946001102950655001202961IND9304365620221120151129.0930723e19930506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930436562DNAL7 a84795382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegensburg-Tuink, A.J.G.10aTransgenic N. glauca plants expressing bacterial virulence gene virF are converted into hosts for nopaline strains of A. tumefaciens  ap. 69-71.  a2019-12-04  aTumours are induced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens on a variety of plants. The virulence determinants of A. tumefaciens reside on a large tumour-inducing (Ti) plasmid. This plasmid carries two regions essential for tumour induction, namely the T region and the Vir region. During infection the T region is transferred to the plant cell, where it becomes stably integrated in one of the host chromosomes as T-DNA. Expression of T-DNA leads to the production of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin, as well as to the synthesis of specific amino-acid derivatives termed opines. Agrobacterium strains are classified according to the types of opines produced by the tumours they induce. The Vir region contains genes that are expressed in the bacterium and are required for T-DNA transfer to plant cells, and several other genes that affect the efficiency of transfer and the host range. Vir regions from different Ti plasmids may vary slightly in the genes they contain: for instance, the virF gene, which is present in the Vir-region of octopine Ti plasmids, is absent from nopaline Ti plasmids. Mutation of the virF gene leads to a weakened virulence of octopine strains on tomato and Nicotiana glauca (shrub tobacco). Nopaline strains are strongly attenuated in N. glanca compared with octopine strains because of the absence of the virF virulence gene from the Ti plasmid in nopaline strains. The virF gene product may be transferred to and be active in plant cells. Here we isolate transgenic N. glauca plants in which the virF coding sequence is expressed using the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. The presence of the VirF protein converts the non-host N. glauca into a host for tumour formation by A. tumefaciens nopaline strains and octopine virF mutants. Our results indicate that certain virulence gene products such as the Virf protein may be transferred to plant cells during tumour induction, where they function as mediators of T-DNA transfer. 3agenetically modified organisms 3aNicotiana glauca 3aDNA 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3agenes 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aArgininexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Toxic 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aVirulencexgenetics 0aNicotiana 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aHooykaas, P.J.J.0 tNature.g1993 May 6, v. 363, no. 6424 p.69-71x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01414naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245010300131520055500234650002900789650002300818650002100841651001600862653003400878655000900912773015200921852000901073939003301082945000801115946001301123655001201136991614728230742620221120151019.0880825s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880027892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRopes, G.H.14aThe Nutri-Pak--experience with an indigenous supplementary feeding intervention in the Philippines  aA report describes the development and application of a nutrition intervention program in the Philippines, termed "Nutri-Pak."

Although the functions of most TFIID subunits are unknown, it is clear that TAFs are not necessary for basal activity but that one or more are required for regulated transcription, and so behave as coactivators. The presence of multiple subunits indicates that there is an intricate assembly process and that TAFs may be responsible for other activities. We have described the properties of the subunit dTAF(II)110, which can interact directly with the transcriptional activator Sp1. In addition, the largest subunit, dTAF(II)250, binds directly to TBP and links other TAFs to the complex. Here we describe the cloning, expression and partial characterization of the Drosophila TAF of Mr, 80,000, dTAF(II)80. Sequence analysis reveals that dTAF(II)80 contains several copies of the WD40 (beta-transducin) repeat. Moreover, dTAF(II)80 shares extended sequence similarity with an Arabidopsis gene, COP1, which encodes a putative transcription factor that is thought to regulate development. We have expressed recombinant dTAF(II)80 and begun to characterize its interaction with other members of the TFIID complex. Purified recombinant dTAF(II)80 is unable to bind TBP directly or to interact strongly with the C-terminal domain of dTAF(II)250 (delta N250). Instead, dTAF(II)80 is only able to recognize and interact with a higher-order complex containing TBP, delta N250, 110 and 60. These findings suggest the formation of TFIID may require an ordered assembly of the TAFs, some of which bind directly to TBP and others that are tethered to the complex as a result of specific TAF/TAF interactions. 3aDrosophila 3aRNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aWeinzierl, R.O.J.1 aAdmon, A.1 aTjian, R.0 tNature.g1993 May 13, v. 363, no. 6425 p.176-179x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03004naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002600136245013100162300001600293500002400309520183700333650001002170650003202180650001702212650002102229650001502250650001502265650003202280650001002312650001102322650001202333650001102345650001402356700001702370700001802387700001902405700001902424773010302443852000902546856003902555655001202594IND4444152620221120141815.0101022e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444415262DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.11472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaeubert, Jens‐Eike10aSuitability of different salmonid strains as hosts for the endangered freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.)  ap. 728-734.  aIncludes references  a1. The complex life cycle of endangered European freshwater pearl mussel Margaritifera margaritifera L. involves an obligatory parasitic phase on a host fish. Knowledge on the host-parasite interaction and on the suitability of different host fish species and strains is required both for the management of wild fish and mussel populations as well as for improving the efficiency of captive breeding methods. 2. In this study, the suitability of different salmonid strains for hosting glochidia was tested, including Danube salmon (Hucho hucho L.) and three brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) strains from inside and outside the freshwater pearl mussel distribution range. All brown trout strains as well as Danube salmon were successfully infected with freshwater pearl mussel glochidia and encystment of mussel larvae was detected. 3. One brown trout strain originating from the natural pearl mussel distribution range was identified as the most suitable host, revealing the highest fish‐weight‐normalized infection rates and highest glochidial growth rates, whereas endemic Danube salmon was least suitable. Under natural conditions, the role of Danube salmon may be attributed to the long‐distance dispersal of glochidia in the Danube system, whereas sedentary brown trout appear to be the most important hosts at a local scale. 4. Successful infection of suitable hosts and the maintenance of these host-parasite systems in calcareous water were demonstrated in this study. These results indicate that neither the infection process nor the encystment phase of freshwater pearl mussels is dependent on low lime concentrations. 5. The results of this study suggest that careful selection and management of appropriate host fish strains is mandatory for sustainable conservation management of freshwater pearl mussel populations. 3aHucho 3aMargaritifera margaritifera 3aSalmo trutta 3abreeding methods 3aencystment 3afreshwater 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahosts 3alarvae 3amussels 3asalmon 3awild fish1 aDenic, Marco1 aGum, Bernhard1 aLange, Michael1 aGeist, Juergen0 tAquatic conservation.g2010 Nov., v. 20, no. 7 p.728-734dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1052-76137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.1147 7aarticle02848naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245014800176300001500324500002400339520163100363650002801994650002402022650001502046650001102061650001902072650000902091650001202100650002302112650001102135650001002146650001402156650001102170650002002181650001302201700002302214700002102237773011602258852000902374856005502383655001202438IND4449967620221120141826.0110225e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444996762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.2010.00789.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner, Marilyn Y.10aImpact of two formulations of the acaricide bifenazate on the spider mite predator Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae)  ap. 99-105.  aIncludes references  aTwo formulations of the novel miticide bifenazate, Floramite SC (240 g/L bifenazate) and Acramite SC (480 g/L bifenazate) were separately evaluated at a rate of 310 mg a.i./L (1.3 mL/L Floramite or 0.65 mL/L Acramite) for side effects on the phytoseiid predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. Tests included a combination of contact and residual treatment by overhead spray, direct contact by immersion, residual contact with treated leaf discs and repellency of a treated surface. Spray application of Acramite to protonymphs and to adult females on leaf discs did not cause increased mortality over 5 days to either stage. Oviposition by treated adults was not affected over 5 days. Egg-laying by adult females sprayed as protonymphs was reduced, but fewer males and inadequate food supply may have been partly responsible. For adult females treated as nymphs by micro-immersion in Floramite or Acramite, there were no significant differences between treated and untreated P. persimilis in mortality or oviposition. For both formulations, there was a significant reduction in oviposition rate of the first generation reared from eggs deposited on treated foliage, but the reduction was <20%. Foliar applications of both formulations to leaf discs were repellent to adult females, resulting in reduced oviposition. The repellency from a treated surface and low direct and indirect toxicity suggests that application of both Acramite and Floramite against two-spotted mite, Tetranychus urticae, at the currently recommended rate of 310 mg a.i./L would be compatible with use of P. persimilis, particularly as a spot treatment. 3aPhytoseiulus persimilis 3aTetranychus urticae 3aacaricides 3aadults 3adirect contact 3aeggs 3afemales 3afoliar application 3aleaves 3amales 3amortality 3anymphs 3apredatory mites 3atoxicity1 aSpohr, Lorraine J.1 aGoodwin, Stephen0 tAustralian journal of entomology.g2011 Feb., v. 50, no. 1 p.99-105dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1326-67567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2010.00789.x 7aarticle01627naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245011900132300001600251300003000267520060900297650001600906650002200922650001600944650002100960650002000981650002601001653002301027653002201050653001901072700001601091773008201107852001301189939003301202945000801235946001301243852000901256655001201265991614726160742620221120125404.0880330s1987    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870033192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, C.J.10aUse and cost of electricity for selected processes specific to a hospital cook-chill/freeze food-production system  ap. 159-169.  ap. 159-169. ill., charts.  aA study assessed the consumption and cost of electricity for a cook-chill/freeze food production system in the food service operation of a 500-bed hospital.

P. amygdalus Batsch] to Resolve Previous Confusion in Its Sf-RNase Sequence  ap. 609-613.  aMost of the self-compatible (SC) cultivars of almond [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb. syn. P. amygdalus Batsch] have the Sf haplotype. In this study, we cloned and characterized the S locus region of the Sf haplotype of SC 'Lauranne'. The relative transcriptional orientation of SFBf and Sf-RNase and the physical distance between them are similar to those of other functional self-incompatible (SI) S haplotypes of Prunus, indicating that the genomic structure of the SC Sf haplotype appears to be intact. Although there is no apparent mutation in the coding sequence of SFBf, the Sf-RNase sequence in this study and previously reported Sf-RNase sequences show discrepancies. First, as opposed to previous indications, the 'Lauranne' Sf-RNase sequence encodes a histidine residue in place of a previously reported arginine residue in the conserved C2 region of Prunus S-RNase. Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products from the Sf-RNase of 'Tuono' confirmed that 'Tuono' Sf-RNase also encodes the histidine residue. We found another difference in the 'Lauranne' Sf-RNase sequence and other reported Sf-RNase sequences. Namely, 'Lauranne' Sf-RNase encodes a phenylalanine residue in place of a previously reported leucine residue in the conserved C5 region of Prunus S-RNase. This is also the case for 'Tuono' Sf-RNase. Expression analysis of Sf-RNase and SFBf by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that Sf-RNase transcripts were barely detectable in pistil, whereas SFBf transcripts were accumulated at a similar level to the level that was observed with SFB of other functional SI S haplotypes of almond. We discuss the possible molecular mechanisms of SC observed with the Sf haplotype with special references to the expression of Sf-RNase. 3aPrunus dulcis 3aalmonds 3acultivars 3acloning (plants) 3aselfing 3aplant fertility 3agenes 3aloci 3agenetic distance 3ahaplotypes 3aribonucleases 3anucleotide sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aFukuta, Kyoko1 aYamane, Hisayo1 aEsumi, Tomoya1 aTao, Ryutaro1 aGradziel, T.q(Thomas)1 aDandekar, Abhaya M.1 aFernández i Martí, Ángel1 aAlonso, Jose M.1 aSocias i Company, Rafel0 tHortScience.g2009 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.609-613x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/07/24  aOther US 7aarticle01238naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009200127300001600219520036400235650002200599650001100621650001300632650001300645650001800658650003600676653002300712700001600735700001500751700001200766773008100778852000900859939003300868946001100901655001200912IND9304361120221120115844.0930723e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930436112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoneyama, T.10aFractionation of nitrogen isotopes by glutamine synthetase isolated from spinach leaves  ap. 489-491.  aThe isotopic fractionation of nitrogen in the reaction in vitro of glutamine synthetase isolated from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves was calculated from the changes in natural 15N abundance (delta 15N value) of ammonia and amide of glutamine during the incubation.

W12426 (13 p.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper investigates the feasibility of periodic tracers (i.e., tracers injected in a periodic waveform) for subsurface characterization using numerical simulations. From a theoretical point of view, periodic tracers offer many advantages over conventional pulse or continuous tracers. For example, periodic tracers are more sensitive to various transport and reaction processes and are less susceptible to corruption by environmental noise. With the recent advances in computer-controlled injection technologies, time is now ripe for investigating the feasibility of these tracers for laboratory and field tracer tests. A series of numerical sensitivity analyses are performed in this study for assessing the sensitivity of these signals for various transport and reaction phenomena in the subsurface. Sensitivity coefficients are calculated and compared for conventional and periodic tracers for various transport phenomena. An inverse modeling case study is performed to evaluate the potential of periodic tracers for detecting the location and concentration of biological active zones. The results indicate that periodic tracers have the potential to perform significantly better than conventional tracers. 3alabeling techniques 3asimulation models 3asoil water content 3awave physics 3asoil water 3asoil transport processes 3asubsurface flow 0amathematical models 0asoil hydraulic properties 0amethodology 0anew methods 0ahydrology1 aMoline, G.R.1 aWebb, O.F.0 tWater resources research.g2005 Dec., v. 41, no. 12 p.W12426 (13 p-W12426 (13 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/01/28  aOther US 7aarticle02560naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245016400125300001600289520150000305650002001805650001901825650002201844650001601866650001601882650001701898650002401915650002901939653001501968653001501983653003601998700001502034700001502049773008102064852000902145939003302154946001102187655001202198IND9304360820221120105917.0930723e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930436082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, Y.10aEffects of 5-aminolevulinic acid on the accumulation of chlorophyll b and apoproteins of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-protein complex of photosystem II  ap. 465-472.  aThe effects were examined of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) on the accumulation of Chl and apoproteins of light-harvesting Chl a/b-protein complex of photosystem II (LHCII) in cucumber cotyledons under intermittent light. A supply of ALA preferentially increased the accumulation of Chl a during intermittent illumination. However, when cotyledons were pretreated with a brief exposure to light or benzyladenine (BA), the stimulatory effect of ALA on the increase in the level of Chl b was greater than that in the level of Chl a, resulting in decreased ratios of Chl a/b. Time-course experiments with preilluminated cotyledons revealed that LHCII apoproteins accumulated rapidly within the first 30 min of intermittent illumination with a decline during subsequent incubation in darkness. A supply of ALA did not affect the accumulation of LHCII apoproteins during the intermittent light period, but it efficiently inhibited the decline in their levels during the subsequent darkness. After exposure to a single pulse of light of BA-treated cotyledons, the prompt increase in levels of LHCII apoproteins was not accompanied by the formation of Chl b, which began to accumulate later. The pattern of changes in levels of LHCII apoproteins was quite similar to that in levels of Chl a. These results suggest that LHCII apoproteins are first stabilized by binding with Chl a and that an increased supply of Chl a and the accumulation of LHCII apoproteins are prerequisites for the formation of Chl b. 3aCucumis sativus 3aphotosystem II 3aprotein synthesis 3aapoproteins 3achlorophyll 3abiosynthesis 3aaminolevulinic acid 3alight harvesting complex 0aprecursors 0aregulation 0achlorophyll a/b binding protein1 aTanaka, A.1 aTsukji, H.0 tPlant & cell physiology.g1993 Apr., v. 34, no. 3 p.465-472x0032-07817nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03163naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245010900159300001600268500001500284520167200299650001301971650003401984650001902018650001802037650003002055650002302085650003202108650001202140650001602152650001802168650002302186650001002209650002302219650002002242650002502262650002702287650002002314650004302334653002502377653002802402653001202430700001902442700002302461773006902484852000902553930003302562945002502595946001302620655001202633IND4422567020221120105954.0090630e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442256702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJi, Yuanfu10aToward Fine Mapping of the Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus Resistance Gene Ty-2 on Chromosome 11 of Tomato  ap. 614-618.  a2019-12-04  aThe whitefly-transmitted Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is a major pathogen of tomatoes grown in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Several genes of different origins conferring resistance to TYLCV have been introgressed to the cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), including the single dominant gene, Ty-2, that originated from S. habrochiates and was previously mapped to a 19-cM region on the long arm of chromosome 11 delimited by restriction fragment length polymorphism markers TG36 and TG393. In the present study, we confirmed the dominant inheritance of the Ty-2 gene from TYLCV evaluation and molecular marker analysis of an F2 segregating population derived from a commercial hybrid that carries the Ty-2 gene. Evaluating recombinants recovered from the F2 progeny for TYLCV resistance localized the Ty-2 gene to a marker interval of 5.5 cM between C2_At1g07960 (82.5 cM) and C2_At4g32930 (88 cM). Additional recombinants were identified for the target region carrying the Ty-2 gene. TYLCV evaluation of the progeny from these recombinants further delimited the Ty-2 gene to a 4.5-cM interval between C2_At1g07960 (82.5 cM) and cLEN-11-F24 (87 cM). The smaller introgressions no longer include the fusarium wilt race 2 resistance locus (I-2), which should facilitate combining the two resistance genes in cis configuration. The polymerase chain reaction-based markers developed from the present study can be used to precisely monitor the introgression of the Ty-2 gene, thus offering the opportunity to pyramid TYLCV resistance genes from different sources as well as resistance genes for other pathogens into elite tomato cultivars. 3atomatoes 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3aplant breeding 3agene transfer 3amarker-assisted selection 3agenetic resistance 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3ahybrids 3aDNA primers 3apathogenicity 3achromosome mapping 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3aprogeny testing 3anucleotide sequences 3ainheritance (genetics) 3agenetic markers 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0aSolanum habrochiates 0amolecular sequence data 0aSolanum1 aScott, John W.1 aSchuster, David J.0 tHortScience.g2009 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.614-618x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/07/24  aOther US 7aarticle01485naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245008400136300001600220300003000236520059000266650001300856650002800869650003000897653002200927653002700949653002700976700002301003773008201026852000901108939003301117945000801150946001301158655001201171991614722750742620221123001147.0831128s1983    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI830031902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Mahmood A.10aComparative evaluation of manager performance in selected types of foodservices  ap. 163-170.  ap. 163-170. ill., charts.  aA survey was conducted to assess foodservice managers' performance in regular and fast food restaurants, hospitals, nursing homes, colleges, and schools.

  1 aSteinheim, G.10aGenotype by environment interaction for lamb weaning weight in two Norwegian sheep breeds  ap. 33-39.  a2019-12-04  aGenotype x environment interaction (G x E) effects on live weaning weights of lambs were studied by using the 2 breeds Norwegian White sheep (NWS; heavy, long-tailed) and Spel sheep (Spel; lighter, short-tailed) as genetic groups (G). A total of 37,338 NWS lambs and 30,075 Spel lambs born from 1989 to 1999 on 40 farms that kept both breeds together were included in the analyses. Environment was characterized by farm x year (E). In a mixed linear model framework, significance of the random G x E effect and breed-specific environmental variances were tested by using a log-likelihood approach. Directions and magnitudes of the effect were described through variance component estimates. An across-genotype environmental correlation was also used. There was a significant G x E effect on lamb BW; significant breed differences were found for variance of flock x year effects, indicating different phenotypic plasticities with changing flock x year environments, with the NWS being more sensitive to environmental change. Further, the breed-specific residual variance was greater for NWS, indicating that the effects of environmental variation were larger for the weaning weights of the NWS breed within flock and year. Further, the correlation between flock x year effects for the 2 breeds was significantly different from unity (0.82 ± 0.02), indicating that the common environment is "perceived" differently in the 2 breeds. The best environment for one breed is not necessarily best for the other breed, and vice versa. Solutions of flock x year effects may be used to describe how environmental characteristics such as climate and topography affect the production of different genotypes, and for clustering of environments, thus facilitating improvement of breeding programs and management schemes for domestic and wild ungulate populations. 3abreed differences 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphenotype 3aenvironmental factors 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agenotype 3alambs 3aweaning weight 3agenetic variation 3asheep breeds 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aEnvironment 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aSheepxgenetics 2aTime Factors 2aWeaning 3aNorway 0aNorway 0abody weight1 aØdegård, J.1 aÅdnøy, T.1 aKlemetsdal, G.0 tJournal of animal science.g2008 Jan., v. 86, no. 1 p.33-39dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2007-00313Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle02014naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011600125300001600241500001500257520083900272650001301111650001001124650002801134650002601162650000901188650002801197650001601225650001901241650001601260650001001276650002601286650001101312653002801323653001501351653002801366653001801394653001701412700001701429773007901446852000901525939003301534946001301567655001201580IND9304359020221122225402.0930723s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930435902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNenova, V.10aPhysiological and biochemical changes in young maize plants under iron deficiency.

At 14, 21, and 28 days, parameters characterizing growth and photosynthesis were determined. Iron-deficiency resulted in significant changes in biomass accumulation and distribution between vegetative organs as well as changes in the content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and the carotenoids. The photosynthetic rate per leaf area was decreased. Part of 14C incorporated in low molecular compounds was increased and the share of amino acids and organic acids in them was increased. Plants supplied with 1/10th of the optimum Fe required partially adapted to the Fe deficiency. Plants with visual symptoms of Fe-deficiency showed some peculiarities as compared to those plants severely Fe-deficient. 3aZea mays 3astems 3aorganic acids and salts 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3adry matter partitioning 3acarotenoids 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3aroots 3aamino acid metabolism 3aleaves 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0aadaptation 0adry matter accumulation 0achlorophyll b 0achorophyll a1 aStoyanov, I.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g1993, v. 16, no. 5 p.835-849x0190-41677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01842naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006700127300001600194520077300210650002300983650002101006650002201027650002301049650002401072650002601096650001801122650001101140650002001151650001401171650001401185650002801199650001101227650001001238650001901248650001201267653001901279773007901298852000901377939003301386946001301419655001201432IND9304358920221122213024.0930723s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930435892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpiers, J.M.10aCalcium, magnesium, and sodium uptake in rabbit-ey blueberries  ap. 825-833.  aIn a sand culture study with rabbiteye blueberries (Vaccinium ashei Reade), increasing Na fertilization levels increased leaf concentrations of Na, Mg, Ca, Mn, and Zn, and reduced leaf K plus plant growth.

One hundred and thirty-six pigs were assigned to three treatments: entire male pigs (n = 64), immunocastration against GnRH (n = 48) and surgical castration (n = 24). Surgical castration was performed before the age of 1 week. Vaccination comprised two injections: the first injection was given 8 to 11 weeks before slaughter and the second injection 4 weeks before slaughter. After the second injection, immunocastrated pigs showed less non-violent social and aggressive behaviours than entire male pigs of the same age. Mounting was reduced to the same low level as observed in surgically castrated pigs, and more immunocastrated pigs were without skin lesions compared with entire male pigs. Pigs that received the second injection only 1 week before the observation day did not differ significantly in behaviour from those that received the injection 3 weeks before the observation day. Thus, the behaviour seems to change soon after the second injection and these changes remain until slaughter. 3aanimal behavior 3aboars 3aboar taint 3adose response 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3avaccines 3aanimal welfare 3adosage 3ahormone antagonists 3avaccination 3amating behavior 3acastration 0afighting 0ainhibitors 0aimmunocastration1 aLundstrom, K.1 aAndersson, K.0 tAnimal.g2010 June, v. 4, no. 6 p.965-972dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173111000011X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/07/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01828naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245009000138300001500228300002900243520098400272650002301256650002801279650002401307653001101331653001701342653002301359773008101382852000901463939003301472945000801505946001301513655001201526991614719160742620221122025638.0840314s1983    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840044812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWrisley, Albert L.10aFood cost control for hotels part II. A computerized food planning and control system  ap. 95-125.  ap. 95-125. ill., charts.  aThe design of a computerized information system is described for moderate-volume commercial foodservice operations. The overall objective was to provide management with a cost-effective system for forecasting, purchasing needs, inventories, costs, and revenues. Data are entered from a single local terminal and maintained in 6 files, the 3 most important being the ingredient (inventory) file, the recipe file, and the menu file. The food items are coded according to food group. File data are manipulated by 10 software programs. The system establishes a menu file that is a collection of recipes, a recipe file that is a collection of ingredients (or inventory food items), and then works backward through the files to calculate revenues and costs from forecast or actual sales to yield a precost. The system should pay for itself with rather modest savings in food cost. Numerous tables and information flow diagrams describing the system and its operation are included.

A P. putida mutant unable to grow with proline as the sole carbon and nitrogen source was isolated after random mini-Tn5-Km mutagenesis. The mini-Tn5 insertion was located at the putA gene, which is adjacent to and divergent from the putP gene. The putA gene codes for a protein of 1,315 amino acid residues which is homologous to the PutA protein of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and several Rhizobium strains. The central part of P. putida PutA showed homology to the proline dehydrogenase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster, whereas the C-terminal end was homologous to the pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase of S. cerevisiae and a number of aldehyde dehydrogenases. This suggests that in P. putida, both enzymatic steps for proline conversion to glutamic acid are catalyzed by a single polypeptide. The putP gene was homologous to the putP genes of several prokaryotic microorganisms, and its gene product is an integral inner-membrane protein involved in the uptake of proline. The expression of both genes was induced by proline added in the culture medium and was regulated by PutA. In a P. putida putA-deficient background, expression of both putA and putP genes was maximal and proline independent. Corn root exudates collected during 7 days also strongly induced the P. putida put genes, as determined by using fusions of the put promotors to 'lacZ. The induction ratio for the putA promoter (about 20-fold) was 6-fold higher than the induction ratio for the put P promoter.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amessenger RNA 3aZea mays 3aaldehyde oxidoreductases 3asoil bacteria 3aproline 3aroot exudates 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3agenes 3abacterial proteins 3aplasma membrane 3aamino acid metabolism 3apromoter regions 3aPseudomonas putida 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Transport Systems, Neutral 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxdrug effects 2aGene Library 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aProlinexmetabolism 2aProline Oxidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPseudomonas putidaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0aputa gene 0aputp gene 0aputp promoter 0aproline dehydrogenase 0amolecular sequence data 0aputa promoter 0ametabolism 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/af153207 0aoxidoreductases 0anucleotide sequences1 aMolina, L.1 aRamos, C.1 aRamos, J.L.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2000 Jan., v. 182, no. 1 p.91-99x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.182.1.91-99.20003Available from publisher's Web site  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03519naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001900182245012200201300001600323500002400339500001500363520148300378650002801861650001801889650002101907650002501928650001901953650001701972650001601989650001902005650003602024650002602060650004702086650001102133650002702144650003102171650002002202650001102222650004202233650002602275650002102301650002802322650004202350650002502392650002002417650001802437650002402455650005702479653001902536700001802555700002302573773011002596852000902706856008502715930003302800945002502833946001102858655001202869IND4437186320221122005957.0100518e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443718632DNAL7 a200533162pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299099904832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ5011 aCzank, Charles10aSimultaneous pasteurization and homogenization of human milk by combining heat and ultrasound: effect on milk quality  ap. 183-189.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe combination of ultrasound and heat (thermoultrasound) is an emerging food preservation technique that retains higher quantities of bioactive components compared with current thermal pasteurization practice, but has not yet been assessed for pasteurizing human milk. Artificially contaminated human milk samples were treated with ultrasound (20 kHz, 150 watts) with and without heating. The retention of four human milk proteins was quantified by biochemical assay and laser scattering particle sizing was used to determine the extent of homogenization. While ultrasonic treatment was effective at inactivating Escherichia coli (D4 °C=5·94 min), Staphylococcus epidermidis exhibited resistance (D4 °C=16·01 min). Thermoultrasonic treatment was considerably more effective (Esch. coli D45 °C=1·74 min, D50 °C=0·89 min; Staph. epidermidis D45 °C=2·08 min, D50 °C=0·94 minutes) with a predicted retention (2·8 min treatment, 50°C) of secretory IgA lysozyme, lactoferrin and bile salt stimulated lipase of 91, 80, 77, and 45%, respectively. Homogenization of the milk samples occurred after 5 min and 2 min of ultrasonic and thermoultrasonic treatment, respectively. Thermoultrasonic treatment is an effective method for pasteurizing donor human milk and retaining a greater proportion of bioactive components compared with current practices. However, further studies are required to assess the practicality of applying this technique routinely to donor human milk. 3afood processing quality 3amilk analysis 3amilk composition 3aultrasonic treatment 3apasteurization 3amilk quality 3abreast milk 3ahomogenization 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxanalysis 2aDisinfectionxmethods 2aEscherichia colixisolation & purification 2aFemale 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin A, Secretoryxanalysis 2aLactoferrinxanalysis 2aLipasexanalysis 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 2aMilk, Humanxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aMuramidasexanalysis 2aNutritive Value 2aParticle Size 2aSonicationxmethods 2aStaphylococcus epidermidisxisolation & purification 0aheat treatment1 aSimmer, Karen1 aHartmann, Peter E.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2010 May, v. 77, no. 2 p.183-189dCambridge University Pressx0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299099904833Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/07/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03518naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011400182300001600296500002400312520149100336650002501827650002601852650001701878650001501895650001401910650002701924650001001951650001801961650002101979650001202000650001902012650002002031650001302051650001102064650001402075650002702089650006002116650004502176650004302221650003502264650006202299650001302361650004102374650004402415650005502459650005402514650005202568650002402620650002802644700001602672700002302688700001902711700002302730773008202753852000902835856004802844655001202892IND4416990720221121233303.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441699072DNAL7 a191486702pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-009-0890-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgusa, Mayumi14aThe jasmonate signaling pathway in tomato regulates susceptibility to a toxin-dependent necrotrophic pathogen  ap. 965-976.  aIncludes references  aThe plant hormone, jasmonic acid (JA), is known to have a critical role in both resistance and susceptibility against bacterial and fungal pathogen attack. However, little is known about the involvement of JA in the interactions between plants and toxigenic necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Using the tomato pathotype of Alternaria alternata (Aa) and its AAL-toxin/tomato interaction as a model system, we demonstrate a possible role for JA in susceptibility of plants against pathogens, which utilize host-specific toxins as virulence effectors. Disease development and in planta growth of the tomato pathotype of Aa were decreased in the def1 mutant, defective in biosynthesis of JA, compared with the wild-type (WT) cultivar. Exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) application restored pathogen disease symptoms to the def1 mutant and led to increased disease in the WT. On the other hand, necrotic cell death was similarly induced by AAL-toxin both on def1 and WT, and MeJA application to the tomatoes did not affect the degree of cell death by the toxin. These results indicate that the JA-dependent signaling pathway is not involved in host basal defense responses against the tomato pathotype of Aa, but rather might affect pathogen acceptability via a toxin-independent manner. Data further suggest that JA has a promotional effect on susceptibility of tomato to toxigenic and necrotrophic pathogens, such that pathogens might utilize the JA signaling pathway for successful infection. 3aAlternaria alternata 3aAlternaria tenuissima 3abiosynthesis 3acell death 3acultivars 3agrowth and development 3ahosts 3ajasmonic acid 3amethyl jasmonate 3amutants 3aplant hormones 3aplant pathogens 3atomatoes 3atoxins 3avirulence 2aAcetatesxpharmacology 2aAlternariaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aImmunity, Innatexdrug effects 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMutation 2aOxylipinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transduction 2aSphingosinexmetabolism1 aOzawa, Rika1 aTakabayashi, Junji1 aOtani, Hiroshi1 aKodama, Motoichiro0 tPlanta.g2009 Mar., v. 229, no. 4 p.965-976dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-0890-x 7aarticle02474naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011200172300001600284520145200300653001601752653001601768653002001784653000901804653001801813653001801831700001901849700002201868700002101890773012301911852000902034856009202043946001302135655001202148IND4438993520221121224321.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443899352DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06793.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawaguchi, Koji10aGABA modulates development of cerebellar Purkinje cell dendrites under control of endocannabinoid signaling  ap. 627-638.  aJ. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 627-638. Purkinje cells (PCs) are the sole projection neurons in the cerebellar cortex with highly arborized dendrites, on which they receive glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs. Whereas influences of glutamatergic inputs on dendritic development of PCs have been well studied, those of GABA remain elusive. Here we examined effects of GABAergic signaling on dendritogenesis of PCs in dissociated cerebellar cultures. Treatment with GABAA agonists such as muscimol altered Purkinje dendrites to longer and less branched morphology, while GABAA antagonists resulted in shorter dendrites. In contrast, neither a GABAB agonist nor antagonist had major effects on dendritic morphology. Simultaneous addition of a glutamatergic antagonist cocktail or the Trk receptor antagonist K252a did not block muscimol. Furthermore, blockade of endocannabinoid signaling by either AM251 or tetrahydrolipstatin resulted in longer and less branched dendrites similar to those treated with GABAA agonists suggesting upstream regulation by endocannabinoids. Notably, whereas Purkinje dendrites extended in random directions in the presence of muscimol, they oriented to coexisting GABAergic interneurons when treated with AM251. Taken together, our results postulate the hypothesis that GABA released from the cerebellar interneurons modulates dendritogenesis of PCs in an endocannabinoid-dependent manner in the developing cerebellar cortex. 0abasket cell 0acannabinoid 0adendritogenesis 0aGABA 0aPurkinje cell 0astellate cell1 aHabara, Tomomi1 aTerashima, Toshio1 aKikkawa, Satoshi0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 July, v. 114, no. 2 p.627-638dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06793.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02747naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245015600165300001600321500002400337520139700361650002801758650003401786650001101820650001801831650001501849650001201864650001201876650002401888650001101912650002001923650002201943650000901965650001501974650000901989650001301998650001302011650000902024650001202033650001502045650001102060700001802071700002102089773009402110852000902204856005202213655001202265IND4439369220221121171110.0100702e20100715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443936922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBewley, Dan10aVariability of snow water equivalent and snow energetics across a large catchment subject to Mountain Pine Beetle infestation and rapid salvage logging  ap. 464-479.  aIncludes references  aThis study examines the effect on stand and catchment scale snow processes due to widespread forest disturbance by the Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation, for the 1570km² Baker Creek catchment in the B.C. interior where all healthy mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands which dominated the catchment up until 2000 have since died or been salvage logged. Measurements in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this net canopy reduction has reduced peak snowpack and melt rate differences between remaining stands (including large clearcuts, younger regenerating stands and dead mature pine stands), relative to a healthy forest canopy with smaller clearcuts. The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was calibrated and run at 200m resolution across the catchment, and simulated snowmelt rates and snow-covered area compared relatively well to distributed satellite or ground-based measurements. Snowpack and ablation rates were 10-20% higher during the 2008 and 2009 winters than when running the model for the pre-MPB landscape in 2000 using the same input meteorological data, resulting in almost no difference in the snowcover period. A greater snowpack volume which enters the stream network faster inevitably has implications for streamflows, flood risks and water resources, and these are assessed during the next stage of this research project. 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3afloods 3aforest canopy 3alandscapes 3alogging 3amelting 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amontane forests 3aresearch projects 3arisk 3asatellites 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3asoil 3astreams 3awatersheds 3awinter1 aAlila, Younes1 aVarhola, Andrés0 tJournal of hydrology.g2010 July 15, v. 388, no. 3-4 p.464-479dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.031 7aarticle01092naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245012100131300001600252500001500268520014500283650001400428653003100442653003800473653003600511653001800547653004100565700002000606773009100626852000900717939003300726945000800759946001100767655001200778991614713470742620221121125550.0830105e198207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830002912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGogoi, A.R.10aEffect of bunamidine hydrochloride against fowl cestodes Raillietina tetragona, R. cesticillus and R. echinobothrida  ap. 556-560.  a2019-12-05  aRaillietina spp., White Leghorn chicks (exper.), effect of bunamidine hydrochloride against pure and mixed infections, no toxic side effects 3ahelminths 0aanimal parasites and pests 0aRaillietina cesticillus (Cestoda) 0aRaillietina tetragona (Cestoda) 0aanimal health 0aRaillietina echinobothrida (Cestoda)1 aChaudhuri, R.P.0 tIndian journal of animal sciences.g1982 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.556-560x0367-83187nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830105c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle04214naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001800181245010200199300001400301500001500315520196400330650001702294650001402311650003302325650001502358650002102373650001702394650002102411650001402432650001702446650002902463650003602492650002402528650002002552650000902572650001902581650002802600650001502628650002302643650002302666650001402689650001202703650001102715650001402726650004202740650003302782650002802815650001102843650005802854650003602912650004702948650005002995650003103045650003103076650004603107650003703153653001503190700001703205700001403222773008103236852000903317856008503326930003303411945002503444946001103469655001203480IND4370297420221121125612.0050518e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437029742DNAL7 a157477302pmid7 a10.1017/S00220299040006392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the mechanism responsible for the regulation of TGF-beta1 expression in MEC is not known. The present study examined the effect of the hormones, growth hormone (GH), somatostatin (STS), 17-beta oestradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), as well as the growth factors, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), on TGF-beta1 expression in the bovine MEC lines, BME-UV1 and MAC-T. The model of apoptosis in bovine mammary gland in vitro was applied by reduction of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (from 10% to 2% or 0.5% FBS) in the cell environment to show the relationship between TGF-beta1 expression and apoptosis in bovine MEC. RT-PCR, Western blot and laser scanning cytometry (LSC) were used for analysis of TGF-beta1 transcript and protein level as well as apoptosis and cell cycle in examined MEC. In this model of apoptosis, FBS deficiency (mimicking the naturally occurring decline in the access of bioactive compounds and nutrients at the end of lactation and dry period) was associated with increased TGF-beta1 expression at the level of transcript and protein, induction of apoptosis and inhibition of cell cycle. Exogenous TGF-beta1, IGF-I, EGF and GH inhibited FBS-deficiency-stimulated TGF-beta1 expression. The suppressive effect of GH was reversed when cells were maintained longer in FBS-deficient medium. In general, STS, E2 and P4 increased TGF-beta1 expression. However, this effect was dependent on hormone concentration and cell line. BME-UV1 cells were much more responsive to the peptides, GH, STS, IGF-I and EGF, whereas MAC-T cells were more responsive to the steroid sex hormones: E2 and P4. 3asomatostatin 3aestradiol 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3acell cycle 3ain vitro studies 3asomatotropin 3aepithelial cells 3acytokines 3aprogesterone 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransforming growth factor beta 3ahormonal regulation 3agene expression 3acows 3amammary glands 3aepidermal growth factor 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3amammary involution 3aapoptosis 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCell Line 2aEpidermal Growth Factorxpharmacology 2aEpithelial Cellsxphysiology 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aGrowth Substancesxpharmacology 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixpharmacology 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytologyxphysiology. 2aProgesteronexpharmacology 2aSomatostatinxpharmacology 2aTransforming Growth Factor betaxgenetics 2aTransforming Growth Factor beta1 0adry period1 aGajewska, M.1 aMotyl, T.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005 Feb., v. 72, no. 1 p.39-48x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299040006393Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/03/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02998naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245008400168300001400252520168500266650002301951650001601974650001101990650001602001650001002017650001902027650002202046650001402068650002302082650001302105650001202118650002802130650001502158650001202173651001702185700002902202700002202231700002102253700001902274773015502293856005002448856004502498852000902543655001202552IND60768022220221121104533.0220224s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076802222DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2021.111.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeidel, Miriam10aImpact of COVID-19 on Pennsylvania farm revenue Looking back at the 2020 season  ap. 21-26.  aInitial forecasts predicted severe financial losses for small and midsized farmers as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted usual market channels nationwide. Early reports both confirmed and challenged these fears, as some farmers could not find new markets while others established or expanded their direct-to-consumer sales to replace their lost outlets. To understand the impact of the pandemic on Pennsylvania farmers across the entire 2020 growing season, Chatham University and Pasa Sustainable Agriculture[1] surveyed farmers and performed interviews with a subset of these farmers. The anonymous survey was distributed by Pennsylvania-based farm organizations to their constituents, predominantly through email. Just under half the farmers (42%) reported a loss of revenue, while over half (58%) reported either no change or an increase in revenue in 2020. The scale of these changes varied greatly. We also found that vegetable farmers fared slightly better than livestock/eggs/dairy farmers; those with a higher pre-COVID revenue did better than those with a lower pre-COVID revenue; and farms that were able to increase direct-to-consumer sales maintained or increased their total revenues. Participation in state and federal relief programs varied and appeared to have no significant effect on farmers’ final 2020 revenue. Farmers’ responses to the open-ended survey questions demonstrated that the weather, a lack of infrastructure to support small and midsized producers, and consumers’ lack of support for a regional food system were major challenges before COVID. Without meaningful policy changes, these challenges will persist beyond the pandemic’s resolution. 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aagriculture 3ae-mail 3afarm income 3afarms 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3alivestock 3alocal food systems 3apandemic 3asurveys 3asustainable agriculture 3avegetables 3aweather 3aPennsylvania1 aMurakami, Christopher D.1 aEgan, J.

W01416 (22 p.  a2019-12-05  aAn exact analytical solution is presented for solute transport in an unsaturated, vertical fracture and porous rock matrix. The problem includes advective transport in the fracture and rock matrix as well as advective and diffusive fracture-matrix exchange. Linear sorption and radioactive decay are also treated. The solution is derived under the assumptions that longitudinal diffusion and dispersion are negligible and that the fracture and rock properties are homogeneous. The water flux and saturation within the matrix are assumed to be steady and spatially uniform. The fracture flux, saturation, and wetted fracture-matrix interface area are steady but are allowed to be spatially variable. The problem is first solved in terms of solute concentrations that result from an instantaneous point source in the fracture. An integrated form of the solution is also derived for cumulative solute mass flux at a fixed downstream position. The closed-form analytical solution is expressed in terms of algebraic functions, exponentials, and error functions. Analyses indicate limited sensitivity to fracture porosity and fracture retardation under typical conditions but strong sensitivity to matrix diffusion, matrix retardation, and matrix imbibition. 3asimulation models 3ahydrodynamic dispersion 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity 3arocks 3aunsaturated conditions 3aequations 3aporosity 3adiffusivity 3asolutes 3asurface interactions 3aunsaturated flow 3aporous media 3aspatial variation 3aalgorithms 3ahydrologic models 3aadsorption 0awater flow0 tWater resources research.g2006 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.W01416 (22 p-W01416 (22 pwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a20080429b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/04/13  aOther US 7aarticle01139naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075040001800099072001700117100001700134245008100151300001400232500001500246520033300261650001600594651001400610653001200624700001800636710007400654773007100728852000900799930003300808945000800841655001200849991614708430742620221121033250.0780601e197601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7899134772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The evaluations highlight the changing relationship between agriculture and society over the time period studied. A large increase in total emergy supporting the Danish economy was observed, and the 379% rise from 1936 to 1999 in emergy use per capita, a biophysical measure of living standard, came from both imported sources and from the non-renewable storages of the biosphere. In 1936, Danish agriculture was largely based on the use of draft animals for traction and approximately 1,110,000,000 person-hours of direct labor were required for production, while in 1970 and 1999, all traction was mechanized and approximately 415,000,000 and 121,000,000 person-hours were required for production, respectively. Over the same period, the emergy supporting each person-hour of agricultural labor increased by 1600%. The driving forces for agricultural production shifted towards an increased reliance on commercial energy and indirect labor. Given the increase in emergy available to the Danish economy through extraction and use of domestic oil and gas and trade over the period studied, the shift in labor from agriculture to the service and manufacturing sectors represented a nation-wide re-organization for maximum empower. The evaluations also indicate that while agriculture remains an essential way for industrial economies to capture local renewable resources, given the limited net emergy yields of agricultural production, the magnitude of non-agricultural economic activity that agriculture systems can support appears limited in an economy with access to high-net-yield imported energy resources. 3aagriculture 3afarming systems 3aenergy use and consumption 3aenergy efficiency 3aagricultural history 3atemporal variation 3anonrenewable resources 3adraft animals 3afarm labor 3ainternational trade 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic structure 3aeconomic trends 3aDenmark 0astandard of living1 aHaden, A.C.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2006 Nov., v. 117, no. 2-3 p.145-158dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.0253Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle04003naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173072000900182100001800191245010200209300001600311500002400327520214800351650002502499650001002524650001802534650002402552650002302576650002002599650001902619650002102638650002002659650002802679650002302707650002502730650002202755650001302777650001502790650001402805650001502819650002002834650001802854650002902872650001502901650001902916650002002935650001602955651000902971700001302980700001402993700001603007700001603023700001703039773010803056852000903164856008703173930003303260945002503293946001103318655001203329IND4387627620221123024405.0070206e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438762762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ700 0aJ800 0aP200 0aJ500 0aX1001 aGassman, P.W.10aAlternative practices for sediment and nutrient loss control on livestock farms in northeast Iowa  ap. 135-144.  aIncludes references  aA number of structural and managerial practices were evaluated to determine their environmental and economic effectiveness on animal feeding operations in the upper Maquoketa river watershed in northeast Iowa. Economic and environmental model simulations were performed over a 30-year time horizon for each of these practices using extensive data collected from the study area. Results from model simulations indicate that while most of the practices (including terraces, no till farming, contouring, and in-field contour buffers) would reduce sediment and sediment-bound nutrient losses significantly, they have very little benefit on soluble nitrogen and phosphorus losses. This is primarily because the increased infiltration rates resulting from those practices leads to greater losses of subsurface and return flow in the heavily tile-drained watershed. Nonetheless, when these practices are combined with judicious commercial fertilizer use, appreciable reductions in soluble nutrient losses are also indicated, and improvements in sediment loss are maintained. Terraces are indicated to provide the greatest sediment loss reduction (over 60% reduction) at the watershed level, relative to the status quo. Accordingly, installed terraces also lead to the highest simulated reductions in organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus (over 70%). Predicted reductions in sediment for most of the other practices ranged from almost 30% to about 45%. Corresponding reductions in simulated organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus losses range from about 35% to almost 50%. Economic model simulations also show varied impacts. In general, costs of sediment reducing practices range from about $6 per hectare of implemented area with contouring to almost $65 per hectare when terraces are installed on high-slope cropland. Terraces also indicated the greatest sediment loss reduction. On the other hand, judicious commercial fertilizer use is indicated to offset these costs by as much as roughly $50 per hectare. The study indicates that programs that offer producers some flexibility in choosing practice combinations may lead to the best outcomes. 3alivestock production 3afarms 3awater erosion 3asediment deposition 3asediment transport 3aerosion control 3asoil fertility 3alosses from soil 3aland management 3aagricultural watersheds 3aeconometric models 3aenvironmental models 3asimulation models 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aterracing 3ano-tillage 3acontour farming 3afilter strips 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3asoil water 3adrainage water 3aeconomic impact 3afertilizers 3aIowa1 aOsei, E.1 aSaleh, A.1 aRodecap, J.1 aNorvell, S.1 aWilliams, J.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2006 Nov., v. 117, no. 2-3 p.135-144dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.0303Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02091naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002200141245007500163300001600238520109100254650001101345650001001356650001701366650002101383650001601404650002401420650001001444650001701454650001101471651001101482700002301493700002201516773015001538856004401688852000901732655001201741IND4513630920221123015317.0150730e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451363092DNAL7 a10.13031/aea.30.106842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRzeznik, Wojciech13aTheEmission of Odor from LivestockBuildings for Dairy Cattle in Poland  ap. 961-970.  aThe aim of the study was to determine the momentary odor emission factors from two groups of free-stall dairy cattle barns (traditional and modern frame barns) with natural ventilation systems. The odor emission was measured in Poland (Greater Poland) from spring to autumn 2012. The researched six free-stall dairy cattle barns differed also in the type of resting area and manure removal system. The concentrations of odor were measured with the dynamic olfactometry method according to the European Standard EN 13725:2003 procedure. The concentration of odor in the monitored barns ranged from 101 to 825 ouE m-3 thus it characterized high variability. The mean momentary odor emission factors were lower (p=0.05) for traditional designs barns than for modern frame barns and ranged from 0.04 to 0.061 ouE s-1 kg-1 and 0.127-0.171 ouE s-1 kg-1, respectively. The housing system (deep litter, shallow litter, cubicles with floor mats or litter) did not influence on odor emission factors within modern frame barns group and also within the group of traditional designs barns (p=0.05). 3aautumn 3abarns 3adairy cattle 3aemissions factor 3afree stalls 3anatural ventilation 3aodors 3aolfactometry 3aspring 3aPoland1 aMielcarek, Paulina1 aJugowar, Jerzy L.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2014 Nov., v. 30, no. 6 p.961-970dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.30.10684  aDNAL 7aarticle01476naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002900154245013800183300001500321500002400336520066400360650000901024650001501033773012001048852000901168856005701177655001201234IND4456013120221122192219.0110408e195805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445601312DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1958.tb00012.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, P.

Staged logistic regression models are used to identify the early lifecourse antecedents of a man being childless in later life and the mediating effects of work-related variables and duration of union. The results show that the father's and mother's occupations, the level and type of education, and birthplace are important early lifecourse antecedents of whether a man is childless in later life. The lengths of time a man has been in married and cohabiting and his current occupation are found shown to have significant relationships with whether he is childless. 3amen 3aemployment 3aoccupations 3amarital status 3aAustralia 0aChildlessness 0aFertility 0aFatherhood 0aFamily background0 tPopulation research and policy review.g2010 June, v. 29, no. 3 p.319-338dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-59237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11113-009-9142-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02143naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013600166300001400302520107100316650002101387653002201408653001901430653002401449653001701473700002001490700001801510700001901528700002001547773009801567852000901665856008501674930003301759946001301792655001201805IND4439489520221122145355.0100702e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443948952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10562-010-0370-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Bao-Chuan 10aSelective Liquid-phase Hydrodechlorination of Chlorotrifluoroethylene over Palladium-Supported Catalysts: Activity and Deactivation  ap. 68-75.  aLiquid-phase hydrodechlorination of chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) to trifluoroethylene (TrFE) with molecular hydrogen was studied over palladium-supported catalysts. BaSO₄, Al₂O₃ and activated carbon (AC) were used as supports, respectively. The results showed that the Pd/AC catalysts exhibit higher activity than Pd/BaSO₄ and Pd/Al₂O₃. The treatment of activated carbon with HNO₃ led to a considerable increase of surface functional groups containing oxygen atoms, which resulted in a higher dispersion of palladium on the supports and enhancement of catalytic activity. The stability of the catalyst was investigated, one reason for the inhibition was the accumulation of NaCl on the surface of Pd/AC that blocks the pores of carbon support. The activity of Pd/AC could partially recovered by washing with water. The other irreversible deactivation of the catalyst are from the change of particle size and the pore structure, leaching of Pd, a decrease of BET surface area and Pd surface area of Pd/AC catalyst.

Our approach was to reconcile measured loads of nutrients exported from the catchment with those estimated based on characterisation of farming practices within the catchment. The latter was based upon detailed surveys of farm practices and soil quality. Monthly stream monitoring showed that median nutrient (N and P), sediment and faecal bacteria concentrations exceeded guidelines recommended for surface waters. Measured specific yields for suspended sediment (SS), total N (TN) and phosphorus (P) discharged from the catchment were 58, 8.2 and 0.43 kg ha-1 year-1, respectively, for the 2001-2005 monitoring period. In comparison, model estimates of N and P losses in drainage and overland flow from farms in the catchment were 10.1 and 0.59 kg ha-1 year-1, respectively. Field measurements, farm management surveys and farm systems modeling have identified some land management practices that appear to be key sources of many of these pollutants. These sources include subsurface drainage systems (including the preferential flow of irrigated effluent through these soils), overland flow from the heavy soils used for dairy farming in the catchment and the practice of intensively wintering cows on forage crops. Modeling suggests that a significant improvement in catchment water quality could be achieved through the implementation of targeted best management practices (BMPs) on dairy farms in the catchment. These include (i) covered feedpad wintering systems for controlling N losses, (ii) nitrification inhibitor use on milking platforms, (iii) deferred irrigation and low rate application of farm dairy effluent and (iv) limiting soil Olsen P to economically optimum levels. The adoption of these BMPs will, in part, depend on their economic viability. This paper therefore presents a double-bottom-line analysis (i.e. environmental and economic) of some of these BMPs and discusses their potential to cost-effectively deliver improved water quality in the Bog Burn catchment. 3abeef cattle 3adairy cattle 3anitrification inhibitors 3aphosphorus 3aagricultural watersheds 3aanimal husbandry 3alivestock production 3asediment deposition 3awater pollution 3aplantation forestry 3awater quality 3aagricultural runoff 3asoil quality 3anitrification 3agood agricultural practices 3aeutrophication 3aforage crops 3anitrogen 3asheep 3acost effectiveness 3aland management 3aNew Zealand 0aeconomic analysis1 aWilcock, R.J.1 aSmith, L.C.1 aTikkisetty, B.1 aThorrold, B.S.1 aCostall, D.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2007 Jan., v. 118, no. 1-4 p.211-222dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.05.0163Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03443naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100002200182245011200204300001600316500002400332500001500356520177600371650002202147650001902169650001502188650001902203650001202222650001802234650002802252650002502280650001702305650002502322650001202347650001602359650001802375650001302393650002002406650001502426651001202441653003002453653002202483653002002505700001902525700001702544700001902561773010802580852000902688856008702697930003302784945002502817946001102842655001202853IND4387615920221122121332.0070206e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438761592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2006.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ700 0aW000 0aB200 0aX1001 aBricklemyer, R.S.10aMonitoring and verifying agricultural practices related to soil carbon sequestration with satellite imagery  ap. 201-210.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Kyoto Protocol entering into force on 16 February 2005 continues to spur interest in development of carbon trading mechanisms internationally and domestically. Critical to the development of a carbon trading effort is verification that carbon has been sequestered, and field level measurement of C change is likely cost prohibitive. Estimating C change based on agricultural management practices related to carbon sequestration seems more realistic, and analysis of satellite imagery could be used to monitor and verify these practices over large areas. We examined using Landsat imagery to verify crop rotations and quantify crop residue biomass in north central Montana. Field data were collected using a survey of farms. Standard classification tree analysis (CTA) and boosted classification and regression tree analysis (BCTA) were used to classify crop types. Linear regression (LM), regression tree analysis (RTA), and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) were used to estimate crop residue. Six crop types were classified with 97% accuracy (BCTA) with class accuracies of 88-99%. Paired t-tests were used to compare the difference between known and predicted mean crop residue biomass. The difference between known and predicted mean residues using SGB was not different than 0 (p-value = 0.99); however root mean square error (RMSE) was large (1981 kg ha-1), implying that SGB accurately predicted regional crop residue biomass but not local predictions (i.e., field or farm level). The results of this study, and previous research classifying tillage practices and estimating soil disturbance, supports using satellite imagery as an effective tool for monitoring and verifying agricultural management practices related to carbon sequestration over large areas. 3asimulation models 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3acarbon markets 3atillage 3acrop residues 3adry matter accumulation 3acarbon sequestration 3aspatial data 3aenvironmental policy 3aLandsat 3aagriculture 3acrop rotation 3aaccuracy 3adisturbed soils 3aprediction 3aMontana 0acarbon trading mechanisms 0asatellite imagery 0acrop management1 aLawrence, R.L.1 aMiller, P.R.1 aBattogtokh, N.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2007 Jan., v. 118, no. 1-4 p.201-210dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.05.0173Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02209naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006400125500016800189500002400357520110100381650001101482650001201493650002501505650001301530650001101543650002301554650002601577650001201603650002101615651001201636700001601648773011201664852000901776856008601785655001201871IND4464823720221122121318.0130124s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446482372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoka, F.M.10aMechanical harvesting of sweet oranges for juice processing  aPaper presented at the First International Symposium on Mechanical Harvesting and Handling Systems of Fruits and Nuts, held April 1-4, 2012,  Lake Alfred, Florida.  aIncludes references  aCitrus growers in Florida are developing mechanical harvesting technology to order to increase harvest labor productivity and reduce harvesting costs.

An endemic population is known on Long Point peninsula, Lake Erie, Ontario, but I. scapularis adults have also been collected from other localities within the province. To test the hypothesis that distribution of the blacklegged tick is limited by cold climatic extremes 35 fed female, 70 unfed adult, and 70 unfed nymphal I. scapularis were held in containers within four natural habitats on Long Point (42 degrees 36' N; 80 degrees 5' W) and at northern localities near Ottawa (45 degrees 27' N; 75 degrees 42' W), Hearst (49 degrees 40' N; 83 degrees 41' W), and Kenora (49 degrees 47' N; 94 degrees 29' W), Ontario, from early December 1991 until May 1993. At the northern localities, 84.8 and 30.5% of fed females and unfed adults survived overwinter, respectively. On Long Point, 56.4% of fed females and 23.6% of unfed adults successfully overwintered. Longevity of fed females and unfed adults was increased by > 2 mo at the northern localities compared with Long Point, although survival rates for unfed nymphs at the northern sites and on Long Point were similar. Females within the four habitats on Long Point, and at Kenora and Ottawa, laid eggs from late April to mid-May, whereas eggs were deposited in late June at Hearst. Emergence of larvae from eggs began in late July or early August on Long Point and at Ottawa. Larvae were first observed in early October at Kenora, and no larvae emerged during 1992 at Hearst. Some eggs that overwintered during 1992-1993 at the northern sites were viable; however, hatching rate was < 10%. The minimum duration of the life cycle of I. scapularis is extended when ticks are introduced into regions of the province with seasonal degree-day accumulations lower than those observed on Long Point. Delays in deposition of eggs and emergence of larvae at Hearst and Kenora were likely a result of insufficient accumulation of degree-days above threshold temperatures for development in 1992. Though some eggs can overwinter successfully, suggesting that latitude-related reduction in seasonal temperature may not limit distribution of this tick in Ontario, hatchability was low. This factor, combined with innate incremental mortality at each instar, difficulty in finding a mate, and low density of medium to large mammal hosts for adults, may mitigate against establishment of I. scapularis by introduction of individual ticks into certain northern regions. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aIxodes scapularis 3adevelopmental stages 3aova 3amortality 3abiological development 3aoverwintering 3ageographical distribution 3atemperate zones 3atemperature 2aAnimals 2aCold Climate 2aFemale 2aLarva 2aNymph 2aOviposition 2aTicksxgrowth & development 3aOntario 0aOntario1 aBarker, I.K.1 aSurgeoner, G.A.1 aMcEwen, S.A.1 aGillespie, T.J.1 aRobinson, J.T.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1995 Mar., v. 32, no. 2 p.143-152x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/32.2.1433Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle04613naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003300164245018900197300001600386520214600402650002502548650001802573650001802591650007702609650001002686650000902696650002202705650004102727650005102768650004402819650002902863650003002892650002802922650001102950650002202961650001302983650006702996650003803063650001103101650003203112650000903144650004303153650001603196650007103212650005103283650004603334650006003380650002203440651001103462653001203473653000903485653001403494653002103508700002003529700002403549700002303573700002303596700002203619773013603641852000903777856008503786930003303871946001103904655001203915IND4438469120221122050159.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443846912DNAL7 a203766282pmid7 a10.1007/s00228-010-0818-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGawrońska-Szklarz, Barbara 10aEffects of CYP2C19, MDR1, and interleukin 1-B gene variants on the eradication rate of Helicobacter pylori infection by triple therapy with pantoprazole, amoxicillin, and metronidazole  ap. 681-687.  aObjective Eradication of H. pylori is an important treatment strategy in peptic ulcer patients. Current regimens of eradication consist of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and two antibiotics. Effects of PPI may depend on their metabolism, and other factors important for the pathophysiology of peptic ulcer disease. Aim of the present study was to evaluate an association of CYP2C19, MDR1, and IL-1B polymorphisms with the eradication rate of H. pylori in Polish Caucasian patients treated with a triple therapy of pantoprazole, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. Methods A total of 139 peptic ulcer patients, positive for H. pylori infection, were treated with triple therapy (pantoprazole + amoxicillin + metronidazole). Subsequently, the patients were divided into two groups (group 1, success, and group 2, failure of eradication after therapy) and genotyped by the PCR-RFLP method for the presence of CYP2C19 variant alleles (*2, *3, and *17), and MDR1 3435C>T and IL-1B +3954C>T polymorphisms. Pantoprazole serum concentrations were measured using the HPLC method. Results No significant differences in frequency or distribution of CYP2C19 genotypes were found between the two groups of patients (i.e., with successful H. pylori eradication and treatment failure). However, any carrier of defective CYP2C19*2/*2 genotype was found among patients with treatment failure. Similarly, MDR1 and IL-1B genotypes were found to be significantly associated with the success or failure of H. pylori eradication. Univariate and multivariate analysis of the genotypes did not reveal any significant association between the genotypes and H. pylori eradication. Pantoprazole concentrations differed significantly, and were the highest in patients with defective allele CYP2C19*2 carriers and lowest in hyperactive genotype homozygotes CYP2C19*17/*17. Conclusion The results suggest that the CYP2C19 genotype contrary to MDR1 and IL-1B genotypes may have an impact on the efficacy of H. pylori eradication in peptic ulcer patients treated with pantoprazole in Polish Caucasian peptic ulcer patients administered pantoprazole, amoxicillin, and metronidazole. 3agenetic polymorphism 3apeptic ulcers 3ainterleukin-1 2a2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazolesxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAmoxicillinxadministration & dosage 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aAryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylasesxgenetics 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP2C19 2aDrug Therapy, Combination 2aWhite Peoplexgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHelicobacter Infectionsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aHelicobacter pylorixdrug effects 2aHumans 2aInterleukin-1betaxgenetics 2aMale 2aMetronidazolexadministration & dosage 2aMiddle Aged 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1xgenetics. 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B. 2aPeptic Ulcerxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aProton Pump Inhibitorsxadministration & dosagexblood. 2aTreatment Failure 0aPoland 0aCYP2C19 0aMDR1 0aH. pylori 0aPharmacogenetics1 aSiuda, Andrzej 1 aKurzawski, Mateusz 1 aBielicki, Dariusz 1 aMarlicz, Wojciech 1 aDroździk, Marek 0 tEuropean journal of clinical pharmacology.g2010 July, v. 66, no. 7 p.681-687dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0031-69707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00228-010-0818-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02601naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001700162245008900179300001600268500001500284520108800299650002801387650001201415650000901427650002401436650002101460650002301481650001901504650002201523650001201545650001201557650001101569650001901580650000901599650001401608650005501622651001401677651001401691653002301705653002401728653001301752653002301765700001701788700001501805773008701820852000901907856008401916930003302000945001302033946001302046655001202059IND2047548320221122040202.0950830e199503  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204754832DNAL7 a76089182pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/32.2.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, B.A.10aGenetic structure of four species of Triatoma (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) from Argentina  ap. 134-137.  a2019-12-04  aThe genetic structure of Triatoma guasayana Wygodzinsky & Abalos, T. sordida (Stal), T. platensis Neiva, and T. infestans (Klug) was compared by starch gel electrophoresis. In total, 17 enzyme loci were analyzed in T. infestans and 14 loci in the other three species. Zymograms were useful in species identification. Icdh-2 and Hk-1 are diagnostic loci, and Icdh-1, Hk-2, Es-1, and Es-2 are helpful in distinguishing these species. The proportion of polymorphic loci for the four species (range, 52.9 to 58.3%) was somewhat higher than that expected from reports for other insects. Mean heterozygosity per locus (range, 0.062 to 0.156) was within the range reported for insects in the literature. The level of heterozygosity was highest for T. guasayana and lowest for T. sordida. Values of genetic distance (Nei's D), identity (Nei's I), and similarity (Rogers's S) indices indicate that the four species are well-defined taxa. T. infestans and T. platensis are the closest (D = 0.45, S = 0.62). T. guasayana and T. sordida (D = 0.77, S = 0.46) form another pair of related species. 3ainterspecific variation 3aalleles 3aloci 3aenzyme polymorphism 3aTriatoma sordida 3aTriatoma infestans 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGene Frequency 2aMale 2aPhylogeny 2aTriatominaexclassificationxenzymologyxgenetics. 3aArgentina 0aArgentina 0atriatoma guasayana 0aspecies differences 0aTriatoma 0atriatoma platensis1 aCanale, D.M.1 aBlanco, A.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1995 Mar., v. 32, no. 2 p.134-137x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/32.2.1343Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01966naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245010900167300001600276520076800292650003201060650001701092650000901109650001601118650002001134650002001154650002201174650001401196650001901210653002401229653001801253700001601271700001501287700001801302773011001320852000901430856008501439930003301524946001101557655001201568IND4432994020221122040318.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443299402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10535-010-0024-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbenavoli, M.

Some hemoblasts differentiate into somatic lineage cells such as endodermal multipotent epithelial, cardiac and body-wall muscle, and blood cells. There is no well established evidence that somatic hemoblasts are stem cells. Rather, like tissue-restricted progenitor cells, some peripheral hemoblasts give rise to terminally differentiated cells, while other hemoblasts differentiate into germ cells and accessory cells. Unlike somatic lineage cells, germ cells and their precursors express vasa homologues in common. In some colonial tunicates, vasa is indispensable for germ cell development. All vasa-positive hemoblasts appear to differentiate into germ cells, suggesting that most of them are tissue-restricted progenitor cells. When a colony is naturally or experimentally depleted of vasa-expressing cells, vasa and vasa-expressing germ cells can reappear in the colony. We speculate that, in addition to tissue-restricted progenitor cells, highly potent stem cells which regulate the activities of blastogenesis and gametogenesis and eventually cause soma-germ conflict in colonial tunicates may exist in colonial tunicates. 3agerm cells 2aAnimals 2aCell Differentiation 2aFemale 2aGerm Cellsxcytology 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aModels, Biological 2aRegeneration 2aStem Cellsxcytologyxultrastructure. 2aUrochordataxcytologyxphysiology. 0ahemoblast 0aprogenitor cell 0asoma 0astem cell1 aSunanaga, Takeshi0 tDevelopment, growth & differentiation.g2010 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.69-76dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0012-15927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01142.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03917naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002600193245009400219300001600313520181900329650001902148650001202167650006702179650007002246650005002316650005402366650005002420650006202470650005402532650004702586650000902633650000902642650002502651650005102676650004002727653001402767653001502781653002002796653001602816653001102832700002502843700002202868700002802890700001902918700002502937700002302962700001902985700001903004700002203023773012303045852000903168856009203177930003303269946001303302655001203315IND4439904520221122031537.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443990452DNAL7 a204923492pmid7 aPMC39948882pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06815.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuczynski, Matthew W.10aInflammatory hyperalgesia induces essential bioactive lipid production in the spinal cord  ap. 981-993.  aJ. Neurochem. (2010) 114, 981-993. Lipid molecules play an important role in regulating the sensitivity of sensory neurons and enhancing pain perception, and growing evidence indicates that the effect occurs both at the site of injury and in the spinal cord. Using high-throughput mass spectrometry methodology, we sought to determine the contribution of spinal bioactive lipid species to inflammation-induced hyperalgesia in rats. Quantitative analysis of CSF and spinal cord tissue for eicosanoids, ethanolamides and fatty acids revealed the presence of 102 distinct lipid species. After induction of peripheral inflammation by intra-plantar injection of carrageenan to the ipsilateral hind paw, lipid changes in cyclooxygenase (COX) and 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) signaling pathways peaked at 4 h in the CSF. In contrast, changes occurred in a temporally disparate manner in the spinal cord with LOX-derived hepoxilins followed by COX-derived prostaglandin E₂, and subsequently the ethanolamine anandamide. Systemic treatment with the mu opioid agonist morphine, the COX inhibitor ketorolac, or the LOX inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid significantly reduced tactile allodynia, while their effects on the lipid metabolites were different. Morphine did not alter the lipid profile in the presence or absence of carrageenan inflammation. Ketorolac caused a global reduction in eicosanoid metabolism in naïve animals that remained suppressed following injection of carrageenan. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid-treated animals also displayed reduced basal levels of COX and 12-LOX metabolites, but only 12-LOX metabolites remained decreased after carrageenan treatment. These findings suggest that both COX and 12-LOX play an important role in the induction of carrageenan-mediated hyperalgesia through these pathways. 3aprostaglandins 2aAnimals 2aArachidonate 12-Lipoxygenasexcerebrospinal fluidxphysiology. 2aCannabinoid Receptor Modulatorsxcerebrospinal fluidxphysiology. 2aEicosanoidsxcerebrospinal fluidxphysiology. 2aEthanolaminesxcerebrospinal fluidxpharmacology. 2aFatty Acidsxcerebrospinal fluidxphysiology. 2aHyperalgesiaxcerebrospinal fluidxmetabolismxpathology. 2aInflammation Mediatorsxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aLipidsxbiosynthesisxcerebrospinal fluid. 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSpinal Cordxmetabolismxpathology. 0ahepoxilin 0alipidomics 0a12-lipoxygenase 0anociception 0aspinal1 aSvensson, Camilla I.1 aDumlao, Darren S.1 aFitzsimmons, Bethany L.1 aShim, Jae-Hang1 aScherbart, Thomas J.1 aJacobsen, Faith E.1 aHua, Xiao-Ying1 aYaksh, Tony L.1 aDennis, Edward A.0 tJournal of neurochemistry.g2010 Aug., v. 114, no. 4 p.981-993dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-30427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2010.06815.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02294naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245015800144300001800302520078600320650001401106650002901120650002601149650001001175650002401185650001201209650001101221650001101232650002501243650004701268650002301315650005401338650006301392650005301455650006601508653002101574653002701595700001601622700002001638700002301658773010001681852000901781939003301790946001301823655001201836IND8804235520221122010547.0880128e198809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880423552DNAL7 a30662442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHogan, J.S.10aSensitivity and specificity of latex agglutination tests used to identify Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from bulk tank milk  ap. 1537-1539.  aComparisons were made among rapid latex agglutination test and conventional biochemical tests used to identify Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus.

Heat stress was assessed using the Temperature Humidity Index (THI) and the Seasonal THI-hrs index. Dairy ewes were exposed to potential heat-stress (THI = 22.2) in 79%, 17%, and 11% of summer, autumn, and spring hours, respectively, whereas no heat-stress was present during winter. The monthly means of the daily maximum hourly THI values remained above the extreme severe heat-stress threshold (i.e. 25.6) during the summer months and above the severe heat-stress threshold (i.e., 23.3) during May and September. During all summer days the minimum daily maximum hourly THI value was 24.6 indicating that sheep experienced severe heat-stress (THI = 23.3). THI levels remained very high (usually above the extreme severe heat-stress threshold) during daytime and dropped below the heat-stress threshold (i.e., 22.2) only for a few hours during night-time. The values of the Seasonal THI-hrs index under heat-stress conditions (THI = 22.2) were 6596, 975, 0, and 516 during summer, autumn, winter, and spring, respectively. These findings suggest that under summer conditions in the east coast of central Greece, dairy ewes were exposed to severe or extremely severe heat-stress conditions, while they were also partially exposed to severe or extremely severe heat-stress conditions during autumn and spring. 3aautumn 3abarns 3acoasts 3adairy sheep 3aheat stress 3ahumidity 3asheep 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3aGreece1 aBartzanas, Thomas1 aPanagakis, Panagiotis1 aKittas, C.q(Constantinos),0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2014 Nov., v. 30, no. 6 p.953-959dAmerican Society of Agricultural EngineerswJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13031/aea.30.10256  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100001800173245010400191300001600295500002400311500001500335520183400350650001902184650002702203650001602230650001102246650002502257650001802282650001302300650001302313650002002326650001002346651000902356651001802365653002102383653002502404700001502429700001602444773010802460852000902568856008702577930003302664945002502697946001102722655001202733IND4387629220221121215851.0070206e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438762922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE110 0aE100 0aE7001 aErenstein, O.10aDeterminants of lowland use close to urban markets along an agro-ecological gradient in West Africa  ap. 205-217.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLowland development efforts in West Africa have a mixed record. The paper argues that this is due to the neglect of market opportunity as a driving force for lowland use and the agro-ecological gradient as an important modifier. The gradient is linked to three modifiers of lowland use: the relative value of lowland cropping with respect to other livelihood strategies; the biophysical productivity of lowland cropping; and the access rights to lowlands. The paper applies a regression-based decomposition framework to analyze the factors affecting lowland use in West Africa. It uses community-level data from 1014 geo-referenced lowland units around four urban centers along an agro-ecological gradient in Cote d'Ivoire and Mali. Tobit models are used to explain the extent of lowland non-use in terms of seasonal fallow, its diversity in terms of rice and other crop cultivation and its land use intensity in terms of double cropping. A multinomial logit model is used to explain lowland cropping systems. Results highlight a positive link between closeness to urban markets and the extent, diversity and intensity of lowland use. The agro-ecological gradient in West Africa has a pronounced influence on agricultural lowland use, which tends to be more widespread, diverse and intensive proceeding towards the drier ecologies. Lowland development did increase the extent and intensity of lowland use, but by favoring the cultivation of rice, had a negative impact on the diversity of lowland use. Lowland use is also associated with migrants, particularly in the more humid ecologies. Research, policy and development implications are explored. An important lesson for scaling out is that it is not proximity to urban markets per se, but the associated market access which is the key driver for more significant lowland use. 3aagroecosystems 3ageographical variation 3aurban areas 3afallow 3adeveloping countries 3amarket access 3alowlands 3aland use 3adouble cropping 3acrops 3aMali 3aCote d'Ivoire 0acropping systems 0aeconomic development1 aOswald, A.1 aMahaman, M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2006 Nov., v. 117, no. 2-3 p.205-217dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.03.0333Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03548naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245006400170300001800234520218500252650001102437650001402448650000902462650002102471650001402492650000802506650001502514650002302529650001902552650001002571650001002581650002202591653002102613653002002634653002802654653002202682653001702704653003002721653001602751653001302767700002302780773011802803852000902921856009202930930003303022946001103055655001203066IND4408936520221121165142.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440893652DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01341.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWill, Heidrun12aA mechanistic simulation model of seed dispersal by animals  ap. 1011-1022.  a1. In order to investigate seed dispersal by animals on a landscape scale, we developed the spatially explicit, individual-based mechanistic model SEED (Simulation of Epi- and Endozoochorous Seed Dispersal). The purpose of the model is to predict patterns and densities of seeds dispersed by animals (especially mammals) within a simulated landscape. 2. The model was parameterized for sheep, cattle and deer as vectors but may be applied to other animals if data for parameterization is available. The model data base currently includes parameter values for about 100 plant species. 3. Seed attachment to and seed detachment from the fur, as well as seed excretion after passage through the gut, are explicitly simulated by drawing randomly from distributions that were determined by standardized experiments. Animal movement is simulated as a correlated random walk, but to increase reality of the model, radio-tracking data of animals can also be used. 4. A sensitivity analysis of SEED was conducted to identify the relative importance of plant and animal traits. The analysis highlighted where the main gaps in our knowledge of seed dispersal processes lie. Even though in our study endozoochorous dispersal had the higher potential for long-distance dispersal compared to epizoochory, there is only scarce knowledge about seed production and especially about the proportion of seeds eaten by an animal, parameters which were shown to be of major importance for dispersal. 5. A comparison of variation in plant and animal traits, respectively, showed that dispersal kernels depend more on changes in the animal vector than on the comparably little variation a particular plant species can exhibit. For this reason, animal movement is, from all the dispersal-relevant parameters, the one for which more exact data is most urgently needed. 6. Synthesis. The newly developed simulation model will help to understand, quantify and predict long-distance seed dispersal by animals. The possibility to incorporate real landscapes and movement data from very different animals makes the model generalizable and possibly applicable to a wide range of scientific and applied questions. 3acattle 3adatabases 3adeer 3adigestive system 3aexcretion 3afur 3alandscapes 3amechanistic models 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3asheep 3asimulation models 0aanimal dispersal 0aanimal movement 0along-distance dispersal 0amechanistic model 0aplant traits 0aplant-animal interactions 0aseed shadow 0azoochory1 aTackenberg, Oliver0 tJournal of ecology.g2008 Sept., v. 96, no. 5 p.1011-1022dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01341.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03816naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010600172300001800278520212500296650001702421650001102438650002402449650002002473650001502493650001802508650002302526650001802549650001202567650001502579650001102594650002202605650001302627650001302640650001402653650000902667650001602676650001002692650001602702650002002718653003302738653002602771653002502797653002802822653002102850653002502871653002702896700002602923700002602949773011802975852000903093856009203102930003303194946001103227655001203238IND4408937120221121165058.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440893712DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01388.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, Laura E.10aTranslocation of nitrogen and carbon integrates biotic crust and grass production in desert grassland  ap. 1076-1085.  a1. Arid ecosystems are a patch mosaic of plants and biological soil crusts that have been described as islands and mantles of fertility, respectively. To determine whether these patches are metabolically linked by a fungal network of dark septate and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), we measured translocation of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) in a desert grassland using ¹⁵N-NO₃ and ¹³C₅, ¹⁵N-glutamic acid as substrates. 2. Substrates were applied as point sources to either small patches of biotic crust or to a subset of leaves within a bunch grass tussock. 3. Both substrates were translocated over approximately 1 m² areas (approximately 20 patches) at rates up to 100 cm day⁻¹ during a 4-day period following a natural rainfall event. Foliar uptake of ¹⁵N from glutamate was initially more rapid than ¹⁵N uptake from nitrate, and translocation from foliage was initially more rapid than translocation from soil crust. Rates of ¹⁵N translocation between patches were similar to rates of atmospheric N deposition and denitrification. 4. ¹³C from ¹³C₅, ¹⁵N-glutamic acid applied to leaves was translocated to crust suggesting that plant C may provide metabolic support to biological soil crusts during periods of active growth. ¹³C from ¹³C₅, ¹⁵N-glutamic acid applied to soil crusts did not enter plants, in contrast to the ¹⁵N from this substrate, indicating that glutamate was not translocated intact. 5. The dominant fungi of roots, rhizosphere soil and biological soil crusts are dark septate ascomycetes, most classified as Pleosporales, and AMF are rare. Phylogenetic analyses indicate substantial overlap in fungal community composition between roots and crusts, which may facilitate nutrient transfers. 6. Synthesis. This study supports the hypothesis that the spatial structure of semi-arid ecosystems, a patch mosaic of grasses and biological soil crust described, respectively, by the island of fertility and mantle of fertility paradigms, is functionally integrated by exchanges of C and N through a symbiotic fungal network dominated by dark-septate fungi. 3aPleosporales 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3aecosystems 3afoliar uptake 3afungal communities 3aglutamic acid 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aleaves 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphylogeny 3arain 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil crusts 3astable isotopes 0aarbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0abiological soil crust 0acarbon translocation 0adark septate endophytes 0adesert grassland 0aislands of fertility 0anitrogen translocation1 aPorras-Alfaro, Andrea1 aSinsabaugh, Robert L.0 tJournal of ecology.g2008 Sept., v. 96, no. 5 p.1076-1085dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01388.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03796naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100001600179245012500195300001800320500002400338500001500362520164600377650002402023650002902047650001702076650000802093650002302101650001202124650001002136650002102146650002402167650001202191650001302203650001002216650002502226650001102251650001002262650003002272650002002302650002502322650004002347650001102387650001302398650001102411650001802422650003302440650000902473650001602482650003002498650002602528651001002554653001002564700001302574700001502587700001102602700001502613700001402628700001102642700001202653700001402665773011802679852000902797856008202806856006902888930003302957945002502990946001103015655001203026IND4387643520221121165127.0070207e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438764352DNAL7 a165523972pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08033322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT2001 aHuang, A.Q.10aLipoprotein lipase gene S447X polymorphism modulates the relation between central obesity and serum lipids, a twin study  ap. 1693-1701.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To investigate the impact of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene S447X polymorphism on the relation between central obesity and lipid levels. Design: A total of 961 adult twin pairs were included from the program of Chinese Twin Registry, between 2001 and 2002. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference >or= 90 cm for male and >or= 80 cm for female. Two statistical methods were performed to test the modification effect of S447X polymorphism of LPL gene on the relation between central obesity and lipid levels: one was Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models for all twin pairs and the other was co-twin matched case-control analysis in 82 central obesity discordant monozygotic twin pairs. Results: In GEE models for all twins, central obesity was significantly associated with serum lipids except for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), while X447 allele had favorable effects on the levels of triglyceride (TG), HDL and TG to HDL ratio (TG/HDL). The interactions of S447X polymorphism and central obesity were statistically significant for TG/HDL and HDL. In central obesity discordant monozygotic twin pairs, central obesity was significantly related with 26.2% increase of TG and 27.2% increase of TG/HDL in S/S447 genotype, while in 447X allele carrier, central obesity was significantly related with 13.7% increase of HDL. Conclusion: These results suggest that LPL gene S447X polymorphism modifies the relation between central obesity and serum lipids, which also stresses the importance of reducing waist circumference to improve serum lipids for people with central obesity, especially those with S/S447 genotype. 3amathematical models 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ablood lipids 3amen 3alipoprotein lipase 3aalleles 3awomen 3atriacylglycerols 3awaist circumference 3aobesity 3agenotype 3atwins 3agenetic polymorphism 3aadults 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDiseases in Twinsxbloodxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aLipoprotein Lipasexgenetics 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxbloodxgenetics. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 3aChina 0agenes1 aHu, Y.H.1 aZhan, S.Y.1 aXu, B.1 aPang, Z.C.1 aCao, W.H.1 aLu, J.1 aQin, Y.1 aLee, L.M.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2006 Dec., v. 30, no. 12 p.1693-1701dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08033323Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070509b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle04132naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100001500170245012700185300001800312500002400330500001500354520172000369650002102089650001702110650001702127650001502144650002402159650001902183650004002202650004302242650001902285650002302304650001302327650002002340650001102360650001402371650001002385650000902395650001802404650002102422650002602443650002002469650002802489650006602517650006602583650001102649650001102660650001802671650000902689650001602698650006202714650002102776650003102797653003202828653002102860700001902881700001902900700001602919700001702935700001602952700001502968700002002983773011803003852000903121856008203130856006903212930003303281945002503314946001103339655001203350IND4387643920221121130912.0070207e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438764392DNAL7 a166521372pmid7 a10.1038/sj.ijo.08033372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aDube, M.C.10aMuscle adiposity and body fat distribution in type 1 and type 2 diabetes: varying relationships according to diabetes type  ap. 1721-1728.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: To compare the relationships between markers of total and regional adiposity with muscle fat infiltration in type 1 diabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects and their respective nondiabetic controls, and to document these relationships in type 1 diabetic subjects. Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: In total, 86 healthy, with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes or control subjects. Each diabetic group was matched for age, sex and body mass index with its respective nondiabetic control group. Measurements: Measures of body composition (hydrodensitometry), fat distribution (waist circumference, abdominal and mid-thigh computed tomography scans) and blood lipid profiles were assessed. Results: Low attenuation mid-thigh muscle surface correlated similarly with markers of adiposity and body composition in all groups, regardless of diabetes status, except for visceral adipose tissue and waist circumference. Indeed, relationships between visceral adiposity and muscle adiposity were significantly stronger in type 2 vs type 1 diabetic subjects (P<0.05 for comparison of slopes). In addition, in well-controlled type 1 diabetic subjects (mean HbA1c of 6.8%), daily insulin requirements tended to correlate with low attenuation mid-thigh muscle surface, a specific component of fat-rich muscle (r=0.36, P=0.08), but not with glycemic control (HbA1c). Conclusion: This study suggests that the relationship of central adiposity and muscle adiposity is modulated by diabetes status and is stronger in the insulin resistant diabetes type (type 2 diabetes). In well-controlled nonobese type 1 diabetic subjects, the relationship between muscle fat accumulation and insulin sensitivity was also maintained. 3aglycemic control 3ablood lipids 3avisceral fat 3abiomarkers 3acomputed tomography 3aadipose tissue 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3amuscle tissues 3ainsulin resistance 3apatients 3abody mass index 3aadults 2aAdiposity 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnthropometry 2aBody Composition 2aBody Fat Distribution 2aBody Mass Index 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xbloodxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolismxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aThighxpathology 2aTomography, X-Ray Computed 0aanthropometric measurements 0abody composition1 aJoanisse, D.R.1 aPrud'homme, D.1 aLemieux, S.1 aBouchard, C.1 aPerusse, L.1 aLavoie, C.1 aWeisnagel, S.J.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2006 Dec., v. 30, no. 12 p.1721-1728dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.ijo.08033373Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070509b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02860naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010600169300001600275500002400291520177700315650001402092650001602106650002402122650001502146650001402161650003002175650001102205650002002216650001102236650003202247650001102279650002302290773012802313852000902441856004802450655001202498IND4456906220221121060236.0110417e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445690622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10806-010-9246-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanford, A. Whitney10aEthics, Narrative, and Agriculture: Transforming Agricultural Practice through Ecological Imagination  ap. 283-303.  aIncludes references  aThe environmental degradation caused by industrial agriculture, as well as the resulting social and health consequences, creates an urgency to rethink food production by expanding the moral imagination to include agricultural practices. Agricultural practices presume human use of the earth and acknowledge human dependence on the biotic community, and these relations mean that agriculture presents a separate set of considerations in the broader field of environmental ethics. Many scholars and activists have argued persuasively that we need new stories to rethink agricultural practice, however, the link--the story that does and can shape agricultural practice--has not yet been fully articulated in environmental discourse. My analysis explores how language has shaped existing agricultural models and, more important, the potential of story to influence agricultural practice. To do this, I draw upon cognitive theory to illustrate how metaphoric and narrative language structures thought and influences practice, beginning with my contention that industrial agriculture relies on a discourse of mechanistic relations between humans and a passive earth, language that has naturalized the chemically intensive monocultures prevalent in much of the American Midwest. However, alternative agricultures, including organic agriculture, agro-ecology, and ecological agriculture, emphasize qualities such as interdependence and reciprocity and do so as a deliberate response to the perceived inadequacies of industrial agriculture and its governing narrative. Exploring the different discourses of agricultural systems can help us think through different modalities for human relations with the biotic community and demonstrate story's potential role in altering practice. 3aactivists 3aagroecology 3aalternative farming 3abiocenosis 3acognition 3aenvironmental degradation 3aethics 3afood production 3ahumans 3ainterpersonal relationships 3amodels 3aorganic production0 tJournal of agricultural and environmental ethics.g2011 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.283-303dSpringer Netherlandsx1187-78637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10806-010-9246-6 7aarticle03124naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164100002500173245008100198300001600279500002400295500001500319520157300334650002601907650002401933650002401957650001701981650002001998650002502018650003202043650002602075650002502101650001702126650002302143650001002166653001302176653002002189653004502209653001402254700001902268700001402287700002002301773010802321852000902429856008702438930003302525945002502558946001102583655001202594IND4387618720221121060242.0070206e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438761872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2006.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP000 0aL100 0aE1001 aWerf, H.M.G. van der10aEnvironmental impacts of farm scenarios according to five assessment methods  ap. 327-338.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIt is not known to what extent the outcome of studies assessing the environmental impacts of agricultural systems depends on the characteristics of the evaluation method used. The study reported here investigated five well-documented evaluation methods (DIALECTE, Ecological Footprint, Environmental Management for Agriculture, FarmSmart, Life Cycle Assessment) by applying them to a case study of three pig farm scenarios. These methods differ with respect to their global objective (evaluation of impact versus evaluation of adherence to good practice), the number and type of environmental issues they consider, the way they define the system to be analysed, the mode of expression of results (for the farm as a whole, per unit area or per unit product) and the type of indicators used (pressure, state or impact indicators). The pig farm scenarios compared were conventional good agricultural practice (GAP), a quality label scenario called red label (RL) and organic agriculture (OA). We used the methods to rank the three scenarios according to their environmental impacts. The relative ranking of the three scenarios varied considerably depending on characteristics of the evaluation method used and on the mode of expression of results. We recommend the use of evaluation methods that express results both per unit area and per unit product. Environmental evaluation methods should be used with great caution, users should carefully consider which method is most appropriate given their particular needs, taking into consideration the method's characteristics. 3ainput output analysis 3anutrient management 3aexperimental design 3afood animals 3afarm management 3aecological footprint 3agood agricultural practices 3alife cycle assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3acase studies 3aorganic production 3aswine 0aDIALECTE 0afarming systems 0aenvironmental management for agriculture 0aFarmSmart1 aTzilivakis, J.1 aLewis, K.1 aBasset-Mens, C.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2007 Jan., v. 118, no. 1-4 p.327-338dElsevierx0167-88097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2006.06.0053Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070514b20070602c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/05/01  aNon-US 7aarticle01826naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245010000170300001600270520074200286650002101028650001401049650001301063650001001076650001301086650001701099650002301116650001601139650001201155700002801167700001801195773011001213852000901323856008801332939003301420946001101453655001201464IND4450577620221121025014.0110311e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445057762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.femsle.2005.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastiani, Michele13aAn avian pathogenic Escherichia coli isolate induces caspase 3/7 activation in J774 macrophages  ap. 133-140.  aAvian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains, the etiological agent of colibacillosis in poultry, must resist the attack of incoming macrophages in order to cause disease. In this work, we show that an APEC strain (APEC17) remained viable inside J774 macrophages for at least 8 h and was cytotoxic to them 6-8 h after infection. APEC17 induced caspase 3/7 activation, the central caspases in apoptosis, in infected macrophages already at 2 h after infection. Both cytotoxicity and caspase 3/7 activation were reduced when cells were infected with heat-killed APEC17, showing that bacteria must be viable to induce apoptosis. Our findings using APEC17 suggest that APEC may escape destruction by triggering macrophage apoptotic death. 3aEscherichia coli 3aapoptosis 3abacteria 3abirds 3acaspases 3acytotoxicity 3aetiological agents 3amacrophages 3apoultry1 aVidotto, Marilda Carlos1 aHorn, Fabiana0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2005 Dec., v. 253, no. 1 p.133-140dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.femsle.2005.09.0243Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02683naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002100163245014000184300001600324500001500340520065800355650001401013650003001027650001801057650002801075650001501103650001601118650002301134650002501157650001901182650000901201650002001210650001801230650002601248650001201274650001601286650002401302650001401326650001201340650004101352650003801393650003301431650003101464650000901495650002901504650004801533650003801581650002801619653000901647653002301656653001401679653003001693653001501723653002101738653001801759653001801777700001601795773009601811852000901907930003301916945002501949946001101974655001201985IND4364805920221120222919.0041005e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436480592DNAL7 a153131262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Then, over time, these sporozoites move into the circulation, from where they reach the liver to initiate a malaria infection. By use of intravital microscopy of the skin, we present direct morphological evidence of mosquito probing that introduces sporozoites into avascular tissue, of the migration of these sporozoites through the dermis and into blood vessels, and of the role of anti-sporozoite antibodies in blocking sporozoite invasion of these dermal blood vessels. 3aproboscis 3agreen fluorescent protein 3acell movement 3afluorescence microscopy 3aantibodies 3ahematophagy 3aPlasmodium berghei 3adisease transmission 3ainsect vectors 3amice 3aimmune response 3ablood vessels 3ahematophagous insects 3amalaria 3asporozoites 3aAnopheles stephensi 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aAntibodies, Protozoanximmunology 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aPlasmodium bergheiximmunologyxphysiology. 2aSkinxblood supplyxparasitology. 2aSporozoitesxphysiology 0askin 0aparasite migration 0aCulicidae 0asporozoite immobilization 0amicroscopy 0aprobing behavior 0acell motility 0acell invasion1 aFrevert, U.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2004 Aug., v. 34, no. 9 p.991-996x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20041027b20041101c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02800naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245013300148300001800281520121700299650001101516650003101527650002001558650001601578650002001594650001201614650004301626650001101669650005201680650005501732650003901787650003301826650006101859650003201920650003601952650002901988650002802017650006302045653002802108653002302136700001602159773010002175852000902275939003302284946001302317655001202330IND8804233720221120192205.0880926e198809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880423372DNAL7 a28519512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, T.T.

Pulmonary lavage specimens obtained from calves before virus inoculation contained 98% alveolar macrophages (AM) and 1% neutrophils. Six days after inoculation, the mean percentage of neutrophils in lavage specimens had significantly increased to 7.9 +/- 6.0% in BHV-1-inoculated calves and to 18.3 +/- 9.9% in PI-3 virus-inoculated calves, reflecting viral-induced pulmonary inflammation that was confirmed histologically. Approximately 75% of AM obtained before virus inoculation had Fc surface receptors, and 60% had C3b receptors. Six days after inoculation, the percentage of AM with Fc and C3b receptors was significantlyreduced to 69.7 +/- 8.6% and 27.1 +/- 19.8%, respectively, in BHV-1-inoculated calves and to 67.8 +/- 15.4% and 38.8 +/- 23.2%, respectively, in PI-3 virus-inoculated calves. Alveolar macrophages obtained after virus inoculation were significantly impaired in their ability to phagocytize opsonized Staphylococcus epidermidis, but were able to kill ingested bacteria. Alveolar macrophage dysfunctions caused by BHV-1 or PI-3 respiratory infection did not differ appreciably. 3acalves 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aParamyxoviridae 3amacrophages 3aimmune response 2aAnimals 2aBronchoalveolar Lavage Fluidxcytology 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxmicrobiologyxphysiopathology. 2aInfectious Bovine Rhinotracheitisxphysiopathology 2aMacrophagesxanalysisxphysiology. 2aParainfluenza Virus 3, Human 2aParamyxoviridae Infectionsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aPulmonary Alveolixcytology 2aReceptors, Complementxanalysis 2aReceptors, Complement 3b 2aReceptors, Fcxanalysis 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 0aphysiological functions 0abovine herpesvirus1 aAnanaba, G.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1988 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.1447-1451x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880926c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02198naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245006800143300001800211520111100229650001501340650000901355650002001364650001201384650003701396650002001433650003101453650000901484650002401493650002101517650002301538650005501561650002301616700001801639773010001657852000901757939003301766946001301799655001201812IND8804234320221120181201.0880926e198809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880423432DNAL7 a30662422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolt, P.S.10aIn vitro effect of T-2 mycotoxin on the immune response of mice  ap. 1480-1484.  aThe in vitro biologic effects of T-2 mycotoxin on the immune response of mice was undertaken. Twenty nanograms of toxin abrogated the immune response to the T-dependent antigen sheep RBC, whereas a partial response was observed when 2 ng was used. Analysis of cell culture viabilities indicated that cell death occurred with toxin doses that conincided with the diminished immune responses. A similar decreased response was observed against the T-independent antigen, TNP-lipopolysaccharide, indicating toxic effects on both B and T lymphocyte populations. Delay of toxin administration as much as 116 hours of the 120-hour incubation period still resulted in a substantially diminished immune response, indicating the toxin acts on both the afferent and efferent immune systems. Equal effects were observed for mice of the b, d, and k haplotype, indicating no apparent strain variability in sensitivity to T-2 mycotoxin effects. These results indicated that T-2 mycotoxin can modulate the immune response, and that this modulation is attributable to direct toxic effects on the cells of the immune system. 3amycotoxins 3amice 3aimmune response 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formationxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aHemolytic Plaque Technique 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMycotoxinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aSpleenximmunology1 aDeLoach, J.R.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1988 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.1480-1484x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880926c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02258naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245010300143300001800246500001500264520091000279650000901189650000901198650001601207650001501223650000901238650000801247650001101255650002601266650001201292650003201304650004601336650000901382650001101391650002201402650000901424650001701433650004801450653002001498653002501518653000801543700001501551700001601566700001501582773010001597852000901697939003301706946001301739655001201752IND8804234820221120181040.0880928e198809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880423482DNAL7 a32236572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUhaa, I.J.10aCase-control study of risk factors associated with nosocomial Salmonella krefeld infection in dogs  ap. 1501-1505.  a2019-12-04  aIn a case-control study of risk factors associated with an episode of nosocomial Salmonella krefeld infection in dogs at the veterinary medical teaching hospital, data on 20 case dogs and 75 control dogs were obtained by review of hospital records.

This process is catalyzed by nitrogenase and requires copious amounts of ATP. Nitrogenase activity is extremely sensitive to inhibition by oxygen and reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the elevated oxidative metabolic rates required to sustain biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) may favor an increased production of ROS. Here, we explored this paradox and observed that ROS levels are, in fact, decreased in nitrogen-fixing cells due to the up-regulation of transcript levels of six ROS-detoxifying genes. A cluster analyses based on common expression patterns revealed the existence of a stable cluster with 99.8% similarity made up of the genes encoding the α-subunit of nitrogenase Mo-Fe protein (nifD), superoxide dismutase (sodA) and catalase type E (katE). Finally, nitrogenase activity was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by paraquat, a redox cycler that increases cellular ROS levels. Our data revealed that ROS can strongly inhibit nitrogenase activity, and G. diazotrophicus alters its redox metabolism during BNF by increasing antioxidant transcript levels resulting in a lower ROS generation. We suggest that careful controlled ROS production during this critical phase is an adaptive mechanism to allow nitrogen fixation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendophytes 3ametabolism 3anitrogen fixation 3adose response 3anitrogenase 3acatalase 3anitrogen 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acluster analysis 3aadenosine triphosphate 3agenes 3aparaquat 3asugarcane 3aGluconacetobacter diazotrophicus 3agene expression regulation 3aoxygen 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCluster Analysis 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGluconacetobacterxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aNitrogen Fixation 2aNitrogenasexmetabolism 2aParaquatxmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aUp-Regulation 0aantioxidants1 aOliveira, Jose Henrique M. 1 aNogueira, Eduardo M. 1 aGuedes, Helma V. 1 aOliveira, Pedro L. 1 aCâmara, Fernando 1 aBaldani, Jose I. 1 aMartins, Orlando B. 0 tArchives of microbiology.g2010 Oct., v. 192, no. 10 p.835-841dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-010-0609-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02159naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009300128300001600221500002400237520139900261650002301660650001801683650001801701650003101719650001001750700002101760773010301781852000901884655001201893IND4464839520221120095436.0130129s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446483952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdson, Curtis10aTree Location Measurement Accuracy with a Mapping-Grade GPS Receiver under Forest Canopy  ap. 567-576.  aIncludes references  aWe evaluated the accuracy of mapping-grade global positioning system (GPS) receivers in determining tree locations within two temperate conifer forest stands representing moderate and extreme terrain slope conditions. The GPS receiver measurement accuracy assessment focused on autonomous GPS measurements, postprocessing of code satellite signals, and postprocessing of both carrier and coarse acquisition (C/A) code-based signals. The locations of 337 trees within the two stands were measured using a digital total station and a mapping-grade GPS receiver equipped with an external antenna. Average GPS receiver tree position horizontal error was least for the C/A code only differential corrections of tree positions (2.57 and 2.70 m in the two plots), higher for autonomous measurements (2.86 and 3.28 m), and greatest for differential corrections that used both carrier and C/A code signals (2.94 and 3.46 m). The code only differential corrections for tree locations were significantly statistically different or nearly significantly different from the autonomous measurements as well as the carrier and C/A code corrections. On the basis of these results, it appears that postprocessing of coded pseudorange satellite signals is the most accurate and recommended method among those that we tested for mapping-grade GPS surveying of tree locations under a conifer-dominant forest canopy. 3aconiferous forests 3aforest canopy 3aforest stands 3aglobal positioning systems 3atrees1 aWing, Michael G.0 tForest science.g2012 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.567-576dSociety of American Forestersx0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245011700130300001600247500002400263520156400287650003701851650002101888650001801909650001801927650002101945650001801966650001701984650002002001650001602021650001002037651001202047700002102059700001802080700001502098700001702113700002402130773010302154852000902257655001202266IND4464840020221120074818.0130129s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446484002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBequet, Raphael10aSpatial Variability of Leaf Area Index in Homogeneous Forests Relates to Local Variation in Tree Characteristics  ap. 633-640.  aIncludes references  aForest canopy density can be highly variable within one stand. The accuracy of indirect methods to quantify stand leaf area index (LAI) is often unknown, and intensive sampling strategies are required. Our objectives were to study the drivers of the spatial LAI variability and to improve the sampling strategy based on a sampling protocol as a function of the local canopy pattern. We examined the spatial variability of hemispherical photography (HP)-based LAI estimates of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.), and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) in Flanders, Belgium. Within the 30 selected forest stands, a regular grid of 16 LAI measurement points and a circular forest inventory plot were established. The LAI estimates of the grid points were used to calculate the LAI of the squared cells (defined as "patches"), within the regular grid. Local forest inventory data were used to study the drivers of the deviation of patch LAI (LAIdev) relative to the average plot LAI. Average tree distance from a patch center was negatively related with the LAIdev. Tree structural characteristics (dbh, tree height, crown length, and crown cover) were all positively related to the LAIdev. Based on our findings, we suggest that for the forest types analyzed, sampling layouts for HP-based LAI estimates should follow a pattern of selecting two (beech and pine) or three (oak) sample points and positioning the camera at a distance of approximately 20% of the dominant height from one (beech) or two (oak and pine) large trees. 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aPinus sylvestris 3aQuercus robur 3aforest canopy 3aforest inventory 3aforest stands 3aforest types 3aleaf area index 3aphotography 3atrees 3aBelgium1 aCampioli, Matteo1 aKint, Vincent1 aMuys, Bart1 aBogaert, Jan1 aCeulemans, Reinhart0 tForest science.g2012 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.633-640dSociety of American Forestersx0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02335naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245009700148300001800245300002300263500001500286520108700301650001901388650001301407650000901420650001601429650001501445650001201460650003401472650002301506650003001529650002101559650003001580650004001610650003801650653001301688653002901701700001601730773010001746852000901846939003301855946001301888655001201901IND8804234120221120045828.0880926e198809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880423412DNAL7 a32236542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngersoll, J.D.10aIdentification of viral antigens that induce antibody responses on exposure to coronaviruses  ap. 1467-1471.  ap. 1467-1471. ill.  a2019-12-05  aVarious techniques were used to look for protective, non-cross-reactive antibodies in the sera of cats exposed to virulent feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). Antibodies reactive with feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) from FIPV-exposed cats were adsorbed by several passages over an FECV-Sepharose column. In an ELISA against FECV and FIPV, the activity against both viruses was removed at the same rate; thus, no FIPV-specific antibodies could be identified. By gel electrophoresis-derived ELISA, the responses of cats surviving FIPV exposure were compared with those of cats succumbing to FIPV exposure to determine whether survival could be correlated with an antibody response against a particular virus protein. Results indicated that both groups responded in the same way to the matrix envelope protein and nucleocapsid proteins. Even though the response to peplomer in each group was weak, the survivor group responded better to this protein. Furthermore, the response of this group to the peplomer protein had the highest correlation with virus neutralization titer. 3across reaction 3aantigens 3acats 3aperitonitis 3aantibodies 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralximmunology 2aAntibody Formation 2aAntigens, Viralxanalysis 2aCatsximmunology 2aCoronaviridaeximmunology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 0aimmunity 0afeline peritonitis virus1 aWylie, D.E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1988 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.1467-1471x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880926c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02459naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245008000188300001600268520093000284650001001214650002401224650005201248650004101300650001201341650005801353650001101411650003501422650005701457650003201514650005001546650004401596650003601640653001101676653001101687653002001698653001801718773013901736852000901875856008501884930003301969946001102002655001202013IND4430727320221120032138.0100101e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443072732DNAL7 a198305822pmid7 a10.1007/s10974-009-9189-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuther, Pradeep K. 14aThe vertebrate muscle Z-disc: sarcomere anchor for structure and signalling  ap. 171-185.  aThe Z-disc, appearing as a fine dense line forming sarcomere boundaries in striated muscles, when studied in detail reveals crosslinked filament arrays that transmit tension and house myriads of proteins with diverse functions. At the Z-disc the barbed ends of the antiparallel actin filaments from adjoining sarcomeres interdigitate and are crosslinked primarily by layers of α-actinin. The Z-disc is therefore the site of polarity reversal of the actin filaments, as needed to interact with the bipolar myosin filaments in successive sarcomeres. The layers of α-actinin determine the Z-disc width: fast fibres have narrow (~30-50 nm) Z-discs and slow and cardiac fibres have wide (~100 nm) Z-discs. Comprehensive reviews on the roles of the numerous proteins located at the Z-disc in signalling and disease have been published; the aim here is different, namely to review the advances in structural aspects of the Z-disc. 3aactin 3aelectron microscopy 2aActin Cytoskeletonxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aActininxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aAnimals 2aCell Membrane Structuresxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aHumans 2aMuscle Contractionxphysiology 2aMuscle Fibers, Skeletalxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aMuscle Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aSarcomeresxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 0aZ-line 0aZ-band 0aMuscle proteins 0aAlpha-actinin0 tJournal of muscle research and cell motility.g2009 Sept., v. 30, no. 5-6 p.171-185dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0142-43197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10974-009-9189-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03944naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245013100188300001600319500001500335520137000350650001101720650002101731650003701752650001401789650002901803650001001832650001601842650002901858650002601887650001601913650002401929650001001953650002401963650002801987650001402015650003802029650003802067650001902105650001702124650003002141650004302171650002302214650005902237650002802296650004902324650001402373650001402387650005302401650002202454650004402476650005202520650002902572650002402601650003802625650002402663653002902687653003902716653004502755653002402800653001602824653003602840700001902876700002102895773011302916852000903029856009203038930003303130946001103163655001203174IND4431296220221120023239.0100115e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443129622DNAL7 a200030732pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03116.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhn, Hannah10aMembrane steroid-binding protein 1 induced by a diffusible fungal signal is critical for mycorrhization in Medicago truncatula  ap. 716-733.  a2019-12-04  aArbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) is a mutualistic biotrophic association that requires a complex exchange of signals between plant and fungus to allow accommodation of the mycosymbiont in the root cortex. Signal exchange happens even before physical contact, activating the plant symbiotic program. We investigated very early transcriptional responses in Medicago truncatula to inoculation with Glomus intraradices and identified four genes induced by diffusible AM fungal signals before contact. Three of them were previously shown to be mycorrhiza induced at later stages of the symbiosis, while MtMSBP1, encoding a membrane-bound steroid-binding protein, is a novel mycorrhizal marker. Expression analyses in plants defective in the symbiotic receptor kinase DMI2 allowed discrimination of two different signaling cascades involved in the perception of the diffusible signals. Thus, while some of the genes are activated in a DMI2-dependent manner, the induction of one of them encoding a proteinase inhibitor is DMI2-independent. Downregulation of MtMSBP1 by RNAi led to an aberrant mycorrhizal phenotype with thick and septated appressoria, decrease number of arbuscules and distorted arbuscule morphology. This provides genetic evidence that MtMSBP1 is critical for mycorrhiza development. We hypothesize that MtMSBP1 plays a role in sterol homeostasis in the root. 3acortex 3aRNA interference 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aphenotype 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aappressoria 3aMedicago truncatula 3afungi 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aDiffusion 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Silencing 2aGenes, Plant 2aGlomeromycotaxmetabolism 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHyphaexmetabolism 2aMedicago truncatulaxcytologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycorrhizaexcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Transport 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedlingsxmicrobiology. 2aSignal Transduction 2aSubcellular Fractionsxmetabolism 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 0adiffusible fungal signal 0aMedicago truncatula (barrel medic) 0aMtMSBP1 membrane steroid-binding protein 0aGlomus intraradices 0aSYM Pathway 0aarbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis1 aKüster, Helge1 aRequena, Natalia0 tNew phytologist.g2010 Feb., v. 185, no. 3 p.716-733dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03116.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100115b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01886naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151100001500160245007800175300001800253500009300271500002400364520061000388650002500998650002301023650002601046650002201072650004401094650002001138650002101158700001601179700001601195700001801211773009001229852000901319856009101328930003301419945002501452946001101477655001201488IND4396037220221120023210.0071012e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439603722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aMassou, S.10aNMR-based fluxomics: Quantitative 2D NMR methods for isotopomers analysis  ap. 2330-2340.  aIn the Special Issue: Dynamic metabolic netowrks / edited by N.

This approach extends the range of NMR methods applicable in 13C-labelling experiments and is suitable to investigating the dynamic behaviour of metabolic systems. 3abiochemical pathways 3aplant biochemistry 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectral analysis 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3astable isotopes 3aisotope labeling1 aNicolas, C.1 aLetisse, F.1 aPortais, J.C.0 tPhytochemistry.g2007 , v. 68, no. 16-18 p.2330-2340dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.03.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20071105b20071210c00000000  aINDdRSCe2007/11/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02603naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001900146245006800165300001600233500001500249520088500264650001501149650001301164650000801177650001301185650001401198650001001212650002301222650002501245650001701270650001301287650001901300650001101319650001501330650001001345650002601355650002301381650002501404650003501429650002701464650001101491650000901502650002301511650003501534650001601569650002401585650002501609650001701634653001401651653002201665653001201687653001401699700001901713700002101732773012001753852000901873930003301882945002501915946001301940655001201953IND4390777420221120022441.0070502e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439077742DNAL7 a173428822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMcMurray, R.G.14aThe Timing of Fluid Intake During an Olympic Distance Triathlon  ap. 611-619.  a2019-12-05  aSeven highly trained male triathletes, aged 18 to 35 years, were tested during two simulated Olympic distance triathlons to determine whether run performance was enhanced when consuming 177 ml of water at 8, 16, 24, and 32 kilometers (Early Trials) compared to consumption at 10, 20, 30, and 40 kilometers (Late Trials), during the cycling segment of the triathlon. Swim times for 1500 m were similar between trials; 40-km cycling times were approximately 10 s faster during the Late Trials; however, 10-km run times were faster during the Early Trials (P < 0.02). No significant differences between run trials were found for the rating of perceived exertion, oxygen uptake, heart rate, and change in urine specific gravity. It was concluded that the consumption of fluids earlier in the cycle phase of the Olympic distance triathlon benefits the run and overall performance time. 3aheart rate 3adrinking 3amen 3aathletes 3abicycling 3aurine 3aoxygen consumption 3aathletic performance 3ayoung adults 3aswimming 3adrinking water 3asports 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBicyclingxphysiology 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDrinkingxphysiology 2aExercise Tolerancexphysiology 2aHeart Ratexphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPhysical Endurancexphysiology 2aRespiration 2aRunningxphysiology 2aSwimmingxphysiology 2aTime Factors 0ahydration 0aphysical activity 0arunning 0atriathlon1 aWilliams, D.K.1 aBattaglini, C.L.0 tInternational journal of sport nutrition & exercise metabolism.g2006 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.611-619x1526-484X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070919b20071002c00000000  aINDd1CTe2007/09/16  aOther US 7aarticle03023naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245008300146300001600229520145300245650001001698650001301708650002101721650001701742650002101759650000901780650001901789650001001808650002501818650001401843650000901857650001201866650001101878650001401889650002401903650001901927650001001946650004601956650001902002650000902021650001102030650002202041650004202063650001102105650005202116650003202168650002302200650001902223700001502242773012002257852000902377930003302386945001302419946001302432655001202445IND2327968020221123040904.0020710e200112  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232796802DNAL7 a119157822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, L.W.10aOsteoporosis knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of female collegiate athletes  ap. 482-489.  aFemale athletes often engage in harmful dietary and weight control practices that can impair bone health and hinder performance. To promote related positive health behavior practices, nutrition educators may be more effective if they understand the osteoporosis knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among female athletes. A questionnaire including items related to osteoporosis and dietary calcium knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral practices was administered to 114 female collegiate athletes (19.6 +/- 1.4 years). Self-reported intakes of dairy product consumption were also obtained; subjects were asked how many times per week they drank milk and ate cheese, yogurt, and ice cream. The mean score for osteoporosis knowledge was 7.1 +/- 1.9 (out of 10 items). The mean score for favorable responses to attitude items was 2.1 +/- 0.8 (out of 3 items). Correct responses to dietary calcium knowledge items were 2.2 +/- 0.7 (out of 3 items). On average, subjects consumed 2.4 +/- 1.6 servings of dairy products per day; 31% of subjects consumed the recommended 3 or more servings per day. Osteoporosis knowledge, osteoporosis attitudes, and dietary calcium knowledge were not correlated (p > .05) with dairy product intake. Because of the importance of achieving a high peak bone mass to prevent osteoporosis, our data suggest that further research is needed regarding other factors that might influence dairy product intake among female athletes. 3awomen 3aathletes 3acollege students 3aosteoporosis 3ahealth promotion 3adiet 3aweight control 3abones 3aathletic performance 3aknowledge 3amilk 3acheeses 3ayogurt 3aice cream 3anutrition education 3ahealth beliefs 2aAdult 2aCalcium, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aDairy Products 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aOsteoporosisxprevention & controlxpsychology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSportsxpsychology 2aWomen's Health1 aBass, M.A.0 tInternational journal of sport nutrition & exercise metabolism.g2001 Dec., v. 11, no. 4 p.482-489x1526-484X7nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03324naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245011700147300001600264520146700280650000801747650002201755650002001777650001701797650001201814650001301826650001601839650002001855650001901875650002501894650001601919650001801935650001801953650001001971650000901981650005101990650004202041650004602083650002402129650002402153650002202177650002502199650001102224650002602235650001902261650000902280650004602289650002402335650001702359650001902376653001102395653001302406653001102419653001002430700001702440700001702457773012002474852000902594930003302603945001302636946001302649655001202662IND2323260320221123040831.0010929e200012  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232326032DNAL7 a110993682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloomer, R.J.10aEffects of meal form and composition on plasma testosterone, cortisol, and insulin following resistance exercise  ap. 415-424.  aThe purpose of this study was to examine the effects of postexercise feeding on plasma levels of insulin, testosterone, cortisol, and testosterone:cortisol (T:C). Ten experienced, resistance trained males (20.7 +/- 0.95 years) were given whole food (WF: protein 38 g; carbohydrate 70 g; fat 7 g), a supplemental drink (SD; isocaloric and isonitrogenous to WF), an isocaloric carbohydrate beverage (C), or a placebo beverage (P) immediately, 2 and 4 hours after a standardized weight training protocol on 4 days, each separated by 1 week, in a repeated measures design. Subjects also received a standardized meal at 7 and 12 hours postexercise. Insulin, testosterone, and cortisol were measured pre-exercise and during 24 hours of recovery (at 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 8, and 24 hours) using venous blood samples. Significant (condition x time) interactions were found for insulin, testosterone, and T:C, but not for cortisol (p < .05). The SD yielded a greater response for insulin than all other conditions. Conversely, P demonstrated the greatest values for testosterone and T:C at 2.5 and 4.5 hours postexercise. Cortisol did not vary between conditions and there were no condition effects for insulin, testosterone, cortisol, and T:C at 8 or 24 hours. In conclusion, the efficacy of postexercise feeding for optimizing T:C and muscle growth is unclear; however, consumption of SD appears to maximize circulating insulin for several hours following resistance exercise. 3amen 3astrength training 3ablood chemistry 3atestosterone 3ainsulin 3acortisol 3afood intake 3adietary protein 3aprotein intake 3adietary carbohydrate 3adietary fat 3aenergy intake 3acarbohydrates 2aAdult 2aDiet 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aExercisexphysiology 2aHumans 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTestosteronexblood 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Lifting 0agrowth 0aefficacy 0aratios 0ameals1 aSforzo, G.A.1 aKeller, B.A.0 tInternational journal of sport nutrition & exercise metabolism.g2000 Dec., v. 10, no. 4 p.415-424x1526-484X7nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02738naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245006600180300001600246520100500262650001601267650002301283650001301306650001501319650002301334650002301357650001501380650002001395650001701415650002101432650002101453650001601474650000801490650001001498650001101508650001001519650002301529650002501552650001101577650002201588650002401610650001101634650000901645650003001654650002301684650003501707650002401742650002901766653002601795700001401821700001701835700001901852700001701871773012001888852000902008930003302017945002502050946001302075655001202088IND4374546120221123024937.0050920e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437454612DNAL7 a162866742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHerrmann, M.10aAltered vitamin B12 status in recreational endurance athletes  ap. 433-441.  aThis study aimed to compare the vitamin B12 and folate status of recreational endurance athletes and inactive controls by modern biomarkers. In 72 athletes (38 ± 7 y) and 46 inactive controls (38 ± 9 y) serum levels of vitamin B12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), holotranscobalamin II (holoTC), folate, and homocysteine (Hcy) were measured. Vitamin B12 and folate levels of both groups were comparable, but athletes had higher median (25.-75. percentile) MMA [242 (196 to 324) versus 175 (141 to 266) nmol/L] and holoTC concentrations [67 (52 to 93) versus 55 (45 to 70) pmol/L] than controls. Hcy was slightly lower in athletes [9.2 (7.2 to 12.6) versus 10.8 (8.9 to 12.9) nmol/L]. In controls, we found the following correlations: vitamin B12 and MMA (r = -0.38), vitamin B12 and holoTC (r = 0.51), MMA and holoTC (r = -0.36). In athletes, MMA did not correlate with vitamin B12 and holoTC. Our data suggests an altered vitamin B12 metabolism in recreational athletes that needs further investigation. 3avitamin B12 3avitamin metabolism 3aathletes 3afolic acid 3anutritional status 3amethylmalonic acid 3abiomarkers 3atranscobalamins 3ahomocysteine 3asports nutrition 3ahuman physiology 3acorrelation 3amen 3awomen 3aadults 2aAdult 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxblood 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMethylmalonic Acidxblood 2aNutritional Status 2aPhysical Endurancexphysiology 2aVitamin B 12xblood 2aVitamin B Complexxblood 0aholotranscobalamin II1 aObeid, R.1 aScharhag, J.1 aKindermann, W.1 aHerrmann, W.0 tInternational journal of sport nutrition & exercise metabolism.g2005 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.433-441x1526-484X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080722b20080801c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/11/10  aOther US 7aarticle03291naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002000163245010500183300001600288520105000304650001701354650001301371650002001384650001001404650002101414650001501435650001101450650001401461650001701475650001201492650001601504650000801520650001801528650001901546650001001565650001401575650001101589650002001600650002001620650001501640650001401655650001501669650001001684650004201694650006801736650009301804650003601897650003701933650002401970650001101994650003802005650002602043650000902069650005702078653002602135700002002161700001502181700001902196700001502215700001502230700001502245700001502260700001702275700001702292773012002309852000902429930003302438945002502471946001302496655001202509IND4372023520221123024858.0050705e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437202352DNAL7 a161316962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Healthy males (mean +/- standard deviation; age, 21.6 +/- 3.3 y) consumed 3 mg caffeine . kg(-1) . d(-1) on days 1 to 6 (equilibration phase). On days 7 to 11 (treatment phase), subjects consumed either 0 mg (C0; placebo; n = 20), 3 mg (C3; n = 20), or 6 mg (C6; n = 19) caffeine . kg(-1) . d(-1) in capsules, with no other dietary caffeine intake. The following variables were unaffected (P > 0.05) by different caffeine doses on days 1, 3, 6, 9, and 11 and were within normal clinical ranges: body mass, urine osmolality, urine specific gravity, urine color, 24-h urine volume, 24-h Na(+) and K(+) excretion, 24-h creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, serum Na(+) and K(+), serum osmolality, hematocrit, and total plasma protein. Therefore, C0, C3, and C6 exhibited no evidence of hypohydration. These findings question the widely accepted notion that caffeine consumption acts chronically as a diuretic. 3awater stress 3acaffeine 3anutrient intake 3aurine 3aspecific gravity 3aosmolarity 3asodium 3apotassium 3aelectrolytes 3aliquids 3ahomeostasis 3amen 3adose response 3arenal function 3acolor 3aexcretion 3avolume 3abody mass index 3ablood chemistry 3acreatinine 3adiuretics 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBody Waterxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCaffeinexadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aCentral Nervous System Stimulantsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxmetabolism. 2aDehydrationxchemically induced 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aHumans 2aKidneyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aKidney Function Tests 2aMale 2aWater-Electrolyte Balancexdrug effectsxphysiology. 0achronic hypohydration1 aPumerantz, A.C.1 aRoti, M.W.1 aJudelson, D.A.1 aWatson, G.1 aDias, J.C.1 aSokmen, B.1 aCasa, D.J.1 aMaresh, C.M.1 aLiberman, H.0 tInternational journal of sport nutrition & exercise metabolism.g2005 June, v. 15, no. 3 p.252-265x1526-484X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/12/01  aOther US 7aarticle02185naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001600137245011800153300001800271500002400289520089500313650001701208650001901225650002501244650002101269650002601290650002101316650001701337650001001354650002101364650002001385650001501405651002101420653001701441700001601458773009201474852000901566856009301575930003301668945002501701946001301726655001201739IND4396033620221122220654.0071012e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439603362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aJ500 0aF5001 aBilgili, U.10aEffect of Nitrogen Fertilization on Quality Characteristics of Four Turf Mixtures Under Different Wear Treatments  ap. 1139-1152.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of three nitrogen (N) application regimes on the color, turf quality, cover, and clipping weights of four different sports type mixtures were evaluated under different wear frequencies for three years in an irrigated field.

The turf mixtures were subjected to four different wear treatments at frequencies of zero (control), once per week, once biweekly, and once per month for approximately eight months each experimental year. Wear treatments reduced turf color and quality, cover percentage, and clipping yield. Application of wear every week was detrimental to turf characteristics, whereas wear once every month generally had no significant effect. Nitrogen fertilization resulted in improved color and quality, and increased cover percentage and clipping yield. 3aturf grasses 3alawns and turf 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3abotanical composition 3atrampling damage 3aplant damage 3acolor 3avegetation cover 3aathletic fields 3airrigation 3aTurkey (country) 0aturf quality1 aAcikgoz, E.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007 , v. 30, no. 7-9 p.1139-1152dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/24  aOther US 7aarticle02351naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245008000143300001600223500001500239520125100254650002001505650001601525650001401541650001701555650001301572650002401585650001801609650001501627650002301642650002601665651001701691653001701708653001201725700001501737700001501752773008201767852000901849930003301858945002501891946001301916655001201929IND4373307120221122220608.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437330712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Data collection included plant populations (percent stand), marketable and unmarketable yields and edamame pod and bean quality indicators. Plant populations varied by year and cultivar and were generally below 80%. The effect of temperature on seedling emergence, and therefore plant populations, was evaluated for four edamame cultivars by using growth chambers programmed with varying day/night temperature regimes. Seedling emergence varied by cultivar and was generally below 80% with two exceptions. When grown in a 70/60 degrees day/night temperature regime, 'Butterbeans', and 'Early Hakucho' exceeded 80% seedling emergence. In the field trial, plant populations affected marketable yields. Pod and bean quality were dependent on cultivar. Results indicated that 'Butterbeans', 'Early Hakucho', 'Green Legend', 'Shironomai', 'Butterbaby', and 'Lucky Lion' appear promising for growing in Pennsylvania based on pod and bean quality. However, the issue of poor seedling emergence and plant populations presents a major constraint to commercial production and needs to be studied further. 3aseedling growth 3aGlycine max 3acultivars 3acrop quality 3asoybeans 3aambient temperature 3aplant density 3acrop yield 3aseedling emergence 3afield experimentation 3aPennsylvania 0aplant growth 0aedamame1 aKelley, K.1 aButler, L.0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 3 p.672-676wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/23  aOther US 7aarticle02250naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245007700178300001600255520117100271650002201442650001701464650001301481650002501494650001701519650002101536650001701557650002301574650001501597650002001612650001101632700001501643700002001658773008201678852000901760930003301769945002501802946001301827655001201840IND4373299320221122220623.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437329932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Irrigation of 0.4 inch was applied to half of the plots immediately after application of terbacil. Injury was greater when terbacil was applied before new growth than when applied at the three-leaf stage. Injury symptoms increased linearly with terbacil rate. Irrigation immediately following terbacil application reduced injury relative to non-irrigated plots. Weed control was reduced when terbacil was applied at the three-leaf stage than when applied before new growth. Irrigation did not reduce weed control. Herbicide injury symptoms were not detected the spring following terbacil application. Fruit yield was not affected by herbicide and irrigation treatments applied the previous year. The combination of low rates of terbacil, 0.8-1.6 oz/acre a.i., followed by irrigation to remove the herbicide from foliage is a safe option that growers can use to improve weed control and reduce hand weeding costs in the planting year. 3aFragaria ananassa 3astrawberries 3aterbacil 3aherbicide resistance 3aweed control 3airrigation rates 3aplant damage 3aapplication timing 3acrop yield 3aadverse effects 3aleaves1 aDoohan, D.1 aScheerens, J.C.0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 3 p.560-564wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle04531naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001800146245005900164300001800223500002400241500001500265520300500280650002803285650001703313650002303330650001103353650001403364650002003378650002103398650001203419650002103431650001103452650001003463650002203473650002603495650001903521650002603540650001603566650002003582651002203602653002403624653001503648700002003663700001703683773009203700852000903792856009303801930003303894945002503927946001303952655001203965IND4396033820221122220547.0071012e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439603382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF120 0aJ500 0aF2001 aBrennan, R.F.10aComparing the Calcium Requirements of Wheat and Canola  ap. 1167-1184.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSpring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the major crop species grown in south-western Australia and no responses of wheat to applied calcium (Ca) have been obtained in field experiments though responses have been obtained in glasshouse pot studies for wheat grown on the predominantly sandy acidic soils of the region. Since the mid 1990s canola (oilseed rape, Brassica napus L.) has been grown in rotation with wheat and has often developed symptoms of Ca deficiency when grown on sandy acidic soils in the field. The Ca requirement of canola in these soils is not known and was measured and compared with Ca requirements of wheat in the glasshouse study reported here when 5 amounts of Ca (0-630 mg Ca/pot), as calcium sulfate, were applied. Application of Ca did not affect shoot production of wheat but increased grain yields by about 25% and 50 mg Ca/pot was required to produce 90% of the maximum grain yield. Two canola cultivars were grown, and both showed no shoot yield responses to applied Ca at early growth (GS1.5). However, at flower bud visible (GS3.5) shoots of triazine tolerant canola cv. 'Karoo' showed about 17% increase to applied Ca and required approximately 47 mg Ca/pot to produce 90% of the maximum yield, while corresponding values for cv. 'Outback' were 42% and 185 mg Ca/pot. Both canola cultivars showed large seed (grain) yield responses to applied Ca. Canola cv. 'Outback' produced no grain when no Ca was applied and showed approximately 97% increase to applied Ca and required about 462 mg Ca/pot to produce 90% of the maximum grain yield. The triazine tolerant cv. 'Karoo' produced about 22% of the maximum grain yield when no Ca was applied, showed approximately 78% grain yield response to applied Ca and required about 475 mg Ca/pot to produce 90% of the maximum grain yield. However, to produce 50% of the maximum grain yield, cv. 'Outback' required 250 mg Ca/pot while cv. 'Karoo' required about 100 mg Ca/pot. The grain yield response curve for cv. 'Karoo' was exponential and that for cv. 'Outback' was sigmoid so differences in the response curves were largest when small amounts of Ca were applied and decreased as more Ca was applied. Evidently canola cultivars differ in their ability to access soil and applied Ca providing opportunity to breed and select cultivars efficient at accessing soil and applied Ca. For both wheat and canola the concentration of Ca in dried shoots increased as more Ca was applied and, for each amount of Ca applied, the concentration of Ca in shoots decreased as plants matured. Both canola cultivars consistently had larger concentrations of Ca in shoots than wheat, either when no Ca was applied and for each amount of Ca applied, suggesting canola roots were better able to access soil and applied Ca than wheat roots. The Ca concentration in young wheat (GS15) and canola (GS1.5) shoots that was related to 90% of the maximum grain yield (critical Ca concentration) was 0.33% for wheat and 2.5% for both canola cultivars. 3ainterspecific variation 3aplant growth 3aapplication timing 3acanola 3acultivars 3aplant nutrition 3anutrient content 3acalcium 3afertilizer rates 3ashoots 3awheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3anutrient requirements 3aBrassica napus 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3acalcium sulfate 3aWestern Australia 0aspecies differences 0acrop yield1 aBolland, M.D.A.1 aWalton, G.H.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007 , v. 30, no. 7-9 p.1167-1184dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/24  aOther US 7aarticle02680naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245013200164300001600296520140800312650002001720650001101740650001501751650001101766650001601777650002701793650003001820650001701850650001501867650001101882650002601893650001701919650002101936650001601957650001001973650001701983650001402000700001602014700001802030773008202048852000902130930003302139945002502172946001302197655001202210IND4373300420221122220532.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437330042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Dormant shoots were tested in early winter to determine the rate of AA vapor that they could tolerate before being damaged. Apricot (Prunus armeniaca), apple (Malus x domestica), and peach (Prunus persica) shoots collected from a single site in Dec. 1999 tolerated 30, 12, or 6 mg.L(-1) AA, respectively. Vineland 3 (V3) and Malling-Merton 106 (MM. 106) rootstock liners fumigated with 1 mg.L(-1) AA were adequately surface-sterilized although the effect on growth was not recorded. A similar experiment with Malling 9 (M9) rootstocks showed that 12 mg.L(-1) AA would eliminate most surface microorganisims from roots although it delayed shoot growth when the trees were planted. The higher 15 mg.L(-1) rate delayed tree growth and appeared to kill some trees. The 12 mg.L(-1) rate prevented growth of Erwinia amylovora and Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae bacteria on shoots even when an enrichment technique was used to detect them. Finally, when 96 'Jonagold' apple shoots known to be infected by Podosphaera leucotricha were fumigated with AA in 2001, none developed powdery mildew, although 99% of the control shoots did. These promising results suggest that further research should be done toward adapting AA fumigation for use by commercial nurseries. 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3arootstocks 3ascions 3aacetic acid 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3adisinfection 3afumigation 3ashoots 3apropagation materials 3aplant damage 3aapplication rate 3asterilizing 3aroots 3aplant growth 3amortality1 aRandall, P.1 aHampson, C.R.0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 3 p.591-596wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle02852naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245013700178300001600315520149600331650002001827650001801847650001701865650002101882650002301903650002101926650003001947650002001977650001701997650001902014650001702033650002002050650002102070650002502091650001502116650001802131650002402149700001902173700001602192773008202208852000902290930003302299945002502332946001302357655001202370IND4373303220221122175957.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437330322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSantos, B.M.10aManaging nutsedge and stunt nematode in pepper with reduced methyl bromide plus chloropicrin rates under virtually impermeable films  ap. 596-599.  aTwo field trials were conducted to determine the effect of reduced methyl bromide plus chloropicrin (MBr + Pic 67:33 v/v) rates applied under two types of virtually impermeable films (VIF) on nutsedges (Cyperus spp.) and stunt nematode (Tylenchorhynchus spp.) control, and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) crop yield. A split-plot design with six replications was established, with MBr + Pic rates in the main plots and mulch types as subplots. MBr + Pic rates were 0, 88, 175, and 350 lb/acre. Mulch types were low-density polyethylene (LDPE) mulch, Hytibar VIF, and Bromostop VIF. Results showed that there were no differences on weed and nematode control, and bell pepper fruit yield between the two types of VIF. Two exponential models characterized the nutsedge responses to MBr + Pic rates with LDPE mulch and VIF, with weed densities declining as MBr + Pic rates increased. Reducing MBr + Pic rates by one-half (175 lb/acre) under VIF provided similar nutsedge control as the full-rate (350 lb/acre) with LDPE mulch. Similar results were observed with stunt nematode, where the most effective control occurred with VIF. Bell pepper yield with LDPE mulch responded linearly to increased MBr + Pic rates. However, a logarithmic model described the response of pepper yields to the fumigant rates under VIF. The application rate of this fumigant could be effectively reduced to 25% of the commercial rate (350 lb/acre) under either VIF, without causing significant bell pepper yield losses. 3aCapsicum annuum 3asweet peppers 3aweed control 3aCyperus rotundus 3aCyperus esculentus 3aTylenchorhynchus 3aplant parasitic nematodes 3abroadleaf weeds 3apest control 3amethyl bromide 3achloropicrin 3asoil fumigation 3aapplication rate 3aplastic film mulches 3acrop yield 3aplant density 3amathematical models1 aGilreath, J.P.1 aMotis, T.N.0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 3 p.596-599wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle02061naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009700145300001800242300002300260520068500283650001400968650001900982650001601001650003901017650001201056650001401068650001601082650001201098650004601110650001101156650001101167650005901178650003701237650002501274650002101299650001701320650002901337650001701366653001301383700001601396700001301412773009901425852000901524939003301533946001301566655001201579IND8803051420221122154016.0880805e198807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880305142DNAL7 a31389312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarmon, B.G.10aSurvival of rough and smooth strains of Brucella abortus in bovine mammary gland macrophages  ap. 1092-1097.  ap. 1092-1097. ill.  aChronic bovine brucellosis is characterized by persistent infection of the mammary gland. The interaction of live Brucella abortus with bovine mammary gland macrophages was studied in vitro. Opsonization of smooth B abortus strain 2308 and rough strain 45/20 was required for phagocytosis by mammary gland macrophages. When opsonized with specific antiserum, strains 2308 and 45/20 stimulated a considerable oxidative burst when phagocytized by mammary gland macrophages. Intracellular survival rates for strain 2308 were significantly higher than those for strain 45/20. After being phagocytized, B abortus localized in phagosomes and phagolysosomes of mammary gland macrophages. 3abeef cows 3amammary glands 3amacrophages 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3astrains 3amortality 3abrucellosis 2aAnimals 2aBrucella abortusximmunologyxphysiology. 2aCattle 2aFemale 2aMacrophagesximmunologyxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytology 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aOpsonin Proteins 2aPhagocytosis 2aPhagosomesxmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 0ain vitro1 aAdams, L.G.1 aFrey, M.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1988 July, v. 49, no. 7 p.1092-1097x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880805c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02335naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001300119245007300132300001800205500002400223500001500247520095700262650002201219650001601241650002201257650001401279650003501293650002601328650001301354650001701367650002101384650002301405650001501428650001501443650002801458650001101486653002101497653002001518700001301538700001201551700001301563773009201576852000901668856009301677930003301770945002501803946001301828655001201841IND4396034820221121225243.0071012e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439603482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF5001 aQiao, Y.10aPhosphorus Deficiency Delays the Onset of Nodule Function in Soybean  ap. 1341-1353.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEffects of phosphorus (P) deficiency on nodulation were examined in soybean grown in nutrient solution for 7 weeks. Increasing P supply increased shoot growth of nitrogen (N2)-fixing plants from week 5 and that of nitrate-fed plant from week 4 after treatment. Nitrogen (N2)-fixing plants had a greater P requirement for maximum growth at week 5. Increasing P supply from 1 to 16 micromolar increased N concentration in N2-fixing plants at week 4 but did not affect it from week 5. By contrast, P deficiency increased N concentration in nitrate-fed plants. Increasing P supply improved nodule formation from week 3. Nodule mass was affected more by P supply than nodule number, which, in turn, was affected more than plant growth. However, P supply did not decrease nodule specific N2 fixation from week 5. The results suggest that P deficiency impaired symbiotic N2 fixation through delaying onset of nodule function and decreasing nodule development. 3aplant development 3aGlycine max 3anitrogen fixation 3asymbiosis 3anutrient-nutrient interactions 3anutrient deficiencies 3asoybeans 3aroot nodules 3anitrate nitrogen 3anutrient solutions 3anodulation 3aphosphorus 3adry matter partitioning 3ashoots 0anitrogen content 0aplant nutrition1 aTang, C.1 aHan, X.1 aMiao, S.0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2007 , v. 30, no. 7-9 p.1341-1353dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/12/24  aOther US 7aarticle01517naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245007800148300001600226500002300242520032800265650002200593650001300615650001000628650002500638650001100663650001100674650001400685650005400699650002700753650003200780651001300812651001300825653001300838653002100851653002300872700002100895773010600916852000901022939003301031945000801064946001101072655001201083991616508130742620221121225258.0840201e198212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840005872DNAL7 a63089812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGill, H.S.10aPrevalence of Toxoplasma antibodies in pregnant African women in Tanzania  ap. 167-170.  aSummary in French.  aToxoplasma gondii, humans, survey of infection rate in normal pregnant African women and in those suffering from anemia and hypertension, results suggest association between parasite infection and hypertension and anemia, infection rate was significantly high in women who had histories of abortion: Dar es Salaam, Tanzania 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aimmunity 2aAdult 2aAntibodiesxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications, Infectiousxepidemiology 2aToxoplasmaximmunology 2aToxoplasmosisxepidemiology 3aTanzania 0aTanzania 0aabortion 0aAnemia, Protozoa 0aReproduction, Host1 aMtimavalye, L.A.0 tAfrican Journal of Medicine and Medical Sciences.g1982 Dec., v. 11, no. 4 p.167-170x0309-39137nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840201c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02660naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001900178245011400197300001400311500001500325520147800340650002501818650001801843650001301861650002501874650001201899650002301911650001101934651001201945653001501957700001701972700001701989700001702006700001202023700001902035773008002054852000902134930003302143945002502176946001302201655001202214IND4373379820221121225327.0050817e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437337982DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Commercially mature fruit were harvested two different times after the compounds were applied, degreened when necessary, washed, waxed (without fungicide), and then stored at 50 degrees (10.0 degrees C) with 90% relative humidity. Compared to control (unsprayed) fruit, preharvest application of benomyl or thiophanate-methyl resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) less decay of citrus fruit after storage in nine out of ten experiments, often reducing decay by about half. In one experiment, pyraclostrobin and phosphorous acid also significantly decreased total decay by 29% and 36%, respectively, after storage compared to the control. Only benomyl and thiophanate-methyl significantly reduced stem-end rot (SER; primarily Diplodia natalensis or Phomopsis citri) after storage, with an average of 65% less decay compared to the control. Though benomyl significantly reduced anthracnose (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) in two of four tests with substantial (>20%) infection and phosphorous acid significantly reduced it once, thiophanate-methyl did not significantly reduce the incidence of anthracnose postharvest. The data suggests that preharvest application of thiophanate-methyl may reduce postharvest SER and total decay similar to preharvest benomyl treatments. 3apostharvest diseases 3adeterioration 3astem rot 3apreharvest treatment 3abenomyl 3athiophanate-methyl 3aCitrus 3aFlorida 0afungicides1 aPelosi, R.R.1 aBurton, M.S.1 aStover, E.W.1 aDou, H.1 aMcCollum, T.G.0 tHortTechnology.g2004 , v. 14, no. 1 p.58-62wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdDGXe2005/12/21  aOther US 7aarticle02184naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100002100137245011800158300001800276500002400294520085900318650001701177650000901194650002101203650002301224650002401247650002001271650002001291650001401311650002101325650001401346650002801360650001401388700002001402700002001422700001901442773009201461852000901553856009301562930003301655945002501688946001301713655001201726IND4396035020221121225217.0071012e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439603502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF200 0aF6001 aSantos, A.M. dos10aEffects of Seasonal Nitrate Flush on Nitrogen Metabolism and Soluble Fractions Accumulation in Two Rice Varieties  ap. 1371-1384.  aIncludes references  aTwo rice varieties, 'Piaui' (a landrace) and 'IAC-47' (an improved variety), were grown in nutrient solution containing 20 mg nitrate (NO3(-))-nitrogen (N) L(-1) up to 32 days after germination (DAG).

  1 aHanson, E.10aRaspberry variety performance in Southern Michigan  ap. 716-721.  aSeven primocane-fruiting and 15 floricane-fruiting raspberry varieties (Rubus idaeus) were compared for three fruiting seasons on a loamy sand soil in southwest Michigan. The earliest primocane-fruiting varieties ('Autumn Bliss', 'Autumn Britten', 'Polana') began ripening 3 weeks before the standard variety, 'Heritage'. 'Autumn Bliss' was the most productive early primocane-fruiting variety. 'Caroline' and 'Dinkum' ripened about 1 week earlier than 'Heritage', and 'Ruby' was 2 days later. 'Caroline' was the most productive of this group and also had large fruit that were somewhat resistant to rot caused by Botrytis cinerea. 'Caroline' also received the greatest leaf feeding from rosechafer beetles (Macrodactylus subspinosus). Most primocane-fruiting varieties were fairly resistant to leaf spot (Sphaerulina rubi), while 'Dinkum' was highly susceptible to spur blight (Didymella applanata). Floricane-fruiting varieties were evaluated based on fruit production and quality as well as winter injury to canes, disease resistance, and feeding injury from two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae). The floricane-fruiting varieties showing minimal winter injury were 'Boyne', 'Killarney', 'Latham', 'Nova', and 'Prelude'. 'Canby', 'Encore', 'Glen Ample,', 'Qualicum', 'Reveille', 'Titan', and 'K 81-6' were moderately hardy; while 'Tulameen', 'Malahat', and 'Lauren' were not hardy enough for this location. 'Reveille', 'Killarney', 'Boyne', and 'Prelude' were the most productive floricane-fruiting varieties. 'Nova' and 'Qualicum' had low levels of botrytis rot. 'Nova' was most resistant to leaf spot and also had resistance to spur blight. Injury from mites was greatest on 'Glen Ample' and lowest on 'Malahat', 'Prelude', 'Qualicum', and 'Tulameen'.

The changes in growth, Zn, iron (Fe), copper (Cu) and manganese (Mn) concentrations as well as photosynthetic performance were used as additional evaluation criteria. Photosynthetic pigments concentrations in Zn-exposed cuttings of genotype II decreased as compared with genotype I, which corresponded well with the higher leaf Zn accumulation, decreased Fe concentrations as well as lowered photosynthetic rate.

Evoked compound muscle action potentials were recorded in this ipsilateral intrinsic laryngeal muscles, using a percutaneous needle electrode. Latencies, amplitudes, and durations were measured. Latencies were correlated with neck length (r = 0.88 on left and 0.82 on right). Five of the dogs were euthanatized, and the nerve length between the 2 stimulating needle electrodes was measured; calculated conduction velocities (mean +/- SD) were 55 +/- 6 m/s (left) and 57 +/- 6 m/s (right). In 38 additional canine cadavers, the lengths of the exposed left and right recurrent laryngeal nerves were correlated with neck length (r = 0.44 on left and 0.56 on right). A linear regression model is proposed for predicting normal latencies, despite variations in neck length among different breeds of dogs. 3adogs 3alarynx 3aneurons 3aelectromyography 3avelocity 3alinear models 2aAction Potentials 2aAnimals 2aDogsxphysiology 2aElectric Stimulation 2aElectromyographyxveterinary 2aFemale 2aLaryngeal Musclesxphysiology 2aLaryngeal Nervesxphysiology 2aMale 2aNeural Conduction 2aRecurrent Laryngeal Nervexphysiology 0aphysiological functions 0aconductivity1 aMarshall, A.E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1988 Sept., v. 49, no. 9 p.1533-1536x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880128c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01508naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245010000134300001400234520065900248650001600907650001300923650002200936653001600958653001100974653001400985700001900999773012501018852000901143939003301152945000801185946001301193655001201206991616503880742620221121101233.0851216e198310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859263432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, R.R.10aAgricultural land value changes from electric transmission lines: implications for compensation  ap. 33-36.  aExtract: This study focuses on potential, as well as current, land uses. Furthermore, it focuses on consumption characteristics (e.g. aesthetic values), as well as land productivity changes. Little emphasis has been given to potential uses and consumptive characteristics impacts in the past. The market value of property is the cumulation of the productive and consumptive components of demand for property. Hence market value information is used in this study to measure the total impact of high voltage electric transmission lines on agricultural land values. This kind of information can provide important input into landowner compensation decisions. 3aelectricity 3aland use 3aagricultural land 0autilization 0aimpact 0avaluation1 aPhillips, W.E.0 tJournal of the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers.g1983 Oct., v. 47, no. 2 p.33-36x0003-116X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19851216c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle03000naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010300165300001600268520181600284650001202100650001902112650002702131650001602158650001902174650002202193653002602215653002302241653003602264653002302300653003602323653002302359773010602382852000902488856008502497930003302582946001102615655001202626IND4439494220221121070444.0100702e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443949422DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-009-9680-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhenhong 14aThe dynamics of ecosystem restoration: theoretical considerations on the basis of species richness  ap. 205-217.  aMuch recent research on ecosystem restoration has focused on specific cases, restoration mechanisms, and techniques in the field. However, there has been less emphasis on the theoretical aspects. Here, species richness is considered as an indicator of ecosystem restoration. The dynamic process of ecosystem restoration is put into a coordinate system consisting of species richness s and time t. The factors affecting ecosystem restoration are introduced into the system to develop dynamic models describing the ecosystem restoration process. We propose that the forces controlling the restoration process include ecosystem restoration force (F ₁), disturbance force (F ₂), environmental resistance force (F ₃), resistance force to disturbance (F ₄), and the resultant force F, and develop models for their calculation. These forces are functions of time, climate, species immigration rate, disturbance, species richness, and soil nutrient heterogeneity. Disturbance force (F ₂) and resistance force to disturbance (F ₄) are positively related to species richness. Our models suggest that the velocity differential ψ of the change in species richness is inversely proportional to species richness and directly proportional to the resultant force F of ecosystem restoration. In the presence of a harmful disturbance, species richness is always lower than maximum species richness s m. The lower the primary richness s ₀ and immigration rate r in ecosystem restoration, the more obvious the logistic characteristics of the curve of the dynamic process. The dynamic models can be used to predict the restoration of species richness and analyze its dynamic mechanism, and assess the potential for ecosystem restoration. This integrated approach provides a new understanding of ecosystem restoration. 3aclimate 3adynamic models 3aecological restoration 3aimmigration 3asoil nutrients 3aspecies diversity 0aEcosystem restoration 0aRestoration forces 0aEnvironmental resistance forces 0aDisturbance forces 0aEcosystem restoration potential 0aEcosystem function0 tPlant ecology.g2010 Aug., v. 209, no. 2 p.205-217dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-009-9680-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100702b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01592naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002400115245003900139300001400178520086600192650001301058653001201071653002201083653002301105700001901128700002301147773006901170852000901239930003301248945000801281946001301289655001201302991616503280742620221121070435.0850812e198312  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850076822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevandoski, Lucy A.10aHow to weather the sick-day season  ap. 30-33.  aHaving a sick-day plan is essential for diabetics. Without one, even minor illnesses can confuse diabetes control. General guidelines are given for handling diabetes during common illnesses - colds, "stomach flu", and diarrhea, but only a physician should make changes in insulin and diet. A detailed sick day plan should be worked out in advance with the doctor. Generally a minor illness can be prevented from turning into a major problem. There are 5 general rules to follow: notify the doctor or get to the emergency room immediately, continue to take oral diabetes medications or insulin unless you are told otherwise, drink plenty of fluids and try to eat normally, monitor your blood or urine for glucose and urine for ketones at least every 4 hours, and check blood and urine test results, along with temperature, medications and notable symptoms.

Market demand has progressively called for larger bulb size and bulbs with single centers. At harvest onions were evaluated for maturity, number of bolters, and single centeredness. Cultivars showed a wide range of bulbs with only one growing point or "bullet" single centers, ranging from 1% to 57% in 2000, from 7% to 70% in 2001, and from 1% to 74% in 2002. The percentages of bulbs functionally single-centered for processing uses ranged from 18% to 88% in 2000, from 24.7% to 91.3% in 2001, and from 14.4% to 92% in 2002. Bulb yield and market grade were evaluated out of storage. Marketable yield after 4 months of storage varied significantly by cultivar from 643 to 1196 cwt/acre (72.1 to 134.1 Mg.ha(-1)) in 2000, from 538 to 980 cwt/acre (60.3 to 109.8 Mg.ha(-1)) in 2001, and from 583 to 1119 cwt/acre (65.3 to 125.4 Mg.ha(-1)) in 2002. Averaging over cultivars, super colossal bulb size averaged 26%, 14%, and 10% in 2000, 2001, and 2002, respectively. 3aAllium cepa 3aonions 3acultivars 3avariety trials 3abulbs 3acrop yield 3aweight 3abolting 3afood grades 3astorage time 3afood storage 3aOregon 0asingle-centered onions 0asuper colossal bulbs1 aFeibert, E.1 aSaunders, L.D.0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 2 p.399-408wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/21  aOther US 7aarticle02602naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001500168245014200183300001800325500002400343500001500367520107000382650001201452650003001464650001801494650001101512650002301523650001001546650002001556650003101576650001801607650001001625650001801635650002201653650001801675650001201693650002001705650001801725653001801743653001801761700001301779700001401792773009801806852000901904856009001913930003302003945002502036946001102061655001202072IND4396044920221121060000.0071015s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439604492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.02.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aT2001 aChau, C.F.10aPhysicochemical changes upon micronization process positively improve the intestinal health-enhancement ability of carrot insoluble fibre  ap. 1569-1574.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe influences of the particle size reduction and physicochemical changes by micron technology on the intestinal health-improvement ability of a promising carrot insoluble fibre was investigated. The feeding of the micronized fibres (10.3-20.9 μm), especially that prepared by the high-pressure micronization, could significantly (p < 0.05) improve some caecal and faecal parameters in the intestinal lumen by decreasing caecal ammonia concentration (-25.5%), increasing faecal output (137%) and moisture content (142%), and also reducing the activities of undesired β-d-glucosidase (-42.1%) and β-d-glucuronidase (-68.9%) in faeces. The relationships between the physicochemical properties and physiological functions of the micronized fibres have been discussed. The results also demonstrated that both the particle size and way of treatment were important factors affecting the physicochemical properties and physiological functions of fibres, and the consumption of micronized fibre at 5% level might exert a favourable effect on improving intestinal health. 3aammonia 3aintestinal microorganisms 3adietary fiber 3apomace 3aexperimental diets 3acecum 3ainsoluble fiber 3aphysicochemical properties 3aparticle size 3afeces 3awater content 3aintestinal mucosa 3aanimal models 3acarrots 3aenzyme activity 3adisaccharides 0amicronization 0afiber content1 aWu, S.C.1 aLee, M.H.0 tFood chemistry.g2007, v. 104, no. 4 p.1569-1574dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.02.0353Available from publisher's Web site  a20080111b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/12  aNon-US 7aarticle01674naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245005200138300001200190520082900202650001701031650002301048650001201071650001401083650001001097650002201107650001701129650000901146653001901155773008601174852001301260939003301273945000801306946001301314852000901327655001201336991616501030742620221121045745.0850827e198405  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850076522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Susan Male.10aOsteoporosis: New findings about an old disease  ap. 1-4.  aRisk factors and therapeutic and preventive measures concerning osteoporosis are cited and discussed. The 6 highest risk factors included being a female caucasian of northern European descent, early menopause, small weight-for-height, a sedentary lifestyle, and calcium deficiency. Thin, small-boned women are more susceptible due to lesser bone mass. Estrogen deficiency is the most well-documented cause of accelerated bone loss, and estrogen replacement therapy is the single most effective means of preventing osteoporosis. Calcium supplements have become routine for treating women having osteoporosis, but such treatment is rarely used alone and is not widely used for prevention. Other therapies (e.g., sodium fluoride and other alternatives) and exercise which promotes new bone formation are briefly discussed.

Tafalla. Materials and methods The experiment was a mesocosm assay, conducted as a randomized factorial design with three factors. The first factor had three levels: control soil, soil inoculated with Glomus intraradices (Schenk and Smith), and soil inoculated with Pseudomonas mendocina Palleroni; the second one had two regimes of watering: adequate and inadequate water supply and the third factor had two concentrations of CO₂: ambient CO₂ and elevated CO₂. Six replicates per treatment were set up, making a total of 72 pots. Community structure was studied by PCR-DGGE (polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis), and functional properties of the microbiota were investigated by community-level physiological profiling (CLPP) with Microresp™. Results and discussion DGGE banding patterns showed that water stress affected bacterial and fungal communities, while microbial inoculation had little effect. Under well-watered and normal CO₂ conditions, the fungal diversity increased clearly by PGPR and especially by AM inoculation. Elevated CO₂ concentration changed microbial communities, but did not increase the microbial diversity (Shannon diversity index (H′) based on PCR-DGGE data). A principal component analysis showed a significant effect of drought stress on CLPP. The inoculation with PGPR, especially, increased the functional diversity for different guilds of carbon source. In contrast, elevated CO₂ concentration had no influence on functional diversity. Conclusions Our results revealed that elevated CO₂ decreased the negative effects of drought on soil structural microbial diversity as well as plant growth but without changes in functional microbial diversity. In addition, the synergistic effect of the PGPR on growth of lettuce plants might not only result from a direct PGP effect but also from an indirect shift of the fungal community in response to elevated CO₂ under water stress conditions. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3asoil inoculation 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater supply 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aLactuca sativa 3adrought 3acarbon 3afunctional diversity 3acarbon dioxide 3arhizosphere 3awater stress 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3asynergism 3aplant growth 3aPseudomonas mendocina 3acommunity structure 3afungal communities 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil 3alettuce 3aadverse effects 3afunctional properties 3agrowth chambers 3afungi 0aDGGE 0aMicroresp 0aElevated CO₂ 0aCLPP 0aGlomus intraradices 0aMicrobial community1 aKnapp, Brigitte A. 1 aWaldhuber, Sebastian 1 aCaravaca, Fuensanta 1 aRoldán, Antonio.1 aInsam, Heribert 0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2010 Dec., v. 10, no. 8 p.1585-1597dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-010-0259-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20101126b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02036naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245011700177300001600294520087000310650004301180650001301223650001201236650002101248650002601269650001701295650001701312650001301329650001401342650002001356650001501376650002701391650001101418650002301429773008201452852000901534930003301543945002501576946001301601655001201614IND4369705820221121035638.0050508e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436970582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Cleaning and disinfecting used perlite for recycling saved 56% of the cost to replace the media and reduced salt content to the optimum level recommended for raising container grown plants. Disinfecting used perlite with hot water raised media temperatures above limits necessary to kill several fungi and nematodes. Tomatoes planted in recycled perlite produced greater marketable yield and heavier fruit than those planted in new perlite. Season and year of planting also have significant effects on yield. Used perlite can be cleaned and disinfected as needed and recycled for many years because it is not organic in nature and physically and chemically stable. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3atomatoes 3aperlite 3asoilless culture 3agreenhouse production 3adisinfection 3adesalination 3acleaning 3arecycling 3aeconomic impact 3acrop yield 3acontainer-grown plants 3aweight 3aseasonal variation0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 2 p.342-345wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/21  aOther US 7aarticle02631naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001700127245009800144300001600242520167600258650001101934650002001945650003401965650001601999650001702015650001802032653001702050700001702067700001602084700001902100773008202119852000902201930003302210945002502243946001302268655001202281IND4372619920221121013307.0050721e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437261992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDeLong, J.M.12aA new technology that determines low-oxygen thresholds in controlled-atmosphere-stored apples  ap. 262-266.  aHarvestWatch is a new chlorophyll fluorescence (F)-based technology that identifies the low-oxygen threshold for apple (Malus x domestica) fruit in dynamic low-O2 controlled atmosphere (DLOCA) storage environments e.g., <1% oxygen (O2). Immediately following harvest, 'Cortland', 'Delicious', 'Golden Delicious', 'Honeycrisp', 'Jonagold' and 'McIntosh' fruit were cooled and loaded into 0.34 m3 (12.0 ft3) storage cabinets. A static controlled atmosphere (CA) regime of 1.5% O2, 1.5% carbon dioxide (CO2) and 3 degrees C (37.4 degrees) 0 degrees C (32.0 degrees) for 'Delicious' and 'Golden Delicious' was established for the control fruit, while the low-O2 threshold was identified by a spike in the fluorescence parameter, Falpha, as the O2 levels in the DLOCA cabinets were lowered below 1%. The DLOCA storages were then maintained at O2 levels of 0.1% to 0.2% above the threshold value for each cultivar, which returned Falpha to prethreshold signatures. Quality measurements following 5 to 9 months of storage and a 7-day shelf life of 20 degrees C (68.0 degrees), showed that the HarvestWatch fruit were generally firmer, had no incidence of superficial scald in 'Cortland' and 'Delicious' apples, and did not accumulate fermentative volatile compounds. The HarvestWatch system permits rapid, real-time measurements of the status of stored apple fruit in ultra low-O2 environments without the inconvenience of breaking the room's atmosphere. Our results indicate that HarvestWatch facilitates what may be the highest possible level of fruit quality retention in long-term, low-O2 apple storage without the use of scald-controlling or other chemicals before storage. 3aapples 3aMalus domestica 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3afruit quality 0aHarvestWatch1 aPrange, R.K.1 aLeyte, J.C.1 aHarrison, P.A.0 tHortTechnology.g2004 , v. 14, no. 2 p.262-266wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdDGXe2006/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle03179naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245012200161300001600283500001500299520206900314650001102383650002502394650002802419650001202447650002002459650002002479650001602499651001202515653001202527653001902539700001502558700001702573700001702590773008202607852000902689930003302698945002502731946001302756655001202769IND4372618620221120213332.0050721e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437261862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDavies, F.S.10aEcoLyst appplication timing and juice corrected soluble solids (Brix) of processing oranges and grapefruit in Florida  ap. 207-212.  a2019-12-05  aEcoLyst, a formulation of N-N-diethyl-2-(4-methylbenzyloxy) ethylamine hydrochloride containing 1 g/fl oz 4.5 oz/gal (33.8 g.L(-1)) a.i., is a plant growth regulator that has been reported to increase soluble solids concentration (SSC) in juice oranges by 0.6% to 1.2%. Our objectives were to determine the effectiveness of EcoLyst application for increasing SSC in Florida oranges (Citrus sinensis) and grapefruit (C. paradisi), and to identify the optimum rate and time of application. Experiments were conducted for three seasons using 'Hamlin,' 'Pineapple,' and 'Valencia' sweet oranges; and for two seasons using 'Flame,' 'Marsh,' and 'Ray Ruby' grapefruit, all in commercial groves. EcoLyst was applied at 6 and 12 fl oz/acre (0.44 and 0.88 L.ha(-1)) for oranges and 16 and 32 ppm (mg.L(-1)) effectively 9 and 18 fl oz/acre (0.66 and 1.32 L.ha(-1)) in most sprays for grapefruit, and included Silwet L-77 adjuvant at 0.05%. Applications were made at several stages of development from prebloom to initial fruit set. In all cases, SSC was determined as juice corrected SSC, by adjusting refractometer readings based on titratable acidity. In 13 trials with sweet orange only five displayed significant increases in SSC (P less than or equal to 0.05) resulting from EcoLyst application. Two additional trials produced SSC increases significant at P < 0.10. Even where significant increases in SSC occurred they were typically observed in only one harvest and at one time of application and were always relatively low in magnitude (highest increase over controls was 0.38%). No rate or timing of EcoLyst application was consistently associated with best response, although eight of nine SSC increases observed in orange occurred with applications ranging from prebloom to 25% open flowers. Only one significant increase in SSC was observed in five trials with grapefruit. In these studies, increases in SSC resulting from EcoLyst application were neither sufficiently consistent nor large enough to justify a recommendation for commercial use in Florida citrus. 3ajuices 3atotal soluble solids 3aplant growth substances 3aoranges 3aCitrus sinensis 3aCitrus paradisi 3agrapefruits 3aFlorida 0aEcoLyst 0asoluble solids1 aStover, E.1 aZalman, G.R.1 aCiliento, S.0 tHortTechnology.g2004 , v. 14, no. 2 p.207-212wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdDGXe2006/01/12  aOther US 7aarticle02529naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245007900179300001600258500001500274520128500289650001301574650004301587650001401630650001801644650001801662650002001680650001801700650002001718650001501738650001501753650001701768650002601785653002301811653002001834653001501854700001201869700001601881773008201897852000901979930003301988945002502021946001302046655001202059IND4373296720221120213313.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437329672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGlancey, J.L.10aTechnical advances and strategies for future developments in mechanization  ap. 486-488.  a2019-12-05  aThe vegetable industry is important to our nation as a provider of nutritious and safe food directly consumed by our citizens. It is also critical to a rich and vigorous national agriculture. During the 20th century, engineering innovations coupled with advances in genetics, crop science, and plant protection have allowed the vegetable industry in the U.S. to plant and harvest significantly more land with higher yields while using less labor. Currently, fresh and processed vegetables generate 16% of all U.S. crop income, but from only 2% of the harvested cropland. Yet, many of the challenges in production that existed a century ago still exist for many crops. Perhaps the most significant challenge confronting the industry is labor, often accounting for 50% of all production costs. A case study of the mechanized production system developed for processed tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum) confirms that systematic methodology in which the machines, cultural practices, and cultivars are designed together must be adopted to improve the efficiency of current mechanized systems as well as provide profitable alternatives for crops currently hand-harvested. Only with this approach will horticultural crop production remain competitive and economically viable in the U.S. 3atomatoes 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3acultivars 3aprofitability 3amechanization 3avegetable crops 3afood industry 3acrop management 3acrop yield 3afarm labor 3acase studies 3amechanical harvesting 0aliterature reviews 0alabor economics 0avegetables1 aKee, E.1 aWootten, T.0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 3 p.486-488wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle02436naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245010100160300001600261520144100277650002201718650001301740650001701753650002401770650001801794650002801812653001801840700001801858700001901876700001701895773008201912852000901994930003302003945002502036946001302061655001202074IND4372619220221120201747.0050721e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437261922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJones, M.L.10aEffects of preservatives and cold storage on postharvest performance of deciduous holly branches  ap. 230-234.  aDeciduous holly branches were visually rated over a period of 5 weeks to evaluate differences in display life between various cultivars of winterberry (Ilex verticillata) and japanese winterberry (I. serrata) x winterberry. Holly branches were naturally defoliated and the postharvest performance of the cut branches was therefore based on the quality and longevity of the fruit. Chemical treatments including floral preservative, floral preservative plus silver, and anti-transpirant were also evaluated. 'Bonfire' and 'Sunset' had the highest ratings for marketability based on the longevity and quality of their fruit. 'Bonfire' and 'Winter Red' had the highest fruit density per stem. Treatment with floral preservatives significantly increased the display life of holly branches. Preservative plus silver delayed deterioration later in the study, presumably by delaying the senescence of the fruit. Anti-transpirant treatment did not decrease solution uptake by the holly stems. Cold storage of dry branches at 0.00 +/- 1.11 degrees C (32.0 +/- 2.0 degrees) did not significantly reduce branch display life if held for 23 days or less. Cut branches of all cultivars had a longer display life when stuck in sand and left outdoors in a lath house than when rated in vase solutions indoors. This study indicates that deciduous holly branches provide an attractive alternative cut branch for both interior and outdoor holiday displays. 3aIlex verticillata 3abranches 3acold storage 3apostharvest systems 3apreservatives 3aornamental woody plants 0aholly berries1 aCochran, K.K.1 aAnderson, G.A.1 aFerree, D.C.0 tHortTechnology.g2004 , v. 14, no. 2 p.230-234wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdDGXe2006/01/13  aOther US 7aarticle01859naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245005800177300001600235500012300251520072100374650001001095650001701105650001601122650001401138650001901152650001501171650001801186650002801204650001901232650002501251653002301276773008201299852000901381930003301390945002501423946001301448655001201461IND4373297120221120201828.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437329712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Mainly a pick-your-own and local sales item of the early 1990s and before, the increased presence of blackberries in retail grocery stores in the last 10 years has broadened the market for this small fruit. Cultivars that can be shipped and have extended shelf life have been the cornerstone of this expansion. Also, off-season production in Mexico has provided fruit for retail marketing during most months of the year. Further advances in production, marketing, and consumption can be achieved with the continuation of improved cultivar development and expansion of production technology. 3aRubus 3ablackberries 3afruit crops 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3ashelf life 3afruit quality 3afood processing quality 3afood marketing 3aconsumer preferences 0aliterature reviews0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 3 p.491-500wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle03392naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245006200159300001600221500001500237520218000252650001702432650002402449650001802473650002102491650001902512650001502531650001502546650001002561650002002571650002602591650003102617650002102648650002702669653001702696653002302713700001802736700001802754773008202772852000902854930003302863945002502896946001302921655001202934IND4373298320221120191717.0050815e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437329832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCase, L.T.12aA review of weed control practices in container nurseries  ap. 535-545.  a2019-12-05  aContainer production has increased rapidly in many parts of the U.S. over the past 15 years. Container production has been the fastest growing sector in the nursery industry and the growth is expected to continue. Weed growth in container-grown nursery stock is a particularly serious problem, because the nutrients, air, and water available are limited to the volume of the container. The extent of damage caused by weeds is often underestimated and effective control is essential. Various researchers have found that as little as one weed in a small (1 gal) pot affects the growth of a crop. However, even if weeds did not reduce growth, a container plant with weeds is a less marketable product than a weed-free product. Managing weeds in a container nursery involves eliminating weeds and preventing their spread in the nursery, and this usually requires chemical controls. However, chemical controls should never be the only management tools implemented. Maximizing cultural and mechanical controls through proper sanitation and hand weeding are two important means to prevent the spread and regeneration of troublesome weeds. Cultural controls include mulching, irrigation methods (subirrigation), and mix type. Nursery growers estimate that they spend $500 to $4000/acre of containers for manual removal of weeds, depending on weed species being removed. Economic losses due to weed infestations have been estimated at approximately $7000/acre. Reduction of this expense with improved weed control methodologies and understanding weed control would have a significant impact on the industry. Problems associated with herbicide use in container production include proper calibration, herbicide runoff concerns from plastic or gravel (especially when chemicals fall between containers) and the need for multiple applications. As with other crops, off-site movement of pesticides through herbicide leaching, runoff, spray drift, and non-uniformity of application are concerns facing nursery growers. This article reviews some current weed control methods, problems associated with these methods, and possible strategies that could be useful for container nursery growers. 3aplant growth 3amanual weed control 3aprofitability 3acultural control 3aeconomic costs 3aherbicides 3acrop yield 3aweeds 3aplant nurseries 3acrop-weed competition 3aintegrated weed management 3achemical control 3acontainer-grown plants 0aweed control 0aliterature reviews1 aMathers, H.M.1 aSenesac, A.F.0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 3 p.535-545wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle03037naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100002000196245008400216300001800300500002400318500001500342520131300357650002001670650001701690650002501707650002501732650001201757650001501769650001301784650001001797650001501807650008201822650001201904650004401916650005401960650003502014650002302049650007002072653002302142653001502165653001102180700001402191773011002205852000902315856009002324930003302414945002502447946001102472655001202483IND4396074220221120191721.0071016e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439607422DNAL7 a164272772pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2005.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF600 0aX3001 aAhluwalia, S.S.10aMicrobial and plant derived biomass for removal of heavy metals from wastewater  ap. 2243-2257.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDischarge of heavy metals from metal processing industries is known to have adverse effects on the environment. Conventional treatment technologies for removal of heavy metals from aqueous solution are not economical and generate huge quantity of toxic chemical sludge. Biosorption of heavy metals by metabolically inactive non-living biomass of microbial or plant origin is an innovative and alternative technology for removal of these pollutants from aqueous solution. Due to unique chemical composition biomass sequesters metal ions by forming metal complexes from solution and obviates the necessity to maintain special growth-supporting conditions. Biomass of Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus nigricans, Ascophyllum nodosum, Sargassum natans, Chlorella fusca, Oscillatoria anguistissima, Bacillus firmus and Streptomyces sp. have highest metal adsorption capacities ranging from 5 to 641 mg g-1 mainly for Pb, Zn, Cd, Cr, Cu and Ni. Biomass generated as a by-product of fermentative processes offers great potential for adopting an economical metal-recovery system. The purpose of this paper is to review the available information on various attributes of utilization of microbial and plant derived biomass and explores the possibility of exploiting them for heavy metal remediation. 3awater pollution 3aheavy metals 3awastewater treatment 3aindustrial effluents 3abiomass 3awastewater 3abacteria 3afungi 2aAdsorption 2aBacteriaxclassificationxdrug effectsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBiomass 2aMetals, Heavyxisolation & purification 2aPlantsxclassificationxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 0aliterature reviews 0apollutants 0aplants1 aGoyal, D.0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Sept., v. 98, no. 12 p.2243-2257dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2005.12.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080118b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01654naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001900127245009500146300001600241520073900257650002600996650001201022650001801034650001701052650002201069650001501091651001301106700001801119700001701137773008201154852000901236930003301245945002501278946001301303655001201316IND4373381420221120170807.0050817e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437338142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We hypothesized that community structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and bark of trees are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the bark of trees since species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the bark of trees whereas parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that frequently occurred on tree bark did not feed on lichens according to their stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the bark of trees. Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor parthenogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aparthenogenesis 3acommunity structure 3alichens 3amites 3ahabitats 3atrees 3aSarcoptiformes 3agrassland soils 3asexual reproduction 3aforest soils 3astable isotopes 3aacarology 3aecosystems 3amosses and liverworts 3abark 3agrasslands 3aforests 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aEcosystem 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFood Chain 2aMale 2aMitesxphysiology 2aNitrogen Isotopes 2aPlant Bark 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aReproduction 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSoil 2aSpecies Specificity 3aAustria 3aAlps region 0aAustria 0aReproductive mode 0aTree bark 0aCentral Alps 0aOribatida1 aSchatz, Heinrich 1 aMaraun, Mark 0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2010 Nov., v. 52, no. 3 p.221-237dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0168-81627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-010-9366-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01814naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002700148245010000175300001400275520067600289650001300965650002600978650003601004650001701040650003901057650001801096650001501114650001801129700001801147700001701165700002101182773010801203852000901311856008801320939003301408946001101441655001201452IND4450578420221120170756.0110311e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445057842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.femsle.2005.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarra Caracciolo, Anna10aIn situ analysis of native microbial communities in complex samples with high particulate loads  ap. 55-58.  aIn the present study a procedure combining a cell extraction method and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for molecular monitoring and quantification of bacteria in soil and aquifer samples is presented.

Terms typically have included price, quantity, and quality, but others may be added when growers sell to large customers. Because the industry is very competitive, growers are hesitant to turn down a sale simply because they are asked to pay another cost or provide another service. For this study, a list of items that might be in the terms of sale was developed. Growers were surveyed to determine which of these items were included in the agreement in 1996 and 2001. McNemar's test was used to determine whether proportions of items being added to the agreement were significantly different from items being removed when considering the mass merchandiser and the garden center market channels. Five of the items had significantly more additions to the terms of sale for mass merchandisers, contrasted to four for the garden center channel. Two of these items, apply barcode stickers and continuous inventory replenishment, were significant for both channels. The other significant items for the mass merchandiser channel were provide custom containers, provide returnable shipping equipment, and take back unsold merchandise. These are items can that enhance competitive position and provide cost savings. For garden centers, the other two items with significantly different proportions were attach product information tags, which is a service demanded by consumers, and provide minimum volume, which can reduce the number of suppliers needed in this channel. 3abarcoding 3ainventories 3aprices 3acosts and returns 3asales 3aplant nurseries 0amarketing1 aNavajas, R.0 tHortTechnology.g2004 , v. 14, no. 1 p.119-124wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdDGXe2005/12/21  aOther US 7aarticle01990naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001900157245006900176300001800245500002400263520076700287650001701054650001701071650001601088650001901104650003101123650002801154651001801182651002401200651001401224651001801238653002301256700001701279700001801296773008801314852000901402856008801411930003301499945002501532946001101557655001201568IND4396076620221120161854.0071016e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439607662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2006.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aCannon, R.J.C.12aA review of the pest status and control options for Thrips palmi  ap. 1089-1098.  aIncludes references  aThrips palmi Karny, the melon thrips, has spread widely and rapidly in tropical and subtropical regions, but despite a number of outbreaks (all successfully eradicated) and regular interceptions, it remains absent from Europe.

The aim of this study was to compare the blood lactate concentrations during exercise of varying duration and intensity in horses. We used 145 horses of mixed gender, age, and breed. All the subjects were clinically healthy. They were divided into six groups based on the activities they were required to perform: jumpers, gallopers, trotters, trekking, treadmill, and swimming horses. A two-way ANOVA of blood lactate concentrations showed a statistically significant difference between gallopers and jumpers at rest. Immediately after exercise, trotters differed significantly from gallopers, trekking and jumpers, whereas 30 min after exercise, trotters differed only from gallopers and trekking horses. No significance was found for other groups. ANOVA showed a significant effect of time for jumpers and gallopers. Overall, trotters exhibited the lowest accumulation of lactate after exercise. We hypothesize that the lower velocity of trotting and the relative fast consumption of lactate in a fit horse are responsible for the difference between trotters and the other groups. The results obtained allow a scientific evaluation of the athletic potential of an individual horse and constitute an easy way to predict the horse's long-term performance. 3aexercise 0aSport horses 0aLactate 0aGallop 0aTrot 0aShow jump1 aMessina, Vanessa 1 aCasella, Stefania 1 aGiannetto, Claudia 1 aCaola, Giovanni 0 tComparative clinical pathology.g2010 Dec., v. 19, no. 6 p.535-539dLondon : Springer-Verlagx1618-56417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00580-010-0965-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02244naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245010900168300001600277520116000293650002801453650001601481650001101497650002901508650001601537650001201553650002101565650001301586650002201599700002201621773011001643852000901753856008801762939003301850946001101883655001201894IND4450577720221120161958.0110311e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445057772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.femsle.2005.09.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurosawa, Norio10aHomologous recombination of exogenous DNA with the Sulfolobus acidocaldarius genome: Properties and uses  ap. 141-149.  aIn order to quantify recombination between exogenous DNA and the Sulfolobus acidocaldarius chromosome, we electroporated pyrE (uracil-auxtotrophic) recipient strains with functional pyrE sequences and counted Pyr⁺ transformants by direct plating. Certain culture and post-electroporation conditions increased the yield of Pyr⁺ recombinants from non-replicating pyrE plasmid, whereas cognate methylation of Sua I restriction sites in the plasmid decreased it. Recombination of linear DNAs with the S. acidocaldarius genome was proportional to the length of a limiting overlap, but even synthetic oligonucleotides produced reasonable numbers of recombinants with appropriate recipient strains. To investigate uses of this latter property, we electroporated an 18-bp pyrE deletion mutant with mixtures of synthetic oligonucleotides altering glycine-55 of the orotate phosphoribosyl transferase encoded by pyrE. Pyr⁺ transformants were recovered in which this codon was converted to each of the alternatives encoded by the oligonucleotide mixtures, thereby identifying five amino acid substitutions tolerated at this position of the thermostable enzyme. 3aamino acid substitution 3achromosomes 3agenome 3ahomologous recombination 3amethylation 3amutants 3aoligonucleotides 3aplasmids 3athermal stability1 aGrogan, Dennis W.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2005 Dec., v. 253, no. 1 p.141-149dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.femsle.2005.09.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01741naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245007900165300001400244520082500258650002301083650002001106650001001126650001401136650002701150650001301177773010801190852000901298856008801307939003301395946001101428655001201439IND4450578020221120145344.0110311e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445057802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.femsle.2005.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRep, Martijn10aSmall proteins of plant-pathogenic fungi secreted during host colonization  ap. 19-27.  aSmall proteins secreted by plant pathogenic fungi in their hosts have been implicated in disease symptom development as well as in R-gene mediated disease resistance. Characteristically, this class of proteins shows very limited phylogenetic distribution, possibly due to accelerated evolution stimulated by plant-pathogen arms races. Partly due to lack of clues from primary sequences, insight into the biochemical functions or molecular targets of these proteins has been slow to emerge. However, for some proteins important progress has recently been made in this direction. Expression of the genes for small secreted proteins is in many cases specifically induced after infection, which should help to advance our still very limited understanding of how plant pathogens recognize and respond to the host environment. 3adisease resistance 3agene expression 3ahosts 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aproteins0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2005 Dec., v. 253, no. 1 p.19-27dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.femsle.2005.09.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02143naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245011300166300001600279520073700295650002501032650002601057650001201083650002301095650001001118650001201128650001301140650001501153650001301168650001401181650001101195653002501206653003501231653001901266700001801285700001901303700001901322700001901341700002301360700002001383773013201403852000901535856008501544930003301629946001101662655001201673IND4447530620221120145243.0110114e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444753062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-010-0465-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Won-Kyung 10a1,3-Propandiol production by engineered Hansenula polymorpha expressing dha genes from Klebsiella pneumoniae  ap. 231-236.  aCurrently, 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) is an important chemical widely used in polymer production, but its availability is being restricted owing to its expensive chemical synthesis.

In this work, the key role that process design plays during the development of cost-effective technologies is recognized through the analysis of major trends in process synthesis, modeling, simulation and optimization related to ethanol production. Main directions in techno-economical evaluation of fuel ethanol processes are described as well as some prospecting configurations. The most promising alternatives for compensating ethanol production costs by the generation of valuable co-products are analyzed. Opportunities for integration of fuel ethanol production processes and their implications are underlined. Main ways of process intensification through reaction-reaction, reaction-separation and separation-separation processes are analyzed in the case of bioethanol production. Some examples of energy integration during ethanol production are also highlighted. Finally, some concluding considerations on current and future research tendencies in fuel ethanol production regarding process design and integration are presented. 3alignocellulose 3asucrose 3astarch 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aethanol 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnology 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aComputer Simulation 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnergy-Generating Resources 2aEthanolxchemical synthesisxmetabolism. 2aFermentation 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aResearchxtrends 2aStarchxchemistry 2aSucrosexmetabolism 0arenewable energy sources 0aliterature reviews 0afeedstocks1 aSánchez, O.J.0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Sept., v. 98, no. 12 p.2415-2457dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2007.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080118b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/18  aNon-US 7aarticle01598naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245003800166300001400204520073600218650001900954650002300973650002400996650001701020650001701037700001601054700001901070700001101089773008001100852000901180930003301189945002501222946001301247655001201260IND4373380620221120131133.0050817e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437338062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Sodding could speed establishment in landscape plantings. This study looked at the effects of two sod thicknesses and different rates of nitrogen fertilization before and after sodding, on stand establishment and overall turf quality. Evaluations 2, 4 and 8 weeks after sodding assessed rooting and overall turf quality. Thicker sod showed better rooting 4 weeks after planting; after 8 weeks, rooting of both thicknesses was similar. Nitrogen fertilization before or after sodding did not affect rooting. More nitrogen led to better overall turf quality up to 4 weeks after planting; however, this quality difference disappeared 8 weeks after sodding. 3asod production 3aFestuca longifolia 3aground cover plants 3asoil erosion 3aturf grasses1 aHagan, W.L.1 aZak Mousli, M.1 aWu, L.0 tHortTechnology.g2004 , v. 14, no. 1 p.88-90wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20070730b20070802c00000000  aINDdDGXe2005/12/21  aOther US 7aarticle02870naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002800171245010300199300001800302520139800320650002001718650001501738650001001753650000901763650002201772650001601794650001101810650001701821650001101838650000901849650001601858650001501874650001501889650003201904650001701936650001701953650001601970651001101986653002301997653001302020653003202033700002202065700003302087700001902120773009902139852000902238856009202247946001302339655001202352IND4441456320221120131144.0100820e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444145632DNAL7 a204973912pmid7 a10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01424.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTekeli-Yeşil, Sıdıka10aFactors Motivating Individuals to Take Precautionary Action for an Expected Earthquake in Istanbul  ap. 1181-1195.  aIstanbul is expected to experience an earthquake in the near future, but individuals show limited interest in preparing for it. This study aims to identify the factors associated with taking action to prepare for an earthquake and mitigate its effects at the individual level. A field survey was carried out in 2007 in two districts of Istanbul with different levels of earthquake risk. Within these districts, three socioeconomic levels were considered. A total of 1,123 people were interviewed face to face. Analysis indicated that the educational level of the respondents was the leading factor associated with taking at least three measures, followed by living in a higher earthquake risk area, having participated in rescue and solidarity activities in previous earthquakes, a higher level of knowledge about earthquakes, home ownership, a higher score for action-stimulating attitudes, being younger, and a higher general safety score, in that order. The findings pointed to the role of knowledge about earthquakes and possible mitigation/preparedness measures, and thus the importance of developing effective awareness programs. Such programs should also consider the characteristics of different groups in the population. Motivated individuals, such as those who have participated in rescue and solidarity activities in previous earthquakes, could be involved in reaching other people. 3arisk perception 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDisaster Planning 2aEarthquakes 2aFemale 2aFocus Groups 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMotivation 2aPerception 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aSocial Class 2aYoung Adult 0aTurkey 0aEarthquake hazards 0aIstanbul 0amitigation and preparedness1 aDedeoğlu, Necati1 aBraun-Fahrlaender, Charlotte1 aTanner, Marcel0 tRisk analysis.g2010 Aug., v. 30, no. 8 p.1181-1195dBlackwell Publishing Incx0272-43327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01424.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02590naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245007200166300001400238520136300252650001101615650001401626650001201640650001501652650001401667650001901681650001101700650001401711650001101725650002401736650001201760650001101772651000901783653002001792653002401812700002301836700002301859700002001882773010401902852000902006856008502015930003302100946001102133655001202144IND4447524320221120121231.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444752432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11258-010-9801-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcEwan, Ryan W. 10aFlowering phenology change and climate warming in southwestern Ohio  ap. 55-61.  aGlobal surface temperature has increased markedly over the last 100 years. This increase has a variety of implications for human societies, and for ecological systems. One of the most obvious ways ecosystems are affected by global climate change is through alteration of organisms' developmental timing (phenology). We used annual botanical surveys that documented the first flowering for an array of species from 1976 to 2003 to examine the potential implications of climate change for plant development. The overall trend for these species was a progressively earlier flowering time. The two earliest flowering taxa (Galanthus and Crocus) also exhibited the strongest shift in first flowering. We detected a significant trend in climate suggesting higher temperatures in winter and spring over the sampling interval and found a significant relationship between warming temperatures and first flowering time for some species. Although 60% of the species in our study flowered earlier over the sampling interval, the remaining species exhibited no statistically detectable change. This variation in response is ostensibly associated with among-species variation in the role of climate cues in plant development. Future work is needed to isolate specific climate cues, and to link plant phenology to the physiological processes that trigger plant development. 3aCrocus 3aGalanthus 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aflowering 3aglobal warming 3ahumans 3aphenology 3aspring 3asurface temperature 3asurveys 3awinter 3aOhio 0aFirst flowering 0aMinimum temperature1 aBrecha, Robert J. 1 aGeiger, Donald R. 1 aJohn, Grace P. 0 tPlant ecology.g2011 Jan., v. 212, no. 1 p.55-61dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-010-9801-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02700naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001400144245011000158300001600268500001500284520143600299650002401735650002601759650002301785650002501808650001801833650001301851650001701864650002401881650001301905650002101918650001601939650001501955650002801970651001901998653002702017653002102044700001502065773008202080852000902162930003302171945002502204946001302229655001202242IND4369706420221120105630.0050508e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436970642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Defoliants included acetic acid, chelated copper, crop oil concentrate surfactant (COC), ethephon, dimethipin plus COC, pelargonic acid, and a tap water control. For chelated copper, a concentration of 800 mg.L(-1) (ppm) was most effective at promoting defoliation, providing 100% defoliation of american bittersweet and 76% defoliation of american beautyberry. For curly willow and american beautyberry, all concentrations of dimethipin produced good or excellent defoliation. Increasing concentrations of ethephon from 200 to 2500 mg.L(-1) increased defoliation from 0% to 67%. Pelargonic acid was not effective at promoting defoliation of woody plants at the concentrations used. In an experiment conducted during spring using containerized curly willow, irrigation was stopped for 0, 3, or 6 days before defoliants were applied, but none of the irrigation treatments promoted defoliation. In a postharvest study using cut curly willow, stems were held in distilled water at 5, 20, or 35 degrees C (41.0, 68.0, or 95.0 degrees) for 1, 3, 5, or 7 days. Holding cut stems of curly willow at 20 degrees C promoted 68% defoliation, compared to 53% or 28% for 5 or 35 degrees C, respectively. 3ahorticultural crops 3apostharvest treatment 3aapplication timing 3aenvironmental impact 3aphytotoxicity 3anecrosis 3astorage time 3astorage temperature 3aduration 3airrigation rates 3adefoliation 3adefoliants 3aornamental woody plants 3aNorth Carolina 0anonfood plant products 0aapplication rate1 aDole, J.M.0 tHortTechnology.g2005 , v. 15, no. 2 p.376-380wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20060307b20060402c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/02/21  aOther US 7aarticle02699naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245015000165300001600315500001500331520164700346650001901993650001202012653002302024653002402047653001402071653002202085773014002107852000902247856008502256930003302341946001102374655001202385IND4445407020221120101000.0101119e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444540702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10901-010-9198-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Eijk, Gwen 10aDoes living in a poor neighbourhood result in network poverty? A study on local networks, locality-based relationships and neighbourhood settings  ap. 467-480.  a2019-12-04  aThis paper examines whether and how living in a poor neighbourhood results in “network poverty”. Through a detailed analysis of the formation of personal networks of people living in a poor neighbourhood and those living in an affluent neighbourhood in Rotterdam, I examine the role of the neighbourhood in the formation of personal networks. I address three issues. First, whether resource-poor people who live in a poor neighbourhood form relationships with fellow-residents to compensate for their otherwise small network. I find that they do not and that their small network is primarily caused by non-participation in settings such as study, work, leisure and associations. Second, I distinguish locally maintained relationships that have originated in other settings from locality-based relationships that originated in the neighbourhood. The study shows that high network localness is more a matter of maintaining relationships in the neighbourhood than forming many new locality-based relationships with fellow-residents. Third, I examine how the neighbourhood facilitates relationship formation and conclude that this happens not in “the neighbourhood” but in neighbourhood settings, which attract a particular segment of a neighbourhood population. I conclude that the problem of network poverty is not in the first place spatial but rather lies in lack of participation in certain settings. Furthermore, social mixing policies can only be successful if they are accompanied by initiatives to draw a mixed population to neighbourhood settings and facilitate routine encounters between resource-rich and resource-poor people. 3asocial capital 3apoverty 0aPoor neighbourhood 0aSpatial segregation 0aisolation 0aPersonal networks0 tJournal of housing and the built environment HBE.g2010 Dec., v. 25, no. 4 p.467-480dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1566-49107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10901-010-9198-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20101119b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01328naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245002800148300001300176500001200189500001500201520018100216650001700397650002400414650001700438650001200455650002900467650001000496650002100506650002400527650001100551650001100562650000900573650002400582651001800606651001800624653001300642653004000655700001800695773009400713852000900807939003300816945000800849946001300857655001200870991616482370742620221120080106.0830322e19820506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830028992DNAL7 a70704132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLord, W.D.10aSwine Ascaris in humans  ap. 1113.  aLetter.  a2019-12-04  aAscaris suum, children of both sexes between ages 3 and 11, history of exposure to pigs or soil contaminated with pig feces, possible role of pigs in epidemiology of ascariasis 3aepidemiology 3anematode infections 3aAscaris suum 2aAnimals 2aAscariasisxtransmission 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aSwinexparasitology 3aNew Hampshire 0aNew Hampshire 0aNematoda 0aDisease transmission, Animal to man1 aBullock, W.L.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1982 May 6, v. 306, no. 18 p.1113-1113x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830322c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01801naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012200125300001800247520099600265650002001261650002201281700001701303700001501320700001201335773011001347852000901457930003301466945001301499946001101512655001201523IND2058706620221120075915.0970730e199610  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205870662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenema, K.10aMutational analysis and chemical modification of Cys24 of lactococcin B, a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis  ap. 2825-2830.  aUsing site-directed mutagenesis the single cysteine residue at position 24 of lactococcin B was replaced by all other possible amino acids. Most of these mutant molecules retained bacteriocin activity, with the exception of those in which cysteine was replaced by a positively charged amino add. This would seem to be in agreement with the authors' earlier observation that treatment of the wild-type molecule with HgCl2 resulted in its inactivation. The factor that causes inactivation of lactococcin B seems to be the introduction of a positive charge at position 24 by HgCl2 rather than oxidation of this residue, as treatment of the bacteriocin with other oxidative chemicals did not interfere with the ability of lactococcin B to dissipate the membrane potential of sensitive cells. Results are also reported which imply that inactive lactococcin B can still bind to its receptor. It can be replaced by an active bacteriocin molecule, resulting in dissipation of the membrane potential. 3afood processing 3afood microbiology1 aDost, M.H.R.1 aVenema, G.1 aKok, J.0 tMicrobiology.g1996 Oct., v. 142, no. pt.10 p.2825-2830aMicrobiology (Reading, England)x1350-08727nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01256naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245007900150300001600229500001200245520020300257650001500460650001800475650001000493650005000503650001100553650001800564650001100582650000900593650001600602650003200618700001500650700001700665700002000682773009300702852000900795939003300804945000800837946001300845655001200858991616481670742620221120063942.0830322e19820819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830029042DNAL7 a70992122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHauser, W.E.10aCentral-nervous-system toxoplasmosis in homosexual and heterosexual adults  ap. 498-499.  aLetter.  atoxoplasmosis, central nervous system infection in otherwise healthy heterosexual and homosexual adults with no known underlying disease, clinical and diagnostic findings in 6 cases briefly reviewed 3aToxoplasma 3atoxoplasmosis 2aAdult 2aCentral Nervous System Diseasesxepidemiology 2aFemale 2aHomosexuality 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aToxoplasmosisxepidemiology1 aLuft, B.J.1 aConley, F.K.1 aRemington, J.S.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1982 Aug. 19, v. 307, no. 8 p.498-499x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830322c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle03561naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245009100147300001800238300002300256500001500279520198500294650000902279650001202288650001502300650001702315650002502332650001202357650004202369650000902411650001102420650004602431650000902477650002502486650004402511650007202555650006502627653001402692653002302706700001602729700001302745700001902758700001902777700001802796700001902814700001302833700001902846773009902865852000902964939003302973946001303006655001203019IND8803958620221120052539.0880919e198808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880395862DNAL7 a24599962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, J.K.10aPathogenesis of experimentally induced feline immunodeficiency virus infection in cats  ap. 1246-1258.  ap. 1246-1258. ill.  a2019-12-05  aFeline immunodeficiency virus (FIV; formerly, feline T-lymphotropic lentivirus) is a typical lentivirus resembling human and simian immunodeficiency viruses in morphologic features, protein structure, and reverse transcriptase enzyme. It is antigenically dissimilar, however. The virus is tropic for primary and permanent feline T-lymphoblastoid cells and Crandell feline kidney cells. The virus did not grow in other permanent feline non-lymphoblastoid cells that were tested or in lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells from man, dogs, mice, and sheep. During short term inoculation studies in cats, the feline immunodeficiency-like syndrome found in nature was not experimentally induced, but a distinct primary phase of infection was observed. Fever and neutropenia were observed 4 to 5 weeks after inoculation; fever lasted several days, and neutropenia persisted from 1 to 9 weeks. Generalized lymphadenopathy that persisted for 2 to 9 months appeared at the same time. Antibodies to FIV appeared 2 weeks after inoculation and then plateaued. Virus was reisolated from the blood of all infected cats within 4 to 5 weeks after inoculation and persisted indefinitely in the face of humoral antibody response. Virus was recovered from blood, plasma, CSF and saliva, but not from colostrum or milk. Contact transmission was achieved slowly in one colony of naturally infected cats, but not between experimentally infected and susceptible specific-pathogen-free cats kept together for periods aslong as 4 to 14 months. The infection was transmitted readily, however, by parenteral inoculation with blood, plasma, or infective cell culture fluids. In utero and lactogenic transmission were not observed in kittens born to naturally or experimentally infected queens. Lymphadenopathy observed during the initial stage of FIV infection was ascribed to lymphoid hyperplasia and follicular dysplasia. A myeloproliferative disorder was observed in 1 cat with experimentally induced infection. 3acats 3aviruses 3aimmunology 3apathogenesis 3aimmunologic diseases 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxetiologyxtransmission. 2aCats 2aFemale 2aLymphatic Diseasesxetiologyxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aRNA-Directed DNA Polymerasexmetabolism 2aRetroviridaexisolation & purificationxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aRetroviridae Infectionsxetiologyxtransmissionxveterinary. 0aisolation 0aculture techniques1 aSparger, E.1 aHo, E.W.1 aAndersen, P.R.1 aO'Connor, T.P.1 aMandell, C.P.1 aLowenstine, L.1 aMunn, R.1 aPedersen, N.C.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1988 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.1246-1258x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04112naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100003000179245007000209300001600279500002400295500001500319506007600334520211800410506003702528650001102565650000902576650001102585650001002596650001402606650001902620650001302639650002202652650001902674650001402693650001002707650001502717650001802732650002302750650001202773650002002785650001602805650001202821650001202833650001302845650007702858650004902935650002502984650003203009650003503041650002403076650002903100650005303129651001103182653001203193700003003205700002803235773010003263852000903363856007803372655001203450IND4411659320221207125106.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441165932DNAL7 a187557012pmid7 aPMC27123762pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcn1532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos-Ordoñez, María F.10aParthenocarpy and Seed Predation by Insects in Bursera morelensis  ap. 713-722.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: While parthenocarpy (meaning the production of fruits without seeds) may limit fecundity in many plants, its function is not clear; it has been proposed, however, that it might be associated with a strategy to avoid seed predation. Bursera morelensis is a dioecious endemic plant that produces fruits with and without seeds, and its fruits are parasitized by insects. Its reproductive system is not well described and no published evidence of parthenocarpy exists for the species. The purpose of this work was to describe the breeding system of B. morelensis and its relationship to seed predation by insects. METHODS: The breeding system was described using pollination experiments, verifying the presence of parthenocarpic fruits and apomictic seeds. Reproductive structures from flower buds to mature fruits were quantified. For fruits, an anatomical and histological characterization was made. The number of fruits in which seeds had been predated by insects was correlated with parthenocarpic fruit production. KEY RESULTS: The major abortion of reproductive structures occurred during fruit set. The results discard the formation of apomictic seeds. Flowers that were not pollinated formed parthenocarpic fruits and these could be distinguished during early developmental stages. In parthenocarpic fruits in the first stages of development, an unusual spread of internal walls of the ovary occurred invading the locule and preventing ovule development. Unlike fruits with seeds, parthenocarpic fruits do not have calcium oxalate crystals in the ovary wall. Both fruit types can be separated in the field at fruit maturity by the presence of dehiscence, complete in seeded and partial in parthenocarpic fruits. Trees with more parthenocarpic fruits had more parasitized fruits. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first time the anatomy of parthenocarpic fruits in Burseraceae has been described. Parthenocarpic fruits in B. morelensis might function as a deceit strategy for insect seed predators as they are unprotected both chemically and mechanically by the absence of calcium oxalate crystals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aovules 3abuds 3afruits 3aseeds 3afecundity 3aseed predation 3acrystals 3aearly development 3afruit maturity 3apredators 3atrees 3adehiscence 3aparthenocarpy 3aindigenous species 3aBursera 3acalcium oxalate 3apollination 3ainsects 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aBurseraxgrowth & developmentxparasitologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aFruitxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aParthenogenesisxphysiology 2aPredatory Behaviorxphysiology 2aRegression Analysis 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSeedsxparasitologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 0aMexico 0aovaries1 aMárquez-Guzmán, Judith.1 aDel Coro Arizmendi, Ma.0 tAnnals of botany.g2008 Nov., v. 102, no. 5 p.713-722dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcn1533Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02221naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245015000152300001800302520033100320650002500651650002100676650002000697650002700717650001400744650003900758650002000797650001000817650002600827650004500853650004600898650004600944650003400990650003401024650001801058650001101076650002301087650004701110650002601157650000901183650005101192650003001243650003001273650004301303650002901346650003001375700001601405700001901421700001801440700001401458773009601472852000901568939003301577945000801610946001301618655001201631991616480470742620221120052502.0830322e19811210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830028952DNAL7 a62721092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGottlieb, M.S.10aPneumocystis carinii pneumonia and mucosal candidiasis in previously healthy homosexual men: Evidence of a new acquired cellular immunodeficiency  ap. 1425-1431.  aPneumocystis carinii pneumonia associated with mucosal candidiasis and viral infections, distinct and unusual clinical syndrome documented only in previously healthy male homosexuals, cytomegalovirus infection probable important factor in pathogenesis of this potentially transmissible cellular immune deficiency, case reports 3aPneumocystis carinii 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmune response 3acell-mediated immunity 3apneumonia 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 3amixed infection 2aAdult 2aCandidiasisxetiology 2aCandidiasis, Oralxetiologyximmunology. 2aCytomegalovirusxisolation & purification 2aCytomegalovirus Infectionsxcomplications 2aEsophageal Diseasesxetiology 2aHerpes Simplexxcomplications 2aHomosexuality 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aImmunologic Deficiency Syndromesxetiology 2aLymphopeniaxetiology 2aMale 2aPneumonia, Pneumocystisxetiologyximmunology. 2aRectal Diseasesxetiology 2aSarcoma, Kaposixetiology 2aSimplexvirusxisolation & purification 2aSkin Neoplasmsxetiology 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology1 aSchroff, R.1 aSchanker, H.M.1 aWeisman, J.D.1 aFan, P.T.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1981 Dec. 10, v. 305, no. 24 p.1425-1431x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830322c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02864naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245009800147300001800245300002300263520137800286650001001664650001301674650001201687650001801699650001201717650001301729650002101742650001201763650005801775650007101833650003801904650005501942650002101997650002502018650002402043650005602067650003002123653002102153700001702174700001802191700001902209773009902228852000902327939003302336946001302369655001202382IND8803959920221120052609.0880927e198808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880395992DNAL7 a31406952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgberink, H.F.10aCharacterization of the structural proteins of porcine epizootic diarrhea virus, strain CV777  ap. 1320-1324.  ap. 1320-1324. ill.  aPig epizootic diarrhea virus cannot be grown in cell culture; for its characterization, intestinal perfusate material from a pig infected with the strain CV777 had to be used. In isopyknic sucrose gradients, a peak of virus-specific ELISA activity was detected at a density of 1.17 g/ml. Using immunoprecipitation of radioiodinated-purified virus material followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 3 proteins of low molecular weight (20,000 to 32,000 daltons [D] were found; after blotting nitrocellulose and glycoprotein identification with concanavalin A and horseradish peroxidase, 1 of the proteins (23,000 D) gave a signal. Another protein of 58,000 D was encountered, which was the only protein binding an RNA probe. Finally, a protein of 85,000 D was visible, associated with minor bands of about 110,000 and 135,000 D in most experiments. Using the concanavalin A-blotting technique, the same bands were visualized. The demonstration of a polydisperse cluster of proteins from 20,000 to 32,000 D (of which at least 1 is glycosylated), of glycosylated proteins from 85,000 to 135,000 D, and of an RNA-binding protein of 58,000 D is taken as structural evidence that pig epizootic diarrhea virus should be classified with the Coronaviridae, irrespective of the apparent lack of an antigenic relationship with other members of that family. 3aswine 3adiarrhea 3aviruses 3aCoronaviridae 3astrains 3aproteins 3amolecular weight 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aCoronaviridaexanalysisxclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGlycoproteinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aMolecular Weight 2aRNA-Binding Proteins 2aSwinexmicrobiology 2aViral Proteinsxanalysisxisolation & purification. 2aViral Structural Proteins 0acharacterization1 aEderveen, J.1 aCallebaut, P.1 aHorzinek, M.C.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1988 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.1320-1324x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01201naa a2200397 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245005400148300001600202500001500218520005200233650002600285650001500311650002500326650002400351650002400375650003400399650003500433650003700468650002400505650002300529650004200552653001300594700001500607700001700622773009100639852000900730939003300739945000800772946001100780655001200791991616480080742620221120052548.0830318e19820225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830027562DNAL7 a68004082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFish, W.R.10aPurine metabolism in Trypanosoma brucei gambiense  ap. 422-428.  a2019-12-04  aTrypanosoma brucei gambiense, purine metabolism 3aTrypanosoma gambiense 3ametabolism 2aFormatesxmetabolism 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlycinexmetabolism 2aGuanine Deaminasexmetabolism 2aPurine Nucleosidesxmetabolism 2aPurine Nucleotidesxbiosynthesis 2aPurinesxmetabolism 2aSerinexmetabolism 2aTrypanosoma brucei bruceixmetabolism 0aProtozoa1 aMarr, J.J.1 aBerens, R.L.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g1982 Feb. 25, v. 714, no. 3 p.422-428x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830318c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02482naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245004500144300001800189300002300207520137500230650000901605650001901614650001001633650002101643650001201664650005801676650000901734650007501743650005001818653002001868700001901888700001701907700001801924773009901942852000902041939003302050946001302083655001202096IND8803959320221120052711.0880921e198808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880395932DNAL7 a31780252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyers, L.J.10aAnosmia associated with canine distemper  ap. 1295-1297.  ap. 1295-1297. ill.  aThe sense of smell in dogs infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) was examined by use of EEG olfactometry, behavioral olfactometry, and electro-olfactography. Infection with CDV was confirmed by a direct immunofluorescence technique in 8 active cases and was suggested by clinical history compatible with canine distemper 10 to 26 weeks earlier in 6 cases. Pathologic alterations of the olfactory mucosa in 3 clinically affected dogs was examined by light microscopy. Infection with CDV was found to be associated with anosmia and lack of recorded responses on electro-olfactogram in 8 of 8 dogs with clinical signs of acute distemper from naturally acquired infections. Anosmia was found in 5 of 6 dogs that had recovered from acute distemper 10 to 26 weeks earlier. The sixth dog had hyposmia, with abnormalities on the electro-olfactogram. Histologic examination was not performed on the 6 dogs that had recovered. Histologic lesions observed at necropsy in 3 dogs that had had clinical signs of acute distemper were those of subacute purulent rhinitis and atrophy of the olfactory epithelium. Altered olfactory function could be explained by mucopurulent exudate blocking odors from olfactory receptors in the acutely affected dogs, but alteration of olfactory function in the dogs that had recovered without clinical evidence of rhinitis could not be explained. 3adogs 3ahistopathology 3asmell 3aolfactory organs 2aAnimals 2aDistemperxcomplicationsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDogs 2aOlfaction Disordersxetiologyxpathologyxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aOlfactory Mucosaxpathologyxphysiopathology. 0adistemper virus1 aHanrahan, L.A.1 aSwango, L.J.1 aNusbaum, K.E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1988 Aug., v. 49, no. 8 p.1295-1297x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01663naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147100001700156245009300173300001600266500002400282500001500306520038900321650001500710650001500725650001000740650001500750650001900765650001400784650002000798650001600818650001300834650001800847650001300865651001800878653002300896653002300919700002000942773007800962852000901040856008701049930003301136945002501169946001101194655001201205IND4396072520221120041650.0071016s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439607252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.flora.2006.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aDang, T.T.T.14aThe reproductive biology of Stellaria longipes Goldie (Caryophyllaceae) in North America  ap. 403-407.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStellaria longipes is a very variable species of circumpolar distribution and wide ecological amplitude.

The model for moisture removal can be represented by a sum of exponential terms, adjusted to the experimental data from the dehydration of the product under investigation. Using this analogy, physical meaning was attributed to each parameter involved in the drying equation. The number of RC circuit branches in the electric system is equal to the number of exponential terms of the drying equation. In the cases investigated (soybean and sunflower seed), the adjusted equations to express the time variations of the product moisture were composed of the sum of two exponential terms, which are equivalent to the removal of two types of water during the drying process. 3abranches 3adrying 3aelectronic circuits 3aequations 3amodels 3asoybeans 3asunflower seed1 aCouto, S.

Maximizing water use efficiency (WUE) for cotton lint yield is therefore a strategic goal in conserving limited water resources. In this study, different row spacings, planting patterns, and irrigation levels were evaluated to investigate water use efficiency for cotton under subsurface drip irrigation (SDI). An experiment with three row spacings, three planting patterns, and four water levels was conducted during three years in western Texas. The row spacing treatments were ultraânarrow (UNR), 0.76 m, and 1.02 m. The planting patterns for the 0.76âm and 1.02âm row spacings were every row planted, one planted and one skipped, and two planted and one skipped. The UNR cotton was solidâplanted in 0.25âm rows in 1997 and in 0.38âm rows in 1998 and 1999. Driplines were placed beneath each planted row, except in the case of the UNR rows where the rows were planted over the 0.76âm dripline spacing. The UNR and the 0.76âm row spacings resulted in higher WUE than the 1.02âm row spacing for the highest water level in 1997, and for the lowest water level in 1998 for the everyârow pattern. When the three years of data were combined for analysis, it was observed that for the lowest water treatment (0.6 mm/d inâseason irrigation), the UNR spacing produced a higher WUE (0.258 kg/m3) than the 0.76âm and 1.02âm row spacings (0.198 kg/m3). The average WUE of the UNR spacing for three years of the experiment was 11.7% and 21.3% higher than the 0.76âm and 1.02âm row spacings, respectively. Although the 0.76âm and 1.02âm row spacings were not significantly different, the WUE of the 0.76âm row spacing was 10.5% higher than that of the 1.02âm row spacing. Therefore, we conclude that, under our conditions, row spacing can have a moderate impact on WUE for SDI systems. The narrower cotton spacing exhibited trends toward higher WUE. When the planting patterns were analyzed by combining three years of data, it was found that planting pattern did not have an influence on WUE for the 0.76âm and 1.02âm row spacings. 3agroundwater 3airrigation rates 3alint cotton 3alint yield 3amicroirrigation 3aplanting 3arain 3arow spacing 3awater resources 3awater treatment 3awater use efficiency 3aTexas1 aUnruh, B.

In this study, the resistance inheritance was investigated in an F ₂ and its F ₂:₃ populations derived from a cross from two inbred lines W2D (resistant) and W222 (susceptible). The 3:1 ratio of resistant to susceptible plants indicated that the resistance is controlled by one dominant gene (named as RppD). The gene RppD was located by means of the F ₂ population. Total of 11 markers, including five SSR markers, five sequence-tagged site markers and one cleaved-amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker, were identified to narrow the gene RppD down to a smaller interval. The closest markers flanking RppD were SSR marker umc1291 and CAPS marker CAPS858, with genetic distances of 2.9 and 0.8 cM, respectively. Moreover, RppD might be a novel Rpp resistance gene or haplotype differing from RppQ and RppP25 according to an allelism test among the three crosses W2D × Qi319, W2D × P25 and Qi319 × P25. As a result, RppD haplotype might be helpful to maize germplasm enhancement and disease-resistant breeding. 3aPuccinia polysora 3aZea mays 3abreeding 3acorn 3adominant genes 3agenetic improvement 3ahaplotypes 3ainbred lines 3amicrosatellite repeats1 aXu, Li1 aZhang, Deng-Feng1 aDai, Jing-Rui1 aWang, Shou-Cai0 tMolecular breeding.g2010 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.433-439dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-009-9342-3 7aarticle03018naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001300187245009400200300001800294500002400312520121300336650001401549650002301563650001401586650002501600650001301625650001901638650001901657650001901676650002101695650002701716650003401743650004101777650003101818650004401849650006301893650002101956650001401977650001301991650004302004650003202047700002002079700002102099700002102120700002202141773010902163852000902272856009002281930003302371945002502404946001102429655001202440IND4396071720221120031749.0071016e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439607172DNAL7 a170552632pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2006.08.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aX3001 aAsad, S.10aDecolorization of textile azo dyes by newly isolated halophilic and halotolerant bacteria  ap. 2082-2088.  aIncludes references  aStudies were carried out on the decolorization of textile azo dyes by newly isolated halophilic and halotolerant bacteria. Among the 27 strains of halophilic and halotolerant bacteria isolated from effluents of textile industries, three showed remarkable ability in decolorizing the widely utilized azo dyes. Phenotypic characterization and phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence comparisons indicate that these strains belonged to the genus Halomonas. The three strains were able to decolorize azo dyes in a wide range of NaCl concentration (up to 20% w/v), temperature (25-40 °C), and pH (5-11) after 4 days of incubation in static culture. They could decolorize the mixture of dyes as well as pure dyes. These strains also readily grew in and decolorized the high concentrations of dye (5000 ppm) and could tolerate up to 10,000 ppm of the dye. UV-Vis analyses before and after decolorization and the colorless bacterial biomass after decolorization suggested that decolorization was due to biodegradation, rather than inactive surface adsorption. Analytical studies based on HPLC showed that the principal decolorization was reduction of the azo bond, followed by cleavage of the reduced bond. 3aHalomonas 3amicrobial activity 3aphylogeny 3aphenotypic variation 3aazo dyes 3adecolorization 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3atextile industry 3atextile mill effluents 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aChromatography, Thin Layer 2aColoring Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHalomonasxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aIndustrial Waste 2aPhylogeny 2aTextiles 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aAmoozegar, M.A.1 aPourbabaee, A.A.1 aSarbolouki, M.N.1 aDastgheib, S.M.M.0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Aug., v. 98, no. 11 p.2082-2088dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.08.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20080123b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02195naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245008700162300002000249520097100269592002801240596004601268596005401314650001101368650002101379650002401400650001301424650002501437700001801462700001401480700001901494700002101513700001901534700005201553773012401605856008301729852000901812655001201821IND60755477920221117222705.0211102e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075547792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-06495-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fei10aPulsed electric current joining of oxide-dispersion-strengthened austenitic steels  ap. 19216-19227.  aThe solid-state joining of oxide-dispersion-strengthened (ODS) austenitic steels was achieved using a pulsed electric current joining (PECJ) process. Microstructures of the austenitic grain structures and oxide dispersions in the joint areas were characterized using electron microscopy. Negligible grain growth was observed in austenitic grain structures, while slight coarsening of oxide dispersions occurred at a short holding time. The mechanisms of the PECJ process may involve three steps that occur simultaneously, including the sintering of mechanical alloying powders in the bonding layer, formation of oxide dispersions, and bonding of the mechanical alloying powders with the base alloy. The high hardness and irradiation resistance of ODS alloys were retained in the joint areas. This research revealed the fundamental mechanisms during the PECJ process, which is beneficial for its potential applications during the advanced manufacturing of ODS alloys.  aPublisher supplied data  aCMMI-1762190cNational Science Foundation  a31310018M0045cU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission 3aalloys 3aelectric current 3aelectron microscopy 3ahardness 3aradiation resistance1 aYan, Xueliang1 aChen, Xin1 aSnyder, Nathan1 aNastasi, Michael1 aHattar, Khalid1 aCui, Bai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0585-66980 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Dec., v. 56, no. 34 p.19216-19227dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-06495-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01325naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245026000162300001800422520029100440592002800731650001200759650001300771650001300784700002400797773015200821856007700973852000901050655001201059IND60521505620221122181502.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052150562DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1976-08282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiegler, Erich10aZur Reaktivität von C=N-Doppelbindungssystemen, IX1 Reaktionen mit Harnstoff, Thioharnstoff, N.N-Dimethylsemicarbazid bzw.

The most prominent layer of OLED is the emissive layer because the device emission color, contrast ratio, and external efficiency depend of this layer’s materials. This review ruminates on the basics of OLEDs, different light emission mechanisms, OLEDs achievements, and different types of challenges revealed in the field of OLEDs. This review’s primary intention is to broadly discuss the synthesizing methods, physicochemical properties of conducting polymer polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), and its polymeric nanocomposite-based emissive layer materials for OLEDs application. It also discusses the most extensively used OLED fabrication techniques. PMMA-based polymeric nanocomposites revealed good transparency properties, good thermal stability, and high electrical conductivity, making suitable materials as an emissive layer for OLED applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenergy use and consumption 3alight emitting diodes 3aliquid crystal display 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymethylmethacrylate 3athermal stability1 aChoudhary, Ram Bilash1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1464-56491 aMandal, Gobind0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Dec., v. 56, no. 34 p.18837-18866dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-06503-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03986naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003800135040001800173100002700191245010500218300001400323520185900337592002802196650001002224650001302234650001302247650002502260650000902285650001702294650002402311650001802335650001402353650003602367650001802403650001002421650002302431650003702454650002402491650001202515650002802527650002902555650004202584650002602626650004002652650003902692650007502731650002802806650002102834650003902855650003902894650004802933650002602981650001503007650002503022700002603047700002203073700002603095773008703121856008403208990002303292852000903315655001203324IND60087330320221120181315.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008733032DNAL7 a206244932pmid7 aPMC29675792pmcid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2010.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStephens, Elizabeth H.10aMitral valvular interstitial cell responses to substrate stiffness depend on age and anatomic region  ap. 75-82.  aThe material properties of heart valves depend on the subject’s age, the state of the disease and the complex valvular microarchitecture. Furthermore, valvular interstitial cells (VICs) are mechanosensitive, and their synthesis of extracellular matrix not only determines the valve’s material properties but also provides an adhesive substrate for VICs. However, the interrelationship between substrate stiffness and VIC phenotype and synthetic properties is poorly understood. Given that the local mechanical environment (substrate stiffness) surrounding VICs differs among different age groups and different anatomic regions of the valve, it was hypothesized that there may be an age- and valve-region-specific response of VICs to substrate stiffness. Therefore, 6-week-, 6-month- and 6-year-old porcine VICs from the center of the mitral valve anterior leaflet (MVAC) and posterior leaflet (PML) were seeded onto poly(ethylene) glycol hydrogels of different stiffnesses and stained for markers of VIC activation (smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMaA)) and collagen synthesis (heat shock protein-47 (HSP47), prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4H)). Six-week-old MVAC demonstrated decreased SMaA, P4H and HSP47 on stiffer gels, while 6-week-old PML only demonstrated decreased HSP47. Six-month-old MVAC demonstrated no difference between substrates, while 6-month-old PML demonstrated decreased SMaA, P4H and HSP47. Six-year-old MVAC demonstrated decreased P4H and HSP47, while 6-year-old PML demonstrated decreased P4H and increased HSP47. In conclusion, the age-specific and valve-region-specific responses of VICs to substrate stiffness link VIC phenotype to the leaflet regional matrix in which the VICs reside. These data provide further rationale for investigating the role of substrate stiffness in VIC remodeling within diseased and tissue engineered valves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3acollagen 3aethylene 3aextracellular matrix 3agels 3aheart valves 3aheat shock proteins 3ahydrocolloids 3aphenotype 3aprocollagen-proline dioxygenase 3asmooth muscle 3aswine 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aAgingxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aCell Shapexdrug effects 2aHSP47 Heat-Shock Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHeparinxpharmacology 2aHydrogelsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMechanical Phenomenaxdrug effects 2aMitral Valvexanatomy & histologyxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPeptidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxpharmacology 2aProcollagen-Proline Dioxygenasexmetabolism 2aStaining and Labeling 2aSus scrofa 2aVimentinxmetabolism1 aDurst, Christopher A.1 aWest, Jennifer L.1 aGrande-Allen, K.

Both the culturable and unculturable (metagenome) methylotrophs were investigated in the lake sediments employing both mxaF and 16S rRNA genes as markers. ARDRA profiling, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, PAGE profiling of HaeIII, EcoRI restricted mxaF gene and the mxaF gene sequences using culture-dependent approach revealed the relatedness of α-proteobacteria and Methylobacterium, Hyphomicrobium and Ancyclobacter sp. The total viable counts of the culturable aerobic methylotrophs were relatively higher in sediments near the sea mouth (S3; Panaspada), also demonstrated relatively high salinity (0.1 M NaCl) tolerance. Metagenomic DNA from the sediments, amplified using GC clamp mxaF primers and resolved through DGGE, revealed the diversity within the unculturable methylotrophic bacterium Methylobacterium organophilum, Ancyclobacter aquaticus, Burkholderiales and Hyphomicrobium sp. Culture-independent analyses revealed that up to 90 % of the methylotrophs were unculturable.

The purpose of this study is to develop a robust committee machine model for estimating fast and slow shear wave velocities from petrophysical logs. To this end, appropriate inputs were determined and different algorithms including artificial neural network, fuzzy logic and neuro-fuzzy were applied. Afterward, the obtained outputs were merged by utilizing optimization methods consisting of Ant Colony Optimization for Continuous Domain, Genetic and Simulated Annealing approaches. The construction of the committee machine was done using a case study including 2000 data samples from the Sarvak Formation in one of the southwestern Iran oilfields. The utilized dataset was divided into training and testing data which contain 1600 and 400 samples, respectively. Mean Squared Error was presented as a determinative factor for evaluating system performance. To obtain the best system performance with the lowest Mean Squared Error, the parameters setting of each algorithm were coded in different ranges. A total 52416, 76896 and 29400 cases were run to optimize the parameter settings of genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and continues ant colony optimization models, respectively. A weight factor is assigned to each method indicating their contribution in the final estimation. The desirable weights' combination is acquired using optimization methods. Among the individual systems, fuzzy logic and artificial neural network obtained the best performance for estimating fast and slow shear wave velocities, respectively. Also, the results of committee machine algorithms indicate a well optimization on individual systems and have superior performance over them. The most efficient optimization algorithms in the structure of committee machines for fast shear wave velocity are Genetic and Simulated Annealing and for slow shear wave velocity is Genetic Algorithm, in terms of Mean Squared Error criteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3adata collection 3afuzzy logic 3aneural networks 3aoil fields 3asystem optimization 3aIran 0aFuzzy logic 0aNeuro-fuzzy 0aNeural network 0aGenetic algorithm 0aSimulated annealing 0aCommittee machine1 aKadkhodaie, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4789-86311 aSedghi, Mohammad Hassanpour1 aGholami Vijouyeh, Hamed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5766-28470 tComputers & geosciences.g2022 Aug., v. 165 p.105149-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2022.1051493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245008700207300001800294520109900312592002801411596007701439596009201516596009301608650001301701650001101714650001301725650001601738650001301754650001401767650002101781650001401802650001901816650003301835700005801868700005201926700005601978700005202034700005602086700005402142700005802196700005502254700005302309700005602362700005402418773012102472856008202593852000902675655001202684IND60675956120221119120706.0191112e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067595612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-019-03992-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Guangchun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6633-601512aA novel CeO2/MgAl2O4 composite coating for the protection of AZ31 magnesium alloys  ap. 1727-1737.  aA novel CeO₂/MgAl₂O₄ composite coating, fabricated via a cathode plasma electrolytic deposition (CPED) technique followed by hydrothermal synthesis, was developed in this study to explore its potential application as corrosion protection for AZ31 magnesium alloys. The microstructure observed through scanning electron microscopy indicated that reducing the duty cycle of the power source within a reasonable range during the CPED process was beneficial to form a uniform and dense MgAl₂O₄ coating, which served as an ideal adhesive matrix for a uniform CeO₂ coating as the outermost layer. The results of electrochemical impedance spectra and neutral salt spray tests showed that the decoration of the CeO₂ layer significantly improved the corrosion resistance of the CeO₂/MgAl₂O₄ composite coating compared to the single MgAl₂O₄ coating and bare substrate. Cross-cut tests revealed that the adhesion of the MgAl₂O₄ coating and the CeO₂/MgAl₂O₄ composite coating were both excellent due to the strong binding between the MgAl₂O₄ coating and the substrate.  aPublisher supplied data  agrant numbers 51771027cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  agrant number 2017YFB0702100cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  agrant number FRF-BD-18-019Acthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aadhesion 3aalloys 3acathodes 3aceric oxide 3acoatings 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3amagnesium 3amicrostructure 3ascanning electron microscopy1 aQiao, Qianqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7724-08601 aJin, Lei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0317-47891 aZhang, Bowei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4654-91921 aWang, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6730-11371 aHuang, Gang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8935-17361 aYao, Qiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3916-49561 aZhang, Dongjiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0629-72661 aZhang, Zhan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1396-92861 aFang, Tao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6400-798X1 aWu, Junsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8485-08161 aHe, Yedong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9740-18840 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Feb., v. 55, no. 4 p.1727-1737dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-019-03992-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013400167500001900301520157900320592002801899650002601927650001501953650001501968650002101983650001902004650002802023650003402051650001002085650001102095653002402106653003902130653003402169653002002203653002502223653002602248700001802274700001802292700001802310700001902328700002002347700001702367700001702384773011202401856008302513852000902596655001202605IND60722159620221119123246.0210201e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072215962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2020.1128942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Do Kyoung10aPaper-based multiplex analytical device for simultaneous detection of Clostridioides difficile toxins and glutamate dehydrogenase  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report a new paper-based multiplex analytical device (mPAD) for simultaneous screening of three analytes (glutamate dehydrogenase, toxin A, and toxin B) known as biomarkers for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). To overcome the limitation of common rapid assays (e.g. lateral flow immunochromatographic and enzyme immunoassays) in terms of multiplexing, sensitivity, simplicity, and ease-of-use, the mPAD is constructed with a three dimensional (3D) configuration of paper components with a multi-channel design. Multiple fluidic paths developed with wax-patterned paper allow the simultaneous detection of glutamate dehydrogenase, toxin A, and toxin B without any cross-reactivity. The 3D fluidic network on the mPAD facilitates a self-operating test procedure for the mixing and addition of amplification reagents with a one-step sliding operation. The results of the multiplex CDI assay can be easily interpreted by the naked eye within 10 min, and are visually intensified over time resulting in up to 3-fold signal amplification. Our device exhibited remarkable analytical performances for the simultaneous detection of three CDI biomarkers, providing a sensitivity of 97%, specificity of 88%, accuracy of 95%, and limits of detection for glutamate dehydrogenase, toxin A, and toxin B of 0.16 ng mL⁻¹, 0.09 ng mL⁻¹, and 0.03 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. These results indicate the high applicability and feasibility of mPAD for multiplex testing for CDI with the advantages of being simple, sensitive, inexpensive, user-friendly, and equipment-free.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium difficile 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3achemical species 3across reaction 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3apaper 3atoxins 0aPaper-based devices 0aClostridioides difficile infection 0aAntibiotic-resistant bacteria 0aMultiplex assay 0aSignal amplification 0aPoint-of-care testing1 aOh, Jeonghyun1 aLee, Jaehyeon1 aCho, Yong Gon1 aPark, Ju Seong1 aChoi, Jong Soon1 aKim, Dal Sik1 aKwon, Joseph0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 176 p.112894-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2020.1128943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009700166300001600263520107400279592002801353653002401381653001501405653002601420653001801446653001801464700002701482773011301509856008301622852000901705655001201714IND60128671320221120093546.0151116e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012867132DNAL7 a10.1644/05-MAMM-A-353R2.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBixler, Andrea10aReproductive performance as a function of inbreeding in prairie voles (microtus ochrogaster)  ap. 944-949.  aMost studies of inbreeding depression have confounded levels of inbreeding of parents with those of offspring. We used 4 experimental groups of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) in which both parents and offspring were noninbred, parents and offspring were inbred, or parents and offspring differed in their level of inbreeding. For each pair, we recorded latency to the production of the 1st litter, number of litters produced and number of young born in 120 days, litter weights from birth to weaning, and parental behavior. Noninbred parents produced more litters and young and showed shorter interlitter intervals than did inbred parents. Inbred offspring weighed less at birth and weaning. We found no significant differences in parental behaviors among groups. Our results demonstrate that inbreeding depression occurs in prairie voles, and that it may be influenced more by physiological changes in inbred parents or young than by behavioral deficiencies in inbred parents. However, larger sample sizes could reveal that parental behavior does have an effect.  aPublisher supplied data 0agenetic relatedness 0ainbreeding 0ainbreeding depression 0aparental care 0aprairie voles1 aTang-Martinez, Zuleyma0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2006 Oct., v. 87, no. 5 p.944-949dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F05-MAMM-A-353R2.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013600167300001800303500001900321520206100340592002802401650001702429650002902446650001702475650001202492650001302504650001202517650001302529700001802542700001902560700001902579773015302598856008102751852000902832655001202841IND60684801320221120080800.0200222e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068480132DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590191001822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulikova, L.

(Colchicaceae, Magnoliophyta) in the Lower Volga Region  ap. 1294-1301.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  a—This study presents the results of four years of observations of Bulbocodium versicolor (Ker-Gawl.) Spreng. populations in Saratov and Volgograd oblast. A low ecological plasticity of the species was established. Although the species is confined to steppe phytocenoses that vary in composition and structure, the morphology of specimens was rather conservative, which can be explained by the homogeneity of the vegetation conditions over the studied part of the range during active vegetation and flowering. It was shown that, in the Lower Volga region, B. versicolor is characterized by a reduced stress component of its life strategy and a low index of size plasticity. The species uses a patient strategy. Under stress conditions at the morphological level, plants react by miniaturizing the traits of the generative sphere, i.e., redistributing efforts from developing the generative sphere to maintaining the vegetative sphere. The ecotopic and phytocenotic tolerance of B. versicolor is manifested as the capacity to retain the occupied territory for a long time and to avoid competition by selection of the range. According to the conservation priority index, the majority of B. versicolor populations in the Lower Volga region are in a state close to endangered and their preservation requires immediate action. The main factors limiting the number of species in the region are probably aridization of climate and direct anthropogenic impact, which is reflected in the conversion of wildlands into arable land. There is no obvious negative impact on the species by intensive grazing and collection in bouquets. This may be attributed to the secluded location of the remaining species’ habitats that makes the species practically inaccessible in the period of massive flowering. This is primarily due to the fact that the remaining habitats of the species are relatively far from settlements and that during the period of mass flowering of the species they are virtually inaccessible to an impact from these factors due to the remote location.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColchicaceae 3aanthropogenic activities 3aarable soils 3aclimate 3apatients 3asteppes 3awildland1 aKashin, A.

It is not well understood, however, how the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway is regulated. Fortunately, the maize germplasm exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity that can be exploited for this purpose. Here, the accumulation of carotenoids and the expression of genes from carotenoid metabolic and catabolic pathways were investigated in several maize landraces. The carotenoid content in grains varied from 10.03, in the white variety MC5, to 61.50 μg·g−1, in the yellow-to-orange variety MC3, and the major carotenoids detected were lutein and zeaxanthin. PSY1 (phythoene synthase) expression showed a positive correlation with the total carotenoid content. Additionally, the PSY1 and HYD3 (ferredoxin-dependent di-iron monooxygenase) expression levels were positively correlated with β-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, while CYP97C (cytochrome P450-type monooxygenase) expression did not correlate with any of the carotenoids. In contrast, ZmCCD1 (carotenoid dioxygenase) was more highly expressed at the beginning of grain development, as well as in the white variety, and its expression was inversely correlated with the accumulation of several carotenoids, suggesting that CCD1 is also an important enzyme to be considered when attempting to improve the carotenoid content in maize. The MC27 and MC1 varieties showed the highest HYD3/CYP97C ratios, suggesting that they are promising candidates for increasing the zeaxanthin content; in contrast, MC14 and MC7 showed low HYD3/CYP97C, suggesting that they may be useful in biofortification efforts aimed at promoting the accumulation of provitamin A. The results of this study demonstrate the use of maize germplasm to provide insight into the regulation of genes involved in the carotenoid pathway, which would thus better enable us to select promising varieties for biofortification efforts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3abeta-cryptoxanthin 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofortification 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenes 3acorn 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3alandraces 3alutein 3aseed development 3avitamin A 3azeaxanthin1 aGalli, Vanessa1 ados Anjos e Silva, Sérgio Delmar1 aRombaldi, Cesar Valmor0 tNutrients.g2014 Jan. 28, v. 6, no. 2 p.546-563dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60205463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245011800211300001600329520085400345592002801199653002601227653003101253653002601284653001201310653002601322700002301348773011301371856008301484852000901567655001201576IND60128671420221120093646.0151116e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012867142DNAL7 a10.1644/05-MAMM-A-355R1.12doi7 aPMC27749222pmcid7 a199076692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLonghofer, Lisa K.10aMolecular systematics of the genus neotoma based on dna sequences from intron 2 of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene  ap. 961-970.  aPhylogenetic relationships were evaluated among 13 species of Neotoma based on DNA sequences from intron 2 of the nuclear alcohol dehydrogenase gene 1 (Adh1-I2).

Three major clades (I––III) consistently were recovered and relationships among taxa within 2 of the clades remained unchanged between analyses; however, relationships within clade III were largely unresolved. Average genetic divergence values were 2.12%% among species, 4%% between subgenera (Teonoma and Neotoma), and 5.1%% between genera (Hodomys and Neotoma).

The separation of these compounds in a single HPLC analysis is particularly challenging due to the similarity of rooibos phenolics. As a result, multiple methods are often required to analyze all major phenolics in rooibos tea samples. The method development process is significantly enhanced in this study by using the recently introduced automated column coupler in combination with the variable column length strategy. This strategy consists of performing the initial scouting runs, wherein the best separation conditions are determined, on a short column and subsequently fine-tuning the separation on longer columns to benefit from their higher separation performance. It is demonstrated that the method development process can further be expedited by operating each column length at the maximum pressure, in this case 1000bar. Although this holds in general, it is even more the case for the presently considered sample, since the selectivity of the sample is more pressure- than temperature-dependent. Applying the optimized method to unfermented and fermented aqueous rooibos tea extracts in combination with Q-TOF mass spectrometry, some 30 phenolic compounds are tentatively identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aphenolic compounds 3atea1 aBroeckhoven, Ken1 aKalili, Kathithileni M.1 ade Villiers, André1 aDesmet, Gert0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Oct. 14, v. 1218, no. 41 p.7347-7357dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245010600166300001600272500001900288520185000307592002802157596006402185650002202249650002302271650001802294650001002312650003602322650001502358650004102373650001202414650001102426650001602437650002702453650001702480650001402497650002502511650001802536651000902554700001902563700002902582700005802611773012502669856008202794852000902876655001202885IND60736595220221116212948.0210510e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073659522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11816-021-00664-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Rui Xuan10aAdventitious root cultures of Clitoria ternatea L. and its potential as a memory enhancer alternative  ap. 163-176.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClitoria ternatea L., known as the butterfly pea plant, is from the Fabaceae family and is commonly used in traditional medicine or as a brain tonic in Asia. The root extracts of C. ternatea have been previously studied for its neuroprotective properties linked to memory enhancement of the mammalian brain, indirectly delaying the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases. The current study aims to establish in vitro adventitious root cultures of C. ternatea via cotyledon explants and to identify the phytoconstituents of the induced adventitious roots. In this study, the highest percentage of induction (95.24%) was achieved in half-strength MS medium supplemented with 2.50 mg/L NAA (1-naphthaleneacetic acid) after 6 weeks of culture. Results also indicated that the supplementation of 1.50 mg/L NAA induced the highest number of adventitious roots (12.86 ± 2.14), while 2.50 mg/L 4-Cl-IAA (4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid) yielded higher adventitious root length (0.75 ± 0.13 cm) in comparison with the other auxin treatments. Microscopic analysis indicated thicker in vitro root morphology for all NAA treatments in comparison with the roots of in vitro seedling. Ethanolic extract of in vitro-generated adventitious roots showed potential anti-acetylcholinesterase activities (IC₅₀ = 1519.89 ± 0.18 μg/mL) albeit being lower than the control (IC₅₀ = 70.37 ± 0.01 μg/mL), while gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis identified the presence of pentacyclic triterpenes, phytosterols and fatty acids in the adventitious root culture that are linked to the mammalian neuroprotective properties of C. ternatea. The current investigation reports on the potential of C. ternatea root cultures being further utilized to produce valuable metabolites linked to the mammalian memory enhancement.  aPublisher supplied data  a203/PBIOLOGI/6711902cMinistry of Higher Education Malaysia 3aClitoria ternatea 3aadventitious roots 3abiotechnology 3abrain 3achemical constituents of plants 3acotyledons 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amammals 3amemory 3ametabolites 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aphytosterols 3aseedlings 3atraditional medicine 3atriterpenoids 3aAsia1 aHassan, Zurina1 aSubramaniam, Sreeramanan1 aChew, Bee Lynn1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6678-08690 tPlant biotechnology reports.g2021 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.163-176dSpringer SingaporewJournal:jnl4237782x1863-54667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11816-021-00664-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015800173300001600331500001900347520087300366592002801239596011201267596009601379596009601475650001501571650001801586650002501604650001101629650003201640650002301672650002001695653001001715653002301725653003501748653002301783700002101806700001901827700002301846773013601869856008502005852000902090655001202099IND60692796520221120184757.0200503e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069279652DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2017.12817242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagiwara, Tomoaki10aMonitoring of adsorption behaviors of bovine serum albumin onto a stainless steel surface by the quartz crystal microbalance based on admittance analysis  ap. 783-789.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe adsorption process of bovine serum albumin (BSA) onto a stainless steel surface was investigated using the quartz crystal microbalance based on admittance analysis. The adhered mass change ∆m increased with time as a result of contacting the BSA solution, and considerably long period (>2 h) was required for the attainment of the asymptotic values of ∆m as well as dissipation factor ∆D. The relation between ΔD and Δm suggested that the layer of adsorbed BSA molecules became stiffer with increasing time at higher BSA concentration. The relation between Δm after 2 h and the final BSA concentration was described well by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. However, the time course of Δm clearly deviated from the Langmuir adsorption model. The stretched exponential function model described the time course of Δm well although it was an empirical one.  aPublisher supplied data  aSanriku Research and Education Base Formation ProjcIwate Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100003983  a24560919cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691  a15K06539cJapan Society for the Promotion of Sciencedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001691 3aadsorption 3abiotechnology 3abovine serum albumin 3amodels 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asorption isotherms 3astainless steel 0aQCM-A 0aprotein adsorption 0astretched exponential function 0adissipation factor1 aNattawut, Phosri1 aShibata, Mario1 aSakiyama, Takaharu0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 81, no. 4 p.783-789dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.12817243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014900171300001600320520126200336592002801598650001201626650002301638650002601661650002401687650001501711650001801726650001601744650001001760650002301770650001101793650001501804650002201819650001301841650003701854650004401891650005801935650003001993653001202023653001502035653002002050653001802070700002302088700002802111700002602139773013902165856008502304852000902389655001202398IND60672022420221116144624.0191128e20191021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067202242DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2019.16639652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aR, Vinoth Kumar10aRecovery of Aliphatic Fatty Acids from Red Seaweed Champia parvula (C.

In this regard, C. parvula crude extracts were obtained from n-hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, methanol, and water used to study the antifungal action. Results showed that methanolic extract had potent action against C. albicans, C. tropicalis, T. mentagrophytes, and A.flavus, with the highest inhibition of 16.7 mm found against C. tropicalis. Minimum inhibition concentration at 12.5 and minimum fungal concentration at 25 μg/mL were found in the methanolic extract. Therefore, to identify the bioactive compound for this antifungal action in the methanolic extract, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) were used. The RP-HPLC had three peaks with retention times at 3.30, 3.86, and 4.73 min, showing the presence of ester fatty acid compound. Further, these compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gas chromatography (GC), and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), which showed the presence of long-chain aliphatic fatty acid like eicosanoic acid with formation of oct-1-en-3-ol compounds attached.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChampia 3aactive ingredients 3aantifungal properties 3abioactive compounds 3achloroform 3aethyl acetate 3afatty acids 3afungi 3agas chromatography 3ahexane 3amacroalgae 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3athin layer chromatography 0aSeaweed 0aantifungal 0aeicosanoic acid 0aC. tropicalis1 aSubbiah, Murugesan1 aSivamurugan, Vajiravelu1 aRamu Ganesan, Abirami0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2019 Oct. 21, v. 28, no. 9 p.922-932dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2019.16639653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245027000172300001800442520168100460592002802141650002502169650001802194650001002212650002902222650002202251650003402273650004602307650001802353650004302371650002102414650001502435650002502450650002302475650001602498650001602514650001402530650000802544650001402552650001002566700002102576700001902597700002402616700002202640700002002662700002502682773010602707856008402813852000902897655001202906IND60112888720221121153642.0141111e20111014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011288872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRegalado, Erik L.10aIsolation and identification of phenolic compounds from rum aged in oak barrels by high-speed countercurrent chromatography/high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and screening for antioxidant activity  ap. 7358-7364.  aBeverages, especially wines are well-known to contain a variety of health-beneficial bioactive substances, mainly of phenolic nature which frequently exhibit antioxidant activity. Significant information is available about the separation and identification of polyphenols from some beverages by chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, but considerably poor is chemical data related to the polyphenolic content in rums. In this paper, a method involving the all-liquid chromatographic technique of high-speed countercurrent chromatography (HSCCC) combined with high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC–DAD–ESI-MSⁿ) has been successfully applied for separation and identification of phenolic compounds in an aged rum. Besides, the phenolic fraction (PF) was assayed for its antioxidant effects using three different free radical in vitro assays (DPPH, RO₂ and spontaneous lipid peroxidation (LPO) on brain homogenates) and on ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Results showed that PF potently scavenged DPPH and strongly scavenged peroxyl radicals compared to ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT); and almost equally inhibited LPO on brain homogenates subjected to spontaneous LPO when compared to quercetin. Moreover, PF also exhibited strong reducing power. This chemical analysis illustrates the rich array of phenols in the aged rum and represents a rapid and suitable method for the isolation and identification of phenolic compounds from mixtures of considerable complexity, achieving high purity and reproducibility with the use of two separation steps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3abrain 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3achemical analysis 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afree radicals 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro studies 3aionization 3aisolation techniques 3alipid peroxidation 3aoak barrels 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3arum 3ascreening 3awines1 aTolle, Sebastian1 aPino, Jorge A.1 aWinterhalter, Peter1 aMenendez, Roberto1 aMorales, Ana R.1 aRodríguez, José L.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Oct. 14, v. 1218, no. 41 p.7358-7364dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.08.0683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04609naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024003600127040001800163100002400181245009600205300001600301500002000317506002800337506003000365520247100395592002802866596008302894596007002977596004503047596007103092596003503163596004603198596003003244596006003274596005803334596003403392596004703426596004503473506003703518650002303555650001903578650002503597650002303622650001103645650001503656650001003671700005903681700002403740700002603764700001703790773012603807856007903933903002204012852000904034655001204043IND60629635220221207111548.0190202e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062963522DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2664.132652doi7 a10.1111/1365-2664.132652chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerigan, William J.10aCryptic wide‐ranging movements lead to upwardly biased occupancy in a territorial species  ap. 470-480.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aOccupancy modelling is useful for inferring population status and dynamics when occupancy reflects the presence of established individuals or populations, such as residents detected at breeding sites. However, if occupancy is assumed to reflect the presence of established residents but reflects transient movements from nonresidents at truly unoccupied sites, inferences about population status will be overly optimistic. In population monitoring, detections arising from dispersing or wide‐ranging individuals could be considered “false positives” because they do not reflect true contributions to local occupancy dynamics. The spotted owl Strix occidentalis is one of the most studied endangered species in the world and motivated the development of occupancy models to monitor populations. Because spotted owls are site‐faithful, it is assumed that detections within known breeding areas represent occupancy of established residents. We evaluated this assumption by (a) characterizing the extent to which GPS‐marked owls used multiple nest/roost areas, and (b) using detection/nondetection data to estimate the effect of false positive detections generated by wide‐ranging movements on occupancy. Thirty‐one of 36 GPS‐marked owls (86%) used nest/roost areas other than their own, and 11 owls (30%) used five or more. In occupancy analyses, 8% of all detections were confirmed to be false positives of colour‐marked wide‐ranging individuals and 20% of all detections were classified as “ambiguous” and, therefore, potential false positives. On average, failing to account for false positive detections upwardly biased occupancy by a factor of 1.29 (95% CI: 1.23–1.34). However, in the year following a large, severe fire that affected 30 of 84 owl nest/roost areas in our study area, failing to account for false positives upwardly biased occupancy by a factor of 1.65 (95% CI: 1.17–2.12). Synthesis and applications. If unrecognized or unaccounted for, “false positive” detections of wide‐ranging individuals outside their predicted territories can generate upward biases in occupancy and potentially mask effects of ecological disturbances. We recommend researchers minimize the potential for movement‐related false positive detections by developing study designs that reduce the frequency of such detections, excluding false positive detections using field data when possible, and explicitly modelling false positive errors.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlifedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006238  cDepartment of Water Resourcesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004813  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000202  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  cSierra Nevada Adaptive Management Project  cSierra Nevada Conservancy  cUSDA Forest Service, Pacific Southwest Research Station  cCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection  cUSDA Forest Service, Region 5  cCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife  cCalifornia Department of Water Resources0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStrix occidentalis 3abreeding sites 3aecological imbalance 3aendangered species 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anests1 aJones, Gavin M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5102-12291 aWhitmore, Sheila A.1 aGutiérrez, Ralph J.,1 aPeery, M.

Each granular sample was placed on the tube mouth of an open-type Helmholtz resonator. The resonant frequency was determined by measuring the electric impedance of a loudspeaker that was installed in the resonator and driven by a chirp signal linearly sweeping from 90 to 220 Hz for 6.0 s. For a changing sample layer thickness, the resonant frequency was measured, and the specific airflow resistance was calculated by measuring the static pressure drop required for N₂ gas to flow through the layer at a constant velocity of 0.042 m/s. When the thickness of the layer was fixed, the Helmholtz resonant frequency decreased as the specific airflow resistance increased, regardless of the kind of granular material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair flow 3abiochemistry 3abiotechnology 3abrown rice 3acorn 3aelectric impedance 3amouth 3asoybeans 3astatic pressure 0aHelmholtz resonance 0aspecific airflow resistance 0alayer of granular material 0adissipation of acoustic energy1 aTomatsu, Eiji1 aKatsuno, Nakako0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 81, no. 4 p.823-830dTaylor & FranciswJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09168451.2017.12817273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012100172300001600293520119500309592002801504650001401532650002201546650002101568650002401589650000901613650002101622650000701643650003301650650002001683650001601703650001401719653001301733653001301746653001401759653002801773653002401801700002101825700001901846700003001865773013901895856008602034852000902120655001202129IND60672022620221116144605.0191128e20191021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067202262DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2019.16656032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugiono, Sugiono10aStructural and Rheological Characteristics of Alginate from Sargassum cristaefolium Extracted by Twin Screw Extruder  ap. 944-959.  aThis study aimed to investigate the effects of process extrusion on the characteristics of Sargassum cristaefolium sodium alginate (SCSA) extracted using twin-screw extruder. Box-Behnken Design (BBD) from response surface methodology (RSM) was established to understand the effects of temperature, screw speed, and pH on the multiple-responses of alginate characteristics including intrinsic viscosity, yield, and molecular weight. The results revealed that temperature, screw speed, and pH significantly affected (P < .05) all responses. The optimum extraction condition was found at temperature of 58.18°C, screw speed of 77.99 rpm, and pH 10.11. At this condition, the response of residence time distribution was 7.07 ± 0.029 min, yield of 34.01 ± 0.12%, intrinsic viscosity of 460.13 ± 14.75 mL/g, and molecular weight of 217.94 ± 7.14 × 10³ g/mol. This alginate had mannuronic acid to guluronic acid (M/G) ratio of 0.28, and the L-guluronic acid block was 0.78, which was higher than the D-mannuronic acid block. Rheological characterization of SCSA in aqueous solution was shear-thinning pseudoplastic, and alginate gel in 1 M CaCl₂ was more elastic than liquid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSargassum 3aaqueous solutions 3acalcium chloride 3aexperimental design 3agels 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3asodium alginate 3atemperature 3aviscosity 0aAlginate 0arheology 0aM/G ratio 0aSargassum cristaefolium 0atwin-screw extruder1 aMasruri, Masruri1 aEstiasih, Teti1 aWidjarnako, Simon Bambang0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2019 Oct. 21, v. 28, no. 9 p.944-959dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl47704x1547-06367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2019.16656033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245006500169300001600234520150600250592002801756650002501784650001901809650001501828650003301843650001501876650002201891653003601913653001901949653001701968653002001985653002002005700002502025700001602050700002602066700002602092700001702118773011202135856008502247852000902332655001202341IND60561872420221119161030.0180830e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056187242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, John10aReal-time direct detection of silica scaling on RO membranes  ap. 346-358.  aSilica scaling of RO membranes was evaluated via real-time direct surface imaging demonstrating a capability for detecting the onset of silica scale formation and its evolution. Silica scaling was detected significantly earlier than by traditional flux decline measurements. The observed rate of silica particle nucleation followed classical nucleation theory while the growth of individual silica particles, at the early stages of silica scaling, was governed by diffusional growth. SEM and optical images of the membrane surface suggest that silica scaling occurs through the formation of both primary silica particles and their agglomerates (~1–30µm), as well as a gel-like silica film embedded with silica particles both of which contribute to permeate flux decline. At low silica saturation index at the membrane surface (SIm≤1.93) silica gel film formation resulted in a smoother and less porous film than at higher silica saturation (SIm≥2.72). At the higher silica saturation levels (SIm=2.72–3.50), silica scaling resulted in larger observed particles as well as rapid permeate flux decline. The silica scale layer thickness was in the range of ~0.1–3.5µm, with surface roughness being higher by a factor of 2.6–8.3 relative to the native membrane. Results of the present study suggest that there is merit in exploring the application of the present approach for early detection and monitoring of silica scaling in RO plants in support of strategies for silica scale mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3aimage analysis 3amonitoring 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica gel 3asurface roughness 0aDirect membrane surface imaging 0aSilica scaling 0aFlux decline 0aReverse osmosis 0aScale detection1 aRahardianto, Anditya1 aKim, Soomin1 aVēlāyutan̲, T.

However, their deployment and operative costs limit their implementation in harsh environments, such as the ones presented in the high Andean wetlands. In this context, this work presents a framework to monitor cost-effectively high Andean wetlands using a multi-agent approach based on: field testing, UAV orthomosaics, and satellite imagery. The method developed comprises two stages: i) definition of the monitoring agent (field testing, satellite, UAV) and ii) image processing. For these stages, semi-empirical and statistical models, which were developed in previous works are incorporated in an open-source framework to tailor each monitoring approach accordingly to the seasonality of a representative Andean wetland. The application of the method and its results highlight the suitability of using visual spectrum low-cost remote sensing approach to compute wetlands saturation percentage. In addition, the methodology proposed allowed the development of a temporal monitoring scheme, where the viability of each monitoring agent is examined. In order to validate the method, field data and multispectral imagery were employed using as case of study the Pugllohuma wetland located in the Antisana Reserve. Thus, the main contribution of this work lies in establishing a technified monitoring framework for the Ecuadorian high Andean wetlands, which can be scaled up and extrapolated to other wetlands with similar harsh environmental conditions, helping to their management and protection policies decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adata collection 3adecision making 3amultispectral imagery 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aviability 3awetlands 3aAndes region 0aHigh Andean wetlands 0aUAVs 0aSatellite 0aMonitoring 0aImage processing1 aChangoluisa, Iván1 aPalma, Kevin1 aCruz, Patricio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3026-79801 aValencia, Deyanira1 aAyala, Paul1 aHidalgo, Victor1 aQuisi, Diego1 aJara, Nelson1 aPuga, Diana0 tHeliyon.g2022 Mar., v. 8, no. 3 p.e09054-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e090543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009800169300001600267500001900283520142600302592002801728650001901756650001901775650002401794650002701818650001101845650001201856650001301868650004901881650001301930653002001943653001801963653003001981653002802011653002502039653000902064653000902073653000902082653001802091653002202109653002102131653002002152653002202172653000802194653000802202653000702210700002202217700002202239700001802261700002602279700002302305700002602328700002302354700001702377700002902394700001602423773009002439856008502529852000902614655001202623IND60725957220221116231713.0210219e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072595722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2020.12.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Mandeep10aHeteroarene-fused anthraquinone derivatives as potential modulators for human aurora kinase B  ap. 152-165.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe quest for effective anticancer therapeutics continues to be extensively pursued. Over the past century, several drugs have been developed, however, a majority of these drugs have a poor therapeutic index and increased toxicity profile. Hence, there still exists ample opportunity to discover safe and effective anticancer drugs. Aurora Kinase B (AurB), a member of the Aurora kinase family and a key regulator of mitotic cell division, is found to be frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and has thus emerged as an attractive target for the design of anticancer therapeutics. In the present study, a structure-based scaffold hopping approach was utilized to modify the heterocyclic moiety of (S)-3-(3-aminopyrrolidine-1-carbonyl)-4,11-dihydroxy-2-methylanthra [2,3-b]furan-5,10-dione (anthrafuran 1) to generate a series of heteroarene-fused anthraquinone derivatives, which were then subjected to virtual screening for the identification of potential AurB inhibitors. The obtained hits were subsequently synthesized and evaluated by using a combination of in silico and biophysical techniques for elucidating their in vitro binding and inhibition activity with recombinantly expressed AurB. Four identified hits presented an improved binding profile as compared to their parent analog anthrafuran 1. One derivative, anthrathiophene 2 demonstrated excellent in vitro inhibition of AurB (7.3 μM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthraquinones 3acancer therapy 3acomputer simulation 3aheterocyclic compounds 3ahumans 3amitosis 3amoieties 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3atoxicity 0aAurora kinase B 0aAnthraquinone 0aProtein kinase inhibitors 0aBiolayer interferometry 0aCell viability assay 0aAurB 0aAurA 0aAurC 0aanthrafuran 1 0aanthrathiophene 2 0anaphthoisatine 3 0anaphthoindole 4 0aanthraimidazole 5 0aTrp 0aBLI 0aMD1 aMalhotra, Lakshay1 aHaque, Md Anzarul1 aMukesh Kumar,1 aTikhomirov, Alexander1 aLitvinova, Valeria1 aKorolev, Alexander M.1 aEthayathulla, A.S.1 aDas, Uddipan1 aShchekotikhin, Andrey E.1 aKaur, Punit0 tBiochimie.g2021 Mar., v. 182 p.152-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.12.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245015900177300001600336520091900352592002801271650001201299650001901311650001701330650001101347650001401358650001501372650001801387650002101405650000901426653001701435653001201452653000801464653001401472700002701486773009001513856008501603852000901688655001201697IND60581755620221117201954.0180830e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058175562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Lera, Susana10aOn the development of a wood gasification modelling approach with special emphasis on primary devolatilization and tar formation and destruction phenomena  ap. 643-652.  aTar generation in biomass gasification still poses a considerable challenge regarding its access to commercial stage. Along with experimental research, it is essential to develop comprehensive models of the process that allow accurate prediction of the resulting syngas composition, as well as tar generation. Traditionally, models have focused on defining heterogeneous reactions of char conversion, devoting limited attention to gas interactions. The present research offers a new wood gasification model for fluidized beds, characterized by a detailed definition of homogeneous reactions, considering both generation and evolution of created tar through oxidation, reforming and thermal cracking. The model succeeds in predicting gas generation, composition and heating value with a relative error similar or lower than analogue existing gasification models, as well as the order of magnitude of tar generation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3afluidized beds 3agasification 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aprediction 3asynthesis gas 3athermal cracking 3awood 0aGasification 0aBiomass 0aTar 0aModelling1 aPallarés Ranz, Javier0 tEnergy.g2016 Oct. 15, v. 113 p.643-652dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.07.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245006100210500001900271520075900290592002801049650001901077650002001096650001901116650001301135650001701148650001201165653001101177653001001188653001201198653001201210653001901222653001101241700005701252773009501309856008701404852000901491655001201500IND60732794320221119233916.0210423e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073279432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Ashish1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6682-429410aHost-virus interactions mediated by long non-coding RNAs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aViruses are obligate pathogens that cause a wide range of diseases across all kingdoms of life. They have a colossal impact on the economy and healthcare infrastructure world-wide. Plants and animals have developed sophisticated molecular mechanisms to defend themselves against viruses and viruses in turn hijack host mechanisms to ensure their survival inside their hosts. Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs have emerged as important macromolecules that regulate plant-virus and animal-virus interactions. Both pro-viral and anti-viral lncRNAs have been reported and they show immense potential to be used as markers and in therapeutics. The current review is focussed on the recent developments that have been made in viral interactions of animals and plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal viruses 3ahealth services 3ainfrastructure 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3aviruses 0aLncRNA 0aVirus 0aLincRNA 0aViroids 0aSub-viral RNAs 0asgRNAs1 aPrasad, Manoj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0691-01630 tVirus research.g2021 June, v. 298 p.198402-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010800170300001800278520153500296592002801831653003301859653002001892653001401912653001301926653002001939653003101959773011501990856008302105852000902188655001202197IND60128672320221120104559.0151116e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012867232DNAL7 a10.1644/05-MAMM-A-430R1.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinarelli, John A.10aEstimation of endocranial volume through the use of external skull measures in the carnivora (mammalia)  ap. 1027-1036.  aAllometric relationships of brain and body size in the mammalian order Carnivora have been studied with respect to the pattern and timing of brain-size evolution and aspects of life history, adaptation, and ecology. Analyses of character evolution are aided by inclusion of relevant fossil data; however, endocranial volumes for fossil taxa have been limited to a few cases of extraordinary preservation, reducing the power of analyses. A method for estimating the volume of the brain from external braincase measurements of extant carnivorans is developed here. Multiple linear regression, combined with Akaike information criterion––based model averaging, was employed to predict endocranial volume from 3 external skull measures for 825 museum specimens of 126 extant terrestrial taxa spanning the Carnivora. The AIC-averaged model accurately predicted endocranial volumes for carnivoran taxa (R² == 0.983), and the results were robust to potential sampling problems. Moreover, the model did not reflect phylogenetic autocorrelation, nor did it represent an induced correlation due to a general body-size scaling. Rather, the averaged model was an accurate predictor of brain volume that should be easily extendable to the carnivoran fossil record, and additionally can be generalized to construct similar models for a broad range of mammalian clades. This in turn will allow comparative studies within and among distantly related mammalian lineages and reconstructions of brain volumes for a diverse array of fossil taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAkaike information criterion 0abrain allometry 0aCarnivora 0aMammalia 0amodel-averaging 0amultiple linear regression0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2006 Oct., v. 87, no. 5 p.1027-1036dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F05-MAMM-A-430R1.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014800170300001200318500001900330520105100349592002801400596004101428650002101469650001501490650001501505650000801520650001801528650001501546650001901561650001101580650001701591650000701608650001901615650002301634650001701657650001601674650001901690650001001709700001701719700002801736700002201764700002101786773014101807856008301948852000902031655001202040IND60733025820221116161225.0210430e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073302582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-021-05090-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunay Gurer, Ayse10aAdsorption Isotherms, Thermodynamics, and Kinetic Modeling of Methylene Blue onto Novel Carbonaceous Adsorbent Derived from Bitter Orange Peels  ap. 138.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis work reports the production of activated carbons (AC) from bitter orange peel by using ZnCl₂ or H₃PO₄ as activating agent at two different carbonization temperatures (450 °C and 550 °C). Surface morphology analyses of produced bitter orange activated carbons (BOACs) were done by SEM. The surface areas of the produced BOACs, functional groups on the AC surfaces and compositions, were determined by using BET, FT-IR, and TGA analyses. Furthermore, their application for the removal of methylene blue (MB) was studied. The parameters affecting adsorption, such as pH and temperature, were evaluated. BOAC produced with ZnCl₂ at 550 °C, exhibits the highest surface area (1450.6 m² g⁻¹), whereas BOAC produced with ZnCl₂ at 450 °C yielded with the highest adsorption capacity (108.9 m² g⁻¹). Langmuir isotherm shows a good fit for the BOACs. Adsorption kinetics were studied and follows pseudo-second-kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameter studies indicate that the adsorption process is endothermic and spontaneous.  aPublisher supplied data  aFBA-2016-1961cAkdeniz Üniversitesi 3aCitrus aurantium 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aair 3acarbonization 3aendothermy 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3aorange peels 3apH 3asoil pollution 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3awater1 aAktas, Kemal1 aOzkaleli Akcetin, Merve1 aErdem Unsar, Ayca1 aAsilturk, Meltem0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2021 Apr., v. 232, no. 4 p.138-138dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-021-05090-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03144naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012600166300001400292520149800306592002801804650001801832650002801850650001101878650001101889650002201900650002001922650001201942650001701954650001801971650001701989650001202006650001202018650002802030650002402058650001802082650001102100650002202111650001402133650001402147653002102161653001702182653001902199653001602218653003202234653003902266700001702305700001402322700001502336700001502351773011802366856008502484852000902569655001202578IND60540450620221120142122.0190318e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054045062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, YongAn10aSublethal effects of the chitin synthesis inhibitor, hexaflumuron, in the cotton mirid bug, Apolygus lucorum (Meyer-Dür)  ap. 43-50.  aHexaflumuron is a type of benzoylphenylurea insecticide which is highly toxic for many insects. Sublethal doses of hexaflumuron have been shown to significantly affect insect growth and development. However, the action mechanism of hexaflumuron is not well understood. In the present study, first instar Apolygus lucorum nymphs were exposed to sublethal doses of hexaflumuron based on the estimated 120h acute LC50 valve of 20.53mg/ml. We found that exposure to sublethal hexaflumuron doses resulted in a significant increase in development time and reduced the weights of fifth instar A. lucorum nymphs. We also measured trehalose, which is a primary blood sugar in insects, and the enzyme trehalase that is involved in energy metabolism. Trehalose content in first instar nymphs significantly increased following hexaflumuron treatment while the glucose content, soluble trehalase activity and expression levels of ALTre-1 mRNA decreased significantly. However, no significant changes in membrane-bound trehalase activity and ALTre-2 mRNA expression were observed. In addition, these decreases or increases could be correlated to increases in treatment time or concentration of hexaflumuron, respectively. The present findings indicated that sublethal doses of hexaflumuron could interfere the normal carbohydrate metabolism by depressing the expression of ALTre-1 in A. lucorum, which provide valuable information on the physiology and molecular mechanisms for the toxicity of hexaflumuron.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3achitin 3acotton 3aenergy metabolism 3agene expression 3aglucose 3ahexaflumuron 3ainsect growth 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alethal concentration 50 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3anymphs 3asublethal effects 3atrehalase 3atrehalose 0aApolygus lucorum 0aHexaflumuron 0aAcute toxicity 0aDevelopment 0aSoluble trehalase (ALTre-1) 0aMembrane-bound trehalase (ALTre-2)1 aXiao, LiuBin1 aSun, Yang1 aZhao, Jing1 aBai, LiXin0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2014 May, v. 111 p.43-50dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2014.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245016300171300001800334500001900352500001100371520118800382592002801570650001801598650001101616650002801627650002501655650001501680650001601695650001901711700005801730700001701788700002201805773012301827856008301950852000902033655001202042IND60736596220221116142528.0210514e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073659622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11947-021-02646-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajumder, Prasanta10aDrying of Selected Major Spices: Characteristics and Influencing Parameters, Drying Technologies, Quality Retention and Energy Saving, and Mathematical Models  ap. 1028-1054.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aDemand for value-added spices all year round has warranted suitable post-harvest processing, since most are non-perennial by nature and perishable owing to enzymatic or maillard reactions and pathogenic microbial contamination. Drying involves the minimization of biologically active water up to the safe water activity level and increases the shelf life. An optimized drying technique is needed to be chosen critically because one particular drying condition suitable for a group of spices may be detrimental for others. Therefore, the current review emphasizes the permissible ranges of influencing operating parameters, comparative effects of several drying technologies on drying characteristics, and quality attributes of spices. The paper also provided an up-to-date technological advancement in novel hybrid and staged drying to alleviate the shortcomings of a solo drying technique. As drying is an energy-intensive process, pre-drying treatments and intermittent phenomena have also been explored for energy saving with better quality retention. The paper also highlights the significance of thin layer modeling for predicting the moisture transport phenomena during drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioprocessing 3aenergy 3amicrobial contamination 3amoisture diffusivity 3ashelf life 3avalue added 3awater activity1 aSinha, Abhijit1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3264-63191 aGupta, Rajat1 aSablani, Shyam S.0 tFood and bioprocess technology.g2021 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.1028-1054dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4235020x1935-51307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11947-021-02646-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005600149245007400205506011700279506007600396520152200472592002801994506003702022650001102059650001402070650001802084650001602102650001202118650001702130653001702147653001902164653001702183653001502200653000702215700001702222700002102239700002202260773010902282856008402391852000902475655001202484IND60780431920221207114410.0220704e202302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078043192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atech.2022.1000792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyck, George1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5920-124010aDigital Twins: A novel traceability concept for post-harvest handling  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDigital Twins are a novel approach to systems engineering that can help control complex environments and interface humans with them. This is achieved by digitally mirroring a physical asset to provide historical data, monitoring, and predictions of future states. While there are a few applications of Digital Twins to agriculture, none exist for post-harvest grain handling. However, there have been past attempts at integrating computer assistance in grain quality, called expert systems. These systems were largely abandoned due to their inability to keep operators in the loop and the inadequacy of sensors available during the time of expert systems research. By utilizing Digital Twins and modern post-harvest sensors, operators can be provided with a digital representation of inventory and the quality of grain as it moves throughout a facility. This virtual representation also presents a unique opportunity to enhance market traceability. This review focuses on (1) expert systems, their history, and limitations, (2) the history of Digital Twins and their applicability to grain storage and handling, (3) unit operations and the sensors that are common to grain handling facilities, (4) mathematical and computer models to simulate grain handling operations, and (5) a conceptualization of post-harvest Digital Twins, which identifies research gaps where critical questions should be answered if Digital Twins technology is to be considered a logical contender for traceability of commodities post-harvest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aassets 3acomputers 3agrain quality 3ainventories 3amarkets 3atraceability 0aDigital twin 0aGrain elevator 0aPost-harvest 0aMonitoring 0aDT1 aHawley, Eric1 aHildebrand, Kurt1 aPaliwal, Jitendra0 tSmart agricultural technology.g2023 Feb., v. 3 p.100079-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28528x2772-37557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atech.2022.1000793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013500170300001800305520116300323592002801486653002601514653001801540653001601558653002801574653002701602653001801629653002401647773011501671856008301786852000901869655001201878IND60128672820221120104723.0151116e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012867282DNAL7 a10.1644/05-MAMM-A-209R3.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallace, Steven C.10aDifferentiating microtus xanthognathus and microtus pennsylvanicus lower first molars using discriminant analysis of landmark data  ap. 1261-1269.  aThe distinct ecological requirements of Microtus xanthognathus (yellow-cheeked vole or taiga vole) and M. pennsylvanicus (meadow vole) warrant accurate discrimination of their remains in studies of paleoecology and past biogeographical shifts. An occlusal length of the lower 1st molars (m1) that is >3.2 mm for M. xanthognathus is the method most frequently used to separate these 2 taxa in archaeological and paleontological samples. However, these measurements alone are unreliable because some specimens of M. pennsylvanicus overlap smaller individuals of M. xanthognathus in size. Therefore, I created and tested a morphometric technique that discriminates Recent lower 1st molars (m1s) of M. pennsylvanicus from those of M. xanthognathus, and is applicable to other taxa (both modern and fossil). Despite overlapping occlusal length, my discriminant function based on landmark data correctly classified 100%% (n == 53) of Recent m1s from the 2 taxa and 97.7%% (43 of 44) of (assumed) m1s of M. pennsylvanicus from an archaeological site from about AD 1200 in central Nebraska. This landmark scheme is applicable to fossil and modern Microtus worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 0adiscriminant function 0alandmark data 0ameadow vole 0aMicrotus pennsylvanicus 0aMicrotus xanthognathus 0amorphometrics 0ayellow-cheeked vole0 tJournal of mammalogy.g2006 Dec., v. 87, no. 6 p.1261-1269dAmerican Society of Mammalogists.x1545-15427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1644%2F05-MAMM-A-209R3.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02706naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245015400172500001900326520124700345592002801592650002601620650001901646650001701665650001301682650002901695650001801724650004301742650001301785650001601798653003001814653002401844653002601868653003201894700002301926700002201949700002701971700002301998700006002021773009502081856008702176852000902263655001202272IND60732794720221119232541.0210423e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073279472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeuchi, Ippei10aAnalyses of propagation processes of Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophages S13′ and S25-3 in two different taxonomies by definitive screening design  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo introduce phage therapy against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Western medicine, the establishment of phage manufacturing, particularly phage propagation, is indispensable. For the propagation of S. aureus phages, knowledge of the effects of phage types, process parameters, and analytical methodologies should be investigated. In this study, S. aureus phage propagations were studied in a flask with a new class of design of experiments, definitive screening design, using S. aureus phages S13′ and S25-3 in different taxonomies. Four process parameters, namely, multiplicity of infection, bacterial density at infection, time of harvest, and temperature, were evaluated with the regression models based on the phage concentration data measured using plaque assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. As a result, phage propagations measured using plaque assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were overall similar to each other in the case of phage S13′, while they differed in the case of phage S25-3. These results suggest that the propagation processes need to be developed according to phage type, and the choice of methodologies for phage concentration measurements should be carefully considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteriophages 3aharvest date 3amedicine 3amultiple drug resistance 3aphage therapy 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3atemperature 0aBacteriophage propagation 0aProcess development 0aDesign of experiments 0aDefinitive screening design1 aNasukawa, Tadahiro1 aSugimoto, Ryosuke1 aTakemura-Uchiyama, Iyo1 aMurakami, Hironobu1 aUchiyama, Jumpei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0846-01000 tVirus research.g2021 June, v. 298 p.198406-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1984063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011600168300001800284520067300302592002800975596005901003596009801062650002101160650003001181650002301211650002601234650002401260650001401284650001801298650002201316650004401338650001401382650001801396653001701414653002101431653002401452653002501476700001901501700001601520773012501536856008501661852000901746655001201755IND60672023320221116144646.0191008e20191202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067202332DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14753892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Haolun12aA new diketopiperazine isolated from a Nocardiopsis strain TRM20105 guided by bioassay against Candida albicans  ap. 3421-3425.  aAn actinomycete strain TRM20105 with antifungal activity was identified as Nocardiopsis dassonvillei subsp. dassonvillei DSM43111 (98.34% similarity) by 16S rDNA phylogenetic analysis and morphology observation.

Performance of their colonies depends on pollen and nectar as food resources, but flowering plants are scarce in modern agricultural landscapes. It is well‐known that semi‐natural habitats can enhance floral resources and bumblebee abundance, but the impact of different crop types and their heterogeneity at the landscape scale remains unclear. We tested the effect of two different crop types (oilseed rape [OSR] and maize) and of configurational (field border density) and compositional heterogeneity (crop diversity) on weight gain of buff‐tailed bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris) and the pollen diversity collected by them in 20 landscapes in Central Germany. We found that augmenting maize cover had a detrimental effect on pollen diversity collected by bumblebees, probably due to intensive management resulting in low plant diversity. This low pollen diversity translated into reduced colony growth, since colonies with high pollen diversity gained more weight than colonies with low pollen diversity. In contrast, OSR cover and configurational and compositional heterogeneity did neither affect colony growth nor pollen diversity. However, for OSR, the timing of the flowering period was important. When OSR fields had a high flower cover at the end of the OSR blooming period, colonies showed increased growth rates. Synthesis and applications. Our results complement previous laboratory studies by showing that high pollen diversity leads to better colony performance under field conditions. Therefore, the maintenance of floral diversity in agricultural landscapes is crucial to ensure that bumblebees can fulfil their nutritional needs. However, the heterogeneity of crops, at least under the currently very low levels of crop rotation, does not contribute to this aim. In contrast, crop identity and timing of mass‐flowering crops turned out to be important factors, as maize reduced pollen resources, while late blooming oilseed rape (OSR) was beneficial to bumblebee colonies. Hence, maize cover per landscape should be reduced and strategies to enhance landscape wide flower diversity, especially towards and after the end of oilseed rape bloom, should be promoted to support bumblebee colonies that provide important pollination services.  aPublisher supplied data  aFKZ: 01LC1104AcFederal Ministry of Education and Research 3aBombus terrestris 3aBrassica napus 3aagricultural land 3acorn 3acrop rotation 3acrops 3aflowering 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3anectar 3anutrient requirements 3apollen 3apollination 3apollinators 3aspecies diversity 3awild plants 3aGermany1 aBrachmann, Lara1 aBatáry, Péter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1017-69961 aClough, Yann1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2901-76021 aBehling, Hermann1 aTscharntke, Teja0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2019 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.294-304dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.132963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014600166300001600312520125300328592002801581650002501609650001201634650001801646650002001664650001501684650002001699653003401719653002601753653004301779653002101822653002901843700001601872700001601888700001701904700001701921773011201938856008502050852000902135655001202144IND60561873220221119160902.0180830e20170415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056187322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xianhui10aIn-situ monitoring techniques for membrane fouling and local filtration characteristics in hollow fiber membrane processes: A critical review  ap. 187-200.  aMembrane fouling is the most serious challenge in the hollow fiber microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) processes. A number of in-situ monitoring techniques including optical and non-optical probes have been developed so that membrane fouling is better understood and controlled. This will help advance the membrane technology. In addition, the local filtration hydrodynamics wield a great influence on the membrane fouling formation and system operation stability. State-of-the-art in-situ monitoring techniques for membrane fouling and local filtration characteristics in hollow fiber MF/UF processes are critically reviewed. The principles and applications of these techniques are addressed in order to assess their strengths. This study demonstrated that the real-time observation techniques mainly focus on idealized laboratory apparatus and little on commercial membrane modules. Consequently, more attention should be paid to the development of simple and effective methods or integrated detecting technology so as to satisfy the real status of hollow fiber filtration processes and the optimization of membrane module. On the basis of this review, future analyses considering practical requirements are suggested as R&D priorities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3afouling 3ahydrodynamics 3amicrofiltration 3amonitoring 3aultrafiltration 0aIn-situ monitoring techniques 0aHollow fiber membrane 0aMicro- and ultra- filtration processes 0aMembrane fouling 0aFiltration hydrodynamics1 aMo, Yinghiu1 aLi, Jianxin1 aGuo, Wenshan1 aNgo, Huu Hao0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Apr. 15, v. 528 p.187-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.01.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02348naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013700172300001800309520065200327592002800979650001101007650002501018650002001043650002201063650001801085650001601103650001801119650001501137650001501152650001401167650003901181651001101220653002101231653001901252653002501271653001801296700002501314700003101339700002301370700003101393700002601424700002201450700002201472700002401494700002601518700002201544700002101566773012501587856008501712852000901797655001201806IND60672023420221116144606.0191008e20191202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067202342DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2018.14771432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZago, Adriana M.12aA phytochemical study of the Cuphea glutinosa from Southern Brazil: Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase activity inhibition and antioxidant properties  ap. 3426-3431.  aThis study investigated the antioxidant activity of Cuphea glutinosa (CG) and its effect on Na⁺, K⁺-ATPase from cardiac muscle.

First, we chemically modified carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) to sulfated carboxymethylcellulose (sCMC) to impart native-like electrostatic interaction-based binding of cationic proteins. We then fabricated cartilage ECM mimicking sCMC-gelatin scaffolds which showed preferential binding and sustained delivery of Timp3. This scaffold-mediated delivery of Timp3 demonstrated a reduction in matrix degradation, protease expression and inflammatory markers in the goat ex vivo OA model leading to enhanced retention of cartilage ECM markers when compared to OA control. Further, similar results were obtained when sCMC-gelatin scaffolds were evaluated using human OA samples, supporting its clinical potential. Overall, the Timp3 loaded sCMC-gelatin scaffold shows potential as a treatment approach for OA.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acartilage 3agoats 3ahumans 3ametalloproteinases 3amodels 3aosteoarthritis 3atherapeutics 0asCMC 0aTimp3 0aGel-S 0aDMOADs 0aECM 0aMMP 0aSulfated carboxymethylcellulose (sCMC) 0aSulfated carboxymethylcellulose-gelatin scaffold 0aScaffold mediated Timp3 delivery 0aGoat ex vivo osteoarthritis (OA) model 0aDisease modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) 0aOsteoarthritis treatment1 aKatti, Dhirendra S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 July 01, v. 212 p.54-66dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.05.0933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245012100205300001800326506007600344520141700420592002801837506003701865650001801902650001801920650001701938650001001955650001901965650001901984650001202003650001302015650001902028650003802047650001602085650001702101650001002118650002002128650000902148650001302157650001302170650001802183650002102201650001802222650002202240650001202262650001302274650001302287700003102300700003002331700002102361700002202382700003202404773013302436856007302569852000902642655001202651IND60649889520221207111246.0190707e20140321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064988952DNAL7 a10.3390/nu60311942doi7 aPMC39671872pmcid7 a246621632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukongviriyapan, Upa10aCurcumin Protects against Cadmium-Induced Vascular Dysfunction, Hypertension and Tissue Cadmium Accumulation in Mice  ap. 1194-1208.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCurcumin from turmeric is commonly used worldwide as a spice and has been demonstrated to possess various biological activities. This study investigated the protective effect of curcumin on a mouse model of cadmium (Cd)—induced hypertension, vascular dysfunction and oxidative stress. Male ICR mice were exposed to Cd (100 mg/L) in drinking water for eight weeks. Curcumin (50 or 100 mg/kg) was intragastrically administered in mice every other day concurrently with Cd. Cd induced hypertension and impaired vascular responses to phenylephrine, acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside. Curcumin reduced the toxic effects of Cd and protected vascular dysfunction by increasing vascular responsiveness and normalizing the blood pressure levels. The vascular protective effect of curcumin in Cd exposed mice is associated with up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) protein, restoration of glutathione redox ratio and alleviation of oxidative stress as indicated by decreasing superoxide production in the aortic tissues and reducing plasma malondialdehyde, plasma protein carbonyls, and urinary nitrate/nitrite levels. Curcumin also decreased Cd accumulation in the blood and various organs of Cd-intoxicated mice. These findings suggest that curcumin, due to its antioxidant and chelating properties, is a promising protective agent against hypertension and vascular dysfunction induced by Cd.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylcholine 3aanimal models 3aantioxidants 3ablood 3ablood pressure 3ablood proteins 3acadmium 3acurcumin 3adrinking water 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3aglutathione 3ahypertension 3amales 3amalondialdehyde 3amice 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitroprusside 3aoxidative stress 3aphenylephrine 3aprotective effect 3atissues 3atoxicity 3aturmeric1 aPannangpetch, Patchareewan1 aKukongviriyapan, Veerapol1 aDonpunha, Wanida1 aSompamit, Kwanjit1 aSurawattanawan, Praphassorn0 tNutrients.g2014 Mar. 21, v. 6, no. 3 p.1194-1208dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60311943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245018300168300001600351520159400367592002801961650001901989650001402008650001702022650001002039650001702049650001802066650001602084650001402100650002102114650001702135650001302152653003202165653002602197653003002223653001702253653001702270653002102287700001802308700002102326700002202347700001902369700002002388700001702408700002202425700002102447700002102468700002202489700002002511700002002531700002202551700001502573700001702588773011302605856008602718852000902804655001202813IND60732795120221119232248.0211114e20210510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073279512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhas, Namdev10aStimuli responsive and receptor targeted iron oxide based nanoplatforms for multimodal therapy and imaging of cancer: Conjugation chemistry and alternative therapeutic strategies  ap. 188-245.  aCancer being one of the most precarious and second most fatal diseases evokes opportunities for multimodal delivery platforms which will act synergistically for efficient cancer treatment. Multifunctional iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (IONPs) are being studied for few decades and still attracting increasing attention for several biomedical applications owing to their multifunctional design and intrinsic magnetic properties that provide a multimodal theranostic platform for cancer therapy, monitoring and diagnosis. The review article aims to provide brief information on various surface chemistries involved in modulating IONPs properties to exhibit potential therapy in cancer treatment. The review addresses structural, magnetic, thermal and optical properties of IONPs which aids in the fabrication of efficient multimodal nanoplatform in cancer therapy. The review discussed the pharmacokinetics of IONPs and attributes influencing them. This review inculcates recent advancements in therapies, focused on tumor-microenvironment-responsive and targeted therapy along with their eminent role in cancer diagnosis. The concept of stimuli-responsive including endogenous, exogenous and dual/multi stimuli-based delivery platform demonstrated significantly enhanced anticancer therapy. Several therapeutic approaches viz. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, hyperthermia, gene therapy, sonodynamic therapy, photothermal, photodynamic-based therapy along with biosensing and several toxicity aspects of IONPs have been addressed in this review for effective cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3achemistry 3adrug therapy 3afever 3agene therapy 3aimmunotherapy 3airon oxides 3amagnetism 3apharmacokinetics 3aradiotherapy 3atoxicity 0aMicroenvironment-responsive 0aConjugation chemistry 0aSurface functionalization 0aPhototherapy 0aRadiotherapy 0aToxicity aspects1 aKudarha, Ritu1 aPandey, Abhijeet1 aNikam, Ajinkya N.1 aSharma, Shilpa1 aSingh, Ashutosh1 aGarkal, Atul1 aHariharan, Kartik1 aSingh, Amanpreet1 aBangar, Priyanka1 aYadhav, Dattatray1 aParikh, Dhaivat1 aSawant, Krutika1 aMutalik, Srinivas1 aGarg, Neha1 aMehta, Tejal0 tJournal of controlled release.g2021 May 10, v. 333 p.188-245dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04193naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002000192245009100212506007600303520140800379536054601787592002802333596006602361596011602427596008102543596006602624596005102690506003702741650002502778650002002803650001202823650001802835650001602853650001002869650001702879650001902896650001602915650001202931650001102943650001802954650002102972650000902993650001903002650003203021650002203053650002103075653001203096653001903108653002603127653001803153700002103171700002003192700002003212700002103232700002203253700001803275773011903293856008503412961001303497852000903510655001203519IND60691031020221207070557.0200427e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069103102DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2018.14643612doi7 aPMC61032832pmcid7 a297015412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYurchenko, Olga10aResponse of high leaf-oil Arabidopsis thaliana plant lines to biotic or abiotic stress  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies have shown that it is possible to engineer substantial increases in triacylglycerol (TAG) content in plant vegetative biomass, which offers a novel approach for increasing the energy density of food, feed, and bioenergy crops or for creating a sink for the accumulation of unusual, high-value fatty acids. However, whether or not these changes in lipid metabolism affect plant responses to biotic and/or abiotic stresses is an open question. Here we show that transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plant lines engineered for elevated leaf oil content, as well as lines engineered for accumulation of unusual conjugated fatty acids in leaf oil, had similar short-term responses to heat stress (e.g., 3 days at 37°C) as wild-type plants, including a reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-containing polar lipids and an increase in PUFA-containing neutral lipids. At extended time periods (e.g., 14 days at 37°C), however, plant lines containing accumulated conjugated fatty acids displayed earlier senescence and plant death. Further, no-choice feeding studies demonstrated that plants with the highest leaf oil content generated cabbage looper (Trichoplusia ni) insects with significantly heavier body weights. Taken together, these results suggest that biotic and abiotic responses will be important considerations when developing and deploying high-oil-biomass crops in the field.  aThis work was supported by grants from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Science, BES-Physical Biosciences program (DE-SC0016536), the National Science Foundation (IOS-1557439), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (217291-2013).

The aim of this study was to regenerate an integrated LTB interface by inoculating LTB-relevant cells, isolated from fibrocartilage (FC) or ligament (LIG), separately into each designated region in a single porous cylindrical PLCL scaffold. An injectable, heparin-based hydrogel that has proved to be effective in the culture of chondrocytes as well as the sustained release of growth factor was employed to locally deliver fibrochondrocytes and osteoinductive bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) into the FC region, to promote FC regeneration. In in vitro experiments the hydrogel-combined FC systems produced significantly larger amounts of calcium and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), but less collagen and DNA than FC samples without the hydrogel and all LIG samples. After in vivo subcutaneous implantation in mice for 8weeks the secreted calcium and GAG contents of the hydrogel-containing FC samples were superior or similar to those of the in vitro hydrogel-containing FC samples at 6weeks. As a result of the enhanced production of calcium and GAG, the in vivo hydrogel-containing FC samples produced the highest compressive modulus among all samples. Histological and immunofluorescence analysis as well as elemental analysis also confirmed a denser and more homogeneous distribution of calcium, GAG, osteocalcin and neovascularization marker in the in vitro/in vivo hydrogel-containing FC systems than those without hydrogel. These results also show the beneficial effects of BMP-2 added using the hydrogel. In summary, the use of a heparin-based hydrogel for the local delivery of fibrochondrocytes and BMP-2 could accelerate the maturation and differentiation of LTB-specific FC tissues, and it was also possible to recreate the unique stratification of calcified FC and LIG tissues in a single porous PLCL scaffold in terms of both biochemical and biomechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aangiogenesis 3abiomechanics 3acalcium 3achondrocytes 3acollagen 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglycosaminoglycans 3ahydrocolloids 3ain vitro studies 3aligaments 3amice 3aosteocalcin 2aAnimals 2aBone Morphogenetic Protein 2xpharmacology 2aBone and Bonesxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCompressive Strengthxdrug effects 2aDrug Delivery Systems 2aElastic Modulusxdrug effects 2aFibrocartilagexdrug effectsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHeparinxpharmacology 2aHydrogelsxpharmacology. 2aImplants, Experimental 2aLigamentsxcytologyxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMaterials Testing 2aMice 2aPolyestersxpharmacology 2aPorosityxdrug effects 2aRabbits 2aRegenerationxdrug effects 2aSpectrometry, X-Ray Emission 2aTissue Scaffoldsxchemistry1 aChoi, Won Il1 aTae, Giyoong1 aKim, Young-Ha,1 aKang, Seong Soo1 aKim, Se Eun1 aKim, Sang-Heon1 aJung, Youngmee1 aKim, Soo Hyun0 tActa biomaterialia.g2011 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.244-257dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2010.08.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011500161300001800276520067300294592002800967650002500995650001101020650001301031650004401044650002201088650001401110650001101124650001501135650001701150650001501167650002001182700002701202773012001229856007501349852000901424655001201433IND60549907920221119223253.0160909e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054990792DNAL7 a10.1021/jo300937k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatajczak, Tomasz10aOxidation of H-Phosphonates with Iodine by Intramolecular Support of a 2-Pyridyl Thermolabile Protecting Group  ap. 7866-7872.  aAcceleration of H-phosphonate diester oxidation with iodine accompanied by a thermolabile protecting group (TPG) is presented.

The absolute configurations of phosphorothioate diesters, H-phosphonate diesters, and oxazaphospholidine oxides were determined. ³¹P NMR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the relationship between chemical shift and absolute configuration at the phosphorus center of H-phosphonate diesters and oxazaphospholidine oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aintermediate product 3aiodine 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxidation 3aoxides 3aphosphates 3aphosphonates 3aphosphorus 3astable isotopes1 aChmielewski, Marcin K.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2012 Sept. 21, v. 77, no. 18 p.7866-7872dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo300937k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02058naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245009700166300001600263520085800279592002801137650002501165650001101190650002101201650001001222650002301232650001201255650001001267650001301277650001301290650001201303650001101315653004401326653001401370653000801384700001601392773015701408856008601565852000901651655001201660IND60721289720221117195607.0201224e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072128972DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2017.00076.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarayani,10aPathology of chicken infectious anaemia virus infection in natural outbreaks in Chhattisgarh  ap. 318-320.  aThe present study was carried out to investigate the outbreaks of chicken infectious anaemia virus (CIAV) infections in poultry of Chhattisgarh.

Data were collected from persons exposed at the daycare center and their home contacts. Fecal samples from affected and non-affected daycare center attenders were analyzed for viruses causing acute gastroenteritis by RT-PCR. The percentage of households affected and the attack rates (AR) were calculated. The attack rates were compared using the rate ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. Information was obtained from 245 people (76 attenders and 169 contacts) of whom 49 were clinical cases. Five HAstV-4, two HAstV-8 and three non-typable HAstV cases were identified (six from clinical cases and four from asymptomatic infected people). The global AR was 20% (41.2% in children aged < 2 years). Data were obtained from 67 households: 20 households of affected attenders and 47 of non-affected attendees. Household contacts of affected attenders had a higher AR (74.3%) than that of non-affected attendees (2.4%). We found asymptomatic infections amongst daycare attendees. The transmission of HAstV during the outbreak was not limited to the daycare center but extended to household contacts of both affected and non-affected attenders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman astrovirus 3aday care centers 3agastroenteritis 3apeople1 aPlasencia, Elsa1 aCornejo-Sánchez, Thais1 aJané, Mireia1 aPérez, Cristina,1 aIzquierdo, Conchita1 aGuix, Susana1 aDominguez, Angela,1 aon behalf of the Working Group for the Study of Acute Gastroenteritis Outbreaks in Catalonia, 0 tViruses.g2021 June 09, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130611003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245009300170300001600263520125800279592002801537650002101565650002101586650001301607650001101620650002201631650001101653650001601664650001001680650001501690650001601705650001201721650001601733650001901749650001201768650001001780650001301790650001301803650001201816651001001828653003201838700001901870700001801889700001901907700001701926700001701943773015701960856008602117852000902203655001202212IND60721289820221117195645.0201224e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072128982DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2017.00077.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarikalan, M.10aFatty liver kidney syndrome (FLKS) in peafowl chicks (Pavo cristatus) and its management  ap. 321-323.  aThe present report describes the occurrence of fatty liver kidney syndrome (FLKS) in peafowl chicks. The history of the case revealed that 3 chicks were rescued and rehabilitated in Divisional Forest office, Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh. After two weeks of stall feeding, the chicks exhibited signs of dullness, anorexia, ruffled feathers. The chicks were brought for treatment to Referral Veterinary Polyclinic, ICAR-IVRI. Among three chicks, one died during transit. The dead chick was necropsied to ascertain the cause of death. The conjunctiva was pale. In the abdominal cavity, there was a blood clot adhered to the parietal surface of the left side liver lobe. The liver was yellowish, swollen with rounded borders and the consistency was friable. Kidneys showed sub-capsular haemorrhages, swollen, yellowish tinged and were nephrotic. Microscopically, the liver showed haemorrhages, fatty changes in the hepatocytes and multifocal areas of coagulative necrosis. Kidney section also revealed hemorrhages and cloudy swelling of tubular epithelial cells. Based on the gross and histopathological findings the case was diagnosed as Fatty Liver Kidney Syndrome. The live ailing chicks responded tooral supplementation with biotin for a period of one month.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal cavity 3aanimal pathology 3aanorexia 3abiotin 3ablood coagulation 3achicks 3aconjunctiva 3adeath 3aepithelium 3afatty liver 3aforests 3ahepatocytes 3ahistopathology 3akidneys 3aliver 3anecropsy 3anecrosis 3apeafowl 3aIndia 0afatty liver kidney syndrome1 aKumar, M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the f bc samples were analyzed by high energy moisture characteristic (HEMC) technique and¹H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry. HEMC was applied in order to evaluate aggregate stability of biochar-amended soil samples.¹H NMR relaxometry experiments were conducted for the evaluation of the pore distributions through the investigation of water dynamics of the same samples. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The HEMC technique revealed improvement in aggregate stability through measurements of the amount of drainable pores and the stability ratio. The latter increased as the amount of biochar was raised up. The¹H NMR relaxometry revealed a unimodal T₁distribution for both the sole sandy-clay soil and the biochar. Conversely, a bimodal T₁distribution was acquired for all the different f bc samples. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in aggregate stability was obtained as biochar was progressively added to the sandy-clay soil. A dual mechanism of water retention has been hypothesized. In particular, intra-aggregate porosity was indicated as the main responsible for molecular water diffusion when f bc comprised between 0 and 0.33. Conversely, inter-aggregate porosity resulted predominant, through swelling processes, when f bc overcame 0.33.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregate stability 3abiochar 3aenergy 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aporosity 3asandy clay soils1 aDe Pasquale, Claudio1 aMarsala, Valentina1 aCimò, Giulia1 aAlonzo, Giuseppe1 aCrescimanno, Giuseppina1 aConte, Pellegrino0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2015 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.816-824dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-0960-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001500192245006000207506007600267520077100343592002801114506003701142650001701179650001001196650001701206650001001223650001301233650001701246650001701263650001301280653000901293653000901302653002301311653002501334653002501359700002001384700001201404700001501416773011901431856008501550852000901635655001201644IND60691031220221207070624.0200427e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069103122DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2018.14648542doi7 aPMC61032822pmcid7 a297015402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Xin10aVacuolar trafficking in pollen tube growth and guidance  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVacuoles are versatile organelles in plant cells, critical for growth and responses to environmental cues. Vacuoles are dynamic tubular structures in pollen tubes, the male gametophytes. Mutations at vacuolar fusion machinery caused male gametophytic lethality by affecting pollen tube growth and guidance, which are critical steps leading to angiosperm reproduction. In comparison, the role of vacuolar trafficking and its cargoes in this process is less understood. In this mini-review, we summarize old and recent findings that indicate the involvement of vacuolar trafficking in pollen tube growth and guidance. We also point at future studies that would provide insights into a key role of vacuolar trafficking and its cargos in pollen tube growth and guidance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAngiospermae 3adeath 3agametophytes 3amales 3amutation 3apollen tubes 3areproduction 3avacuoles 0aAP-3 0aRab5 0apollen tube growth 0apollen tube guidance 0avacuolar trafficking1 aFeng, Qiang-Nan1 aLi, Sha1 aZhang, Yan0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2018 May 4, v. 13, no. 5 p.e1464854-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2018.14648543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159520172500288592002802013650001202041650001002053650001902063650001502082650001902097650001602116650001102132650001102143650004302154650001402197650001902211650002502230650001902255650002202274650002302296651001002319700002002329700001902349700001902368700001702387700001602404700001502420700001402435773012802449856007502577852000902652655001202661IND60703987020221122085037.0200722e20200425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070398702DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120913552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Guorong 10aEstimating Frost during Growing Season and Its Impact on the Velocity of Vegetation Greenup and Withering in Northeast China  aVegetation phenology and photosynthetic primary production have changed simultaneously over the past three decades, thus impacting the velocity of vegetation greenup (Vgreenup) and withering (Vwithering). Although climate warming reduces the frequency of frost events, vegetation is exposed more frequently to frost due to the extension of the growing season. Currently, little is known about the effect of frost during the growing season on Vgreenup and Vwithering. This study analyzed spatiotemporal variations in Vgreenup and Vwithering in Northeast China between 1982 to 2015 using Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GIMMS 3g NDVI) data. Frost days and frost intensity were selected as indicators to investigate the influence of frost during the growing season on Vgreenup and Vwithering, respectively. Increased frost days during the growing season slowed Vgreenup and Vwithering. The number of frost days had a greater impact on Vwithering compared to Vgreenup. In addition, Vgreenup and Vwithering of forests were more vulnerable to frost days, while frost days had a lesser effect on grasslands. In contrast to frost days, frost intensity, which generally decreased during the growing season, accelerated Vgreenup and Vwithering for all land cover types. Changes in frost intensity had less of an impact on forests, whereas the leaf structure of grasslands is relatively simple and thus more vulnerable to frost intensity. The effects of frost during the growing season on Vgreenup and Vwithering in Northeast China were highlighted in this study, and the results provide a useful reference for understanding local vegetation responses to global climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforests 3afrost 3aglobal warming 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3ainventories 3aleaves 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphenology 3aphotosynthesis 3aprimary productivity 3aremote sensing 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aChina1 aZhang, Hongyan 1 aYang, Lingbin 1 aZhao, Jianjun 1 aGuo, Xiaoyi 1 aYing, Hong 1 aRihan, Wu 1 aGuo, Dan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 25, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120913553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245014700168300001600315520193500331592002802266650004402294650001202338650001802350650001502368650000902383650002602392650001902418650002102437650001902458650001202477650003302489650001802522650001102540650002002551650001902571650001702590650001602607650001402623700002302637700002402660700002002684700002402704700001902728700002202747773010502769856008102874852000902955655001202964IND60123677920221117234157.0150329e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012367792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-014-0964-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPituello, Chiara10aCharacterization of chemical–physical, structural and morphological properties of biochars from biowastes produced at different temperatures  ap. 792-804.  aPURPOSE: Biochar production from biowastes (e.g. digestate) is currently one of the more innovative and unexplored fields of research. A complete characterization of these materials, also according to the production temperature, would be a key tool to assess their potential use as soil amendments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For this purpose, five feedstocks (sewage sludge, municipal organic waste, cattle manure and silage digestates, poultry litter and vineyard pruning residues) were pyrolyzed at different temperatures. Structural and morphological transformations of biomasses during heating were followed by using FT-IR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and hyperspectral enhanced dark-field microscopy, a novel technique that provides both spectral and spatial information in one measurement. In addition, biochar microstructure (i.e. surface area and pore size distribution) using CO₂and N₂adsorption isotherms was investigated. Specific density was also analysed by a helium pycnometer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Biochars exhibited considerable chemical, structural and morphological differences depending on temperature and feedstock type. Moreover, specific density and surface area increased with the temperature. In particular, heating was able to produce a sharp increase of mesopore and micropore volume especially at 450 and 550 °C, but with different intensities for each feedstock. Thanks to the hyperspectral analysis, distinctive spectral patterns depending on the biochar chemical composition as well as the spatial distribution of the components were found. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that, from a physical–chemical point of view, it is not possible to identify an “ideal” biochar able to improve both soil nutrient content and structure. On the contrary, depending on feedstocks and temperature, each biochar exhibits specific features that would make it suitable for a specific purpose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiochar 3acattle manure 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3ahyperspectral imagery 3amicrostructure 3anutrient content 3apoultry manure 3apruning 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asewage sludge 3asilage 3asoil amendments 3asoil nutrients 3asurface area 3atemperature 3avineyards1 aFrancioso, Ornella1 aSimonetti, Gianluca1 aPisi, Annamaria1 aTorreggiani, Armida1 aBerti, Antonio1 aMorari, Francesco0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2015 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.792-804dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-0964-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01387naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010200174520037400276592002800650650001400678650002900692650001600721650002300737653000700760653000700767653001800774653001200792653001600804653001500820700002000835773009900855856008600954852000901040655001201049IND60701542120221120232838.0201118e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070154212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1093852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDilmaghani, Maryam10aWho pays for my lies?

Recently, severe hemangiomas broke out in Hy-Line layer chickens on a poultry farm in 2017 where ALV was eradicated earlier. Six isolates of ALV-J, named SDAU1701–SDAU1706, were characterized by virus isolation and sequence analysis of the complete proviral genomes. Avian leukosis virus subgroup J was identified by an immunofluorescence assay with monoclonal antibody JE9, whereas Marek's disease virus or reticuloendotheliosis virus was not detected. Sequence analysis of the complete proviral genome revealed that there was 96.0–99.6% identity between each other and had a homology of 94.6–96.0% when compared with the reference strain. The six isolates formed one distinct lineage separate from the reference sequences in a phylogenetic-tree, which suggested that there were several genetic differences between these groups. Homology analysis of the env, pol, and gag genes of the six isolates showed that the env gene was more variable, especially the gp85 protein, which shared only 88.2–91.9% identity with the reference strains. Sequence comparisons of the gp85 protein indicated that 19 sites were different from those in the NX0101 and HPRS-103 strains inducing myeloid leukosis; among our strains, five mutations were identical to those in the viruses causing hemangioma. Four other distinctive mutations were detected in our six isolates. This study reminds us that the surveillance of viral eradication should be conducted continuously on a farm where ALVs were eradicated. To prevent the prevalence of ALVs, more attention should be paid to daily monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  a31402226cNational Science Foundation  a2016YFD0501606cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aSYL2017YSTD11cShandong “Double Tops” Program 3aAvian leukosis virus 3aMardivirus 3aReticuloendotheliosis virus 3afarms 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahemangioma 3alaying hens 3amonitoring 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3asequence analysis 3aviruses 3aChina 0aAvian leukosis virus subgroup J 0ahemangioma 0acommercial Hy-Line chicken 0acharacterization1 aLi, Qiuchen1 aZhang, Yubiao1 aCui, Zhizhong1 aChang, Shuang1 aZhao, Peng0 tPoultry science.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 97, no. 8 p.2667-2674dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245006300167520139100230592002801621650002001649650002501669650002401694650001901718650002101737650002001758650002401778651001201802700001901814700001901833773012801852856007501980852000902055655001202064IND60703987220221122085018.0200722e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070398722DNAL7 a10.3390/rs120914232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumitrescu, Alexandru 10aStatistical Gap-Filling of SEVIRI Land Surface Temperature  aA reliable and practically useable method for gap filling in hourly Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI LST) data using ERA5 Land Skin Temperature (ERA5ST) co-variate and additional easily accessible data (elevation, time, solar radiation info) is proposed. The suggested approach provides estimates to all weather conditions and it is based on a probabilistic model via modern regression models. We have tested two classes of regression models of different complexity and flexibility, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), and generalized additive model (GAM). This analysis uses as main input the hourly LST data set over Romania, through 2016 and 2017, extracted from MSG-SEVIRI images, which is an operational product of the Land Surface Analysis–Satellite Application Facility (LSA-SAF). The comparison between the estimated LST and the original LST values shows that GAM model, that takes into account the distance between missing LST locations and the nearest non-missing locations (GAM2), provides the best results, hence this was used to fill the gaps from the analyzed remote sensing product. Considering the fact that the best covariate (ERA5ST) has global coverage and it is available at high spatial resolution and temporal resolution, the proposed approach could be also used to perform the gap-filling of other existing LST remote sensing products.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aprobabilistic models 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3askin temperature 3asolar radiation 3asurface temperature 3aRomania1 aBrabec, Marek 1 aCheval, Sorin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2020 Apr. 30, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs120914233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009600164300001600260500001500276520194100291592002802232650001302260650001602273650001602289650001302305650001402318650001802332650001102350650001702361650002902378650002402407650001902431650001102450650001502461650001202476650001302488650002702501650000702528650001802535651001802553651001002571653001902581700001302600700001802613700002002631773010502651856008102756852000902837655001202846IND60123678120221117234116.0150329e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012367812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-015-1062-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Haibo10aAnthropogenic mercury sequestration in different soil types on the southeast coast of China  ap. 962-971.  a2019-12-04  aPURPOSE: Soil is a major pool of anthropogenically emitted mercury (Hg) and will in turn be a source of atmospheric Hg contamination. It was hypothesized that accumulation of anthropogenic Hg in the soil at a regional scale is associated with the amount of Hg emitted to the atmosphere and soil type. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 448 horizon samples were collected from the typical soil types of the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta. Titanium (Ti) was selected as a reference element to discriminate anthropogenic Hg from the Hg associated with pedogenic processes. Soil pools of anthropogenic Hg were quantified to show the difference in Hg sequestration among soil types and regions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Soil pools of anthropogenic Hg ranged from 0.70 to 6971 g/ha in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and from 35.81 to 13098.71 g/ha in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). The estimated soil Hg pools were well correlated with the amounts of Hg emitted in these two regions. Soil properties, namely organic matter content, amorphous iron oxides, and cation exchange capacity, were significantly (p < 0.01) and positively correlated with soil Hg accumulation. Meanwhile, soil organic matter was the most important factor to determine the depth distribution of Hg in soil profile of the majority of soils. Perudic Cambisols and Stagnic Anthrosols which contained higher content of amorphous iron oxides had the highest soil Hg pools, indicating the importance of amorphous iron oxides other than organic matter to the Hg retention in soil. Soil and soil horizons with low pH and high salinity did show a low accumulation of Hg probably due to the remobilization of Hg under such conditions. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to the amount of Hg emitted, soil types may be a major factor in controlling the sequestration of anthropogenic Hg in both regions. Stagnic Anthrosols are an important pool for retention of anthropogenic Hg.  aPublisher supplied data 3atitanium 3airon oxides 3acorrelation 3asoil air 3aCambisols 3asoil horizons 3acoasts 3ariver deltas 3acation exchange capacity 3asoil organic matter 3asoil formation 3arivers 3aAnthrosols 3amercury 3asalinity 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3apH 3asoil profiles 3aYangtze River 3aChina 0aorganic matter1 aLi, Yuan1 aLuo, Yongming1 aChristie, Peter0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2015 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.962-971dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-015-1062-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002300168245020000191300001600391520177600407592002802183650002402211650002702235650002302262650000902285650001802294650001902312650002402331650001802355650001802373650001402391650002202405650002102427650001202448650002302460650004502483650002802528650004102556700001902597773009202616856008502708852000902793655001202802IND4475356120221118085044.0141110e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447535612DNAL7 a225427382pmid7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJovanović, Boris,10aImmunotoxicology of non-functionalized engineered nanoparticles in aquatic organisms with special emphasis on fish—Review of current knowledge, gap identification, and call for further research  ap. 141-151.  aThe rapid increase in use of nanotechnology products is increasing the presence of metal, metal-oxide and carbon-based nanoparticles in the aquatic environment. These non-functionalized engineered nanoparticles can interact with the immune system of fish and invertebrates, and tip the ecological balance of population sustainability. Most nanoparticle types present in the aquatic environment, such as titanium dioxide, do not exhibit or have very low direct toxicity, but instead display silent or concealed sub-lethal effects on the immune system with serious implications. There is a gap in current available information regarding the immunotoxic potential of engineered nanoparticles toward aquatic organisms. Therefore, there is a critical need to provide the first comprehensive review of the effects of engineered non-functionalized nanoparticles on the immune system of aquatic animals, address the major gaps in current existing information, and recommend the future focus of research. This manuscript identifies cell mediated immunity and the phagocytic cells as the primary target of nanoparticle immunotoxicity. The immunotoxicity is primarily govern by lysosomal destabilization, frustrated phagocytosis, and change in function of the phagocytic cells, which decrease the ability of animals to defend themselves against pathogens and infectious diseases. Humoral immune system is a lesser target of direct immunotoxicity, but plays a critical role in dissemination of the nanoparticles through the body and their presentation to the phagocytic cells. The external innate immunity and the acquired immunity have not been connected with overly important and direct immunotoxic effects, but instead a big gap in current targeted research has been acknowledged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3acell-mediated immunity 3aecological balance 3afish 3aimmune system 3aimmunotoxicity 3ainfectious diseases 3ainvertebrates 3ananoparticles 3apathogens 3asublethal effects 3atitanium dioxide 2aAnimals 2aFishesximmunology 2aImmune Systemxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aNanoparticlesxtoxicity 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aPalić, Dušan0 tAquatic toxicology.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 118-119 p.141-151dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2012.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001400192245007900206506007600285520073500361536038501096592002801481596009801509596008701607596007501694596007501769506003701844650001101881650001701892650001501909650001401924650002501938650001401963650002601977653001602003653003202019653000902051653001302060653001502073700001402088700001202102700001202114700001402126773011902140856008502259852000902344655001202353IND60691031620221207065527.0200427e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069103162DNAL7 a10.1080/15592324.2018.14676902doi7 aPMC61032902pmcid7 a299444442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Y.10aAUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 plays distinct role during early flower development  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3), one of the auxin response factors family of transcription factors, is well characterized by its functions in polarity identification and organ patterning.

However, the relationship of its multiple roles in differently developmental stage is still unclear. Here, we present data that ARF3 plays distinct roles during early flower development that are different from its roles in organ polarity determination and pattering. Thus, our findings shed light on the functional diversity of one specific transcription factor in plant development.  aThis work was funded by The National Key Research and Development Program of China 2016YFD0100605 and 2016YFD0100102 to Z.Z., National Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project 31671354 and CAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program to X.L., and the State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering (PCCE-KF-2016-01);National Natural Science Foundation of China [31671354];  aPublisher supplied data  a31671354cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aPCCE-KF-2016-01cthe State Key Laboratory of Plant Cell and Chromosome Engineering  a2016YFD0100605cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2016YFD0100102cNational Key Research and Development Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3acytokinins 3aflowering 3afunctional diversity 3ameristems 3atranscription factors 0aArabidopsis 0afloral meristem determinacy 0aARF3 0apolarity 0apatterning1 aZhang, K.1 aGuo, L.1 aLiu, X.1 aZhang, Z.0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2018 May 4, v. 13, no. 5 p.e1467690-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2018.14676903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011100161520098800272592002801260650002801288650002701316650002401343650002101367650001401388650002201402650001101424650001801435650001401453650001401467650001901481650002401500700002301524700002401547700002301571700002401594700002201618773012101640856007301761852000901834655001201843IND60742761920221121010159.0210624e20210609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074276192DNAL7 a10.3390/v130611062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hsuan-Yuan 10aCommon Polymorphisms in the Glycoproteins of Human Cytomegalovirus and Associated Strain-Specific Immunity  aHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV), one of the most prevalent viruses across the globe, is a common cause of morbidity and mortality for immunocompromised individuals. Recent clinical observations have demonstrated that mixed strain infections are common and may lead to more severe disease progression. This clinical observation illustrates the complexity of the HCMV genome and emphasizes the importance of taking a population-level view of genotypic evolution. Here we review frequently sampled polymorphisms in the glycoproteins of HCMV, comparing the variable regions, and summarizing their corresponding geographic distributions observed to date. The related strain-specific immunity, including neutralization activity and antigen-specific cellular immunity, is also discussed. Given that these glycoproteins are common targets for vaccine design and anti-viral therapies, this observed genetic variation represents an important resource for future efforts to combat HCMV infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3acell-mediated immunity 3adisease progression 3adisease severity 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3aglycoproteins 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aneutralization 3avaccine development1 aValencia, Sarah M.1 aPfeifer, Susanne P.1 aJensen, Jeffrey D.1 aKowalik, Timothy F.1 aPermar, Sallie R.0 tViruses.g2021 June 09, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130611063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01314naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245007000161300001800231520044600249592002800695650002300723650002300746650002300769700003100792773013900823856007700962852000901039655001201048IND60521503220221120064353.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052150322DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1976-08042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeller, Klaus14aDie Kristallstruktur des Ca2As3.bThe Crystal Structure of Ca2As3  ap. 1023-1027.  aThe new intermetallic compound Ca₂As₃ has been prepared and its structure determined.

This has so far not been well examined in glycophytic crops. Here, we report the characterization of SbHKT1;4, a member of the HKT gene family from Sorghum bicolor. Upon Na⁺ stress, SbHKT1;4 expression was more strongly upregulated in salt‐tolerant sorghum accession, correlating with a better balanced Na⁺/K⁺ ratio and enhanced plant growth. Heterogeneous expression analyses in mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that overexpressing SbHKT1;4 resulted in hypersensitivity to Na⁺ stress, and such hypersensitivity could be alleviated with the supply of elevated levels of K⁺, implicating that SbHKT1;4 may mediate K⁺ uptake in the presence of excessive Na⁺. Further electrophysiological evidence demonstrated that SbHKT1;4 could transport Na⁺ and K⁺ when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The relevance of the finding that SbHKT1;4 functions to maintain optimal Na⁺/K⁺ balance under Na⁺ stress to the breeding of salt‐tolerant glycophytic crops is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aSorghum bicolor 3aXenopus laevis 3abreeding 3acrops 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahalophytes 3ahypersensitivity 3amutants 3aoocytes 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3asodium 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aCation Transport Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aIon Channel Gatingxdrug effects 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOocytesxmetabolism 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSalinity 2aSalt-Tolerant Plantsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSodiumxmetabolism 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSorghumxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aStress, Physiologicalxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aSymportersxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aXenopus1 aRen, Zhi‐Jie1 aLiu, Zhi‐Quan1 aFeng, Xue1 aGuo, Rui‐Qi1 aLi, Bao‐Guo1 aLi, Le‐Gong1 aJing, Hai‐Chun0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2014 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.315-332dChinese Academy of Sciencesx1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.12144  aDNAL 7aarticle02127naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012000164520108100284592002801365650001401393650002301407650001101430650001601441653000801457653000801465653000801473653002701481653001901508653001501527653002301542700001801565773009901583856008601682852000901768655001201777IND60701542620221122052826.0201118e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070154262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1093972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Fei10aAsymptotically efficient root estimators for spatial autoregressive models with spatial autoregressive disturbances  aThis paper considers closed-form root estimators for spatial autoregressive models with spatial autoregressive disturbances (SARAR model). We first derive a simple consistent closed-form estimator. Then we construct feasible moment conditions that are quadratic in the spatial lag and spatial error dependence parameters separately, which generate root estimators with closed forms. We consider both the cases with homoskedastic and unknown heteroskedastic disturbances. In the homoskedastic case, the root estimator can be asymptotically as efficient as the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE); in the heteroskedastic case, it can be asymptotically as efficient as a method of moments estimator (MME) that sets adjusted quasi-maximum likelihood scores to zero, where the adjusted scores have zero means at the true parameters. The root estimators and their associated standard errors can avoid the computation of any matrix determinants or inverses, so they are computationally simple without iterations, especially valuable for big data where the sample size is large.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3aheteroskedasticity 3amodels 3asample size 0aC13 0aC21 0aR15 0aSpatial autoregression 0aRoot estimator 0aEfficiency 0aHeteroskedasticity1 aLee, Lung-fei0 tEconomics letters.g2020 Sept., v. 194 p.109397-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2020.1093973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010300164300001800267500001500285520120400300592002801504650002401532650002301556650001301579650000901592650001201601650002101613650001101634650004401645650002101689650002201710650001101732650001401743653001401757700005301771700001901824700001701843700001401860700001601874773012201890856008202012852000902094655001202103IND60592089220221117204525.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059208922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-018-2190-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yifang10aSurface passivation with nitrogen-doped carbon dots for improved perovskite solar cell performance  ap. 9180-9190.  a2019-12-06  aUndercoordinated lead cations and halide anions on the surface of perovskite layer can form surface trap states and cause electronic disorders which reduce the performance of perovskite solar cells. Nitrogen-doped carbon dots (NCDs) that have rich nitrogen- and oxygen-containing functional groups can effectively interact with the unsaturated metal sites and halide anions on the surface and boundaries of perovskite grains. Herein, low-cost NCDs are utilized as efficient additives to passivate the surface of a solution-processed CH₃NH₃PbI₃ perovskite film, which remarkably reduce charge carrier recombination, as evidenced by the results of time-resolved photoluminescence and electrochemical impedance spectrum measurements. FTIR spectra indicate the formation of hydrogen bonds between the undercoordinated iodine ions on perovskite grains and hydroxyl as well as nitrogenous groups of NCDs. In addition, NCDs additives also help increase interfacial charge transfer from perovskite to electron-transporting layer, leading to an improvement in power conversion efficiency for the solar cell device from 12.12 ± 0.28% (standard cell fabricated in same conditions) to 15.93 ± 0.15%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3aphotovoltaic cells 3amoieties 3alead 3acations 3aelectrochemistry 3aanions 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3ahydrogen bonding 3aphotoluminescence 3aiodine 3aadditives 0aimpedance1 aZhang, Jie1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2756-890X1 aChen, Shuhuang1 aZhang, Haoyu1 aLi, Ligui1 aFu, Zhiyong0 tJournal of materials science.g2018 June, v. 53, no. 12 p.9180-9190dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-018-2190-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245013500212300001600347520217300363592002802536650001502564650002302579650001502602650001502617650001502632650001302647650002502660650004302685651002302728700001702751700001902768773011202787856008302899852000902982655001202991IND60755475720221117222708.0211102e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075547572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-020-01360-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjenontin, Ida N.

Embodiments in Sub-Saharan Africa and Implications for Future Design  ap. 619-641.  aForest landscape restoration (FLR) is gaining ground as a novel, holistic approach to sustainable environmental management across developing countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, 30 countries have joined the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative to advance FLR goals. Although conceptually compelling, and despite efforts articulating initial implementation guidelines, divergent discourses and interpretations confound FLR translation into practice. We propose a characterization of FLR in practice using insights from political ecology; principles of ecological restoration and landscape sustainability science; and the philosophy, principles, and objectives of the FLR paradigm. Our qualitative analysis further draws on secondary data and insights from participant observation during FLR-related workshops. We build and organize the FLR characterization around answers to ten questions: why restoration; what purpose; for what desired outcomes; where (location and land uses); what spatial extent and scale(s); who; which techniques; how (approach/strategy); when and how long; and how much to achieve. We then assess early FLR strategic priorities for interventions across nine African countries and analyze five selected actual projects to illustrate use of the proposed FLR characterization framework. The illustrative characterization of both planned interventions and actual projects does not reflect all the proposed characteristics of FLR in practice. Missing features include the initial biophysical condition, the desired target ecosystem state, and evaluation dimensions, and ill-articulated aspects include cross-sectoral integrations. We contend that any significant differences between FLR conceptualization, including its principles, and the practical manifestations can undermine coherence, the value that the FLR approach adds, and its wider adoption. The proposed characterization of FLR in practice contributes to scholarly attempts to realign FLR conceptual philosophy, principles, and rhetoric to its practical manifestations in different contexts, and can inform future design of FLR undertakings for more inclusive landscape governance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aforest restoration 3agovernance 3alandscapes 3aphilosophy 3apolitics 3aqualitative analysis 3asustainability science and engineering 3aSub-Saharan Africa1 aZulu, Leo C.1 aEtongo, Daniel0 tEnvironmental management.g2021 Nov., v. 68, no. 5 p.619-641dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-020-01360-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245022900168300001600397520096000413592002801373650002401401650001301425650001601438650002601454650001801480650001901498650001901517653002101536653003701557653000901594653003201603653003901635653002901674700001501703700001901718700001301737700001801750700001501768773011501783856008401898852000901982655001201991IND60602329020221119190411.0180711e20150904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060232902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2015.07.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hongwei10aChromatographic efficiency comparison of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes-containing hybrid monoliths via photo- and thermally-initiated free-radical polymerization in capillary liquid chromatography for small molecules  ap. 110-117.  aMonolithic poly(methacrylate epoxy cyclosiloxane-co-polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes) (epoxy-MA–POSS) capillary columns have been prepared via either photo- or thermally-initiated polymerization of the corresponding monomers using a 1-propanol/PEG 400 mixture as porogens.

The results indicate that hybrid monoliths fabricated by photochemical initiation exhibit higher column efficiency (97,000–98,400plates/m) than those synthesized by thermal polymerization (41,100–48,000plates/m) in cLC. The higher efficiency of photo-initiated hybrid monoliths is closely related to lower eddy dispersion (A-term) and mass transfer resistance (C-term).  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aepoxides 3airradiation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass transfer 3aphotochemistry 3apolymerization 0aHybrid monoliths 0aMethacrylate epoxy cyclosiloxane 0aPOSS 0aFree-radical polymerization 0a2,2-Dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone 0aPhotochemical initiation1 aOu, Junjie1 aLiu, Zhongshan1 aLin, Hui1 aPeng, Xiaojun1 aZou, Hanfa0 tJournal of chromatography.g2015 Sept. 04, v. 1410 p.110-117dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2015.07.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245014700167300002000314520132300334592002801657596006001685596010901745596009001854650002101944650002501965650001201990650001202002650001302014650001302027650001602040650001602056650002302072650002002095650001402115650001302129650001402142650002502156650001302181700001702194700001702211700001602228700001602244700002602260700003602286700001802322700001602340773015502356856008302511852000902594655001202603IND60752872320221118181035.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075287232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14844-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeboah, Akwasi10aEvaluation of two wild castor (Ricinus communis L.) accessions for cadmium tolerance in relation to antioxidant systems and lipid peroxidation  ap. 55634-55642.  aThe present study was conducted to assess the effect of toxicity of cadmium (Cd) on growth, tolerance index (TI), antioxidant activities, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in two contrasting wild castor accessions (16-024 and S2-4) via hydroponic experiment (0 and 100 mg/L Cd). The results showed that Cd significantly reduced the growth rate, seedling height, root length, and shoot length of the castor accessions compared to the control, with the Cd effect being more severe in S2-4 than in 16-024. In addition, biomass response including the root and shoot fresh weight and root dry weight decreased in both accessions compared to the control. Compared to the control group, the shoot dry weight of accession S2-4 declined by 21.7%, whereas there was no change in 16-024, suggesting a level of tolerance in 16-024. Analysis of TI on all the growth parameters and biomass content revealed that accession 16-024 was highly tolerant to Cd stress than S2-4. The results further revealed that the expression of the antioxidant enzymes, viz., superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), non-enzymatic antioxidant, glutathione, and MDA content, was influenced by genotype. S2-4 exhibited a higher antioxidant activity (SOD, CAT) and lipid peroxidation activity than 16-024, indicative of oxidative damage from Cd stress.  aPublisher supplied data  a31271759cNational natural science foundation of China,  a2013b060400024, 2014a020208116, and 2016a020208015cGuangdong provincial science and technology projects  a2013050206cProject of enhancing school with innovation of Guangdong ocean university 3aRicinus communis 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acatalase 3agenotype 3aglutathione 3ahydroponics 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3apollution 3aresearch 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity1 aLu, Jiannong1 aGu, Shuailei1 aLiu, Haiyan1 aShi, Yuzhen1 aAmoanimaa-Dede, Hanna1 aAgyenim-Boateng, Kwadwo Gyapong1 aPayne, Joseph1 aYin, Xuegui0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 39 p.55634-55642dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14844-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010800170300001800278520192500296592002802221650001202249650001502261650004802276650001402324650001602338650001102354650001702365650002402382650001902406650001302425650002302438650001702461650001302478650001302491650001702504650001702521650001102538650002202549651001702571651001202588700002002600773011202620856008102732852000902813655001202822IND60439384220221120225022.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043938422DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-015-0958-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Marc-Oliver14aThe value of targeted reforestations for local insect diversity: a case study from the Ecuadorian Andes  ap. 2709-2734.  aWe surveyed insect communities (Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera) on native treelets (Cedrela montana, Heliocarpus americanus, Tabebuia chrysantha) planted among anthropogenic land cover types (pasture, secondary shrub, and a pine plantation), comparing them among one another and to those found on conspecific treelets in adjacent montane rainforest. Between 2010 and 2012, we sampled 160 treelets (Pasture: 47, Shrub: 26, Pine: 44, Forest: 43). Habitability of reforestations for forest insects was quantified by examining species richness, diversity partitioning and community composition on reforestations relative to natural forest. Species richness was high (phytophagous Coleoptera: 185 spp., predatory Coleoptera: 101 spp., phytoph. Hemiptera: 174 spp., phytoph. Lepidoptera: 147 spp.) with values being highest in natural forest, and significantly lower in all reforestations. Phytophagous Coleoptera and Lepidoptera communities showed a trend toward higher species richness in pine than in pasture or shrub. Predatory Coleoptera showed higher values in pasture and pine compared to shrub. These findings suggest that microclimatic effects of surrounding vegetation may affect species richness. Given high habitat heterogeneity and prevalence of rare species, tree-level α-diversity and turn-over between individual sample treelets emerged as the strongest contributors to overall diversity. Coleoptera community composition was mainly a function of habitat, but colonization of reforestations by forest species was restricted to phytophagous taxa and contingent on the presence of canopy cover. For Hemiptera and Lepidoptera, community composition was similar across habitats and determined mainly by host species. In summary, young reforestations maintain less diverse insect communities compared to natural forest but still harbor a considerable number of species, particularly if canopy cover is present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCedrela 3aColeoptera 3aHandroanthus chrysanthus subsp. chrysanthus 3aHemiptera 3aLepidoptera 3acanopy 3acase studies 3acommunity structure 3aforest insects 3ahabitats 3ainsect communities 3amicroclimate 3apastures 3aplanting 3arain forests 3arare species 3ashrubs 3aspecies diversity 3aAndes region 3aEcuador1 aFiedler, Konrad0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2015 Oct., v. 24, no. 11 p.2709-2734dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-015-0958-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03968naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012800172300001600300500001500316520259200331592002802923650001402951650001502965650001102980650002102991650001903012650001303031650001703044650000903061650001103070650001403081650001603095650001203111650002003123650001403143650001703157650001203174651002203186653001003208700002203218700002703240700002403267773010503291856008103396852000903477655001203486IND60123678920221117234048.0150329e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012367892DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-015-1092-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe la Rosa, José M.10aAssessment of distribution and sources of pyrogenic carbon in the lower course of the Guadiana River (SW Iberian Peninsula)  ap. 759-768.  a2019-12-04  aPURPOSE: The main goal of this work was to determine the pyrogenic carbon (PyC) distribution in surficial sediments for the last 40 km of the Guadiana River (SW Iberian Peninsula). In addition, the changes in the contribution of terrestrial and marine organic matter (OM) sources and their relationship with the PyC contents were assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sediments were collected from 22 stations within the lower course of the Guadiana River. All the samples were analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon to nitrogen atomic ratios (C/N), and stable carbon isotope ratio (δ¹³C) as indicators of changes in the sources of OM. PyC was determined according to the chemo-thermal oxidation method (CTO-375). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: TOC ranged from 0.25 to 2.37 %dw. The greatest TOC contents were located in sediments collected at the middle estuary. The C/N values ranged from 7.7 to 12.7, with slight relative increase in the marine input compared to pre-Alqueva times. Similar C/N ranges are representative of native soil OM, lacustrine OM, and local sedimentary OM. The δ¹³C values of the sediment samples ranged from –25.0 to –27.6 ‰ illustrating a signature of C₃higher plants, marsh-plants, lacustrine plants, and freshwater algae present in the area of study and in the forests located upstream. PyC ranged between 0.17 and 0.74 gkg⁻¹, with the highest contents measured in samples located close to urbanized areas. Sediments collected at the middle estuary, within a rural area, showed the lowest proportions of PyC relative to the percent of TOC (≤4 % TOC). The negative relationship between PyC to TOC ratio and TOC contents confirmed the selective preservation of PyC to degradation in the sedimentary OM of the Guadiana estuary. The carbon isotope composition of the final material after applying the CTO-375 method (hereafter called δ¹³CPyC) was ˂–30 ‰, suggesting that the PyC fraction was mainly composed of a mixture of fossil fuels and C₃-charred biomass. Nevertheless, selective loss of the less recalcitrant OM fractions due to degradation and/or chemical alteration might contribute to lighter carbon isotope values of PyC. CONCLUSIONS: Geochemical data showed that sedimentary OM was composed of a mix of different OM sources, with a slight increase in the marine input after the Alqueva dam went into operation. The PyC content was higher close to urbanized areas of the Guadiana River estuary. The selective preservation of PyC in the sedimentary OM of the Guadiana estuary was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3afreshwater 3arivers 3anitrogen content 3aorganic matter 3anitrogen 3aurbanization 3asoil 3acarbon 3aoxidation 3arural areas 3abiomass 3astable isotopes 3aestuaries 3afossil fuels 3aforests 3aIberian Peninsula 0aAlgae1 aMartins, José M.1 aSoares, António Monge1 aAraújo, M.

In monopodial plants, for example in Arabidopsis thaliana, the flowers are initiated as lateral appendages of a central indeterminate inflorescence meristem. In sympodial plants, flowers arise by terminal differentiation of the inflorescence meristem, while further inflorescence development proceeds from new sympodial meristems that are generated at the flank of the terminal flower. We have used the sympodial model species Petunia hybrida to investigate inflorescence development. Here, we describe a mutant, bonsai (bns), which is defective in flower formation, inflorescence branching, and control of meristem size. Detailed microscopic analysis revealed that bns meristems retain vegetative charateristics including spiral phyllotaxis. Consistent with a block in flower formation, bns mutants exhibit a deregulated expression of various MADS-box genes. Molecular analysis revealed that the bns mutant carries a transposon insertion in the previously described EVERGREEN (EVG) gene, which belongs to the WUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX (WOX) transcription factor gene family. EVG falls in the WOX9 subfamily, which has diverse developmental functions in angiosperms. The comparison of WOX9 orthologues in five model species for flowering shows that these genes play functionally divergent roles in monopodial and sympodial plants, indicating that the WOX9 regulatory node may have played an important role in the evolution of shoot architecture.  aThis work was supported by a project in the frame of the Swiss initiative for systems biology “SystemsX.ch” (Plant Growth in a Changing Environment, No. [SXRTX0-123956] and [51RT0-145716]) and by a grant from the Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung (Grant number [31003A_135778]).  aPublisher supplied data  aSXRTX0-123956 and 51RT0-145716cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001711  a3100AO-135778cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschungdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000017110 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPetunia hybrida 3aappendages 3abonsai 3abranching 3aevolution 3aflowering 3aflowers 3ahomeotic genes 3ameristems 3amodels 3amutants 3aphyllotaxy 3aracemose inflorescences 3atranscription factors 3atransposons 0aEVERGREEN 0ameristem 0aMADS-box 0aWOX9 0aWUSCHEL-LIKE HOMEOBOX91 aDuvvuru Muni, R.

The structure, thermal performance, energy storage and release capability, cycle stability are deeply characterized. Shape-stability for EMC18@GO-C18 and EMC18@GO shows a bigger improvement than that of bulk EMC18 because of the framework role of 2D GO nanosheets. At 160 °C, no liquid leakage appears in EMC18@GO-C18, exhibiting a superior shape stabilization temperature to EMC18@GO, which is contributed by its enhanced interfacial compatibility from the introduced octadecyl side chains. Thermal performance shows a highly dependence upon the content of GO or GO-C18 nanofillers, and the thermal cycling stability reaches 500 times. Four thermal cycles are well repeated for the fabric coated by EMC18@GO-C18-2%, and no energy efficiency loses. The maximum temperature difference and thermal buffering time is −15 °C and 375 s at 70 °C working temperature. Good structure stabilization and thermal performance of EMC18 doped by GO-C18 offers a chance to approach the high-efficient thermal energy storage materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanhydrides 3aenergy efficiency 3afabrics 3agraphene oxide 3aliquids 3amixing 3ananosheets 3aphase transition 3atemperature 3athermal energy 0aComb-like polymer 0aPhase change materials 0aThermal energy storage 0aFunctionalized graphene oxide 0aThermal cycle1 aKong, Lei1 aWang, Haixia1 aXu, Hongxing1 aLi, Jing1 aShi, Haifeng0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 July 15, v. 168 p.119-127dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01550naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011400157300001800271520039600289592002800685650001400713650001900727650002300746650002300769650002200792650001200814700001800826700001400844700002200858700001500880700001500895700001500910700001800925700001700943773012000960856007501080852000901155655001201164IND60549909020221119223419.0160909e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054990902DNAL7 a10.1021/jo301115t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yun-Long10aDirect Asymmetric Vinylogous Mannich Reaction of 3,4-Dihalofuran-2(5H)-one with Aldimine Catalyzed by Quinine  ap. 8338-8343.  aThe direct asymmetric vinylogous Mannich reaction of 3,4-dihalofuran-2(5H)-one with aldimine catalyzed by quinine was first reported, and γ-butenolides have been obtained in excellent yield (up to 98%) and enantioselectivities (up to 95% ee).

Previous reports on TLRs in birds showed significant levels of inter- and intraspecific genetic variation. Little is known about the structure and function of the avian immune system, especially waterfowl species. This work aimed to identify and clone Anas platyrhynchos (mallard duck) TLR-3 (dTLR-3) and its expression level following challenge with velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a model for waterfowl species. The mallard duck TLR-3 full-length cDNA sequence had been cloned, which consisted of 2457 nucleotides. The translated amino acid sequence showed identity degree as 97% with Muscovy duck, 95% with geese, 89% with helmeted guineafowls, 88% with the chickens TLR-3 gene, 82% with turkey TLR-3, and 79% with zebra finch, while it showed 54% with human one; the analysis data suggested that the new sequence is probably homologous to vertebrates’ TLR-3. The predicted protein encoded by the duck dTLR-3 mRNA sequence is composed of 819 amino acids. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that dTLR-3 has typical structural features and contains the main components of proteins in the TLR family. The dTLR-3 expressed in almost all examined tissues of mallard duck following quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis and using B-actin as a housekeeping gene. To check the functionality of the receptor and its role in viral infection, we evaluate the expression level in different tissues and its changes following NDV infection. The results showed significant (P < 0.05) upregulated in the brain at 24 h (1.84-fold), reached a peak at 48 h (4.82-fold), and recovered to normal levels at 72 h post-infection. These results indicate a complete and functional dTLR-3 that is orthologous to other vertebrate receptors with its potential role in early response against viral infection in mallard duck species.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. IRT0923cChangjiang Scholar Program of Chinese Ministry of Education 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aCairina moschata 3aNewcastle disease 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3aToll-like receptors 3aadaptive immunity 3aamino acid sequences 3abrain 3aducks 3agenetic variation 3aguineafowl 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3apollution 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 3awaterfowl1 aAbouelmaatti, Reham R.1 aTalat, Shaimaa1 aFawzy, Mohamed1 aRady, Mohamed1 aDiab, Mohamed1 aAlkahtani, Saad1 aSultan, Hesham1 aSun, Changjiang1 aLei, Liancheng1 aHan, Wenyu1 aSedeik, Mahmoud1 aAbdel-Daim, Mohamed M.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 39 p.55786-55795dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14759-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03724naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012900175300001600304520228300320592002802603650001402631650004402645650001102689650001302700650001602713650001302729650001902742650003302761650002902794650001502823650001802838650001902856650002202875650002102897651001102918700002702929700002802956700003102984700003703015700001903052773010503071856008103176852000903257655001203266IND60123679220221117234047.0150329e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012367922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-014-1040-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeal, Otávio dos Anjos10aSoil chemical properties and organic matter composition of a subtropical Cambisol after charcoal fine residues incorporation  ap. 805-815.  aPURPOSE: Brazil is the world’s greatest charcoal producer with an annual production of 10 million tons. However, about 15 % is lost as charcoal fines, which can be used as soil fertilizer and source of soil stable carbon (C). In this study we, investigated the impact of charcoal fines application on soil chemical properties and organic matter (SOM) stability and composition. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four doses (0, control, 10, 20 and 40 Mg ha⁻¹) of charcoal fines were incorporated to the soil at 10 cm. Soil samples were collected at four soil depths (0–5, 5–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm) 20 months after charcoal incorporation. Soil chemical properties were determined, and SOM composition was evaluated by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX) and carbon stable isotopic analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Soil chemical properties were affected mainly in the upper depth (0–5 cm) and only at the highest dose (40 Mg ha⁻¹), which also increased the total C content in 37.7 % compared to the control. Probably, the observed effects solely on the surface are due the concentration of charcoal on the upper depth, despite its incorporation. The dose of 40 Mg ha⁻¹also increased the total C content at 10–20 cm depth compared to the control. Such result was assigned to the leaching of some finest charcoal particles. The SEM-EDX and SOM δ¹³C signature confirmed the presence of charcoal at both 0–5 and 10–20 cm soil depths. FTIR and TGA indicated an increase in SOM aromaticity and thermostability until 20 cm depth after charcoal incorporation. No effects were observed at the deepest soil depth (20–30 cm), suggesting that charcoal was not leached to this depth within 20 months. CONCLUSIONS: The application of charcoal fines ameliorated the soil chemical properties. In general, the charcoal increased the SOM aromaticity and thermostability and changed the δ¹³C signature at 0–5 and 10–20 cm. Charcoal leaching from the 0–10 to the 10–20 cm depth was observed, but further downward transport was not evidenced by our data. Charcoal fine residues show a potential to be used as an effective soil fertilizer, as well as a stable C source into the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCambisols 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon 3acharcoal 3afertilizers 3aleaching 3aorganic matter 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil chemical properties 3asoil depth 3asoil sampling 3asoil treatment 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aBrazil1 aDick, Deborah Pinheiro1 aLombardi, Kátia Cylene1 aMaciel, Vanessa Gonçalves1 aGonzález-Pérez, José António1 aKnicker, Heike0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2015 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.805-815dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-1040-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01660naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011800156300001800274520057000292592002800862650001500890650001400905650002300919650002300942650001200965650001300977650002200990650002201012650001401034700001601048700001301064700001701077773012001094856007501214852000901289655001201298IND60549909120221119223313.0160909e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054990912DNAL7 a10.1021/jo30117172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Zongjian10aBis(perfluoroalkyl) Phosphino-Oxazoline: A Modular, Stable, Strongly π-Accepting Ligand for Asymmetric Catalysis  ap. 7957-7967.  aA new class of stable, strongly π-accepting and modular bis(perfluoroalkyl)-phosphine-oxazoline ligands (FOX) as CO mimics was prepared.

In medicine Ag-NP have found applications as wound dressings, surgical instruments and bone substitute biomaterials, e.g. silver-containing calcium phosphate cements. Depending on the coating technique, during resorption of a biomaterial Ag-NP may come into close contact with body tissues, including human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). Despite the widespread uses of Ag-NP, there is a serious lack of information concerning their biological effects on human cells. In this study the uptake of Ag-NP into hMSC has been analyzed and the intracellular distribution of Ag-NP after exposure determined. Non-agglomerated (dispersed) Ag-NP from the cell culture medium were detected as agglomerates of nanoparticles within the hMSC by combined focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy. The silver agglomerates were typically located in the perinuclear region, as determined by light microscopy. Specific staining of cellular structures (endo-lysosomes, nuclei, Golgi complex and endoplasmatic reticulum) using fluorescent probes showed that the silver nanoparticles occurred mainly within endo-lysosomal structures, not in the cell nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi complex. Quantitative determination of the uptake of Ag-NP by flow cytometry (scattergram analysis) revealed a concentration-dependent uptake of the particles which was significantly inhibited by chlorpromazine and wortmannin but not by nystatin, indicating clathrin-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis as the primary uptake mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGolgi apparatus 3aantibacterial properties 3abone substitutes 3acalcium phosphates 3acell culture 3acell nucleus 3achlorpromazine 3aculture media 3aendocytosis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3ahumans 3alight microscopy 3amedicine 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anystatin 3aquantitative analysis 3aresorption 3areticulum 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3astem cells 3asurgical equipment 3auptake mechanisms 2aEndocytosis 2aHumans 2aIntracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxcytologyxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMetal Nanoparticlesxchemistryxultrastructure. 2aPovidonexchemistry 2aSilverxmetabolism1 aDiendorf, J.1 aSimon, T.1 aEggeler, G.1 aEpple, M.1 aKöller, M.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2011 Jan., v. 7, no. 1 p.347-354dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2010.08.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04413naa a2200805 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002700135040001800162100001900180245011700199300001800316506007600334520207300410592002802483596006402511506003702575650002302612650002502635650001702660650002102677650004002698650001202738650001302750650001102763650002802774650001002802650001302812650001102825650000902836650002802845650001902873650001302892650000702905650001502912650001402927650001602941650004302957650001703000650001403017650001303031650001103044650001403055650001203069650001903081650001903100650001503119650001103134651001003145653001803155653003403173653001903207653002803226653001103254700001903265700001903284700001403303700001603317700001603333700001603349700001903365700001703384773011103401856007403512852000903586655001203595IND60673790420221207075724.0210209e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067379042DNAL7 a296727732pmid7 aPMC60443122pmcid7 a10.3382/ps/pey1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Martino, G.10aMicrobiological, chemical and physical quality of drinking water for commercial turkeys: a cross-sectional study  ap. 2880-2886.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDrinking water for poultry is not subject to particular microbiological, chemical and physical requirements, thereby representing a potential transmission route for pathogenic microorganisms and contaminants and/or becoming unsuitable for water-administered medications. This study assessed the microbiological, chemical and physical drinking water quality of 28 turkey farms in North-Eastern Italy: 14 supplied with tap water (TW) and 14 with well water (WW). Water salinity, hardness, pH, ammonia, sulphate, phosphate, nitrate, chromium, copper and iron levels were also assessed. Moreover, total bacterial count at 22°C, presence and enumeration of Enterococcus spp. and E. coli, presence of Salmonella spp. and Campylobacter spp. were quantified. A water sample was collected in winter and in summer at 3 sampling sites: the water source (A), the beginning (B) and the end (C) of the nipple line (168 samples in total). Chemical and physical quality of both TW and WW sources was mostly within the limits of TW for humans. However, high levels of hardness and iron were evidenced in both sources. In WW vs. TW, sulphate and salinity levels were significantly higher, whilst pH and nitrate levels were significantly lower. At site A, microbiological quality of WW and TW was mostly within the limit of TW for humans. However, both sources had a significantly lower microbiological quality at sites B and C. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Kentucky was isolated only twice from WW. Campylobacter spp. were rarely isolated (3.6% of farms); however, Campylobacter spp. farm-level prevalence by real-time PCR was up to 43% for both water sources. Winter posed at higher risk than summer for Campylobacter spp. presence in water, whereas no significant associations were found with water source, site, recirculation system, and turkey age. Low salinity and high hardness were significant risk factors for C. coli and C. jejuni presence, respectively. These results show the need of improving sanitization of drinking water pipelines for commercial turkeys.  aPublisher supplied data  aRC IZSVe 08/11aB21J12000280001cItalian Ministry of Health0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCampylobacter coli 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3aEnterococcus 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica 3aammonia 3achromium 3acopper 3across-sectional studies 3afarms 3ahardness 3ahumans 3airon 3amicrobiological quality 3amicroorganisms 3anitrates 3apH 3aphosphates 3apipelines 3aplate count 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3aserotypes 3asulfates 3asummer 3atap water 3aturkeys 3awater hardness 3awater salinity 3awell water 3awinter 3aItaly 0aCampylobacter 0achemical and physical quality 0adrinking water 0amicrobiological quality 0aturkey1 aPiccirillo, A.1 aGiacomelli, M.1 aComin, D.1 aGallina, A.1 aCapello, K.1 aBuniolo, F.1 aMontesissa, C.1 aBonfanti, L.0 tPoultry science.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 97, no. 8 p.2880-2886dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pey1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014400165300001600309520240700325592002802732650000902760650002602769650002302795650001802818650003102836650001602867650001802883650001702901700001902918700001602937700001802953700002002971773010502991856008103096852000903177655001203186IND60123679320221117234048.0150329e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012367932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-014-1044-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Hongtao12aA modified method for estimating fine and coarse fractal dimensions of soil particle size distributions based on laser diffraction analysis  ap. 937-948.  aPURPOSE: Particle size distribution (PSD) is one of the most commonly measured physical properties of soil. The fine fractal dimension, Df, and the coarse fractal dimension, Dc, are, respectively, based on the fine and coarse size fractions of soil particles. Laser diffraction effectively determines the volume PSD of soil. Original and modified methods for determining the Dfand Dcof the volume PSD of soil are derived and presented in this work. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The modified method is based on the assumption that the relationship between the number of particles and particle size is not linear. Dfand Dcare determined using the original and modified methods to analyze volume PSD of 11 soil samples through laser diffraction based on the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and International Soil Science Society (ISSS) systems. Some soils have coarse fragments ranging from 2 to 1 mm (USDA system) or from 2 to 0.2 mm (ISSS system) in size, comprising 0 % of the total volume. As log 0 does not exist, the original and modified methods based on USDA or ISSS systems are unsuitable for estimating Dc. The arithmetic mean of the R²values of the relevant log–log plots of all soil samples determined using the modified method to estimate Dfis larger than that of the original method based on the USDA and ISSS systems. Using the modified method to estimate Dfis therefore recommended. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The overall trend of the values obtained indicates that the Dfof coarse-textured soil approaches 2. If at least four decimal places are retained in estimations of Df, the probability of achieving identical Dfvalues for any two soil samples with different size fractions is low. In this case, Dfhelps characterize soil texture. The arithmetic mean of the Dfof all soil samples based on the USDA system is greater than that based on the ISSS system. Dfis evidently dependent on selected fractions of separates present in a soil related to texture. The performance of the original and modified methods to estimate Dfvalues based on the ISSS system is not good as indicated by F test at the significance level of 0.05. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the original and modified methods based on the ISSS system are both not useful in estimating Df. We recommend that future studies of fine fractal dimensions be made with USDA particle size fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3acoarse-textured soils 3afractal dimensions 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aprobability 3asoil sampling 3asoil texture1 aHorton, Robert1 aLei, Tingwu1 aDai, Zhenchao1 aWang, Xiangping0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2015 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.937-948dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-014-1044-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245005400169300001400223520093300237592002801170650002901198650002101227650002101248650001401269650001701283650001601300650001201316650001901328650001501347650001301362650001301375650001201388650002001400653001101420653002601431653002501457700001601482700001601498700002101514700001601535700002101551700001601572700001601588773015701604856008601761852000901847655001201856IND60721291320221120155952.0201224e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072129132DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-970X.2018.00014.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParmar, R.S.10aEndometrial carcinoma in a rabbit - a case report  ap. 74-76.  aA carcass of nearly 7 year old intact female New Zealand White rabbit was presented for postmortem examination.

However, the lack of collaborative engagement of stakeholders and unclear methodology around using futures studies in addressing land management undermine such plans and affect environmental governance. A crucial question is how to link a future-oriented process with governance transformation processes, particularly related to land-use planning and management. To address this issue, we used a co-elaborative scenario-building approach, referred to as participatory prospective analysis (PPA), to facilitate the creation of local multistakeholder platforms considering future-oriented perspectives. The PPA design combines equally the knowledge of local communities, technical experts and decision-makers, and was applied in a series of sequential multistakeholder workshops in two regencies in Indonesia, followed by public consultations on the main results. In both regencies, participants agreed on a common topic related to spatial planning in their jurisdiction to be explored with a 20-year time horizon. They reached consensus on relevant variables, analyzed their dependence/influence, and developed several plausible yet contrasting scenarios for land management and road maps with guidelines for the implementation of desired outcomes. The PPA approach stimulated stakeholder engagement and ensured that more local voices were not only heard but also duly included in the process. It allowed participants to consider strategies that would otherwise have been less readily accepted by their respective organizations. It showed that it is possible to improve existing spatial planning processes in Indonesia by integrating tools for a more inclusive and long-term future-oriented collaborative approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aenvironmental governance 3aenvironmental management 3aglobal change 3astakeholders 3aIndonesia1 aLiswanti, Nining1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5367-25271 aBourgeois, R.

The application of exogenous substances can enhance plant salt tolerance and increase its productivity under salinity stress. This work aimed to assess the mechanisms of selenium (Se) at different concentrations (2, 4 and 8 μM SeCl₂) to mitigate hazardous impacts of salt toxicity at physiological, biochemical and agronomic levels in bread wheat. The results displayed that Se foliar application increased chlorophyll content, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, relative water content, membrane stability index, excised leaf water retention, proline, total soluble sugars, Ca content, K content, antioxidant enzyme activities and non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds compared to untreated plants. On the other hand, Se application decreased the content of Na, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide contents.

The present work investigated for the first time the potential of using urban green waste as raw resource for the production of lignocellulosic fillers by dry fractionation (combination of sorting and grinding processes). Five fractions of lignocellulosic fillers with controlled composition were produced: a branches-rich fraction, a grasses-rich fraction, a leaves-rich fraction, and two fractions constituted of a mixture of constituents. All the fractions were ground to reach an average median diameter around 100 μm. The reinforcing effect of each fraction was investigated and compared to that of the sample as a whole. Biocomposites based on a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) as matrix were produced by melt extrusion, with filler contents up to 30 wt%. It was shown that the branches-rich fraction displayed the best reinforcing effect (e.g. stress at break of 37 ± 1 MPa for a filler content of 15 wt%, similar to that of the neat matrix) whereas the grasses-rich fraction slightly degraded the overall mechanical performance (e.g. stress at break of 33.5 ± 1.5 MPa for a filler content of 15 wt%). The dry fractionation and formulation steps could be thus adapted depending on the targeted application, e.g. by choosing to use the whole urban green waste resource, or to remove grasses, or to keep only branches.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiocomposites 3aextrusion 3afractionation 3agreen waste 3alignocellulose 0aUrban green waste 0aDry fractionation 0aLignocellulosic fillers1 aGontard, Nathalie1 aAngellier-Coussy, Hélène0 tWaste management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 120 p.538-548dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03554naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003500150245009400185300001600279520162300295592002801918650002501946650001601971650001401987650002702001650001902028650001802047650001702065650001302082650001102095650001302106650001702119650002102136650001602157650001302173653000802186653000802194653000902202653000802211653000802219653000902227653000902236653000702245653000802252653000802260653000802268653000902276653000902285653000802294653000802302653001002310653000902320653000802329653000802337653000802345653000702353653000802360653001002368653002602378653001602404653000802420653001602428653001502444700001802459700002302477700002702500700001702527700002202544773011202566856008502678852000902763655001202772IND60561870620221119161047.0180830e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056187062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2016.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolińska-Grabczyk, Aleksandra10aGas and water vapor transport properties of mixed matrix membranes containing 13X zeolite  ap. 334-347.  aMixed matrix membranes (MMM) containing 13X zeolite particles were prepared to study the impact of hydrophilic inorganic component on membrane gas and water vapor transport properties. Rubbery ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR), and glassy polysulfone (PSF) varying in permeability were selected as membrane matrices. The incorporation of 13X decreased gas permeability of all MMMs and had only a marginal effect on ideal selectivity (e.g. 20wt% loading reduced N2 permeability by 21%, 19%, and 4% for PSF, EVA, and HNBR, respectively). The observed trend was in agreement with the diminished free volume size obtained from the positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) measurements suggesting pore blockage. In contrary, water vapor permeability through all MMMs was significantly enhanced by zeolite filling (e.g. 30wt% loading increased H2O permeability by 153%, 34%, and 22% for PSF, EVA, and HNBR, respectively). This was explained as due to the increased water solubility documented by the sorption results, that compensates for the effect of the reduced water diffusivity in MMMs. The variations in MMMs permeabilities were also found to depend on zeolite particle size and its porosity. Two opposite effects were noticed of increased water vapor permeability and decreased gas permeability for MMMs filled with smaller but more porous particles. The water permeation through PSF based membranes may cause debonding at the particle/matrix interface and deterioration of the MMMs properties as indicated by their enhanced gas permeability and reduced selectivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3adiffusivity 3aelectrons 3aethylene-vinyl acetate 3ahydrophilicity 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3aporosity 3arubber 3asorption 3aspectroscopy 3awater solubility 3awater vapor 3azeolites 0aBET 0aDMF 0aEPDM 0aEVA 0aFAU 0aFWHM 0aHNBR 0aMD 0aMEK 0aMFI 0aMMM 0aPALS 0aPDMS 0aPES 0aPSF 0aPTMSP 0aPVAc 0aSEM 0aSTP 0aTAP 0aTg 0aTGA 0aZSM-5 0aMixed matrix membrane 0a13X zeolite 0aGas 0aWater vapor 0aPermeation1 aKubica, Piotr1 aJankowski, Andrzej1 aWójtowicz, Magdalena,1 aKansy, Jerzy1 aWojtyniak, Marcin0 tJournal of membrane science.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 526 p.334-347dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2016.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245012100202300001100323500001900334520182900353592002802182596011702210650003802327650001402365650002202379650003402401650001302435650001302448650001502461650001602476650000902492650001602501650001902517650001502536650003002551650001402581650001002595650002102605650001002626700002702636700002302663773011402686856008302800852000902883655001202892IND60733023120221116160948.0210506e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073302312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-021-01222-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUllah, Smi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0199-587410aGenome-wide association study of multiple traits linked to heat tolerance in emmer-derived hexaploid wheat genotypes  ap. 29.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHeat stress tolerance in plants is a complex trait controlled by multiple genes of minor effect which are influenced by the environment and this makes breeding and selection complicated. Emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccon Schrank) carries valuable diversity that can be used to improve the heat tolerance of modern bread wheat. A diverse set of emmer-based genotypes was developed by crossing emmer wheat with hexaploid wheat. These materials, along with their hexaploid recurrent parents and commercial cultivars, were evaluated at optimum (E1) and heat stressed (E2) sowing times in the field for three consecutive years (2014-2016). The material was genotyped using the Infinium iSelect SNP 90K SNP Assay. The phenotypic data were combined across years within each sowing time and best linear unbiased estimators calculated for each genotype in each environment. These estimates were used for GWAS analysis. Significant phenotypic and genotypic variation was observed for all traits. A total of 125 and 142 marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified in E1 and E2, respectively. The highest number of MTAs were observed on the A genome (106), followed by the B (105) and D (56) genomes. MTAs with pleiotropic effects within and across the environments were observed. Many of the MTAs found were reported previously for various traits, and a few significant MTAs under heat stress were new and linked to emmer genome. Genomic regions identified on chromosomes 2B and 3A had a significant positive impact on grain yield under stress with a 7% allelic effect. Genomic regions on chromosomes 1A and 4B contributed 11% and 9% of the variation for thousand kernel weight (TKW) under heat stress respectively. Following fine mapping, these regions could be used for marker-assisted selection to improve heat tolerance in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data  aUS00057, US00059, US00080, US00081 and Generation Challenge ProgramcGrains Research and Development Corporation 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccon 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3agrain yield 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahexaploidy 3amarker-assisted selection 3aphenotype 3aseeds 3astress tolerance 3awheat1 aRandhawa, Imtiaz A.

In a spatially explicit context, key features to consider are landscape spatial structure, local interactions, and dispersal. Substantial work has been done on each of these features as a driver of stability, but little is known on the interplay between them. Missing has been a more integrative approach, able to map and identify different dynamical regimes, predicting a system's response to perturbations. Here we first consider a simple scenario, i.e., the recovery of a homogeneous metapopulation from a single localized pulse disturbance. The analysis of this scenario reveals three fundamental recovery regimes: Isolated Regime when dispersal is not significant, Rescue Regime when dispersal mediates recovery, and Mixing Regime when perturbations spread throughout the system. Despite its simplicity, our approach leads to remarkably general predictions. These include the qualitatively different outcomes of various scenarios of habitat fragmentation, the surprising benefits of local extinctions on population persistence at the transition between regimes, and the productivity shifts of metacommunities in a changing environment. This study thus provides context to known results and insight into future directions of research.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐10‐LABX‐41cTULIP Laboratory of Excellence  cBIOSTASES Advanced Grant  a666971cEuropean Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aecosystems 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3amixing 3aprediction1 aArnoldi, Jean‐François1 aLoreau, Michel0 tEcology.g2019 Feb., v. 100, no. 2 p.e02586-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.25863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012200175300001600297500001900313520154200332592002801874650001701902650002101919650002201940650001401962650002301976650001101999651001002010653002202020653002202042653002302064653002502087700001902112773009902131856008402230852000902314655001202323IND60722157820221119123438.0201230e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072215782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2020.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Rana Rabnawaz10aMulti-stage network-based two-type cost minimization for the reverse logistics management of inert construction waste  ap. 805-819.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe growing concerns for achieving sustainability has gained much attention from waste management experts with particular focus on reverse logistics, as it supports concepts like circular economy, material recovery, and improved environmental performances. This paper describes a multi-stage network-based model to minimize the overall cost for the reverse logistics management of inert construction waste across its entire life cycle. This model takes a unique two-type costing approach to overcome the ambiguities and deficiencies existing in previous models. Type-I cost refers to the facility-based costing (FBC) and Type-II cost refers to non-facility based costing (NFBC). The mixed-integer linear programming technique is applied using the LINGO software. A case study of construction waste management in Hong Kong is conducted to validate the developed model, which includes waste generation point as the starting node, public fill reception facility and recycling facility as an intermediate node, and landfill as an ending node. The result shows about 24% reduction in the total cost compared to the base case. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of uncertainties on the cost parameters, a detailed scenario based sensitivity analysis is conducted. The optimal result shows that the larger portion of total cost come from the NFBC component. Therefore, NFBC is critical in defining the overall reverse logistics network and thus, should be given more emphasis in the design of an effective construction waste management system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3acomputer software 3alandfills 3amanagement systems 3awastes 3aChina 0aCost minimization 0aReverse logistics 0aConstruction waste 0aNetwork optimization1 aZhang, Xueqing0 tWaste management.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 120 p.805-819dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2020.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011900165300001600284500001900300520148400319592002801803650001301831650000801844650001801852650001601870650001101886650001101897650000901908650001501917650001801932650002401950650001701974650002201991650001902013650001102032650001102043650001602054650001602070650001502086650001102101651001002112700001202122700001602134700001902150700001502169773012102184856008102305852000902386655001202395IND60736593520221116212556.0210510e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073659352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-021-1209-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xingjie10aSpatio-temporal Characteristics of Atmospheric Pollution and Cause Analysis of Haze Events in Sichuan Basin, China  ap. 539-557.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study analyzed the spatio-temporal variability of air quality data for six standard air pollutants (Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM₂.₅), Particulate Matter 10 (PM₁₀), SO₂, NO₂, CO, and O₃) in the Sichuan Basin (SCB), China from 2015 to 2018 in relation to the formation of haze using conventional meteorological data (temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity), satellite data (fire point data, vertical profiles of aerosol subtypes, and aerosol optical depth), planetary boundary layer height, and backward trajectories. The results indicated that the spatio-temporal evolution of the air quality index (AQI) had notable seasonality for the pollution severity in descending order: winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Autumn and winter severe haze events occurred in November and January, respectively, and were caused by higher local pollution emissions under stagnant air conditions. Spring severe haze events occurred in May and were caused by dust from Northwest China and local regions. Severe summer haze events occurred in July and were caused by local burning. Therefore, the analyses showed that local burning, stagnant meteorological conditions, air mass transport and anthropogenic pollution emissions played a key role in haze in the SCB. This study provides scientific insights for fully analyzing heavy air pollution in SCB, China, and also provides a scientific basis for pollution research in regions of complex terrain as basins and mountains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aautumn 3abasins 3adust 3alandscapes 3amass transfer 3ameteorological data 3aparticulates 3arelative humidity 3aremote sensing 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atroposphere 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina1 aGuo, Ke1 aLiang, Yuan1 aZhang, Tingbin1 aWang, Guxi0 tChinese geographical science.g2021 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.539-557dScience PresswJournal:J000001700x1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-021-1209-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100003800180245011800218300001600336506007600352520163200428592002802060506003702088650002502125650001502150650002702165650001102192650002702203650000902230650002302239650002502262650002302287650000902310650001702319650001202336650002102348650002202369650001602391650001802407650002502425650001402450700003902464700003102503700003202534773013102566856007302697852000902770655001202779IND60649886720221207113552.0190707e20140127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064988672DNAL7 a10.3390/nu60204892doi7 aPMC39427122pmcid7 a244732322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMojica-Villegas, María Angélica10aProtective Effect of Resveratrol on Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress Induced by Iron/Ascorbate in Mouse Spermatozoa  ap. 489-503.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aResveratrol (RVT) is a polyphenolic compound found mainly in the grape and attributed with various pharmacological properties, among them their antioxidant activity. In the present study, we assess the antioxidant activity of resveratrol on oxidative damage induced by ferrous iron/ascorbate (100 µM/150 µM) in sperm of CD1+ mice. We evaluated several parameters in spermatozoa treated with or without resveratrol: (i) sperm quality analysis; (ii) mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δѱₘ); (iii) ROS generation; (iv) superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity; (v) glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity; (vi) lipid peroxidation; (vii) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) capability. Spermatozoa treated with RVT (15 µg/mL) before ferrous iron/ascorbate treatment exhibited: a significant increase in motility (8-fold), a significant increase in viability (2-fold), a significant increase in Δѱₘ (1.15-fold), accompanied with a significant decrease in the generation of ROS (4.96-fold), a significant decrease in GPX activity (1.32-fold), and a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation concentration (10.29-fold) relative to spermatozoa treated with ferrous iron/ascorbate; however, no changes in SOD activity were observed. Finally, spermatozoa treated with RVT before ferrous iron/ascorbate treatment showed a significant increase in oocyte fertilization (1.2-fold), relative to spermatozoa treated with ferrous iron/ascorbate. These results suggest that RVT possesses antioxidant properties that may prevent the deleterious effects produced by oxidative damage on spermatozoa, resulting in the maintenance of fertility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrapes 3ain vitro fertilization 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3amedicinal properties 3amembrane potential 3amice 3amitochondria 3aoocytes 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3aresveratrol 3asperm quality 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aviability1 aIzquierdo-Vega, Jeannett Alejandra1 aChamorro-Cevallos, Germán1 aSánchez-Gutiérrez, Manuel0 tNutrients.g2014 Jan. 27, v. 6, no. 2 p.489-503dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu60204893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245012900202300001800331520092100349592002801270596007001298650001401368650001301382650004101395650001101436650001101447650001301458650001101471650001501482650001101497650001601508650002101524650002001545700005401565700005701619700005301676700005501729773012101784856008201905852000901987655001201996IND60675954420221119120558.0191112e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067595442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-019-04037-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Liuyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9908-683010aBenzene–toluene–xylene (BTX) from p-cresol by hydrodeoxygenation over nickel phosphide catalysts with different supports  ap. 1614-1626.  aNi₂P catalysts supported on different supports, such as SiO₂ from different sources, Al₂O₃, TiO₂ and ZrO₂ were prepared for the hydrodeoxygenation of p-cresol (monocyclic phenol model in coal tar). The reaction was carried out on a fixed-bed reactor at a temperature of 330–390 °C under 2 MPa. The order of conversion of p-cresol was as follows: Ni₂P/SiO₂-2 > Ni₂P/SiO₂-3 > Ni₂P/SiO₂-1 > Ni₂P/Al₂O₃ > Ni₂P/ZrO₂ > Ni₂P/TiO₂. Ni₂P/SiO₂-3 shown higher DDO path selectivity, resulting in the conversion of p-cresol of 93% and a selectivity of 72.6% for BTX products under the reaction temperature of 370 °C with LHSV of 0.5 h⁻¹. This catalyst was also used for the hydrodeoxygenation of the crude phenolic mixture extracted from coal tar, which shown that the phenol deoxidation rate was 87.6% and the BTX product selectivity was 73.7% by GC–MS.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018GY-087cShaanxi Province Key Research and Development Program 3acatalysts 3acoal tar 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amodels 3anickel 3ap-cresol 3aphenol 3aphosphides 3asilica 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3azirconium oxide1 aHe, Yulong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0096-93781 aNiu, Menglong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6730-41431 aDan, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2326-90911 aLi, Wenhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1479-14270 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Feb., v. 55, no. 4 p.1614-1626dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-019-04037-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171300001600268500001900284520104400303592002801347650001501375650002201390650001801412650001301430650001401443650001201457650002401469650001201493650001201505650002001517650002201537650001201559650001401571653001901585653001701604653003001621700002201651700002401673700002301697773013601720856008501856852000901941655001201950IND60692794720221120164212.0200503e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069279472DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2016.12779432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanou, Mikihito10aMid-infrared spectroscopic analysis of saccharides in aqueous solutions with sodium chloride  ap. 735-742.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe infrared spectral characteristics of three different types of disaccharides (trehalose, maltose, and sucrose) and four different types of monosaccharides (glucose, mannose, galactose, and fructose) in aqueous solutions with sodium chloride (NaCl) were determined.

This study also focused on not only the glycosidic linkage position and the constituent monosaccharides, but also the concentration of the saccharides and NaCl and found that they have a significant influence on the infrared spectroscopic characterization of the disaccharides in an aqueous solution with NaCl. The absorption intensities representing the interaction between a saccharide and water with NaCl were spectroscopically determined.

Traditional approaches to understanding these declines focus on searching for climatic or other broad‐scale extrinsic drivers. These approaches include multi‐proxy studies that match reconstructed changes in tree abundance to reconstructed changes in precipitation or temperature. Although these correlative approaches are informative, they neglect the potential role of intrinsic processes, such as competition and dispersal, in shaping tree community dynamics. We developed a simple process‐based community model that includes competition among tree species, density‐dependent survival, and dispersal to investigate how these processes might generate abrupt changes in tree abundances even when extrinsic climatic factors do not themselves change abruptly. Specifically, a self‐reinforcing (i.e., positive) feedback between abundance and survival can produce abrupt changes in tree abundance in the absence of long‐term climatic changes. Furthermore, spatially correlated, short‐term environmental variation and seed dispersal can increase the synchrony of abrupt changes. Using the well‐studied, late‐Holocene crash of Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) populations as an empirical case study, we find that our model generates abrupt and quasi‐synchronized crashes qualitatively similar to the observed hemlock patterns. Other tree taxa vary in the frequency and clustering of abrupt change and the proportion of increases and decreases. This complexity argues for caution in interpreting abrupt changes in species abundances as indicative of abrupt climatic changes. Nonetheless, some taxa show patterns that the model cannot produce: observed abrupt declines in hemlock abundance are more synchronized than abrupt increases, whereas the degree of synchronization is the same for abrupt decreases and increases in the model. Our results show that intrinsic processes can be significant contributing factors in abrupt tree population changes and highlight the diagnostic value of analyzing entire time series rather than single events when testing hypotheses about abrupt changes. Thus, intrinsic processes should be considered along with extrinsic drivers when seeking to explain rapid changes in community composition.  aPublisher supplied data  cWisconsin Alumni Research Foundation  a144‐PRJ82RZcNSF  a144‐AAB2562cNSF 3aTsuga canadensis 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acommunity structure 3adisease diagnosis 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3aseed dispersal 3atemperate forests 3atemperature 3atime series analysis 3atrees 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aStegner, M.

The method applied was based on an existing procedure in computational gastronomy, wherein the preference for positive pairing is attributed to dairy-based ingredients and negative pairing behaviour is attributed primarily to spice based ingredients. Recipe data was subjected to backbone extraction, projection of the recipe-ingredient-compound tri-partite network, and analysis for prevalence and authenticity of ingredients. Further, the average flavour sharing index of the cuisine was determined with the help of the flavour profiles of the ingredients. The extent of deviation for the original cuisine in comparison to a random cuisine was used to determine the degree of bias in the food pairing behaviour, with the sign as the indicator of the nature of pairing. The analysis identified the ingredients responsible to exhibit a positive or negative pairing pattern in the sub-cuisines. The ingredients from the spice category were the most prevalent and have resulted in the negative pairing behaviour in the cuisines. This role of spices in effecting a negative pairing behaviour is in line with the earlier reports for other Indian regional cuisines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acuisine 3aflavor 3agastronomy 3aresearch 3aspices 3aIndia 0aNetwork theory 0aComputational gastronomy 0aFood-pairing 0aFlavour compounds 0aIngredients 0aRecipe1 aHazarika, M.K.0 tCurrent research in food science.g2022, v. 5 p.1038-1046dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27271x2665-92717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2022.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011400163300001600277500001900293520174300312592002802055650002702083650002602110650002002136650002302156650002502179650001902204650001602223650001602239650003002255650002902285650001102314651001002325700002002335700001802355773012102373856008102494852000902575655001202584IND60736593720221116212640.0210510e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073659372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-021-1200-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Wenwen10aAgricultural Non-point Source Pollution in China: Evaluation, Convergence Characteristics and Spatial Effects  ap. 571-584.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, an inventory analysis approach was used to investigate the intensity of agricultural non-point source pollution (ANSP) and its spatial convergence at national and provincial levels in China from 1999 to 2017. On this basis, spatial factors affecting ANSP were explored by constructing a spatial econometric model. The results indicate that: 1) The intensity of China’s ANSP emission showed an overall upward trend and an obvious spatial difference, with the values being high in the eastern and central regions and relatively low in the western region. 2) Significant spatial agglomeration was shown in China’s ANSP intensity, and the agglomeration effect was increasing gradually. 3) In the convergence analysis, a spatial lag model was found applicable for interpretation of the ANSP intensity, with the convergence rate being accelerated after considering the spatial factors but slower than that of regional economic growth. 4) The spatial factors affecting the ANSP intensity are shown to be reduced by improving agricultural infrastructure investment, labor-force quality, and crop production ratio, while the expansion of agricultural economy scale and precipitation and runoff have positive impact on ANSP in the study region. However, agricultural research and development (R&D) investment showed no direct significant effect on the ANSP intensity. Meanwhile, improving the quality of the labor force would significantly reduce the ANSP intensity in the surrounding areas, while the precipitation and runoff would significantly increase the pollution of neighboring regions. This research has laid a theoretical basis for formulation and optimization of ANSP prevention strategies in China and related regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aagricultural research 3acrop production 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic development 3ainfrastructure 3ainventories 3alabor force 3anonpoint source pollution 3aresearch and development 3arunoff 3aChina1 aZhong, Zhangbao1 aLi, Zhaoliang0 tChinese geographical science.g2021 June, v. 31, no. 3 p.571-584dScience PresswJournal:J000001700x1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-021-1200-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245013500168520110300303592002801406650002201434650001101456650001401467650001301481650002201494650002601516650002301542650002101565650001601586650001801602650002501620650001301645650001401658653001101672653000801683653000801691653001001699653002101709700001301730700001601743700001701759700001401776700001401790700001601804700001701820773012001837856008801957852000902045655001202054IND60778006820221122010046.0220726e20220910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077800682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Dong10aOrdered porous nitrogen-doped carbon with atomically dispersed FeN4 for efficient oxygen reduction reaction in microbial fuel cell  aIt is necessary to develop cost-effective platinum group materials (PGM)-free cathode catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to replace the state-of-the-art noble metal for the commercialization of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Fe-N-C catalysts are one of the promising candidates for commercial Pt/C. Herein, a new cost-effective and highly stable Fe-N-C catalyst was designed and successfully prepared via a facile process. The catalyst was prepared through one single thermal conversion from Fe-doped ZIF-8 (zeolitic imidazolate framework), a metal-organic framework (MOF) containing well-defined FeN₄ coordination. The mesopores in the unique structure of MOF promoted efficient mass transfer, while those arising from the pyrolysis of the MOF produced more active sites. Unlike previous preparation methods, post-treatments were avoided here. As a result, the Fe-N-C cathode had a high ORR activity with a half-wave potential (E₁/₂) of 0.85 V in a 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution. The classic MFC with this cathodic catalyst provided a maximum power density of up to 1508 mW m⁻².  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3acommercialization 3acoordination polymers 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aenvironment 3amass transfer 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aplatinum 3apyrolysis 0aFe-N-C 0aORR 0aMFC 0aZIF-8 0aElectrocatalysis1 aLiu, Hao1 aCao, Ziqing1 aCai, Tianhao1 aHan, Peng1 aSong, Jun1 aKong, Liang1 aLiu, Changfa0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Sept. 10, v. 838 p.156186-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1561863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01835naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012500158300001600283500001400299520036800313592002800681650002500709650002600734650002100760650002300781650002600804650001800830650002000848650002200868653001900890653003000909653005200939653007900991700001701070700002101087700001801108700002201126773018201148856007401330852000901404655001201413IND60691921220221119182031.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069192122DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.4842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYADA, Hiroshi10a(-)-Semivioxanthin, A New Abscisic Active Compound against Hinoki Cypress Leaves Isolated from Cryptosporiopsis abietina  ap. 484-486.  aNAL-light  aThe new naphthopyrone, (-)-semivioxanthin (1) was isolated from Cryptosporiopsis abietina.

II. Cation exchange  ap. 7110-7129.  aThe contribution of cation exchange to solute retention for type-B alkylsilica columns (made from high-purity silica) has been examined in terms of the hydrophobic-subtraction (H-S) model of reversed-phase column selectivity. The relative importance of cation exchange in the separation of ionized bases by reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) varies with (a) column acidity (values of the column cation-exchange capacity C), (b) mobile-phase pH and buffer concentration, and (c) the nature of the buffer cation. The effects of each of these separation variables on cation retention were examined. The contribution of cation exchange (and other ionic interactions) to solute retention is represented in the H-S model by properties of the solute (κ′) and column (C), respectively. Values of κ′ for 87 solutes have been examined as a function of solute molecular structure, and values of C for 167 type-B alkylsilica columns have been related to various column properties: ligand length (e.g., C₈ vs. C₁₈) and concentration (μmol/m²), pore diameter (nm), and end-capping. These results contribute to a more detailed picture of the retention of cationic solutes in RPC as a function of separation conditions. While previous work suggests that the ionization of type-B alkylsilica columns is generally negligible with mobile-phase pH<7 (as a result of which cation exchange then becomes insignificant), the present study provides evidence for cation exchange (and presumably silanol ionization) at a pH as low as 3 for most columns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3acation exchange 3acation exchange capacity 3achemical structure 3aionization 3amodels 3apH 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asilica 3asolutes1 aCarr, P.W.1 aMcCalley, D.V.1 aNeue, U.D.1 aDolan, J.W.1 aSnyder, L.R.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 Oct. 7, v. 1218, no. 40 p.7110-7129dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2011.07.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245014900210300001800359506011700377506007600494520162800570592002802198506003702226650002902263650001702292650001302309650001102322650002102333650001402354650001302368650001002381650002402391650001602415650001302431650001502444650001202459650002302471650002102494653001402515653001502529653001102544700002402555700001602579700001602595700001602611773010902627856004902736852000902785655001202794IND60780429620221207143846.0220619s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078042962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.crfs.2022.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSıçramaz, Hatice1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5943-956610aImpact of different starter cultures and Lactobacillus helveticus on volatile components, chemical and sensory properties of pasta filata cheese  ap. 1009-1016.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aL.helveticus is known to follow mainly similar metabolic pathways to contribute to cheese flavor with S. thermophilus and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. In this study, the flavor contributions of commercial S. thermophilus starter cultures of different brands and L. helveticus adjunct culture to pasta filata type fresh Kashar cheese were investigated. L. helveticus affected the buttery aroma components of fresh Kashar cheese and resulted in low diacetyl content. In addition, acetaldehyde and other aroma components of L. helveticus added cheese was found to be higher than control and modified control cheeses. On the other hand, the modified control sample containing S. thermophilus from Danisco instead of Chr-Hansen in the control was closer to the control sample in terms of volatile profile. As the shelf-life progressed, the contribution of alcohols and hydrocarbons to volatile components decreased, while the contribution of ketones, which was the dominant group, increased in all products. When the proteolysis and lipolysis levels were examined, the control sample differed from the other two cheese samples with its high proteolysis and lipolysis rate. In summary, the rates of increase in water-soluble nitrogen and free fatty acid contents in 8 weeks of storage (from 18 to 72 days) were determined as 61% and 47%, respectively, in the control Kashar cheese, while it was 39% and 27% in the L. helveticus added sample, and 37% and 28% in the modified control sample. Finally, the sensory scores revealed that cheese flavor and texture preferences could be increased with the addition of L. helveticus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aacetaldehyde 3adiacetyl 3aflavor 3afree fatty acids 3alipolysis 3anitrogen 3aodors 3apasta filata cheese 3aproteolysis 3aresearch 3ashelf life 3atexture 3avolatile compounds 3awater solubility 0aVolatiles 0aSPME-GC-MS 0aKashar1 aGüven, Olgu Taylan1 aCan, Ayşen1 aAyar, Ahmet1 aGül, Yasin0 tCurrent research in food science.g2022, v. 5 p.1009-1016dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27271x2665-92717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.crfs.2022.05.017  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245015400171300001400325520138900339592002801728650001601756650002201772650001301794650001401807650001701821650001801838650001101856650001601867650002401883650001601907650001001923650001201933650001501945650001601960650001401976650001501990650001702005650002102022650001102043653002302054653002802077653002602105653002302131653002302154653001502177700001902192700002002211773010902231856008602340852000902426655001202435IND60732792420221119232503.0210513e20210520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073279242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakankun, Irene10aProteomic analyses of the oleaginous and carotenogenic yeast Rhodotorula diobovata across growth phases under nitrogen- and oxygen-limited conditions  ap. 11-19.  aCarotenoids and triacylglycerols from yeasts are important bioproducts that can be utilized for the nutraceutical and biodiesel industries respectively. Rhodotorula diobovata is capable of producing these bioproducts under varied culture conditions. These productions have been linked to the early stationary growth phase and their levels only start to decline at the late stationary phase when carbon becomes limiting. While nitrogen-limitation influences the onset of lipogenesis, continuous synthesis and accumulation of neutral lipids (triacylglycerides) may be dependent on other culture conditions such as aeration. Proteomic analyses were conducted to enhance our understanding of changes in gene product expression under culture conditions with nitrogen-limitation, coupled with insufficient aeration, and revealed a correlation between the upregulation of proteins in the lipolysis pathways and the reduced synthesis of fatty acids at the early stationary phase. Upregulation of glycolytic pathway enzymes suggested that glucose was quickly converted into pyruvate and then acetyl-CoA. However, acetyl-CoA flux favoured carotenoids biosynthesis over fatty acid synthesis, as cells transitioned into the stationary phase. This work provides insights into how culture conditions influence gene product expression levels, pathway utilization, and end-product synthesis patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodotorula 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aaeration 3abiodiesel 3abiosynthesis 3abiotechnology 3acarbon 3acarotenoids 3adietary supplements 3afatty acids 3agenes 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3alipogenesis 3alipolysis 3aproteomics 3apyruvic acid 3atriacylglycerols 3ayeasts 0aLipid biosynthesis 0aCarotenoid biosynthesis 0aRhodotorula diobovata 0aCulture conditions 0aCell growth phases 0aProteomics1 aSpicer, Victor1 aLevin, David B.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2021 May 20, v. 332 p.11-19dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03812naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245013700179300001800316520209700334592002802431650002302459650000902482650001602491650001102507650001202518650002902530650002802559650002502587650000902612650002602621650002802647650002402675650001302699650001902712650001702731650001802748650001802766650002102784650001802805650001402823650002402837650001802861650001302879650002702892653001702919653001102936653001602947700002202963700002002985773014703005856008503152852000903237655001203246IND60672021120221121045636.0191008e20190925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067202112DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2018.14658882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaskins, Christopher P.10aMeat, eggs, full-fat dairy, and nutritional boogeymen: Does the way in which animals are raised affect health differently in humans?  ap. 2709-2719.  aBackground: Food recommendations to improve cancer prevention are generally based on epidemiologic data and remain inconsistent. These epidemiologic studies, while controversial, have generally produced results that caution against the consumption of high-fat foods, including eggs, red meat, and full-fat dairy, such as butter and cheese. Yet, limited data exist assessing the quality of individual sources of these foods and the effect each has after its consumption. This study set out to assess the impact sources of food within the same groups from animals raised differently on variables associated with health in human studies. Methods and Materials: A search was conducted through MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed. In total, twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria, measuring physiologic changes in humans after consuming animal products following animal diet manipulation. A meta-analysis was attempted to assess the differences between the cohorts in these studies, but was aborted due to poor study quality, vast differences in study design, and a limited number of studies. Results: Studies varied by animal, animal diet manipulation, food product, and overall design. Significant differences were present between groups eating the same food (cheese, beef, eggs, and butter) from animals raised differently, including levels of: conjugated linoleic acid, omega-3 fatty acids (alpha linoleic acid [ALA], docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]), and inflammatory factors (triacyl glycerol [TAG], interleukin-6 [IL-6], interleukin-8 [IL-8], tumor necrosis factor [TNF], and C-reactive protein [CRP]). Lipid levels were minimally affected. Conclusions: This work highlights differences in human health markers after consumption of the same foods from animals raised differently. Overall, lipid levels remained relatively neutral, but significant changes in inflammatory and other serum markers and phospholipids were present. Future studies and dietary recommendations should consider how animals are raised, as this can produce different effects on health markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3abeef 3ablood serum 3abutter 3acheeses 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adietary recommendations 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeggs 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aepidemiological studies 3aexperimental design 3aglycerol 3ahigh fat foods 3ahuman health 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3ameat consumption 3ameta-analysis 3aneoplasms 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aphospholipids 3ared meat 3atumor necrosis factors 0aDiet quality 0acancer 0aanimal food1 aHenderson, George1 aChamp, Colin E.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2019 Sept. 25, v. 59, no. 17 p.2709-2719dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2018.14658883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245014900213300001200362520158500374592002801959596004501987650001302032650001802045650001402063650002002077650002002097650001002117650001902127650001802146650001302164773013202177856008302309852000902392655001202401IND60733023720221116161140.0210908e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073302372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-021-02668-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Sheshtawy, Reda I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5016-569610aEffect of Tris-extender supplemented with a combination of turmeric and ethylene glycol on buffalo bull semen freezability and in vivo fertility  ap. 238.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Tris-extender supplemented with a combination of turmeric and ethylene glycol on buffalo bull semen preservability and in vivo fertility. Five tubes (each contain 5 ml Tris-citric acid-fructose yolk, TCFY). The first tube contains turmeric extract and ethylene glycol and kept as a control. The other four tubes contain 1.5% ethylene glycol plus turmeric extract as follows: 100 μl/5 ml, 200 μl/5 ml, 300 μl/5 ml, and 400 μl/5 ml v/v). Pooled bull semen was added to the Tris extender and to Tris turmeric ethylene glycol. Extended semen was subjected to semen freezing protocol. Semen assessment was carried out. In Tris turmeric ethylene glycol post-cooling, sperm motility and alive sperms were significantly higher in the first concentration of Tris turmeric ethylene glycol (TTE₁), sperm abnormalities were significantly lower in TTE₁ and TTE₂, and sperm membrane integrity (HOST) was significantly higher in TTE₁ and acrosome percent was significantly higher in TTE₁, TTE₂, and TTE₄ if compared to the control. Post-thawing, sperm motility was significantly higher in TTE₁ as compared to the control and other concentrations of TE. All concentrations of TE were significantly higher in sperm membrane integrity (HOST) as relative to the control. Alive sperms were kept in TTE₁ as the control. Acrosome percent was kept in most concentrations as the control. It is concluded that, in cooled and post-thawed semen, the first concentration (TTE₁) gave the best sperm quality and conception rate.  aPublisher supplied data  a10120801cNational Research Centre,Egypt 3aacrosome 3aanimal health 3abuffaloes 3aconception rate 3aethylene glycol 3asemen 3asperm motility 3asperm quality 3aturmeric0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 May, v. 53, no. 2 p.238-238dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02668-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010500163300001600268500001400284520121000298592002801508650001101536650001801547650001401565650000901579650001701588650001201605650003501617650002401652650001401676653002101690653003001711653003401741653003601775653002301811700002101834773018201855856007402037852000902111655001202120IND60691921520221119182053.0200502e20010101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069192152DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.65.4952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBENZERROUK, Rachid10aHepatic Mitochondrial Proteins in Congenitally Hyperammonemic spf Mice: Effect of Acetyl-L-carnitine  ap. 495-500.  aNAL-light  aThe sparse-fur (spf) mutant mouse has an X-linked deficiency of hepatic ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), and develops hyperammonemia immediately after weaning and maintains it throughout its life span. We have studied the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) on the hepatic mitochondrial proteins of the chronically hyperammonemic spf mice. Two different age groups of mice were studied, the weanlings (3 weeks) and the adult mice (8 weeks). Our results indicate that in the mitochondrial matrix, the untreated chronic hyperammonemia induced a significant increase in the quantity of 54.4-kDa protein in spf adult mice. After ALCAR treatment, in spf adult mice, the quantities of the 54.4-kDa, 63.8-kDa, and 129-kDa matrix proteins were significantly increased. In the mitochondrial inner membrane fraction of the spf weanling mice, a 53.5-kDa protein was significantly increased by ALCAR treatment. Our results show that: (a) chronic hyperammonemia has altered the mitochondrial matrix protein profile in spf mice, that (b) ALCAR has a modulating effect on various matrix and inner membrane proteins, and that (c) there was no effect of hyperammonemia or ALCAR treatment on the outer membrane proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiotechnology 3alongevity 3amice 3amitochondria 3amutants 3aornithine carbamoyltransferase 3aprotein composition 3aweanlings 0asparse-fur mouse 0acongenital hyperammonemia 0amitochondrial matrix proteins 0amitochondrial membrane proteins 0aacetyl-L-carnitine1 aQURESHI, Ijaz A.0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2001 Jan. 1, v. 65, no. 3 p.495-500dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.65.4953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014400164300001800308520162800326592002801954596007001982650002802052650001202080650002302092650002102115650004102136650001402177650001902191650001002210650001402220650001202234650003102246650001802277650000902295700001402304700001402318700001602332773013302348856008202481852000902563655001202572IND60742923520221121224608.0210627e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074292352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-021-01292-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qifan10aResearch on VOCs and odor from heartwood and sapwood of paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera (L.)

To reduce this problem of odorous compounds contained in wood panel, this study focused on identifying odorant compounds and exploring the influence of moisture content factors on VOCs and odor emissions. Paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera (L.)Vent.) was investigated using the technology of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactory (GC–MS/O). Total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) and characteristic odor-active compounds were studied, and the emission of heartwood and sapwood of paper mulberry was compared at the same time. It was found that the main components from heartwood and sapwood were aromatics, alkanes, alkenes, aldehydes ketones, alcohols and esters. Totally, 23 kinds of odor-active compounds were identified from heartwood and sapwood of paper mulberry, among which, aromatics and aldehydes ketones were the main odorant compounds. Seven kinds of key odorant compounds were identified in this process. With the decrease in moisture content, the TVOC and total odor intensity of heartwood and sapwood generally decreased. The moisture content had a great effect on VOC release when the moisture content decreased from 70 to 50% and reduced from fiber saturation point (30%) to air saturation point (10%). The main odor impressions of paper mulberry were aromatic, fresh fruit fragrance, sweet scent and special pungent. In the whole process of moisture content decrease, the TVOC, concentration of odorant and odor intensity of sapwood were higher than that of heartwood.  aPublisher supplied data  a31971582cProject of National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBroussonetia papyrifera 3aalkenes 3aaromatic compounds 3afiber saturation 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheartwood 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3araw fruit 3asapwood 3avolatile organic compounds 3awater content 3awood1 aShen, Jun1 aZeng, Bin1 aWang, Huiyu0 tWood science and technology.g2021 July, v. 55, no. 4 p.1153-1170dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-021-01292-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013100159300002000290520173300310592002802043650004402071650001602115650003402131650002202165650001502187650001502202650001102217650002202228650002602250650002902276650001302305650000902318650001402327650001402341650002402355650002102379650001102400650000702411650001402418650001302432650001302445700001702458700002602475773012702501856007502628852000902703655001202712IND60535743820221116175110.0160805e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053574382DNAL7 a10.1021/es503606j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChubar, Natalia10aMechanism of Selenite Removal by a Mixed Adsorbent Based on Fe–Mn Hydrous Oxides Studied Using X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy  ap. 13376-13383.  aSelenium cycling in the environment is greatly controlled by various minerals, including Mn and Fe hydrous oxides. At the same time, such hydrous oxides are the main inorganic ion exchangers suitable (on the basis of their chemical nature) to sorb (toxic) anions, separating them from water solutions. The mechanism of selenite adsorption by the new mixed adsorbent composed of a few (amorphous and crystalline) phases [maghemite, MnCO₃, and X-ray amorphous Fe(III) and Mn(III) hydrous oxides] was studied by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy [supported by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) data]. The complexity of the porous adsorbent, especially the presence of the amorphous phases of Fe(III) and Mn(III) hydrous oxides, is the main reason for its high selenite removal performance demonstrated by batch and column adsorption studies shown in the previous work. Selenite was bound to the material via inner-sphere complexation (via oxygen) to the adsorption sites of the amorphous Fe(III) and Mn(III) oxides. This anion was attracted via bidentate binuclear corner-sharing coordination between SeO₃²– trigonal pyramids and both FeO₆ and MnO₆ octahedra; however, the adsorption sites of Fe(III) hydrous oxides played a leading role in selenite removal. The contribution of the adsorption sites of Mn(III) oxide increased as the pH decreased from 8 to 6. Because most minerals have a complex structure (they are seldom based on individual substances) of various crystallinity, this work is equally relevant to environmental science and environmental technology because it shows how various solid phases control cycling of chemical elements in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aanions 3acrystal structure 3aenvironmental science 3aenvironmental technology 3ageometry 3airon 3amaghemite 3amanganese 3amanganese carbonate 3amanganese oxides 3aoxygen 3apH 3aselenites 3aselenium 3atoxicity1 aGerda, Vasyl1 aSzlachta, Małgorzata0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 48, no. 22 p.13376-13383dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes503606j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010800165300001600273500001400289520154900303592002801852650001801880650003401898650001901932650001201951650001601963650001401979650002301993650001702016650001602033650002202049650001602071650001902087650001102106650001402117650001502131650002802146653002702174653001602201653001902217653002002236653001202256700002002268700002102288700001702309700001602326700001502342700001502357700001802372773012302390856008602513852000902599655001202608IND60706887820221122051325.0201104e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070688782DNAL7 a10.1016/S1875-5364(20)30068-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCUI, Ning10aComplete chloroplast genome of Salvia plebeia: organization, specific barcode and phylogenetic analysis  ap. 563-572.  aNAL-light  aSalvia plebeia has been in use as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for more than 500 years. In this study, the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of S. plebeia was sequenced, assembled and compared to those of other five published Salvia cp genomes. It was found that the cp genome structure of S. plebeia was well conserved and had a total size of 151 062 bp. Four parameters were used to display the usage conditions of the codons of the amino acids in Salvia genus. Although the number of protein-coding genes in each species was the same, the total number of codons was different. Except for amino acids Trp and Met whose Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) value of one condon was equal to 1, the remaining 19 amino acids had 1−3 preferred codons. The preferred codon names of each amino acid were coincident. The period size for the tandem repeats of six species ranged from 9 to 410 bp. Salvia cp genomes mainly possessed tandem repeats with a copy number less than or equal to 3. The sequence length of tandem repeats of the six species ranged from 25 to 824 bp. Highly viarable regions including four intergenic spacers and six partial genes were discovered as potential specific barcodes for Salvia species through cp genome-wide comparison. Finally, we performed phylogenetic analyses based on the complete cp genome and coding sequences respectively. These results provide information to help construct the cp genome library for Salvia, which may support studies of phylogenetics, DNA barcoding, population and transplastomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aSalvia plebeia 3aTrigona 3aamino acids 3abarcoding 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3acodon usage 3agenomic libraries 3ainformation 3aintergenic DNA 3alength 3aphylogeny 3apopulation 3atandem repeat sequences 0aSimple sequence repeat 0aChloroplast 0aTandem repeats 0aMicrosatellites 0aBarcode1 aLIAO, Bao-Sheng1 aLIANG, Cong-Lian1 aLI, Shi-Feng1 aZhang, Hao,1 aXu, Jiang,1 aLI, Xi-Wen1 aChen, Shi-Lin0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2020 Aug., v. 18, no. 8 p.563-572dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(20)30068-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011700167300001800284520111300302592002801415650001301443650001401456650001801470650000901488650000901497650001901506650001201525650002001537650004101557650001601598650001901614653001901633653001801652653000901670653002801679653002701707700001801734700001901752700001901771700001701790773011601807856008601923852000902009655001202018IND60088029420221118013535.0190318e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008802942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.10.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMun, Saehun10aInfluence of environmental stresses on the stability of W/O/W emulsions containing enzymatically modified starch  ap. 1503-1511.  aThe present study was performed to investigate the stability of W/O/W emulsions containing 4-α-glucanotransferase (4αGTase)-treated starch against environmental stresses such as heating, shearing, and repeated freeze-thawing. W/O/W emulsions were subjected to thermal processing at different temperatures ranging from 30 to 90°C for 30min, constant shear for 0–7min, and freeze–thaw cycling between −20°C and 30°C, respectively, and followed by encapsulation efficiency (EE) measurement. As for the case of thermal stress, it was clearly shown that addition of 4αGTase-treated starch in the internal aqueous phase of emulsions helped to maintain higher EE during thermal processing. However, at lower PGPR level (2%), the addition of 4αGTase-treated starch dramatically reduced EE at temperatures higher than 70°C, which was probably related to the melting of 4αGTase-treated starch gel. The incorporation of 4αGTase-treated starch improved the stability of emulsions during shearing process, but could not prevent W/O/W emulsions from creaming and destabilizing during freeze–thaw cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acreaming 3aemulsions 3aencapsulation 3agels 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3amelting 3amodified starch 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3atemperature 3athermal stress 0aW/O/W emulsion 0aStabilization 0aPGPR 0a4-α-Glucanotransferase 0aEnvironmental stresses1 aChoi, Yongdoo1 aPark, Kwan-Hwa1 aShim, Jae-Yong1 aKim, Yong-Ro0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 92, no. 2 p.1503-1511dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.10.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013500160300001600295520158600311592002801897650001501925650001001940650001501950650001501965650002401980650002202004650001902026650001702045651001302062700002402075700001202099700001802111700001602129700001902145773010602164856007302270852000902343655001202352IND60342598220221121115639.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034259822DNAL7 a10.1111/jrh.121082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOpoku, Samuel T.12aA Comparison of the J‐1 Visa Waiver and Loan Repayment Programs in the Recruitment and Retention of Physicians in Rural Nebraska  ap. 300-309.  aPURPOSE: There is a dearth of literature evaluating the effectiveness of programs aimed at recruiting and retaining physicians in rural Nebraska. Taking advantage of the Nebraska Health Professional Tracking System, this study attempts to comparatively assess the effectiveness of the J‐1 visa waiver and state loan repayment programs in the recruitment and retention of physicians in rural Nebraska. METHODS: A mixed methods approach was used. We tracked 240 physicians who enrolled in the J‐1 visa waiver and state loan repayment programs between 1996 and 2012 until 2013. In addition, key informant interviews were conducted to obtain perspectives on the recruitment and retention of physicians in rural Nebraska through the 2 programs. FINDINGS: Results from multilevel survival regression analysis indicated that physicians enrolled in the J‐1 visa waiver program were more likely to leave rural Nebraska when compared with those enrolled in the state loan repayment program. Participants in the qualitative study, however, cautioned against declaring one program as superior over the other, given that the 2 programs addressed different needs for different communities. In addition, results suggested that fostering the integration of physicians and their families into rural communities might be a way of enhancing retention, regardless of program. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study highlight the complexity of recruitment and retention issues in rural Nebraska and suggest the need for more holistic and family‐centered approaches to addressing these issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterviews 3aloans 3amonitoring 3aphysicians 3aregression analysis 3arural communities 3arural families 3arural health 3aNebraska1 aApenteng, Bettye A.1 aLin, Ge1 aChen, Li‐Wu1 aPalm, David1 aRauner, Thomas0 tJournal of rural health.g2015 July, v. 31, no. 3 p.300-309dJournal of Rural Healthx0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.121083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245006800169300001600237520143100253592002801684650002501712650002501737650001501762650002201777650001901799650001101818650001601829650001801845650002201863653003001885653001101915653001601926653001301942653001301955700006201968773010202030856008702132852000902219655001202228IND60561323720221119212442.0190405e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056132372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.12.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHardt, Lukas10aEcological Macroeconomic Models: Assessing Current Developments  ap. 198-211.  aOur society faces a dilemma. While continued economic growth is ecologically unsustainable, low or negative rates of economic growth are accompanied by adverse social impacts. Hence there is a need for macroeconomic tools that can help identify socially sustainable post-growth pathways. The emerging field of ecological macroeconomics aims to address this need and features a number of new macroeconomic modelling approaches. This article provides (1) a review of modelling developments in ecological macroeconomics, based on the literature and interviews with researchers, and (2) an analysis of how the different models incorporate policy themes from the post-growth literature. Twenty-two ecological macroeconomic models were analysed and compared to eight policy themes. It was found that environmental interactions and the monetary system were treated most comprehensively. Themes of income inequality, work patterns, indicators of well-being, and disaggregated production were addressed with less detail, while alternative business models and cross-scale interactions were hardly addressed. Overall, the combination of input-output analysis with stock-flow consistent modelling was identified as a promising avenue for developing macroeconomic models for a post-growth economy. However, due to the wide interpretation of what “the economy” entails, future research will benefit from employing a range of approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic development 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amacroeconomics 3amodels 3aresearchers 3asocial impact 3asocial inequality 0aEcological macroeconomics 0aModels 0aPost-growth 0aDegrowth 0aPolicies1 aO'Neill, Daniel W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0790-82950 tEcological economics.g2017 Apr., v. 134 p.198-211dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11629x0921-80097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245015900168300001600327520129600343592002801639650002501667650001601692650001801708650001101726650000901737650001001746650001201756650001601768651001301784653001601797653001901813653003101832653001701863653002901880653001301909773017201922856008302094852000902177655001202186IND60594979920221119190445.0180525e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059497992DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.120.2.4212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, A.

The odontotarsines Euptychodera corrugata (Van Duzee), Phimodera binotata (Say), and Vanduzeeina balli (Van Duzee), and the pentatomid Chlorochroa (Rhytidolomia) viridicata (Walker) are reported from field sagewort (Artemisia campestris L. subsp. caudata [Michx.] Hall. & Clems.; Asteraceae) at a site in the Nebraska Sandhills. The scutellerids were beaten from the bases of sagewort, whereas the pentatomid was swept from flower buds. Color images of the adults and new state records for C. viridicata are presented, previous biological information on the four pentatomoids is reviewed, biological attributes contributing to their apparent rareness is discussed, and the long-term protection that the Nebraska Sandhills might provide for these species is evaluated. A greater capacity for detecting the odontotarsines is needed to substantiate their use of A. campestris as a host plant and an apparent preference for Asteraceae, and to provide specimens for laboratory studies of their bionomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia campestris 3aChlorochroa 3aScutelleridae 3aadults 3abuds 3acolor 3aecology 3ahost plants 3aNebraska 0aHeteroptera 0aOdontotarsinae 0aChlorochroa (Rhytidolomia) 0adistribution 0ahost-plant relationships 0arareness0 tProceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington.g2018 Apr., v. 120, no. 2 p.421-441dThe Entomological Society of WashingtonwJournal:jnl43298x0013-87977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797.120.2.4213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010200169300001600271520131400287592002801601650000801629650002201637650001201659650002001671650001501691650001301706650002701719653002001746653002901766653003101795653002101826700001501847700001401862700001301876773008901889856008401978852000902062655001202071IND60603642420221122222432.0180716e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060364242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Shizhuo13aAn experimental study on premixed laminar and turbulent combustion of synthesized coalbed methane  ap. 355-364.  aCoalbed methane is an economic and sustainable alternative fuel for spark ignition engines. In a constant volume combustion bomb, an experimental study was conducted about laminar and turbulent burning characteristics of the premixed coalbed methane/air flames. The turbulent burning velocities of coalbed methane-air mixtures were obtained as well as unstretched laminar burning velocities and Markstein lengths of coalbed methane at different rms (root-mean-square) turbulent velocities of 0.03, 0.05, 0.1 m/s, equivalence ratios of 0.8–1.2, and pressures of 0.1, 0.3 MPa. The results reveal that the unstretched laminar burning velocities of the premixed coalbed methane/air mixtures decrease with the increase of N2 volumetric fractions and the initial pressures. The Markstein lengths increase with the rise of the N2 volumetric fractions and the equivalence ratios, but decrease with the increase of initial pressures. With the increase of rms turbulent velocity, the turbulent burning velocities of coalbed methane/air mixtures are promoted at the equivalence ratios ranging from 0.8 to 1.2. The ratio of turbulent burning velocity to laminar burning velocity decreases with the increase of the equivalence ratios, while it increases with the increase of N2 volumetric fractions in coalbed methane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalternative fuels 3aburning 3acoalbed methane 3acombustion 3anitrogen 3aspark ignition engines 0aCoalbed methane 0aLaminar burning velocity 0aTurbulent burning velocity 0aMarkstein length1 aZhang, Xin1 aWang, Tao1 aLiu, Jie0 tEnergy.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 92 p.355-364dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245007100158300001600229520164200245592002801887650001601915650001201931650001001943650001801953650001801971650001501989650001802004650001902022650001702041650002502058650001202083651001002095700001402105700002002119700001802139700001702157773010602174856007302280852000902353655001202362IND60342598820221121115641.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034259882DNAL7 a10.1111/jrh.121072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitz, David10aAssessing Idaho Rural Family Physician Scope of Practice Over Time  ap. 292-299.  aCONTEXT: An important consideration determining health outcomes is to have an adequate supply of physicians to address the health needs of the community. PURPOSE: The purpose of this investigation was to assess scope of practice factors for Idaho rural family physicians in 2012 and to compare these results to findings from a 2007 study. METHODS: The target population in this study was rural family physicians in Idaho counties with populations of fewer than 50,000. Identical surveys and methods were utilized in both 2007 and 2012. RESULTS: The physician survey was mailed to 252 rural physicians and was returned by 89 for a response rate of 35.3%. Parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses were conducted to analyze the 2012 results and to assess changes in scope of practice across the time periods. DISCUSSION: The percentage of rural family physicians in Idaho in 2012 who provided prenatal care, vaginal deliveries, and nursing home care was significantly lower than the results from the 2007 survey. Female physicians were more likely to provide prenatal care and vaginal deliveries than males in 2012. Male physicians were more likely to provide emergency room coverage and esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy services than females in 2012. Younger physicians were found to be more likely to provide inpatient admissions and mental health services in 2012 than older physicians. Employed physicians were more likely to provide cesarean delivery, other operating room services and emergency room coverage in 2012 than nonemployed physicians. Further research is needed to assess the root causes of these changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolonoscopy 3afemales 3amales 3amental health 3anursing homes 3aphysicians 3aprenatal care 3arural families 3arural health 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3aIdaho1 aBaker, Ed1 aMacKenzie, Lisa1 aKinney, Logan1 aEpperly, Ted0 tJournal of rural health.g2015 July, v. 31, no. 3 p.292-299dJournal of Rural Healthx0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.121073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011200161300002000273520104000293592002801333650001601361650002001377650001101397650001901408650000901427650001501436650000901451650001401460650001201474650001401486650001301500651001801513651001501531700002301546700002101569700002401590700002101614773012701635856007501762852000901837655001201846IND60535744020221116174724.0160805e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053574402DNAL7 a10.1021/es50362492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraune, Birgit M.10aChanges in Food Web Structure Alter Trends of Mercury Uptake at Two Seabird Colonies in the Canadian Arctic  ap. 13246-13252.  aArctic ecosystems are changing in response to climate change and some Arctic food web structures are being affected in ways which may have potential consequences for the biomagnification of environmental contaminants. Here, we examined how a shift in diet of an Arctic seabird resulted in a change of trophic position and how that change affected exposure to mercury over time. The thick-billed murre (Uria lomvia), which breeds in the eastern Canadian Arctic, has been monitored for diet and environmental contaminants at two colonies, one in northern Hudson Bay and one in the high Arctic. As a result of a change in diet, murres breeding in Hudson Bay lowered their trophic position which, in turn, should affect their mercury exposure over time. After adjusting mercury concentrations in murre eggs for trophic position, the temporal trend of mercury in Hudson Bay murre eggs changed from nonsignificant to a significantly increasing trend. Valid trends can be deduced only when factors, such as diet, have been taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUria lomvia 3abioaccumulation 3abreeds 3aclimate change 3adiet 3aecosystems 3aeggs 3afood webs 3amercury 3apollution 3aseabirds 3aArctic region 3aHudson Bay1 aGaston, Anthony

For silicosis induction, silica particles (50 mg/rat, 0.1 mL 0.9% NaCl) were instilled intranasally into rats. Aspirin (10 mg/kg/day), krill oil (40 mg/kg/day), or their combination was administered orally for 56 days following silica exposure. Results showed that oral aspirin and krill oil combination significantly mitigated silica-induced pulmonary injury. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid examination showed a decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity, total protein content, and accumulation of total and differential inflammatory cells. Oral aspirin and krill oil combination significantly attenuated silica-induced oxidative stress through the restoration of reduced glutathione concentration and catalase activity in addition to alleviation of elevated malondialdehyde and total nitric oxide contents. Moreover, aspirin and krill oil combination revealed considerable mitigation of silica-induced upregulated expression of the inflammatory and fibrotic mediators: nuclear factor kappa-B, transforming growth factor-β1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9. The antifibrotic effect was also evidenced through the decreased hydroxyproline content and the obvious restoration of lung architecture, as demonstrated upon histopathological examination. In conclusion, oral aspirin and krill oil combination can confer pulmonary protective, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic potentials against silica-induced pulmonary injury. This impact could be credited to the ability of this combination to activate resolution mechanisms, which, in turn, suppress the expression of inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers and replenish antioxidant stores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aaspirin 3abiomarkers 3acardioprotective agents 3acatalase 3agelatinase B 3aglutathione 3ahistopathology 3ahydroxyproline 3akrill 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alungs 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3aoils 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aprotein content 3arats 3aresearch 3asilica0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Apr., v. 28, no. 15 p.19272-19284dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11921-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245013700210300001600347520115900363592002801522650002101550650001401571650002501585650001501610650001401625650000901639700001901648773013101667856008201798852000901880655001201889IND60742923820221121213448.0210627e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074292382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-021-01306-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshihara, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9007-715610aDetermining the Young’s modulus of solid wood by considering the fundamental frequency under the free-free flexural vibration mode  ap. 919-936.  aThe Young’s modulus in the longitudinal direction of a Sitka spruce specimen was determined by conducting free-free flexural vibration tests based on Euler–Bernoulli’s and Timoshenko’s vibration theories. Comparing the Young’s moduli obtained considering these theories, an equation to calculate the Young’s modulus by considering only the fundamental frequency was formulated by modifying the equation derived from the Euler–Bernoulli’s theory. The modification was conducted with the consideration that the modified equation was applicable to various wood species with a wide range of length/depth ratio. Additionally, the accuracy of the proposed equation was examined using a statistical method for comparing the Young’s moduli obtained considering the aforementioned theories. Using the proposed equation, accurate Young’s moduli could be determined considering only the fundamental frequency, with a reduced influence of the length/depth ratio. The statistical analysis results indicated that the proposed equation can effectively yield accurate Young’s moduli for various wood species with a wide range of length/depth ratio.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea sitchensis 3aequations 3astatistical analysis 3atechnology 3avibration 3awood1 aMaruta, Makoto0 tWood science and technology.g2021 July, v. 55, no. 4 p.919-936dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-021-01306-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03781naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011400160300002000274520236500294592002802659650001702687650001302704650000802717650002102725650001502746650003402761650001102795650002402806650001302830650001702843650001502860650001002875650002002885650001302905650002202918650003102940651001502971700002302986700001603009700002103025700002003046700002203066773012703088856007503215852000903290655001203299IND60535744120221116175103.0160805e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053574412DNAL7 a10.1021/es50363332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSleiman, Mohamad10aInhalable Constituents of Thirdhand Tobacco Smoke: Chemical Characterization and Health Impact Considerations  ap. 13093-13101.  aTobacco smoke residues lingering in the indoor environment, also termed thirdhand smoke (THS), can be a source of long-term exposure to harmful pollutants. THS composition is affected by chemical transformations and by air–surface partitioning over time scales of minutes to months. This study identified and quantified airborne THS pollutants available for respiratory exposure, identified potential environmental tracers, and estimated health impacts to nonsmokers. In a ventilated 18 m³ laboratory chamber, six cigarettes were machine-smoked, and levels of particulate matter (PM₂.₅) and 58 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were monitored during an aging period of 18 h. Results were compared with field measurements taken in a smoker’s home 8 h after the last cigarette had been smoked. Initial chamber levels of individual VOCs in freshly emitted secondhand smoke (SHS) were in the range of 1–300 μg m–³. The commonly used SHS tracers 3-ethenylpyridine (3-EP) and nicotine were no longer present in the gas phase after 2 h, likely due mostly to sorption to surfaces. By contrast, other VOCs persisted in the gas phase for at least 18 h, particularly furans, carbonyls, and nitriles. The concentration ratio of acetonitrile to 3-EP increased substantially with aging. This ratio may provide a useful metric for differentiating freshly emitted (SHS) from aged smoke (THS). Among the 29 VOCs detected in the smoker’s home at moderate to high concentrations, 18 compounds were also detected in simultaneously sampled outdoor air, but acetonitrile, 2-methyl furan, and 2,5-dimethyl furan appeared to be specific to cigarette smoke. The levels of acrolein, methacrolein, and acrylonitrile exceeded concentrations considered harmful by the State of California. An initial exposure and impact assessment was conducted for a subset of pollutants by computing disability-adjusted life years lost, using available toxicological and epidemiological information. Exposure to PM₂.₅ contributed to more than 90% of the predicted harm. Acrolein, furan, acrylonitrile, and 1,3-butadiene were considered to be the most harmful VOCs. Depending on which criteria are used to establish the separation between SHS and THS, 5–60% of the predicted health damage could be attributed to THS exposure. Benefits and limitations of this approach are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aacrolein 3aair 3achronic exposure 3acigarettes 3adisability-adjusted life year 3afurans 3ainhalation exposure 3anicotine 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3asmoke 3asmoking (habit) 3asorption 3atracer techniques 3avolatile organic compounds 3aCalifornia1 aLogue, Jennifer M.1 aLuo, Wentai1 aPankow, James F.1 aGundel, Lara A.1 aDestaillats, Hugo0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 48, no. 22 p.13093-13101dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50363333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001700169245007000186300001600256500001500272520102200287592002801309650002101337650001001358650002601368650001401394650001701408650002801425650002801453650001801481650006801499650002901567650002101596650006601617650002401683650001101707650007001718650002101788653001101809700001701820700002101837700001801858700002201876700002001898700001801918773009001936856008602026852000902112655001202121IND4465298120221123043133.0141111e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446529812DNAL7 a228681692pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Kai-Wei10aCytotoxic and antioxidant constituents from Garcinia subelliptica  ap. 851-859.  a2019-12-06  aTwo new triterpenoids, garcinielliptones Q (1) and S (3), and a new phloroglucinol, garcinielliptone R (2), were isolated from the seed of Garcinia subelliptica.

Using eddy covariance measurements from 2010 to 2012, the effects of sky conditions extracted from adjacent sunny, cloudy, and overcast days on net ecosystem productivity (NEP) of a subtropical coniferous plantation were examined from half-hourly to daily scales. Half-hourly NEP responded to the changing radiation more efficiently on overcast days compared to sunny days, but such response did not differ obviously between cloudy and sunny days. Compared with sunny conditions, apparent quantum yield (α) under overcast (cloudy) conditions changed 282.4% (41.7%) in spring, 140.3% (−4.2%) in summer, 218.5% (38.9%) in autumn, and 146.2% (0.5%) in winter, respectively; annually, α under overcast (cloudy) conditions increased by 225.9% (19.8%) in 2010, 189.8% (6.0%) in 2011, and 159.5% (21.4%) in 2012, respectively. Moreover, the potential NEP at the light intensity of 150 and 750 W m−2 was improved due to increased diffuse fraction. However, both daytime NEP and daily NEP were significantly lower under overcast skies than under sunny and cloudy skies. Compared with sunny days, daily NEP on overcast days decreased by 127.7% in spring, 126.4% in summer, 121.8% in autumn, and 100.6% in winter, respectively; annually, daily NEP decreased by 122.5% in 2010, 141.7% in 2011, and 109.9% in 2012, respectively. Diurnal patterns of daily NEP were quite similar between sunny and cloudy days. Both path analysis and multiple regression showed that solar radiation, especially diffuse radiation, was responsible for the variations of NEP under different skies across seasons, but this effect may be weakened by seasonal droughts. This study implies that the effects of sky conditions on NEP are timescale dependent and should be paid more attention in ecosystem carbon cycle study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3acarbon sequestration 3adiurnal variation 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aglobal change 3anet ecosystem production 3apath analysis 3aregression analysis 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 0aDiffuse radiation 0aEddy covariance 0aNEE 0aTemporal variation 0aPath analysis1 aZhang, Leiming1 aLi, Shenggong1 aWen, Xuefa1 aLi, Qingkang1 aWang, Huimin0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 651 p.3002-3014dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.1903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013400168300001600302520089000318592002801208650001601236650001201252650001301264650001601277650001901293650001601312651001301328651001001341653001601351653001401367653001601381653001301397653002301410653002501433653001601458700002101474773017201495856008301667961001301750852000901763655001201772IND60594980020221119190628.0180525e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059498002DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.120.2.4422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, A.

On the other hand, incorporation of Silicon®-SLH softener in finishing baths along with TC affects the performance and antibacterial properties of the treated fabrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aantibacterial properties 3acleaning 3adurability 3afabrics 3afunctional properties 3ananoparticles 3atitanium dioxide 3aurea 3aviscose 3awashing 0aPoly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) 0aViscose fabric 0aTinosan® CEL 0aNano-particles 0aAntibacterial properties 0aUV protection 0aSelf cleaning1 aEid, R.A.A.1 aHashem, S.S.1 aAmr, A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 92, no. 2 p.1539-1545dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245013000161300002000291520122400311592002801535650001901563650002101582650002401603650001201627650001101639650001401650650001501664650001401679650001101693700002201704773012701726856007501853852000901928655001201937IND60535744220221116175057.0160805e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053574422DNAL7 a10.1021/es503723g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerginelli, Iason10aVapor Intrusion Screening Model for the Evaluation of Risk-Based Vertical Exclusion Distances at Petroleum Contaminated Sites  ap. 13263-13272.  aThe key role of biodegradation in attenuating the migration of petroleum hydrocarbon vapors into the indoor environments has been deeply investigated in the last decades. Very recently, empirical screening levels for the separation distance from the source, above which the potential for vapor intrusion can be considered negligible, were defined. In this paper, an analytical solution that allows one to predict risk-based vertical screening distances for hydrocarbons compounds is presented. The proposed solution relies on a 1-D vapor intrusion model that incorporates a piecewise first-order aerobic biodegradation limited by oxygen availability and accounts also for the effect of the building footprint. The model predictions are shown to be consistent with the results obtained using a 3-D numerical model and with the empirical screening criteria defined by U.S.EPA and CRC care. However, the different simulations carried out show that in some specific cases (e.g., large building footprint, high methane concentration, and low attenuation in the capillary fringe), the respect of these empirical screening criteria could be insufficient to guarantee soil-gas concentrations below acceptable risk-based levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradation 3acapillary fringe 3amathematical models 3amethane 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3aprediction 3ascreening 3avapors1 aBaciocchi, Renato0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 48, no. 22 p.13263-13272dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes503723g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245014500198300001800343506007600361520184800437592002802285506003702313650001302350650001602363650001502379650001902394650000902413650001402422650003102436650001802467650002602485650001002511650002202521650001602543650001502559650002402574650002402598650001802622700001502640700001802655700001902673700001402692700001902706700001602725700001502741700001602756773011602772856007402888852000902962655001202971IND60342599220221207091331.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034259922DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.128352doi7 aPMC48953682pmcid7 a260795322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNabity, M.B.10aSymmetric Dimethylarginine Assay Validation, Stability, and Evaluation as a Marker for the Early Detection of Chronic Kidney Disease in Dogs  ap. 1036-1044.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) is a small molecule formed by methylation of arginine, and released into blood during protein degradation. SDMA is primarily eliminated by renal excretion and is a promising endogenous marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). OBJECTIVES: To validate an assay for SDMA measurement, determine stability of SDMA in blood, and compare SDMA with serum creatinine concentration (sCr) and GFR for early detection of decreasing kidney function in dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD). ANIMALS: Eight male dogs affected with X‐linked hereditary nephropathy and 4 unaffected male littermates. METHODS: Prospective study validating SDMA measurement using liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry, assessing stability of SDMA in serum and plasma, and serially determining sCr, SDMA, and GFR (using iohexol clearance) in dogs during progression from preclinical disease to end‐stage renal failure. Correlations were determined using linear regression. Timepoints at which sCr, SDMA, and GFR identified decreased renal function were compared using defined cutoffs, trending in an individual dog, and comparison with unaffected littermates. RESULTS: Symmetric dimethylarginine was highly stable in serum and plasma, and the assay demonstrated excellent analytical performance. In unaffected dogs, SDMA remained unchanged whereas in affected dogs, SDMA increased during disease progression, correlating strongly with an increase in sCr (r = 0.95) and decrease in GFR (r = −0.95). Although trending improved sCr's sensitivity, SDMA identified, on average, <20% decrease in GFR, which was earlier than sCr using any comparison method. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Symmetric dimethylarginine is useful for both early identification and monitoring of decreased renal function in dogs with CKD.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarginine 3ablood serum 3acreatinine 3adisease course 3adogs 3aexcretion 3aglomerular filtration rate 3alinear models 3aliquid chromatography 3amales 3amass spectrometry 3amethylation 3amonitoring 3aprospective studies 3aprotein degradation 3arenal failure1 aLees, G.E.1 aBoggess, M.M.1 aYerramilli, M.1 aObare, E.1 aYerramilli, M.1 aRakitin, A.1 aAguiar, J.1 aRelford, R.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2015 July, v. 29, no. 4 p.1036-1044dJ.B.

The herbicidal properties of a 2.5% concentration of each EO in water mixtures with FAME were evaluated as sprays in a pot experiment. The oil-FAME mixtures showed phytotoxic effects against common lambsquarters and barnyardgrass expressed by a reduction in plant length and aboveground and root biomass, as measured three weeks after foliar spraying. Corn was the most tolerant species to the tested mixtures. Sunflower FAME alone was safe on corn but reduced the growth of weeds. Peppermint EO alone was the most phytotoxic on all tested species. In conclusion, the mixture of peppermint EO with oilseed rape FAME was the best treatment; however, improvement on Ch. album would be desirable for commercial-level control.

We sought to explore the therapeutic effects of Tao-Hong-Si-Wu Decoction (THSWD) on angiogenesis in a rat model of cerebral ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R). The protective effect of THSWD on I/R rats was observed morphologically by immunohistochemical expression of VEGF and CD34, along with immunofluorescence results of co-expression of BrdU and vWF. Then, PMPs from different groups of rats were extracted, and cytokine array analysis was used to screen for angiogenesis associated proteins. The results showed that THSWD can promote the expression of VEGF, CD34, BrdU and vWF. Cytokine array analysis revealed the changes in the expression of 29 related angiogenic proteins in the total protein of PMPs, which involved the Notch signalling pathway. Compared with model group, the expression levels of NICD and Hes-1 in the THSWD group were significantly increased. In the context of I/R, the angiogenesis-related proteins of PMPs are different. THSWD may involve the promotion of activation of the Notch signalling pathway to achieve therapeutic effects on cerebral ischaemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aangiogenic proteins 3aanimal models 3ablood circulation 3acytokines 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aischemia 3amicroparticles 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 0aTao-Hong-Si-Wu Decoction 0aPlatelet microparticles 0aCerebral ischaemia–reperfusion1 aWANG, Meng-Meng1 aXIA, Wen-Wen1 aPENG, Dai-Yin1 aHan, Lan,0 tChinese journal of natural medicines.g2020 Aug., v. 18, no. 8 p.620-627dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6169x1875-53647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(20)30074-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245013400157300001600291520142300307592002801730650001901758650002001777650002601797650002101823650001501844650001301859650001101872650001001883650001601893650002701909650001001936650001101946650002001957650001001977650001201987651002901999653001202028653001302040653001402053653001602067700001702083700001602100773009302116856003802209852000902247655001202256IND50068490020221121102051.0130813s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006849002DNAL7 a10.1071/CP130542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, M.

Crantz) was grown extensively in Northern Europe up to the 1950s. Increasing fuel prices coupled with a ‘diet-conscious’ society have revived interest in camelina for food and biofuel uses. This study assessed the agronomic potential of the crop under Mediterranean dryland conditions and the scope for selection in a diverse collection for food and biofuel use. Yield trials were conducted in the Western Australian wheatbelt between 1999 and 2008. In 14 environments, camelina gave an average yield of 1.04tha-1 compared with the canola (Brassica napus L.) control yield of 1.48tha-1. Camelina outyielded canola significantly at one site, whereas canola significantly outyielded camelina at five sites. Thirty accessions of camelina from five countries were compared in the field in 2011. Agronomic characteristics were recorded and fatty acid analyses performed; significant differences were observed. Accessions were identified with desirable biofuel qualities, and others selected as having fatty acid characteristics suitable for food use. Averaged over accessions, erucic acid content was high at 4.0%, ranging from 5.2% to a low of 2.5% in accession 4130. However, this line was tested in the agronomic trials and its fatty acid profiles varied greatly across environments. For stockfeed use, the protein content of the seed was found to be in range 23.2–29.1%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aCamelina sativa 3aMediterranean climate 3aagronomic traits 3aarid lands 3abiofuels 3acanola 3acrops 3aerucic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afoods 3aprices 3aprotein content 3aseeds 3asociety 3aNorthern European region 0abiofuel 0afood oil 0astockfeed 0afatty acids1 aRossi, A.

The physiological levels of circulating insulin and hyperglycemic control are important factors for a normal prostate growth. Hyperglycemia during puberty is reported to retard the growth of the prostate gland, with remarkable effects on the epithelial compartment. Here, we investigated the impact of hyperglycemia along with a simultaneous or late insulin replacement on the ventral prostate growth in rats during puberty, paying special attention to the deposition of collagen fibers and activities of gelatinase, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and −9 (MMP-9). Hyperglycemia was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) administration in 40-day-old male Wistar rats. A subset of hyperglycemic rats underwent an early insulin replacement (three days after the STZ administration), and another subset underwent a late insulin replacement (twenty days after the STZ administration). Animals were euthanized at 60 and/or 80 days of age. The ventral prostatic lobe was processed for picrosirius red staining, type I and III collagen immunohistochemistry, and gelatin zymography. Hyperglycemic animals showed an increased area of collagen fibers in the prostate, which was composed both types of collagens. MMP-2 activity was significantly reduced in the hyperglycemic animals, while MMP-9 activity was very low and showed no alteration. The simultaneous and late insulin administration restored collagen content and MMP-2 activity. In conclusion, puberty is a critical window for prostate maturation and type-1 diabetes-induced hyperglycemia affects the ratio of the prostatic parenchymal and stromal growth, leading to fibrotic tissues by also MMP-2 down regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollagen 3aenzyme activity 3aepithelium 3agelatin 3agelatinase A 3ahyperglycemia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainsulin 3amales 3aprostate gland 3apuberty 3arats 3astaining 3astreptozotocin 0aPuberty 0aCollagen 0aHyperglycemia 0aDiabetes 0aProstate 0aMetalloproteinase1 aPorto Amorim, Elaine Manoela1 aRibeiro, Larissa Mayume1 aRinaldi, Jaqueline Carvalho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1736-59841 aDelella, Flávia Karina1 aJustulin, Luis Antonio1 aFelisbino, Sérgio Luis0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245018400175300001600359500001500375520171200390592002802102650001002130650001602140650002302156650002602179650002202205650001102227650001402238650001302252650001102265650003002276650001302306650003102319650002102350650001502371650001002386650001002396650002902406650001002435650001102445650001602456650000902472650002702481650002302508650002602531650002302557650001702580650001002597651001402607651001402621651001202635653001802647653002602665653002802691653003202719700002402751700002602775700002002801700002102821700002502842700001902867773011702886856005103003961001303054852000903067655001203076IND50075053420221122033022.0140410e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007505342DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2011.5681132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoughton, Anthony J.10aLaboratory host range of Austromusotima camptozonale (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), a potential biological control agent of Old World climbing fern, Lygodium microphyllum (Lygodiaceae)  ap. 643-676.  a2019-12-05  aOld World climbing fern, Lygodium microphyllum, is one of the most serious invasive weeds impacting south Florida and development of biological control is crucial for sustainable management. Larvae of a small moth, Austromusotima camptozonale, were discovered defoliating L. microphyllum in Australia. Preliminary testing suggested this moth was a Lygodium specialist. Laboratory host range testing was conducted on 65 species of test plants, from 31 families, comprising seven Lygodium species, four close relatives, 45 other species of ferns and fern allies, eight agricultural crops and one gymnosperm species plus the primary host L. microphyllum. Significant oviposition occurred only on other species of Lygodium. No eggs were laid on the agricultural crops, or about half the species of non-Lygodium ferns and fern allies tested. Oviposition on the other non-Lygodium ferns was very low, except on Anemia adiantifolia and Blechnum serrulatum, which received modest egg loads, but did not support development to adult. Larval feeding was low to non-existent on all the non-Lygodium species. Larvae developed to adult only on the native, American climbing fern L. palmatum, and to a lesser extent on L. japonicum. Lygodium japonicum is a naturalized invasive weed in the United States. Colonies of A. camptozonale were unable to persist on L. palmatum and died out in two to seven generations. Freezing winter temperatures in states where L. palmatum occurs would be lethal to A. camptozonale. It was concluded that A. camptozonale would pose no threat to native or cultivated plants in North America or the Caribbean and should be considered as a weed biological control agent against L. microphyllum.  aPublisher supplied data 3amoths 3aoviposition 3aLygodium japonicum 3aLygodium microphyllum 3aadult development 3aadults 3aCrambidae 3afreezing 3aanemia 3abiological control agents 3aBlechnum 3alaboratory experimentation 3ainvasive species 3ahost range 3avines 3ahosts 3aenvironmental management 3aweeds 3alarvae 3atemperature 3aeggs 3abiological development 3abiological control 3aferns and fern allies 3aindigenous species 3aGymnospermae 3acrops 3aAustralia 3aCaribbean 3aFlorida 0aConiferophyta 0alaboratory host range 0aweed biological control 0aAustromusotima camptozonale1 aBuckingham, Gary R.1 aBennett, Christine A.1 aZonneveld, Ryan1 aGoolsby, John A.1 aPemberton, Robert W.1 aCenter, Ted D.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2011 June 1, v. 21, no. 6 p.643-676dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2011.568113  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02567naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245013900175500001900314520117800333592002801511650002601539650002401565650001801589650001201607650001501619650001701634650001501651650001201666650001301678650001101691650002301702650002201725653002101747653001001768700002701778700001901805700001901824700002601843700002101869700001801890773010501908856008702013852000902100655001202109IND60690602020221122004055.0200601e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069060202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1026042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, SM Majharul10aHypoxia reduced upper thermal limits causing cellular and nuclear abnormalities of erythrocytes in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGlobal warming is a threat across the world that leads to estimates of the upper thermal limits of ectothermic species. Increased water temperature up-regulates oxygen consumption and metabolic rates, and alters the physiological processes. In this study, we identified the critical thermal maxima (CTmax) and physiological responses under normoxia and hypoxia in Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus. CTmax was 41.25 °C under hypoxia and 44.50 °C under normoxia. Compared to normoxia, lower values of hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cells (RBCs) were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. In contrast, higher values of white blood cells (WBCs) and blood glucose (Glu) levels were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. Consequently, higher frequencies of micronucleus, cellular and nuclear abnormalities of erythrocytes were observed at the CTmax under hypoxia. These results suggest that high temperature tolerance and subsequent physiology are significantly affected by the oxygen supply in Nile tilapia. As climate vulnerability is intensifying day by day, this data will be helpful in successful management practice for the aquatic environment having low oxygen content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aaquatic environment 3ablood glucose 3aclimate 3aectothermy 3aerythrocytes 3ahemoglobin 3ahypoxia 3anormoxia 3aoxygen 3aoxygen consumption 3awater temperature 0aHigh temperature 0aCTmax1 aZahangir, Md Mahiuddin1 aJannat, Rayeda1 aHasan, Md Naim1 aSuchana, Sajida Akter1 aRohani, Md Fazle1 aShahjahan, Md0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2020 May, v. 90 p.102604-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2020.1026043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245009000168520129600258592002801554650002001582650001301602650002301615650001401638650001601652650001801668700002301686700002201709773012201731856008101853852000901934655001201943IND60763351820221119110706.0220120e20220110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076335182DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy120101602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, Mark F.10aImpact of Sowing Time on Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) Biomass Accumulation and Yield  aChickpea growth, development and grain yield are affected by a range of climatic and environmental factors. Experiments were conducted across four sowing dates from mid-April to the end of May, over two years at Trangie in central western New South Wales (NSW), and Leeton, Wagga Wagga and Yanco (one year) in southern NSW, to examine the influence of sowing time on biomass accumulation, grain yield and plant yield components. Climatic and experimental location data were recorded during the growing seasons. Early sowing (mid-April) resulted in taller plants, higher bottom and top pod heights, fewer pods, more unfilled pods and greater biomass accumulation, but low harvest index due to reduced grain yield compared with late sowing (end of May). Grain number was positively correlated with grain yield and was the main yield component accounting for most of the variation in yield. There was largely a positive correlation between biomass and yield, especially with delayed sowing except for Leeton experiments. This study concludes that sowing around the end of April in central western NSW and mid-May in southern NSW is conducive to higher grain yield as it minimises exposure to abiotic stresses at critical growth periods and allows efficient conversion of biomass to grain yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCicer arietinum 3aagronomy 3abiomass production 3achickpeas 3agrain yield 3aharvest index1 aMaphosa, Lancelot 1 aPreston, Aaron L.0 tAgronomy.g2022 Jan. 10, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy120101603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245020600171300001400377520107000391592002801461650003101489650002601520650001901546650001601565650002901581650002701610650002301637650001901660650001701679650001901696650001501715650001801730650001001748650002701758650002101785650001801806650003201824650001601856650001901872650004401891650001301935650000901948650002201957653001201979653002601991653002702017653002702044700001902071773013802090856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60683099720221119175650.0200417e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068309972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2020.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbada, Sherif S.10aQuinoisobutyride A, an acyclic antibacterial tetrapeptide incorporating an unprecedented heterocyclic amino acid residue from the hypersaline lake-derived fungus Penicillium simplicissimum strain WSH17  ap. 95-98.  aChromatographic refining of the EtOAc extract of a solid rice culture of the hypersaline lake-derived fungus Penicillium simplicissimum strain WSH17 afforded a new linear antibacterial peptide quinoisobutyride A (1) along with three known metabolites (2-4).

These PLB1Tᵣᵢₚₗₑmice presented with age-dependent and AD-relevant phenotypes. Homozygous PLB1Tᵣᵢₚₗₑmice aged 4–12 months were assessed here in a battery of spatial learning tasks: Exp.1 radial-arm water maze (spatial reference and working memory) Exp.2 open-field water maze (spatial reference memory); Exp.3 home cage observation system with spatial learning (IntelliCage); Exp.4 spontaneous object recognition (SOR; novel object and spatial object shift). A separate test with high-expression transgenic APP mice matching the design of experiment 1 was also performed. Spatial deficits in PLB1Tᵣᵢₚₗₑmice were confirmed at 12, but not 4 months in both water maze tasks. PSAPP mice, by contrast, presented with severe yet non-progressive spatial learning deficits already at 4 months. During tests of spatial learning in SOR and IntelliCage, PLB1Tᵣᵢₚₗₑmice neither acquired the location of the water-rewarded corner, nor recognize novel or spatially shifted objects at 4 months, indicating these protocols to be more sensitive than the water maze. Collectively and in line with AD symptomatology, PLB1Tᵣᵢₚₗₑmice present with a graded and progressive age-dependent loss of spatial memory that can be revealed by the use of a battery of tasks. With the emergence of subtle deficits progressively increasing in severity, PLB1Tᵣᵢₚₗₑmice may offer a more patho-physiologically relevant model of dementia than aggressive expression models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3aexperimental design 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3amemory 3amice 3aphenotype1 aKoss, D.1 aPorcu, E.1 aWoodcock, H.1 aRobinson, L.1 aPlatt, B.1 aRiedel, G.0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2013 July, v. 70, no. 14 p.2603-2619dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-013-1314-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015200169300001800321520132200339592002801661596010501689650001801794650002901812650001701841650001301858650002501871650001901896650001401915650001301929650003201942650001301974650003501987650001202022650001102034653001802045653002402063653001902087653001902106653002602125700002002151700001802171700001902189700001802208700001802226773011702244856008502361852000902446655001202455IND60623941520221120154302.0181129e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062394152DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2018.14355792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaada, Mariem10aChangeability in Retama raetam essential oils chemical composition, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties as affected by the physiological stage  ap. 1248-1255.  aRetama raetam essential oils (EOs) composition and biological activities were assessed during three developmental periods. The essential oil yield varied significantly among the developmental stages and the optimal was detected at the fresh fruiting stage (0.34%). In addition, EOs composition varied significantly (p < 0.05) according to the different developmental stages. In fact, 2-Methoxy-4-vinylphenol, linalool, and 1-octen-3-ol were the main compounds in the vegetative, flowering, and the fresh fruiting stages, respectively. Developmental stage had also a strong effect on EOs antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. In fact, during the fresh fruiting stage, IC₅₀ and EC₅₀ values of the antioxidant assays were 2 to 3 times inferior to all others stages. Concerning the determination of the diameter of inhibition, a slight to high antimicrobial activity was revealed against 12 bacteria and 4 yeasts. Once again, EOs from the fresh fruiting stage had higher bactericidal effect than those from the flowering and vegetative ones (IZ varied from 10 to 13 mm). The results of this investigation showed for the first time the high accumulation of EOs at the early stages of fruit development making the fresh fruiting optimal stage for the extraction of powerful antioxidant and antimicrobial EOs.  aPublisher supplied data  aLR10CBBC02cMinistry of Higher Education and Scientific Researchdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009122 3aRetama raetam 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3aflowering 3afruiting 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alinalool 3amedian effective concentration 3aoctenol 3ayeasts 0aRetama raetam 0adevelopmental stage 0aessential oils 0aGC-MS analysis 0abiological activities1 aOueslati, Manel1 aMsaada, Kamel1 aSnoussi, Mejdi1 aHamami, Majdi1 aKsouri, Riadh0 tPlant biosystems.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 152, no. 6 p.1248-1255dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2018.14355793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245009600178300001400274520161900288592002801907650002701935650001301962650002201975650001201997650002102009650002202030650001702052650001102069650001902080650001602099650001602115650001402131650001302145653001002158653001202168653001902180653001902199653001902218653001502237700002102252700001802273773009002291856009002381852000902471655001202480IND60603471920221119230732.0180716e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060347192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaehlke, Susanne10aIntracellular calcium dynamics dependent on defined microtopographical features of titanium  ap. 48-57.  aDetailed insights into the complex cellular behavior at the biomaterial interface are crucial for the improvement of implant surfaces with respect to their acceptance and integration. The cells perceive microtopographical features and, in consequence, rearrange their adhesion structures like the actin cytoskeleton and adaptor proteins. But little is known about whether these altered cellular phenotypes have consequences for intracellular calcium signaling and its dynamics. To elucidate if an artificial, geometrical microtopography influences calcium ion (Ca²⁺) mobilization in osteoblasts, human MG-63 cells were stained with the calcium dye Fluo 3-acetoxymethyl ester and set on defined silicon–titanium (Ti) arrays with regular pillar structures (P5, 5 × 5 × 5 μm) and compared with planar Ti. To induce an immediate calcium signal, cells were stimulated with adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). Interestingly, osteoblasts on micropillars expressing a shortened actin cytoskeleton were hampered in their calcium mobilization potential in signal height as well duration. Even the basal level of the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration was reduced, which was accompanied by a disturbed fibronectin synthesis. The expression of the voltage-sensitive calcium channels Cav1.2, Cav1.3 (L-type) and Cav3.1, Cav3.2, Cav3.3 (T-type) as well as the signaling proteins phospho-AKT and phospho-GSK3α/β remained unaffected on pillars. The topography-dependent calcium dynamics observed here provide new insights into how topographical cues alter cell functions – via the intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadhesion 3abiobased products 3acalcium 3acalcium channels 3acalcium signaling 3afibronectins 3ahumans 3amicrofilaments 3amicrorelief 3aosteoblasts 3aphenotype 3atitanium 0aActin 0aCalcium 0aCell signaling 0aImage analysis 0aMicrostructure 0aOsteoblast1 aKoertge, Andreas1 aNebe, Barbara0 tBiomaterials.g2015 Apr., v. 46 p.48-57dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01843naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010800161300002000269520077900289592002801068650002201096650001001118650002001128700001501148700001901163700002101182700002401203700001901227700002401246700001701270773013401287856007501421852000901496655001201505IND60538959720221120105548.0160815e20131002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053895972DNAL7 a10.1021/ja40878532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKajitani, Takashi10ao-Phenylene Octamers as Surface Modifiers for Homeotropic Columnar Ordering of Discotic Liquid Crystals  ap. 14564-14567.  aLarge-area homeotropic columnar ordering of π-conjugated discotic liquid crystals (LCs) is crucial for certain device applications but generally hard to achieve. Here we report polymeric o-phenylene octamer poly-1 and its monomer 1 as the first surface modifiers for homeotropic columnar order of a variety of discotic LCs up to a macroscopic length scale. Their octameric o-phenylene parts are known to fold helically into a cylinder that is reminiscent of a π-stacked column of discotic LCs. Through-view X-ray diffraction patterns of 1 suggested that this molecule adheres to the glass substrate and directs its cylindrical axis perpendicular to the glass surface. This “face-on” orientation likely nucleates the homeotropic columnar order of discotic LC materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aglass 3aliquid crystals1 aSuna, Yuki1 aKosaka, Atsuko1 aOsawa, Terutsune1 aFujikawa, Shigenori1 aTakata, Masaki1 aFukushima, Takanori1 aAida, Takuzo0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Oct. 02, v. 135, no. 39 p.14564-14567dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja40878533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245005900179300001600238520174800254592002802002650001102030650001302041650001302054650001402067650001502081650002402096650002302120650001202143650002302155650001102178650001302189650000902202650002402211650001902235650001302254650002502267650001002292650001202302650002702314650002802341650002902369650003802398650003102436650001602467650000902483650000902492650002502501650004502526650001702571650001602588650001202604650002202616650002702638650002802665651001902693651001002712700002402722700001702746700002702763773011202790856008102902852000902983655001202992IND4468547920221119185829.0141111e20120327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446854792DNAL7 a222893462pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.01.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdala, S.10aDiuretic activity of some Smilax canariensis fractions  ap. 277-281.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Smilax canariensis is an endemic species of the Canary Islands, popularly known as “Zarzaparrilla sin espinas”. The rhizome, leaves and stem of this species has wide use in folk medicine practice on the islands, where they are habitually employed as diuretic. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this paper we report on the diuretic activity in experimental animals of several fractions of the methanol extract of this species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four fractions of the methanol extract of the rhizomes, leaves and stem of Smilax canariensis (50 and 100mg/kg), Furosemide and Hydrochlorotiazide (10mg/kg), were orally administered to laboratory animals to evaluate their diuretic activity. Water excretion rate, pH, conductivity, and content of Na⁺, K⁺ and Cl⁻ were measured in the urine of saline-loaded mice. RESULTS: All the studied extracts showed an interesting increase of the diuresis, although the n-buthanol (27%; p<0.05) and ethyl acetate extract (35%; p<0.01), at 100mg/kg p.o., showed the most interesting diuretic activity, which suggested that this diuretic effect is associated with the compounds contained in the fractions of intermediate polarity (ethyl acetate and n-butanol), decreasing in the most extreme apolar and polar sub-extracts (dichloromethane and methanol: water respectively). The increase in diuresis produced by these two extracts was very close to the values of Hydrochlorothiazide (32%) or Furosemide (39%), used as reference diuretics. CONCLUSIONS: These data, together with previous results on the aqueous and methanol extracts, reaffirm assertions made regarding the effectiveness of the extracts of this plant against urinary pathologies in the Canary Islands folk medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSmilax 3aacetates 3adiuresis 3adiuretics 3afurosemide 3ahydrochlorothiazide 3aindigenous species 3aislands 3alaboratory animals 3aleaves 3amethanol 3amice 3aoral administration 3aplant extracts 3arhizomes 3atraditional medicine 3aurine 2aAnimals 2aDiuresisxdrug effects 2aDiureticsxpharmacology 2aFurosemidexpharmacology 2aHydrochlorothiazidexpharmacology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIonsxurine 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leaves 2aPlant Stems 2aRhizome 2aSmilaxxchemistry 2aSodium Chloridexurine 2aUrinationxdrug effects 3aCanary Islands 0aSpain1 aMartín-Herrera, D.1 aBenjumea, D.1 aGutiérrez, S.

Since osteoclastogenesis is promoted by positive regulation of inflammatory cytokines, whether AIMP1 could promote osteoclastogenesis was investigated. AIMP1 induced osteoclastogenesis and acted synergistically with RANKL to promote osteoclastogenesis. Down-regulation of CD23, an AIMP1 receptor, abolished AIMP1-mediated osteoclastogenesis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed that the AIMP1 level was significantly higher in the peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients than in normal PB. A monoclonal antibody (clone 15B3AF) that blocked the cytokine activity of AIMP1 inhibited the AIMP1-mediated production of inflammatory cytokines. Clone 15B3AF inhibited the AIMP1-mediated osteoclastogenesis in vitro. We then cloned the complementary determining regions of clone 15B3AF and generated a chimeric antibody (atliximab). In a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model (CIA), atliximab administration significantly attenuated disease severity and improved various histopathological parameters. Three-dimensional micro-computed tomography scanning confirmed that atliximab enhanced the joint structures in CIA mice. Furthermore, atliximab decreased the expression of inflammatory cytokines in the serum and inflamed joints of CIA mice. Taken together, our findings suggest that AIMP1 exacerbates RA by promoting inflammation and osteoclastogenesis and that atliximab could be developed as a therapeutic antibody to target inflammatory diseases, including RA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3acytokines 3adisease severity 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3amice 3amicro-computed tomography 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneutralization 3apatients 3arheumatoid arthritis 3asynovial fluid 3atherapeutics 0aCytokine 0aOsteoclastogenesis 0aArthritis 0aAIMP11 aCho, Jin Gu1 aYoon, Kang Jun1 aLim, Dae-Seog1 aKim, Chul Hoon1 aLee, Sang Won,1 aPark, Sang Gyu0 tBiomaterials.g2015 Mar., v. 44 p.45-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013100162300001800293520169900311592002802010650002102038650001602059650001302075650001102088650002202099650002202121650002202143650002002165700002002185700001902205700001802224700001702242700002602259773011902285856007502404852000902479655001202488IND60550275520171214000000.0160910e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055027552DNAL7 a10.1021/jo501450k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaudel-Siri, Anouk10aTheoretical Study To Explain How Chirality Is Stored and Evolves throughout the Radical Cascade Rearrangement of Enyne-allenes  ap. 9086-9093.  aThis article reports a theoretical study to explain how the intrinsic property of chirality is retained throughout the radical cascade rearrangement of an enantiopure chiral enyne-allene (bearing one stereogenic center) selected as a model for this family of reactions. Calculations at the MRPT2/6-31G(d)//CASSCF(10,10)/6-31G(d) level of theory were used to determine the entire reaction pathway which includes singlet state diradicals and closed-shell species. The cascade process involves three elementary steps, i.e., by chronological order: Myers–Saito cycloaromatization (M-S), intramolecular hydrogen atom transfer (HAT), and recombination of the resulting biradical. The enantiospecificity of the reaction results from a double transmission of the stereochemical information, from the original center to an axis and eventually from this axis to the final center. The first two steps lead to a transient diradical intermediate which retains the chirality via the conversion of the original static chirogenic element into a dynamic one, i.e., a center into an axis. The only available routes to the final closed-shell tetracyclic product imply rotations around two σ bonds (σ(C–C) and σ(C–N), bonds β and α respectively). The theoretical calculations confirmed that the formation of the enantiomerically pure product proceeds via the nonracemizing rotation around the σ(C–C) pivot. They ruled out any rotation around the second σ(C–N) pivot. The high level of configurational memory in this rearrangement relies on the steric impediment to the rotation around the C–N bond in the chiral native conformation of the diradical intermediate produced from tandem M-S/1,5-HAT.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3aenantiomers 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aoptical isomerism 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3astereochemistry1 aCampolo, Damien1 aMondal, Shovan1 aNechab, Malek1 aSiri, Didier1 aBertrand, Michèle

We tested the physical landslide model, LAPSUS_LS, which models slope stability at the catchment scale. LAPSUS_LS combines a hydrological model with a Limit Equilibrium Method model, and calculates the factor of safety of individual cells based on their hydrological and geomorphological characteristics. We tested two types of vegetation on slope stability: (i) coffee monoculture (Coffea arabica) and (ii) a mixed plantation of coffee and deep rooting Erythrina (Erythrina poeppigiana) trees. Using soil and root data from Costa Rica, we performed simulations to test the response of LAPSUS_LS to root reinforcement, soil bulk density, transmissivity, internal friction angle and depth of shear plane. Furthermore, we modified the model to include biomass surcharge effect in the calculations. Results show that LAPSUS_LS was most sensitive to changes in additional cohesion from roots. When the depth of the shear plane was fixed at 1.0m, slopes were not unstable. However, when the shear plane was fixed to 1.5m, the mixed plantation of coffee and trees stabilized slopes, but the coffee monoculture was highly unstable, because root reinforcement was low at a depth of 1.5m. Soil transmissivity had a limited impact on the results compared to bulk density and internal friction angle. Biomass surcharge did not have any significant effect on the simulations. In conclusion, LAPSUS_LS responded well to the soil and vegetation input data, and is a suitable candidate for modeling the stability of vegetated slopes at the catchment level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea arabica 3aErythrina poeppigiana 3abiomass 3abulk density 3acohesion 3afriction 3ahydrologic models 3alandslides 3arooting 3asoil density 3atopographic slope 3atrees 3avegetation types 3awatersheds 3aCosta Rica 0aModeling 0aCohesion 0aRoots 0aSoil 0aTransmissivity 0aBulk density 0aSlope stability1 aRapidel, B.1 aRoupsard, O.1 aVillatoro-sánchez, M.1 aMao, Z.1 aNespoulous, J.1 aPérez, J.,1 aPrieto, I.1 aRoumet, C.1 aMetselaar, K.1 aSchoorl, J.M.1 aClaessens, L.1 aStokes, A.0 tEcological engineering.g2017 Dec., v. 109 p.249-255dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010500168300001800273520114900291592002801440596007001468596006701538596006801605650002101673650001301694650002501707650002101732650001001753650002401763650001801787650001901805650001301824650001601837650003101853650001601884650001401900700002401914700002101938700002301959700002301982773014302005856008302148852000902231655001202240IND60671409720221121033638.0210113e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067140972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-019-03318-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, Guido R.10aModulation of infusion processes to obtain coffee-derived food ingredients with distinct composition  ap. 2133-2146.  aCoffee infusion experiments were conducted to infer how operational variables (time, temperature, mass to volume ratio, and grinding) might affect the efficiency and/or selectivity of compounds extraction. Although the different variables have extensively been reported independently, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental design was yet delineated to study the simultaneous effect of variables in coffee composition. This study fulfills this gap by constructing surface models that reflect the responses in a wide-ranging design space. The freeze-dried extracts were compared regarding the overall yield of extraction, carbohydrate content and composition, caffeine, chlorogenic acid (5-CQA) content, color, and viscosity. Temperature was the major factor for coffee extracts differentiation, regarding both overall and carbohydrates yield and composition. The extraction process efficiency is more related to galactomannans extraction than arabinogalactans. Varying operational conditions, coffee extracts with distinct chemical properties are obtained from the same roasted coffee, broadening their applications in food formulations.  aPublisher supplied data  aFCT UID/QUI/00062/2019cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aSFRH/BD/104855/2014cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aSFRH/BDP/107881/2015cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3aarabinogalactans 3acaffeine 3acarbohydrate content 3achlorogenic acid 3acolor 3aexperimental design 3afreeze drying 3agalactomannans 3agrinding 3aingredients 3aphysicochemical properties 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aPassos, Cláudia P.1 aRodrigues, Carla1 aTeixeira, José A.1 aCoimbra, Manuel A.0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2019 Oct., v. 245, no. 10 p.2133-2146dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-019-03318-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245014000187300001800327520159500345592002801940650001301968650001301981650001701994650001502011650001502026650001602041650001402057650001902071650001202090650001202102650001602114650001502130650002002145650002302165650001102188650001202199650002002211650001202231650005102243650001502294650001702309650001702326650001402343650002902357650001502386650001302401650004702414650001602461650002202477650004902499700002402548700002302572700002102595773011702616856004802733852000902781655001202790IND50073544220221122132519.0140302e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007354422DNAL7 a242142972pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-013-3523-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Feng-Hsun10aTolerance values of benthic macroinvertebrates for stream biomonitoring: assessment of assumptions underlying scoring systems worldwide  ap. 2135-2149.  aTolerance values (TVs) based on benthic macroinvertebrates are one of the most widely used tools for monitoring the biological impacts of water pollution, particularly in streams and rivers. We compiled TVs of benthic macroinvertebrates from 29 regions around the world to test 11 basic assumptions about pollution tolerance, that: (1) Arthropoda are < tolerant than non-Arthropoda; (2) Insecta < non-Insecta; (3) non-Oligochaeta < Oligochaeta; (4) other macroinvertebrates < Oligochaeta + Chironomidae; (5) other macroinvertebrate taxa < Isopoda + Gastropoda + Hirudinea; (6) Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera (EPT) < Odonata + Coleoptera + Heteroptera (OCH); (7) EPT < non-EPT insects; (8) Diptera < Insecta; (9) Bivalvia < Gastropoda; (10) Baetidae < other Ephemeroptera; and (11) Hydropsychidae < other Trichoptera. We found that the first eight of these 11 assumptions were supported despite regional variability. In addition, we examined the effect of Best Professional Judgment (BPJ) and non-independence of TVs among countries by performing all analyses using subsets of the original dataset. These subsets included a group based on those systems using TVs that were derived from techniques other than BPJ, and groups based on methods used for TV assignment. The results obtained from these subsets and the entire dataset are similar. We also made seven a priori hypotheses about the regional similarity of TVs based on geography. Only one of these was supported. Development of TVs and the reporting of how they are assigned need to be more rigorous and be better described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBaetidae 3aBivalvia 3aChironomidae 3aColeoptera 3aGastropoda 3aHeteroptera 3aHirudinea 3aHydropsychidae 3aIsopoda 3aOdonata 3aOligochaeta 3aPlecoptera 3adata collection 3amacroinvertebrates 3arivers 3astreams 3awater pollution 2aAnimals 2aAquatic Organismsxclassificationxphysiology. 2aArthropods 2aBiodiversity 2aChironomidae 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGastropoda 2aInsecta. 2aInvertebratesxclassificationxphysiology. 2aOligochaeta 2aRiversxchemistry 2aWater Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data1 aLawrence, Justin E.1 aRios-Touma, Blanca1 aResh, Vincent H.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2014 Apr., v. 186, no. 4 p.2135-2149dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3523-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03973naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001600186245016400202300001100366506007600377520241100453592002802864506003702892650002102929650001602950650001402966650001302980650001402993650002103007650001203028650001403040650003503054650001703089650000903106650001103115650001203126650001403138650001703152650000903169650001403178700001903192700002303211700001603234773012903250856007903379852000903458655001203467IND60574932320221207064220.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057493232DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-962doi7 aPMC39847092pmcid7 a246128512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shu-Yih10aAbundant expression and functional participation of TRPV1 at Zusanli acupoint (ST36) in mice: mechanosensitive TRPV1 as an “acupuncture-responding channel”  ap. 96.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Acupuncture is a therapy that involves applying mechanical stimulation to acupoints using needles. Although acupuncture is believed to trigger neural regulation by opioids or adenosine, still little is known about how physical stimulation is turned into neurological signaling. The transient receptor potential vanilloid receptors 1 and 4 (TRPV1 and TRPV4) and the acid-sensing ion channel 3 (ASIC3) are regarded as mechanosensitive channels. This study aimed to clarify their role at the Zusanli acupoint (ST36) and propose possible sensing pathways linking channel activation to neurological signaling. METHODS: First, tissues from different anatomical layers of ST36 and the sham point were sampled, and channel expressions between the two points were compared using western blotting. Second, immunofluorescence was performed at ST36 to reveal distribution pattern of the channels. Third, agonist of the channels were injected into ST36 and tested in a mouse inflammatory pain model to seek if agonist injection could replicate acupuncture-like analgesic effect. Last, the components of proposed downstream sensing pathway were tested with western blotting to determine if they were expressed in tissues with positive mechanosensitive channel expression. RESULTS: The results from western blotting demonstrated an abundance of TRPV1, TRPV4, and ASIC3 in anatomical layers of ST36. Furthermore, immunofluorescence showed these channels were expressed in both neural and non-neural cells at ST36. However, only capsaicin, a TRPV1 agonist, replicated the analgesic effect of acupuncture when injected into ST36. Components of calcium wave propagation (CWP, the proposed downstream sensing pathway) were also expressed in tissues with abundant TRPV1 expression, the muscle and epimysium layers. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated mechanosensitive channel TRPV1 is highly expressed at ST36 and possibly participated in acupuncture related analgesia. Since CWP was reported by other to occur during acupuncture and its components were shown here to express in tissues with positive TRPV1 expression. These findings suggest TRPV1 might act as acupuncture-responding channel by sensing physical stimulation from acupuncture and conducting the signaling via CWP to nerve terminals. This study provided a better understanding between physical stimulation from acupuncture to neurological signaling.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aacupuncture 3aadenosine 3aagonists 3aanalgesia 3aanalgesic effect 3acalcium 3acapsaicin 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aion channels 3amice 3amodels 3amuscles 3anarcotics 3anerve tissue 3apain 3areceptors1 aChen, Wei-Hsin1 aHsieh, Ching-Liang1 aLin, Yi-Wen0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.96-96dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01962naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008300169300001600252520091400268592002801182653001301210653001701223653001401240653002101254653001901275700001701294700002301311700002201334700002301356773016701379856008101546852000901627655001201636IND60651112820221119204035.0190711e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065111282DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154140014652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZibrowius, Helmut10aShallow-water scleractinian corals of Ascension Island, Central South Atlantic  ap. 713-725.  aThe presence of five shallow-water scleractinian species at Ascension Island is confirmed, i.e. Favia gravida, Madracis sp., Siderastrea radians, Polycyathus atlanticus and Rhizosmilia gerdae.

Benzimidazole resistance in Haemonchus contortus was assessed by genetic analysis of eggs; measurement of resistant allele percentages at codons 167, 198 and 200 in the β-tubulin gene was determined on pools of H. contortus eggs using pyrosequencing. Susceptibility to benzimidazoles in gastro-intestinal nematodes was also determined using a Faecal Egg Count Reduction Test (FECRT) and a Larval Development Assay (LDA). In total, 16 farms were assessed with the genetic test. Based on resistant allele frequencies, all of the farms (16/16) tested had benzimidazole resistance in H. contortus; the overall percentage of benzimidazole-resistant H. contortus (estimated prior to treatment using the Hardy–Weinberg formula) was 68.5%. The FECRT and LDA were performed on 11 and 13 farms, respectively. Resistance to fenbendazole was detected on 100% (11/11) of the farms where the FECRT was performed. The LDA revealed the presence of thiabendazole resistance in H. contortus in 92% (12/13) of the farms. Estimated percentages of resistant parasites in H. contortus populations obtained with the two biological tests and the genetic test were compared. The results of the genetic test were in agreement with the biological tests and confirmed that benzimidazole resistance in H. contortus is present in Ontario sheep flocks. Differences between the different methods of drug resistance detection are discussed in terms of cost, time and sampling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemonchus contortus 3abenzimidazole 3adrug resistance 3aeggs 3afarms 3afecal egg count 3afenbendazole 3aflocks 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3agene frequency 3agenes 3alarval development 3asequence analysis 3asheep 3atubulin 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBenzimidazolesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aDrug Resistance 2aFecesxparasitology 2aHaemonchiasisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aHaemonchusxdrug effects 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aParasite Egg Count 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 3aOntario 0aOntarioxepidemiology. 0aHaemonchus contortus 0aBenzimidazole resistance 0aDetection 0aPyrosequencing 0aGenetic markers1 aFalzon, L.C.1 aShakya, K.P.1 aMenzies, P.I.1 aPeregrine, A.S.1 aPrichard, R.K.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 198, no. 1-2 p.159-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2013.07.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169300001800264520117400282592002801456596006101484650001101545650001001556650002001566650001301586650000901599650001401608653002901622653001401651653001601665653002001681653003001701653000901731700002501740700001401765773011701779856008501896852000901981655001201990IND60623942120221120154308.0181129e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062394212DNAL7 a10.1080/11263504.2018.14480132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhorasani, M.10aBulb tunic anatomy and its taxonomic implication in Allium L.

Three main types of crystals, i.e. prismatic, sand and druses, were fairly common among the investigated species except for the members of A. sect. Acanthoprason (A. subg. Melanocrommyum) that often lack crystals. The subepidermal layers of outer tunics were mostly composed of hexagonal, rectangular, or elongated cells but A. paradoxum (A. subg. Amerallium, sect. Briseis) showed the pentagonal type and A. longisepalum (A. subg. Amerallium, sect. Molium) the elliptic type of subepidermal cells. The members of A. sub. Melanocrommyum showed various types of tunic cells and crystals.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Guilandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009038 3aAllium 3abulbs 3acalcium oxalate 3acrystals 3asand 3atracheids 0aCalcium oxalate crystals 0alaticifer 0asystematics 0atracheid member 0asubgeneric classification 0aIran1 aSaeidi Mehrvarz, Sh.1 aZarre, S.0 tPlant biosystems.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 152, no. 6 p.1311-1328dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000133x1724-55757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11263504.2018.14480133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245018600158500001900344500002000363520185100383592002802234596005302262650001802315650001402333650002802347650002802375650001902403650001102422650001502433650001902448650001002467650002602477650002102503700001802524700001202542700005302554773012802607856007402735852000902809655001202818IND60710929520221120072352.0200914e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071092952DNAL7 a10.1111/jfbc.133682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ermiao12aA possible underlying mechanism behind the cardioprotective efficacy of tangeretin on isoproterenol triggered cardiotoxicity via modulating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in a rat model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study was aimed to examine the possible underlying cardioprotective efficacy of tangeretin (TAN) in rats exposed to isoproterenol (ISP). Forty male SD rats were separated into four equal groups as the control group, ISP (myocardial infarction; MI group) group rats which were injected intraperitoneally (ip) with 85 mg/kg of ISP. Treatment TAN groups (TAN 50 and TAN 100) rats were orally pretreated with TAN (50 or 100 mg/kg) for 28 days before ISP exposure. Pretreatment with TAN (50/100) significantly reduced (p < .05/0.01) the infarct size, levels of inflammatory markers, cardiac marker enzymes, apoptotic markers along with improved antioxidants. Histo‐morphological results also well‐supported the results of the above biochemical parameters by displaying normal myofibrillar arrangement in TAN pretreated rats. Moreover, the protein expressions of pPI3K and pAkt were considerably elevated in rats administered with TAN. Collectively, TAN pretreatment (especially TAN 100) display better cardioprotective activity against ISP‐induced MI rats. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Tangeretin (TAN) has been reported to exhibit an array of biological functions including cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, and renoprotective activities. However, the in‐depth mechanism is still lacking, which results in this study. Our results indicate that TAN could effectively reduce cardiac infarct size, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress, apoptotic markers, by modulating (upregulating) the protein expressions of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Thus, demonstrating that TAN could be a strong contender for developing a cardioprotective agent and can recommend along with conventional cardioprotective drugs for abolishing MI‐related complications/symptoms. Nevertheless, further human studies are needed to confirm the above suggestion.  aPublisher supplied data  cChina‐Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acardioprotective agents 3acardioprotective effect 3acardiotoxicity 3ahumans 3ainfarction 3aisoproterenols 3amales 3amyocardial infarction 3aoxidative stress1 aYang, Hailing1 aLi, Min1 aDing, Mei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6852-659X0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2020 Sept., v. 44, no. 9 p.e13368-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl8484x0145-88847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfbc.133683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02892naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245015300160300001800313520173100331592002802062650001202090650002102102650001102123650001102134650001202145650001102157650001102168650002002179700002202199700002602221700001902247700003402266773014602300856007502446852000902521655001202530IND60538960320170621000000.0160815e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053896032DNAL7 a10.1021/ja307229e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaestre, Lourdes12aA General Mechanism for the Copper- and Silver-Catalyzed Olefin Aziridination Reactions: Concomitant Involvement of the Singlet and Triplet Pathways  ap. 1338-1348.  aThe olefin aziridination reactions catalyzed by copper and silver complexes bearing hydrotris(pyrazolyl)borate (Tpˣ) ligands have been investigated from a mechanistic point of view. Several mechanistic probe reactions were carried out, specifically competition experiments with p-substituted styrenes, stereospecificity of olefins, effects of the radical inhibitors, and use of a radical clock. Data from these experiments seem to be contradictory, as they do not fully support the previously reported concerted or stepwise mechanisms. But theoretical calculations have provided the reaction profiles for both the silver and copper systems with different olefins to satisfy all experimental data. A mechanistic proposal has been made on the basis of the information that we collected from experimental and theoretical studies. In all cases, the reaction starts with the formation of a metal–nitrene species that holds some radical character, and therefore the aziridination reaction proceeds through the radical mechanism. The silver-based systems however hold a minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the triplet and closed-shell singlet surfaces, which induce the direct formation of the aziridines, and stereochemistry of the olefin is retained. In the case of copper, a radical intermediate is formed, and this intermediate constitutes the starting point for competition steps involving ring-closure (through a MECP between the open-shell singlet and triplet surfaces) or carbon–carbon bond rotation, and explains the loss of stereochemistry with a given substrate. Overall, all the initially contradictory experimental data fit in a mechanistic proposal that involves both the singlet and the triplet pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aborates 3achemical bonding 3acopper 3aenergy 3aligands 3aolefin 3asilver 3astereochemistry1 aSameera, W.

Based on the morphology and 16S rDNA sequence, the isolated myxobacteria were identified as Corallococcus sp., Pyxidicoccus sp., Myxococcus sp., Cystobacter sp. and Archangium sp. The myxobacteria were functionally characterized to assess their ability to produce antibacterial and anticancer metabolites. The isolates were found to be functionally versatile as they produced extracellular bioactive molecules that exhibited high frequency of activities against Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas syringae. The strains also showed cytotoxic activity against the human cancer cell lines of liver, pancreas, prostrate, bone and cervix. These results indicate the importance of isolating diverse strains of myxobacteria from unexplored habitats to find novel bioactive compounds. Moreover, the bioactive molecules explored in this study are predominantly hydrophilic compounds, obviating the limitations of solubility-related aspect of drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3apancreas 3aCystobacter 3amyxobacteria 3acervix 3aPseudomonas syringae 3ametabolites 3aCorallococcus 3aneoplasms 3adrugs 3aribosomal DNA 3ahydrophilicity 3aMycobacterium smegmatis 3ahumans 3acytotoxicity 3aantineoplastic activity 3aMyxococcus 3asoil 3abioactive compounds 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aantibacterial properties 3aArchangium 3aliver 3anucleotide sequences 3aBacillus cereus 3ahabitats 3aIndia 0aMyxobacteria1 aYadav, Arun Kumar1 aChambel, Priyanka1 aKaur, Ramandeep0 t3 Biotech.g2017 June, v. 7, no. 2 p.112-112dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0722-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010200170300001800272520127200290592002801562650004401590650001101634650001101645650002501656650001001681650001801691650001601709650001701725650002101742650001101763650002001774650002501794650003201819650001301851650002101864650001301885650001401898650002201912650001601934650001101950700002201961700002001983700001902003773014302022856008302165852000902248655001202257IND60671410120221120055340.0210113e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067141012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-019-03324-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcquistucci, Rita10aEffect of different leavening agents on the nutritional characteristics of two durum wheat breads  ap. 2173-2181.  aTwo durum wheat bread samples produced using the same re-milled semolina but different leavening agents (sourdough and compressed yeast) have been considered in this study. Chemical composition, color characteristics, lutein content and starch digestibility have been addressed in both samples. In addition, to evaluate possible modifications induced on the protein structure attributable to the different leavening agents used, the secondary structure of proteins was also studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The crumb of bread sample produced by compressed yeast exhibited a higher yellow index compared to the other sample but this difference was completely lost in crust because of the high baking temperature applied. Lutein resulted more preserved after the yeast fermentation due to the shorter time required for the fermentation with respect to sourdough. Total starch and resistant starch content resulted comparable in the two samples with the latter about 1% in both samples. The infrared spectroscopic study of the protein amide I band showed the lack of the random coil structure, related to the protein denaturation, and negligible changes in the relative ratios among the α-helix, β-sheet and β-turn secondary structures of proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abaking 3abreads 3achemical composition 3acolor 3adigestibility 3adurum wheat 3afermentation 3aleavening agents 3alutein 3anutritive value 3aprotein denaturation 3aprotein secondary structure 3aproteins 3aresistant starch 3asemolina 3asourdough 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3ayeasts1 aMelini, Valentina1 aTusa, Salvatore1 aMecozzi, Mauro0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2019 Oct., v. 245, no. 10 p.2173-2181dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-019-03324-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152024002200171024001900193040001800212100001700230245005400247300001600301520102300317592002801340650001501368650001201383650002001395650001601415650001101431650001601442650000901458773010701467856008201574990002301656852000901679655001201688IND60085568220221120044835.0141101e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008556822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tips.2012.08.0012doi7 aPMC34822902pmcid7 a229596522pmid7 aPMC34822902pmcid7 a229596522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Jianren10aCurrent challenges in translational pain research  ap. 568-573.  aThe current gap between basic science research and the development of new analgesics presents a serious challenge for the future of pain medicine. This challenge is particularly difficult in the search for better treatment for comorbid chronic pain conditions because: (i) animal ‘pain’ models do not simulate multidimensional clinical pain conditions; (ii) animal behavioral testing does not assess subjective pain experience; (iii) preclinical data provide little assurance regarding the direction of new analgesic development; and (iv) clinical trials routinely use over-sanitized study populations and fail to capture the multidisciplinary consequences of comorbid chronic pain. Therefore, a paradigm shift in translational pain research is necessary to transform the current strategy from focusing on molecular switches of nociception to studying pain as a system-based integral response that includes psychosocial comorbidities. Several key issues of translational pain research are discussed in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesics 3aanimals 3aclinical trials 3acomorbidity 3amodels 3anociception 3apain0 tTrends in pharmacological sciences.g2012 Nov., v. 33, no. 11 p.568-573dElsevier Ltdx0165-61477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tips.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01720naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008600169300001400255520059800269592002800867650003000895650001500925650002200940650001600962650001000978650001300988653002201001653001801023653001301041653002301054653002301077700002101100773015001121856007801271852000901349655001201358IND60522761620221118013833.0160604e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052276162DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-1987-1-2142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbraham, Wolf-Rainer10aBiotransformation of Humulene by Fungi and Enantioselectivity of the Strains Used  ap. 79-86.  aHumulene was transform ed by strains of Chaetomium cochlioides and Diplodia gossypina ATCC 10936 affording 33 new humulanes.

Highly accurate quantum-chemical protocols exist for computation of ¹H magnetic shieldings in the various contexts, making proton chemical shifts potentially a powerful predictor of structural and electronic properties. However, ¹H CS tensors are not yet widely used in protein structure calculation due to scarcity of experimental data. While isotropic proton shifts can be readily measured in proteins even in the solid state, determination of the ¹H chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensors remains challenging, particularly in molecules containing multiple proton sites. We present a method for site-resolved measurement of amide proton CSAs in fully protonated solids under magic angle spinning. The approach consists of three concomitant 3D experiments yielding spectra determined by either mainly ¹H CSA, mainly ¹H–¹⁵N dipolar, or combined ¹H CSA and ¹H–¹⁵N dipolar interactions. The anisotropic interactions are recoupled using RN-sequences of appropriate symmetry, such as R12₁⁴, and ¹⁵N/¹³C isotropic CS dimensions are introduced via a short selective ¹H–¹⁵N cross-polarization step. Accurate ¹H chemical shift tensor parameters are extracted by simultaneous fit of the lineshapes recorded in the three spectra. An application of this method is presented for an 89-residue protein, U-¹³C,¹⁵N-CAP-Gly domain of dynactin. The CSA parameters determined from the triple fits correlate with the hydrogen-bonding distances, and the trends are in excellent agreement with the prior solution NMR results. This approach is generally suited for recording proton CSA parameters in various biological and organic systems, including protein assemblies and nucleic acids.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahydrogen bonding 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anucleic acids 3aprotein structure 3aproteins 3aspinning 3astandard operating procedures1 aParamasivam, Sivakumar1 aYan, Si1 aPolenova, Tatyana1 aVega, Alexander J.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 135, no. 4 p.1358-1368dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja30849723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04040naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245011300181300001600294520170900310592002802019596007902047596008402126596008402210596008402294596010402378596010902482650002502591650002202616650002502638650001502663650001302678650001902691650000902710650001302719650002002732650000902752650001402761650001602775650001802791650001402809650002002823650001102843650001902854650002102873650002202894651002102916700004302937700002302980700002003003700001903023700002103042700002903063700001903092700002903111700002203140773015003162856008103312852000903393655001203402IND60620733120221118104622.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062073312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-018-9535-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandalski, Priscila Krebsbach10aEffects of short-term thermal stress on the plasma biochemical profiles of two Antarctic nototheniid species  ap. 925-940.  aThermal elevation records in the Austral Ocean have raised questions about the physiological impacts on Antarctic organisms which have evolved under cold and stable water temperatures. Some notothenioid fishes exhibit species-specific responses to elevated temperature, yet the mechanisms involved in restoring homeostasis are unclear. Our study focused on the physiological effects of short-term (2–144 h) exposure to water temperatures of 8 °C on the plasma biochemical profiles of Notothenia coriiceps and Notothenia rossii, species that are abundant in Admiralty Bay, King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula, a region where increasing temperatures have been detected. Despite being phylogenetically similar, these species responded differently to thermal stress. N. rossii showed no changes in cortisol levels, and transient hyperglycemia was likely triggered by elevated catecholamine levels; conversely, metabolic and antioxidant defense parameters were unaffected. Increased gill Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity was observed only in N. rossii after 24 h at 8 °C, which assists in maintaining ionic homeostasis. In N. coriiceps, cortisol accurately indicated thermal stress. Increased cortisol levels in N. coriiceps additionally resulted in transient secondary responses such as hyperglycemia and hyperlactemia, as well as reduced levels of total protein, globulins and triglycerides. Unlike in N. rossii, catalase activity in N. coriiceps was modulated at 8 °C, and this parameter is thus considered a good biomarker of thermal stress. Results suggest that N. coriiceps is more sensitive to thermal stress than is N. rossii and that the former is a potential bioindicator for Admiralty Bay.  aPublisher supplied data  a2443/2011cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a52.0125/2008-8cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a30.5562/2009-6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a30.5969/2012-9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  aCNPq 574.018/2008-5cInstituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Antártico de Pesquisas Ambientais  aFAPERJ E-26/170.023/2008cInstituto Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia Antártico de Pesquisas Ambientais 3aNotothenia coriiceps 3aNotothenia rossii 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3acatecholamines 3acold 3acortisol 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3aglobulins 3ahomeostasis 3ahyperglycemia 3aphylogeny 3aprotein content 3asodium 3athermal stress 3atriacylglycerols 3awater temperature 3aAntarctic region1 ade Souza, Maria Rosa Dmengeon Pedreiro1 aHerrerias, Tatiana1 aMachado, Cintia1 aZaleski, Tania1 aForgati, Mariana1 aGuillen, Angela Carolina1 aViana, Douglas1 aMoura, Mauricio Osvaldo,1 aDonatti, Lucélia0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2018 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.925-940dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3871702x0960-31667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-018-9535-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01620naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245008300159300001800242520064500260592002800905650001100933650001000944650000900954650001100963650002200974650001300996650001701009700002101026700001701047773014601064856007501210852000901285655001201294IND60538960620221120032112.0160815e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053896062DNAL7 a10.1021/ja308528d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarnke, Stephan10aProtein Structure in the Gas Phase: The Influence of Side-Chain Microsolvation  ap. 1177-1180.  aThere is ongoing debate about the extent to which protein structure is retained after transfer into the gas phase. Here, using ion-mobility spectrometry, we investigated the impact of side-chain–backbone interactions on the structure of gas-phase protein ions by noncovalent attachment of crown ethers (CEs). Our results indicate that in the absence of solvent, secondary interactions between charged lysine side chains and backbone carbonyls can significantly influence the structure of a protein. Once the charged residues are capped with CEs, certain charge states of the protein are found to undergo significant structural compaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethers 3agases 3aions 3alysine 3aprotein structure 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy1 avon Helden, Gert1 aPagel, Kevin0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 135, no. 4 p.1177-1180dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja308528d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016300160520215100323592002802474650001502502650001202517650002202529650002202551650001602573650001502589650001702604650002002621650001702641651001102658700002302669700002302692700001902715700002002734700002602754700002102780700001902801700001902820773012002839856007302959852000903032655001203041IND60745443820221121221052.0210723e20210622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074544382DNAL7 a10.3390/f120708212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMátyás, Csaba,10aSurprising Drought Tolerance of Fir (Abies) Species between Past Climatic Adaptation and Future Projections Reveals New Chances for Adaptive Forest Management  aResearch Highlights: Data of advanced-age provenance tests were reanalyzed applying a new approach, to directly estimate the growth of populations at their original sites under individually generated future climates. The results revealed the high resilience potential of fir species. Background and Objectives: The growth and survival of silver fir under future climatic scenarios are insufficiently investigated at the xeric limits. The selective signature of past climate determining the current and projected growth was investigated to analyze the prospects of adaptive silviculture and assisted transfer of silver fir populations, and the introduction of non-autochthonous species. Materials and Methods: Hargreaves’ climatic moisture deficit was selected to model height responses of adult populations. Climatic transfer distance was used to assess the relative drought stress of populations at the test site, relating these to the past conditions to which the populations had adapted. ClimateEU and ClimateWNA pathway RCP8.5 data served to determine individually past, current, and future moisture deficit conditions. Besides silver fir, other fir species from South Europe and the American Northwest were also tested. Results: Drought tolerance profiles explained the responses of transferred provenances and predicted their future performance and survival. Silver fir displayed significant within-species differentiation regarding drought stress response. Applying the assumed drought tolerance limit of 100 mm relative moisture deficit, most of the tested silver fir populations seem to survive their projected climate at their origin until the end of the century. Survival is likely also for transferred Balkan fir species and for grand fir populations, but not for the Mediterranean species. Conclusions: The projections are less dramatic than provided by usual inventory assessments, considering also the resilience of populations. The method fills the existing gap between experimentally determined adaptive response and the predictions needed for management decisions. It also underscores the unique potential of provenance tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aclimate 3adrought tolerance 3aforest management 3ainventories 3aprovenance 3asilviculture 3astress response 3awater stress 3aEurope1 aBeran, František 1 aDostál, Jaroslav,1 aČáp, Jiří,1 aFulín, Martin 1 aVejpustková, Monika 1 aBožič, Gregor 1 aBalázs, Pál,1 aFrýdl, Josef 0 tForests.g2021 June 22, v. 12, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f120708213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001700180245009200197300001800289506007600307520105500383592002801438506003701466650001001503650002101513650002201534650002101556650001201577650001501589650001901604700003101623700002001654773013101674856007501805852000901880655001201889IND60538960720221207122359.0160815e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053896072DNAL7 a10.1021/ja308952y2doi7 aPMC35801252pmcid7 a232762632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, DengGuo10aSmall-molecule Binding to the DNA Minor Groove Is Mediated by a Conserved Water Cluster  ap. 1369-1377.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHigh-resolution crystal structures of the DNA duplex sequence d(CGCGAATTCGCG)₂ complexed with three minor-groove ligands are reported. A highly conserved cluster of 11 linked water molecules has been found in the native and all 3 ligand-bound structures, positioned at the boundary of the A/T and G/C regions where the minor groove widens. This cluster appears to play a key structural role in stabilizing noncovalently binding small molecules in the AT region of the B-DNA minor groove. The cluster extends from the backbone phosphate groups along the mouth of the groove and links to DNA and ligands by a network of hydrogen bonds that help to maintain the ligands in position. This arrangement of water molecules is distinct from, but linked by, hydrogen bonding to the well-established spine of hydration, which is displaced by bound ligands. Features of the water cluster and observed differences in binding modes help to explain the measured binding affinities and thermodynamic characteristics of these ligands on binding to AT sites in DNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-DNA 3abinding capacity 3acrystal structure 3ahydrogen bonding 3aligands 3aphosphates 3athermodynamics1 aWilson, W.

Because agriculture is a major land use worldwide, changes in farming practices can have major repercussions for biodiversity. Particularly in Western Europe, ongoing intensification and scale enlargement but also land abandonment and poor agricultural practices leading to land degradation form a major threat to agrobiodiversity. Agro-ecological farming practices are suggested as an alternative way of farming in order to conserve and enhance biodiversity. Yet knowledge about what factors explain farmers’ adoption of agro-ecological farming practices is fragmented and incomplete. In this paper, we offer a holistic framework that specifies these factors and how they are interconnected. The framework is illustrated and refined by means of a case study analysis of almond farming in Andalusia. The chosen case represents a specific localized farming practice that currently negatively impacts biodiversity but for which agro-ecology forms an attractive alternative regarding biodiversity. The case study demonstrates that our framework offers a useful tool to systematically identify the different factors that affect agro-ecological farming adoption, interlinkages between factors and particularly the more structural barriers to agro-ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabandoned land 3aagricultural land 3aagroecology 3aalmonds 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3afarming systems 3ahabitats 3aland degradation 3aland use 3aWestern European region 0aAgro-ecology 0aadoption 0asustainable agriculture 0aonion model 0aagrobiodiversity 0agovernance1 aRunhaar, Hens0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 16, no. 6 p.442-454dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2018.15376643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245018500177300001600362520158100378592002801959650004401987650000902031650002502040650001902065650001902084650001802103650001602121650002402137650004102161650001302202650001302215650001902228650001102247650001802258650000702276650001602283650003302299650001602332650001102348650001502359653002502374653001802399653003902417653002102456653002202477700001602499700001902515773010502534856008602639852000902725655001202734IND60611224520221122102403.0200517e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061122452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Sanjeeb Kumar10aOptimization of process parameters for the yeast mediated degradation of benzo[a]pyrene in presence of ZnO nanoparticles and produced biosurfactant using 3-level Box-Behnken design  ap. 497-503.  aIn the present study, response surface methodology (RSM) employing 3-level Box-Behnken design was used to optimize the parameters for benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) degradation using yeast consortium YC01 in presence of zinc oxide nanoparticles and produced biosurfactant in the growth medium. The biosurfactant producing ability of YC01 was investigated by drop collapsing test, methylene blue agar plate method and emulsification index (E₂₄). Various process parameters viz. pH (A: 5.0–9.0), temperature (B: 10–50° C), shaking sped (C: 110–150 rpm), inoculum dosage (D: 1–5%) and ZnO nanoparticle concentration (E: 1–3 g/L) were chosen for optimization. Maximum BaP degradation was found to be 82.67 ± 0.01 (%) at central values of all the factors viz., pH 7.0, temperature 30 °C and shaking speed 130 rpm in the presence of 2 g/L of ZnO nanoparticle using 3% inoculum dosage of yeast consortium YC01 after 6 days of incubation period. It was well in close agreement with the predicated value obtained by RSM model yield 82.67 ± 0.04 (%). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed F-value of 66.09, R² of 0.9814, probability of <0.0001 and coefficient of variation of 0.97%, which confirmed the validity of the model. Degradation of BaP was confirmed using GC–MS and FTIR analysis. Kinetic study demonstrated that BaP degradation fitted first order kinetic model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on statistical optimization of BaP degradation using yeast consortium in presence of ZnO nanoparticles and produced biosurfactant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagar 3aanalysis of variance 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abiosurfactants 3aculture media 3aemulsifying 3aexperimental design 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ainoculum 3akinetics 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aprobability 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3ayeasts 3azinc oxide 0aBenzo[a]pyrene (BaP) 0aBiosurfactant 0aResponse surface methodology (RSM) 0aYeast consortium 0aZnO nanoparticles1 aOjha, Nupur1 aDas, Nilanjana0 tEcological engineering.g2018 Sept., v. 120 p.497-503dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002900139245011600168300001200284520157100296592002801867650001601895650001601911650002901927650002401956650002601980650002502006650000902031650001902040650001502059650002102074650002002095650001002115650001102125650001602136650002602152650002202178650002102200650001802221650001802239653002402257653002702281653002602308653001902334700002402353700002202377773009902399856007702498852000902575655001202584IND4414904020221118011108.0151127e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441490402DNAL7 a10.1614/WS-08-093.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelgaleil, Samir A. M.10aHerbicidal Activity of Three Sesquiterpene Lactones on Wild Oat (Avena fatua) and Their Possible Mode of Action  ap. 6-9.  aInhibitory effects of two sesquiterpene lactones, costunolide and parthenolide, isolated from dichloromethane extract of the stem bark of southern magnolia and a parthenolide derivative, 1,10-epoxyparthenolide, were evaluated on germination and seedling growth of wild oat. The sesquiterpene lactones effected a significant reduction of seed germination, particularly at the highest concentrations of 200, 400, and 600 mg L⁻⁻¹, with costunolide being the most active one. Furthermore, the three sesquiterpenes strongly inhibited root and shoot growth of the weed. However, the inhibition of root growth by all compounds was greater than that of shoot growth. Parthenolide inhibited growth of both root and shoot more strongly than the other compounds and a reference herbicide imazamethabenz. At a concentration of 100 mg L⁻⁻¹, parthenolide caused 87 and 41%% growth inhibition of root and shoot, respectively. Parthenolide was tested for its effect on acetolactate synthase (ALS) activity. The compound inhibited the enzyme in a concentration-dependent manner, with 50%% inhibition of 51.44 µµM. The results of this study indicated that the herbicidal activity of the isolated sesquiterpene may be attributed to inhibition of ALS. The promising phytotoxic activity of sesquitepene lactones reported here could be considered a starting point for developing environmentally safer herbicides.Nomenclature: Costunolide, parthenolide, 1,10-epoxyparthenolide, imazamethabenz, wild oat, Avena fatua L.; southern magnolia, Magnolia grandiflora L.

The situation and transition of households’ livelihood in agricultural heritage systems  ap. 455-471.  aZhagana Agriculture-Forest-Animal Husbandry Composite System (ZCS) is the first Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems site in the Tibetan Plateau. Similar to many traditional agricultural regions, with the development of tourism and leisure agriculture, the peasant households in ZCS have gradually changed their livelihood strategies and livelihood activities in the past 10 years, resulting in the disappearance of some traditional farming methods and agricultural landscapes with a long history. By taking livelihood assets as the entry point and livelihood strategies as the core, this paper analyzed the basic situation of households’ livelihood and the transition mechanism of different livelihood strategies in order to offer suggestions for the dynamic conservation and sustainable development of Agricultural Heritage Systems (AHS). (1) The livelihood strategies of peasant households in ZCS can be divided into two major categories: specialized strategies and diversified strategies. (2) According to the empirical calculation of the livelihood asset accounting framework of AHS, the average livelihood asset value of peasant households in ZCS is 2.040, showing that the situation of peasant households’ livelihood is inadequate. (3) The transition of peasant households’ livelihood strategies from traditional strategy to specialized or diversified livelihood strategies is mainly influenced by natural assets, human assets, cultural assets, social assets and informational assets. In order to meet the growing material and spiritual needs of peasant households and achieve the sustainable development of ZCS simultaneously, it is suggested that the agriculture-forestry-animal husbandry-tourism composite strategies shall be taken as the development direction of peasant households’ livelihood strategies.  aThis work was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 41201586]; National Key R&D Program of China [grant number 2017YFC0506402].  aPublisher supplied data  a41201586cThe National Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a2017YFC0506402cNational Key R&D Plan of China 3aagricultural land 3aassets 3acultural heritage 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3alivelihood 3apeasantry 3asustainable development 3atourism 3atraditional farming 3aChina 0aAgricultural heritage systems 0asustainable livelihood strategy 0alivelihood asset 0aTibetan plateau1 aLiu, Moucheng1 aMin, Qingwen1 aLi, Wenhua0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2018 Nov. 2, v. 16, no. 6 p.455-471dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4004155x1747-762X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2018.15376693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245014900205300001800354506007600372520114000448592002801588506003701616650003001653650001201683650001301695650002501708650001701733650001201750650001201762650001901774650002201793650001501815650001301830650001301843650001701856650001401873700002001887700001901907700002301926700002201949700002101971773011901992856007502111852000902186655001202195IND60550276520221207124100.0160910e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055027652DNAL7 a10.1021/jo501529k2doi7 aPMC41844632pmcid7 a251844382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrasutsky, Sergiy

We synthesized five d-MEP analoguesd-erythritol-4-phosphate (EP), d-3-methylthrietol-4-phosphate (MTP), d-3-ethylerythritol-4-phosphate (EEP), d-1-amino-3-methylerythritol-4-phosphate (NMEP), and d-3-methylerythritol-4-thiolophosphate (MESP)and studied their ability to function as alternative substrates for the reactions catalyzed by the IspDF fusion and IspE proteins from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which covert MEP to the corresponding eight-membered cyclic diphosphate. All of the analogues, except MTP, and their products were substrates for the three consecutive enzymes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aArchaea 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3achloroplasts 3acytosol 3aenzymes 3aglyceraldehyde 3aorganic chemistry 3aphosphates 3aproteins 3aprotists 3apyruvic acid 3asynthesis1 aUrbansky, Marek1 aDavis, Chad E.1 aLherbet, Christian1 aCoates, Robert M.1 aPoulter, C.

Sw. accessions in India  ap. 106.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic variation of 36 Sechium edule accessions collected across 12 states in India was assessed using morphological traits and DAMD markers. Eighteen fruit morphological traits (both qualitative and quantitative) were evaluated to confirm the variations in the present collection. Quantitative traits showed major variations with respect to fruit weight (7.85–498.33 g/fruit), fruit length (5.8–15 cm/fruit), fruit diameter (6–28 cm/fruit) and length of the spine (0–5 cm). Qualitative traits were also diverse in fruit colour, shape, spine density, reticulation, flexibility of spine and furrow depth. The first six principle components showed 82.88% variation in the principal component analysis. The principal component analysis revealed that fruit weight, fruit width, fruit diameter, fruit shape, length of spine, spine density and furrow depth had a significant contribution to the total variation. The DNA analysis performed using DAMD primers were used for deducing the diversity at DNA level. The collection produced 102 bands out of which 97 were polymorphic and the percentage polymorphism ranged between 66.66 and 100 per primer. Discrete pattern of clustering was obtained using UPGMA method of complete linkage percent disagreement revealing high diversity among the collected accessions. Thus, the present study indicates that molecular and morphological marker map would improve our knowledge of S. edule and would facilitate efforts to breed improved S. edule cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aSechium edule 3acolor 3acultivars 3afruits 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aplant spines 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquantitative traits 3aIndia1 aTimsina, Bibechana1 aSatyan, Kumudini Belur1 aManohar, Shiragambi Hanumantagouda0 t3 Biotech.g2017 June, v. 7, no. 2 p.106-106dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0726-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02017naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011800165300001600283520099600299592002801295650002201323650001601345650001501361650002301376650001701399650001701416700001901433700002001452700001801472700002001490773011201510856004801622852000901670655001201679IND4450660020221118074724.0121003e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445066002DNAL7 a10.1134/S00036838110201042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuyukina, M.

Despite this, it remains relatively understudied compared to other fisheries issues. This is the first review of the literature relating to shark depredation, which also includes an overview of the potential mechanisms underlying its occurrence and options for mitigation. Furthermore, this review highlights key research gaps that remain to be investigated, thereby providing impetus for future research. In total, 61 studies have been published between 1955 and 2018, which include information on shark depredation. These studies recorded quantitative rates of depredation between 0.9 and 26% in commercial and recreational fisheries and during research fishing, identified 27 shark species from seven families that were responsible for depredation and discussed potential factors influencing its occurrence. Information from research into bycatch mitigation and the testing of shark deterrent approaches and technologies is also presented, in the context of applying these approaches to the reduction of shark depredation.

The reaction has a broad scope with respect to carboxylic acids and ynol ethers, delivering (Z)-α-alkoxy enol esters in good yields with excellent regio- and stereoselectivity. Meaningfully, the Ni-catalyzed selective coupling of alkenyl C–OPiv bonds of (Z)-α-alkoxy enol esters with boronic acids enables a convenient route to the access of (E)-enol ethers. As such, the two-step procedure, consisted of a hydrocarboxylation and a subsequent Suzuki–Miyaura coupling, offers a formal trans hydroarylation of ynol ethers, thus providing a good complementary method to our previous report.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuzuki reaction 3acarboxylic acids 3achemical structure 3aenols 3aesters 3aethers 3aorganic chemistry 3astereoselectivity1 aBai, Yihui1 aMao, Mengyi1 aZhu, Gangguo0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2014 Oct. 03, v. 79, no. 19 p.9179-9185dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjo501615a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009300154300001800247520156900265592002801834650002101862650001601883650002301899650001701922650001101939650002401950650002101974650001501995650001302010650002102023650001802044650000702062650001302069650002202082650001902104650001902123650001702142650003702159650001902196700001802215700001902233700001402252700001702266700001902283700001602302773014202318856007402460852000902534655001202543IND60671040920221116142845.0191002e20150318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067104092DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb02106a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Qian10aDiol glycidyl ether-bridged low molecular weight PEI as potential gene delivery vehicles  ap. 2660-2670.  aA series of cationic polymers (P1–P5) were designed and synthesized using a ring-opening polymerization strategy based on low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI) and using diglycidyl ethers as the bridging moiety. Although these polymers have reduced amino group density relative to 25 kDa PEI, their pH buffering capacity and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) binding ability were seldom affected. They were able to condense plasmid DNA (pDNA) well to form nanoparticles of suitable sizes (150–300 nm) and positive zeta potentials (+25–40 mV). Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assays revealed that polyplexes formed from these polymers have lower cytotoxicity than those derived from PEI. Luciferase reporter gene delivery experiments indicated that these polymers have much better transfection efficiency than 25 kDa PEI, especially P2 and P5. Unlike PEI, serum has little negative effect on the transfection by these materials, and their transfection efficiencies were seldom reduced even with high concentrations of serum. Under optimized conditions, up to 400 times higher transfection efficiency than with PEI could be achieved. Several assays including gel electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy also confirmed the good serum tolerance of these polyplexes. The evenly distributed hydroxyl groups formed by the ring-opening polymerization are considered to contribute much to their high serum tolerance, and such polymerization might be a promising strategy for the design of efficient non-viral gene delivery vectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3ablood serum 3abuffering capacity 3acytotoxicity 3aethers 3agel electrophoresis 3alight scattering 3aluciferase 3amoieties 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aplasmids 3apolyethyleneimine 3apolymerization 3areporter genes 3atransfection 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aLiu, Yan-Hong1 aXun, Miao-Miao1 aZhang, Ji1 aHuang, Zheng1 aZhou, Xue-Dong1 aYu, Xiao-Qi0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Mar. 18, v. 3, no. 13 p.2660-2670dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb02106a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245015500168300001600323506002800339520172100367592002802088506003702116650001802153650001802171650001502189650001802204650001502222650001002237650000802247650000902255650001802264650001202282650001502294650001302309650001802322650001702340651001402357653001402371653001402385653003302399653001702432653002102449700001902470773010202489856008002591852000902671655001202680IND60764480220221207072550.0211116e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076448022DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d1802532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aROHYANI, IMMY SUCI10aShort Communication: Diversity and abundance of soil insects at Jeruk Manis Protected Forest in East Lombok (Indonesia) using several trapping methods  ap. 809-812.  aResource is Open Access  aRohyani IS, Ahyadi H. 2017. Short Communication: Diversity and abundance of soil insects at Jeruk Manis Protected Forest in East Lombok (Indonesia) using several trapping methods. Biodiversitas 18: 809-812. Insects are the most successful organisms because it can live in almost all types of habitats, namely water (freshwater and sea), land, air, and even in both hot and cold climates. Identification of soil insects in a certain type of habitat requires practical, easy, inexpensive, and efficient collection methods so as to obtain high abundance and diversity of soil insects. This study aims to analyze the diversity and abundance of soil insects using several trapping methods in Jeruk Manis Protected Forest in East Lombok. There are five trapping methods applied in this study; (i) pitfall trap, (ii) pitfall traps with bait, (iii) yellow pan traps, (iv) soil sampling, and (v) forest floor collection. The findings show that the overall diversity of soil insects in Jeruk Manis Protected Forest is moderate (1.44), while its evenness level is low (0.48). Soil sampling method provides diversity value of 2.36 and evenness level of 0.89, which is also the highest one among the other methods. Pitfall traps with bait give high individual number of soil insects (10.577 individuals). The highest number of soil insect orders is obtained through forest floor collection with 11 orders, while the highest number of soil insect families is obtained through pitfall trap with 30 families. The taxa of soil insects with relatively highest abundance consecutively are Hymenoptera (Formicidae), Collembola (Isotomidae, Entomobryidae), Coleoptera (Hydrophilidae, Ptiliidae, Scarabeidae), and Diptera (Drosophilidae).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophilidae 3aEntomobryidae 3aFormicidae 3aHydrophilidae 3aIsotomidae 3aManis 3aair 3acold 3aforest litter 3aforests 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3apitfall traps 3asoil insects 3aIndonesia 0aabundance 0adiversity 0ajeruk manis protected forest 0asoil insects 0atrapping methods1 aAHYADI, HILMAN0 tBiodiversitas.g2017 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.809-812dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d1802533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005800144245010100202300002000303520175000323592002802073650001502101650002602116650001102142650002102153650001302174650001402187650001102201650001202212650001402224653003002238653002002268653001802288653003002306653002102336700002402357700005802381700006202439700006402501700005902565773014202624856007802766852000902844655001202853IND60623809620221120214623.0181129e20181029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062380962DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b147562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarzia, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8797-866610aHigh-Throughput Screening of Metal–Organic Frameworks for Macroscale Heteroepitaxial Alignment  ap. 40938-40950.  aThe ability to align porous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) on substrate surfaces on a macroscopic scale is a vital step toward integrating MOFs into functional devices. But macroscale surface alignment of MOF crystals has only been demonstrated in a few cases. To accelerate the materials discovery process, we have developed a high-throughput computational screening algorithm to identify MOFs that are likely to undergo macroscale aligned heterepitaxial growth on a substrate. Screening of thousands of MOF structures by this process can be achieved in a few days on a desktop workstation. The algorithm filters MOFs based on surface chemical compatibility, lattice matching with the substrate, and interfacial bonding. Our method uses a simple new computationally efficient measure of the interfacial energy that considers both bond and defect formation at the interface. Furthermore, we show that this novel descriptor is a better predictor of aligned heteroepitaxial growth than other established interface descriptors, by testing our screening algorithm on a sample set of copper MOFs that have been grown heteroepitaxially on a copper hydroxide surface. Application of the screening process to several MOF databases reveals that the top candidates for aligned growth on copper hydroxide comprise mostly MOFs with rectangular lattice symmetry in the plane of the substrate. This result indicates a substrate-directing effect that could be exploited in targeted synthetic strategies. We also identify that MOFs likely to form aligned heterostructures have broad distributions of in-plane pore sizes and anisotropies. Accordingly, this suggests that aligned MOF thin films with a wide range of properties may be experimentally accessible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acoordination polymers 3acopper 3acopper hydroxide 3acrystals 3adatabases 3aenergy 3afilters 3ascreening 0ametal−organic framework 0aporous material 0aheteroepitaxy 0ahigh-throughput screening 0alattice matching1 aTakahashi, Masahide1 aFalcaro, Paolo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5935-04091 aThornton, Aaron W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7959-13971 aDoonan, Christian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2822-09561 aHuang, David M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2048-45000 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 10, no. 47 p.40938-40950dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b147563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017400172300001600346520147600362592002801838650002101866650002501887650002001912650002301932650001201955650001101967650001901978650001201997650001902009650001502028650001902043650001202062650002102074650001102095650002602106650001802132650002702150650001702177650002302194650002902217650001002246650001102256650002502267650002502292651001302317653002102330653002302351653004002374653002002414653002002434653002502454700001802479700001502497700002502512700002202537773011702559856005102676852000902727655001202736IND50075049820221123042103.0140410e20110101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007504982DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2010.5345502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWooley, Stuart C.14aThe lesser of two weevils: physiological responses of spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) to above- and belowground herbivory by Larinus minutus and Cyphocleonus achates  ap. 153-170.  aThe physiological responses of plants to variable levels of root and shoot herbivory in the field may yield valuable insights regarding potential compensation or tolerance responses for herbivory. In an infestation of Centaurea stoebe (spotted knapweed) located in the Colorado foothills, we measured physiology, biomass, and flower production of individual plants undergoing a natural range of herbivory by the above- and belowground biological control insects, Larinus minutus and Cyphocleonus achates. Over the growing season, net carbon assimilation rate, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and intercellular leaf [CO₂] (Cᵢ) all decreased, while water use efficiency increased. The decrease in these physiological traits was due to an increase in the intensity of L. minutus damage over time; effects of C. achates root damage to plant physiology, including transpiration were only marginally significant. The effects of these two species on plant physiology were not interactive, and Larinus minutus was found to exert larger negative effects on this invasive plant in terms of plant physiology and potential reproductive output than C. achates. While previous studies have shown C. achates to have significant negative effects on population densities of spotted knapweed, the addition of Larinus minutus to the suite of insects used in biological control of spotted knapweed should facilitate continued or enhanced reduction in densities of this noxious weed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentaurea stoebe 3aCyphocleonus achates 3aLarinus minutus 3abiological control 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aflowers 3agrowing season 3aherbivores 3ainsect control 3ainsects 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3anet assimilation rate 3anoxious weeds 3aphysiological response 3aplant damage 3apopulation density 3areproductive performance 3aroots 3ashoots 3astomatal conductance 3awater use efficiency 3aColorado 0aplant physiology 0abiological control 0aCentaurea stoebe L. ssp. micranthos 0ainvasive plants 0aLarinus minutus 0aCyphocleonus achates1 aSmith, Bonnie1 aKing, Chad1 aSeastedt, Timothy R.1 aKnochel, David G.0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 21, no. 2 p.153-170dTaylor & Francis Groupx1360-04787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2010.534550  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011200174520126000286592002801546650001501574650001701589650001901606650002101625650001001646650001201656650001201668650002201680650001201702650001101714650001601725650001901741653001901760653001101779653002001790653001901810653001201829700001401841700002501855700001901880700002401899773009801923856008702021852000902108655001202117IND60690598720221118163842.0200601e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069059872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1149722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstanek, Jason K.10aSimulating onset and evolution of thermal runaway in Li-ion cells using a coupled thermal and venting model  aA coupled, thermal and gas generation/venting model has been developed for simulating the onset and evolution of thermal runaway in 18650 format Li-ion battery cells. The model simulates heat and gas generation during external heating of an electrically isolated cell that results in thermal runaway. Gas generation within the cell leads to pressure build up until the point at which the vent mechanism opens and relieves the internal pressure. Compressible flow of gases is modeled through the vent cap as a function of pressure ratio across the vent. The energy balance of the battery cell includes: heat generated from decomposition reactions and electrical short, external heat transfer to the surroundings, heat absorbed with vaporization and melting processes, as well as the energy loss as material is vented from the cell. The model was able to capture features of the temperature evolution of the battery cell well and generate detailed information about the progression of thermal runaway. The model was exercised to simulate time-to-venting and time-to-thermal-runaway for various changes in cell design parameters such as: amount of free liquid electrolyte, external convection coefficient, and electrolyte evaporation rate after vent opening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy balance 3aevaporation rate 3agases 3aliquids 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amelting 3amodels 3atemperature 3avolatilization 0aLi-ion battery 0aSafety 0aThermal runaway 0aGas generation 0aVenting1 aLi, Weisi1 aMukherjee, Partha P.1 aCrompton, K.R.1 aHacker, Christopher0 tApplied energy.g2020 June 15, v. 268 p.114972-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1149723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02909naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001900135245009100154300001500245520157600260592002801836650001401864650001501878650001401893650002301907650001201930650002301942650001701965650001201982650000901994650001202003700002102015700002702036700002202063700002102085700002302106773015202129856006902281856010502350990002302455852000902478655001202487IND60742921120221123000841.0210627e20210626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074292112DNAL7 a10.3791/619262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBedar, Meiwand10aMaximum isometric tetanic force measurement of the tibialis anterior muscle in the rat  ap. e61926.  aTraumatic nerve injuries result in substantial functional loss and segmental nerve defects often necessitate the use of autologous interposition nerve grafts. Due to their limited availability and associated donor side morbidity, many studies in the field of nerve regeneration focus on alternative techniques to bridge a segmental nerve gap. In order to investigate the outcomes of surgical or pharmacological experimental treatment options, the rat sciatic nerve model is often used as a bioassay. There are a variety of outcome measurements used in rat models to determine the extent of nerve regeneration. The maximum output force of the target muscle remains the most relevant outcome for clinical translation of experimental therapies. Isometric force measurement of tetanic muscle contraction has previously been described as a reproducible and valid technique for evaluating motor recovery after nerve injury or repair in both rat and rabbit models. In this video, we will provide a step-by-step instruction of this invaluable procedure for assessment of functional recovery of the tibialis anterior muscle in a rat sciatic nerve defect model using optimized parameters. We will describe the necessary pre-surgical preparations in addition to the surgical approach and dissection of the common peroneal nerve and tibialis anterior muscle tendon. The isometric tetanic force measurement technique will be detailed. Determining the optimal muscle length and stimulus pulse frequency is explained and measuring the maximum tetanic muscle contraction is demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3adissection 3amorbidity 3amuscle contraction 3amuscles 3anerve regeneration 3anerve tissue 3arabbits 3arats 3asurgery1 aSaffari, Tiam M.1 aFriedrich, Patricia F.1 aGiusti, Guilherme1 aBishop, Allen T.1 aShin, Alexander Y.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 June 26, , no. 172 p.e61926-e61926dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/619263Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61926/maximum-isometric-tetanic-force-measurement-tibialis-anterior-muscle  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03647naa a2200481 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002000167245006300187300001600250500000900266520227700275592002802552650001602580650001502596650001602611650001202627650002102639650001402660650001002674650002102684650001602705650001502721650001702736650001302753650001902766650001602785650001102801650001302812650001202825650001302837650001902850650001602869700002102885700001802906773012302924852000903047856009703056655001203153991605313650742620221120185952.0191122e197809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891643162DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1978.00021962007000050015x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoggess, Sam F.10aDifferential Response of Soybean Varieties to Soil Cadmium  ap. 756-760.  aepub  aOf the trace elements being redistributed by our presentday society, Cd presents probably the greatest potential as a toxic agent in applications to soils. Numerous studies have indicated that various plant species accumulate differing toxic amounts of Cd, and that the toxic symptoms are exhibited differently. Studies to assess the possibility that different varieties of one plant species may exhibit a range of Cd uptake and/or susceptibility have not been conducted in a comprehensive manner. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive survey of the Cd uptake and effect by a number of the prominent soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] varieties grown on several CdCI₂ or sewage sludge-amended soils in the glasshouse. In all varieties, Cd toxicity symptoms appeared as a continuum from slight effects observed as a red, red-brown, or purple coloration at the junction of the leaf blade and petiole, to severe leaf curling and extensive reddening of the leaf veins, chlorosis, and finally a brittle condition followed by abscission of the leaves. All varieties showed increased shoot Cd concentration and decreased dry weight in response to soil CdCl₂, but varietal differences in the severity of these Cd effects were observed. To quantify these differences in plant response to soil CdCI₂, indices based on the severity of visual symptoms, dry weight reduction, and shoot Cd concentration were used to rank the varieties according to Cd susceptibility. As all three rankings were significantly correlated, a composite susceptibility index based on all three criteria could be used to describe the response of each variety to Cd. Susceptibility index rankings of varieties grown on three different CdCl₂-amended soils were found to correlate with each other and with relative Cd concentrations of varieties grown on sewage sludge-amended soil. Soybean maturity groupings were not correlated with visual symptoms, dry weight reduction, or shoot Cd concentration. The data suggest that of the soybean varieties tested for Cd susceptibility on CdCl₂-amended soils that Dunfield, Harosoy, Arksoy, Dare, Flambeau, and Scioto were generally the most susceptible while Clark, Mandarin, Mukden, Jackson, and Lee were consistently ranked as less susceptible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aabscission 3abrittleness 3acadmium 3acadmium chloride 3achlorosis 3acolor 3agreenhouse soils 3agreenhouses 3aleaf blade 3aleaf curling 3apetioles 3aplant response 3aplant veins 3asewage 3asoybeans 3asurveys 3atoxicity 3atrace elements 3aweight loss1 aWillavize, Susan1 aKoeppe, D.

The addition of phytase to pig and poultry diets can contribute to reducing P excretion; however, cascading effects of phytase on plant–soil systems remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed how three different diets containing various levels of exogenous phytase, i.e., (1) no-phytase, (2) phytase (250 FTU), and (3) superdose phytase (500 FTU) for pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and broilers (Gallus gallus domesticus) might affect P dynamics in two different plant–soil systems including comfrey (Symphytum × uplandicum) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne). We found that differences in phytase supplementation significantly influenced total P content (%) of broiler litter and also pig slurry (although not significantly) as a result of dietary P content. P Use Efficiency (PUE) of comfrey and ryegrass plants was significantly higher under the intermediate ‘phytase’ dose (i.e., commercial dose of 250 FTU) when compared to ‘no-phytase’ and ‘superdose phytase’ associated with pig slurry additions. Soil P availability (i.e., water soluble P, WSP) in both comfrey and ryegrass mesocosms significantly decreased under the intermediate ‘phytase’ treatment following pig slurry additions. Dietary P content effects on P losses from soils (i.e., P leaching) were variable and driven by the type of organic amendment. Our study shows how commercial phytase levels together with higher dietary P contents in pig diets contributed to increase PUE and decrease WSP thus making the plant–soil system more P conservative (i.e., lower risks of P losses). Our evidence is that dietary effects on plant–soil P dynamics are driven by the availability of P forms (for plant uptake) in animal excretes and the type of organic amendment (pig vs. broiler) rather than plant species identity (comfrey vs. ryegrass).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium perenne 3aSymphytum 3aagronomy 3acomfrey 3aexcretion 3alivestock production 3aphosphorus 3aphytases 3apig manure 3apoultry manure 3asoil 3asoluble phosphorus 3aswine1 aBall, Elizabeth M.

The tribal classification is revised; two new tribes are proposed, i.e., Lytopylini and Agathirsini. Mesocoelini n. stat., is included as a tribe of Agathidinae for the first time. The concepts of Earinini and Agathidinini are revised. Biroia Szépligeti, 1900, is synonymized with Megalagathis Schulz, 1906 (emendation for Megagathis Krechbaumer 1894). A new genus and species from Colombia, Smithagathis davidsmithi Sharkey are erected. The currently recognized 61 genera of Agathidinae are presented in a list which includes their tribal placement. Biroia Szépligeti, 1900, and its junior synonym Isoptronotum Enderlein, 1920 are synonymized with Megalagathis Schulz, 1906, new synonymies. The species of Biroia are moved to Megalagathis as new combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBraconidae 3amitochondrial genes 3anew combination 3anew genus 3aphylogeny 3aColombia 0aIchneumonoidea 0asystematics 0ataxonomy 0anew tribe1 aChapman, Eric G.0 tProceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington.g2017 Dec., v. 119 p.823-842dThe Entomological Society of WashingtonwJournal:jnl43298x0013-87977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797.119.SpecialIssue.8233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04060naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012100169520211700290592002802407650002102435650002602456650002502482650001002507650001602517650002502533650002602558650002302584650000902607650004902616650001802665650002002683650004302703650005202746650001402798650001702812650002602829650003002855653002402885653000902909653000902918653000902927653000902936700001802945700002002963700001702983700001703000700001803017700002003035700001803055700001803073700002203091700001903113700002103132700001903153700002003172700002103192773010603213856008203319852000903401655001203410IND60706885320221120220226.0200913e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070688532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gep.2020.1191302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAryal, Yam Prasad10aStage-specific expression patterns of ER stress-related molecules in mice molars: Implications for tooth development  aThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a site where protein folding and posttranslational modifications occur, but when unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER lumen, an unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs. A UPR activates ER-stress signalling genes, including inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (Ire1), activating transcription factor 6 (Atf6), and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (Perk), to maintain homeostasis. The involvement of ER stress molecules in metabolic disease and hard tissue matrix formation has been established; however, an understanding of the role of ER-stress signalling molecules in tooth development is lacking. The aims of this study are to define the stage-specific expression patterns of ER stress-related molecules and to elucidate their putative functions in the organogenesis of teeth. This study leverages knowledge of the tissue morphology and expression patterns of a range of signalling molecules during tooth development. RT-qPCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to determine the stage-specific expression patterns of ER-stress-related signalling molecules at important stages of tooth development. RT-qPCR analyses showed that Atf6 and Perk have similar expression levels during all stages of tooth development; however, the expression levels of Ire1 and its downstream target X-box binding protein (Xbp1) increased significantly from the cap to the secretory stage of tooth development. In situ hybridization results revealed that Atf6 and Xbp1 were expressed in cells that form the enamel knot at cap stage and ameloblasts and odontoblasts at secretory stage in stage-specific patterns. In addition, Atf6, Ire1, and Xbp1 expression exhibited distinct localization patterns in secretory odontoblasts and ameloblasts of PN0 molars. Overall, our results strongly suggest that ER-stress molecules are involved in tooth development in response to protein overload that occurs during signaling modulations from enamel knots at cap stage and extracellular matrix secretion at secretory stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aextracellular matrix 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain situ hybridization 3ametabolic diseases 3amice 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3aorganogenesis 3aprotein folding 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3atooth enamel 3atranscription factors 3aunfolded protein response 0aTooth morphogenesis 0aAtf6 0aIre1 0aPerk 0aXbp11 aLee, Eui-Seon1 aKim, Tae-yŏng,1 aSung, Shijin1 aKim, Ji-Youn1 aAn, Seo-Young1 aJung, Jae-Kwang1 aHa, Jung-Hong1 aSuh, Jo-Young1 aYamamoto, Hitoshi1 aSohn, Wern-Joo1 aCho, Sŭng-wŏn,1 aLee, Youngkyun1 aAn, Chang-Hyeon1 aKim, Chae-yŏng,0 tGene expression patterns.g2020 Sept., v. 37 p.119130-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12408x1567-133X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gep.2020.1191303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245016600170520103900336592002801375650002601403650001501429650001801444650002801462650002501490650001201515650001501527650001601542650001401558650001401572650001401586650002301600650001401623650000901637650001901646650001801665653003001683653001501713653000901728653001401737700002201751700002801773700002401801773011201825856008201937852000902019655001202028IND60683096320221119180258.0200228e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068309632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2020.1038312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashem, Mohamed A.14aThe antitumor activity of Arthrospira platensis and/or cisplatin in a murine model of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma with hematinic and hepato-renal protective action  aHerein two experiments were conducted.

The second experiment assessed the outcomes of SP and/or CDDP administration on renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function in normal mice. The results showed that the EAC evoked a significant decrease in the mice survival rate, life span percentage, antioxidant defense system, and Caspase-3 immunoexpression but a significant increase in the viable cancer cells count, tumor and lipid peroxidation biomarkers concentrations, and Ki-67 immunoexpression. The EAC induced alterations improved to various degrees following SP and/or CDDP administration. SP minimized the oxidative hepatic and renal DNA-damaging and hematotoxic effect of CDDP. Overall, SP has a potent anticancer activity and could be used effectively as a hematinic and hepato-renal protective agent with anticancer drugs like CDDP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArthrospira platensis 3aDNA damage 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aascites 3abiomarkers 3abone marrow 3acarcinoma 3acaspase-3 3acisplatin 3alipid peroxidation 3alongevity 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3asurvival rate 0aEhrlich ascites carcinoma 0aPeritoneum 0aKi67 0aCaspase 31 aShoeeb, Sara B.A.1 aAbd-Elhakim, Yasmina M.1 aMohamed, Wafaa A.M.0 tJournal of functional foods.g2020 Mar., v. 66 p.103831-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2020.1038313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03660naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001900135245008400154300001500238520223400253592002802487650001502515650001602530650001402546650002402560650002002584650002102604650001302625650001102638650002002649650001902669650001102688650001102699650001602710650001702726650002002743650001402763700001902777700002002796700002102816773015102837856006902988856010103057990002303158852000903181655001203190IND60742921220221122224820.0210627e20210521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074292122DNAL7 a10.3791/621932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrey, Dario L.10aMonitoring neutrophil elastase and cathepsin g activity in human sputum samples  ap. e62193.  aProteases are regulators of countless physiological processes and the precise investigation of their activities remains an intriguing biomedical challenge. Among the ~600 proteases encoded by the human genome, neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) are thoroughly investigated for their involvement in the onset and progression of inflammatory conditions including respiratory diseases. Uniquely, secreted NSPs not only diffuse within extracellular fluids but also localize to plasma membranes. During neutrophil extracellular trap (NETs) formation, NSPs become an integral part of the secreted chromatin. Such complex behavior renders the understanding of NSPs pathophysiology a challenging task. Here, detailed protocols are shown to visualize, quantify and discriminate free and membrane-bound neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CG) activities in sputum samples. NE and CG are NSPs whose activities have pleiotropic roles in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): they promote tissue remodeling, regulate downstream immune responses and correlate with lung disease severity. The protocols show how to separate fluid and cellular fraction, as well as the isolation of neutrophils from human sputum for enzymatic activity quantification via small-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer-based (FRET) reporters. To gather specific insights into the relative role of NE and CG activities, a FRET readout can be measured by different technologies: i) in vitro plate reader measurements allow for high-throughput and bulk detection of protease activity; ii) confocal microscopy spatiotemporally resolves membrane-bound activity at the cell surface; iii) small-molecule FRET flow cytometry enables for the rapid evaluation of anti-inflammatory treatments via single-cell protease activity quantification and phenotyping. The implementation of such methods opens the doors to explore NSPs pathobiology and their potential as biomarkers of disease severity for CF and COPD. Given their standardization potential, their robust readout and simplicity of transfer, the described techniques are immediately shareable for implementation across research and diagnostic laboratories.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3acathepsin G 3achromatin 3aconfocal microscopy 3acystic fibrosis 3adisease severity 3aelastase 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3aflow cytometry 3agenome 3ahumans 3aneutrophils 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3aphenotype1 aGuerra, Matteo1 aMall, Marcus A.1 aSchultz, Carsten0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2021 May 21, , no. 171 p.e62193-e62193dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/621933Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/62193/monitoring-neutrophil-elastase-cathepsin-g-activity-human-sputum  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02419naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100002100167245010700188300001600295500000900311520150800320592002801828650001201856650001201868651001101880700002101891773012301912852000902035856009702044655001202141991605333300742620221122235654.0191122e197809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891643292DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1978.00021962007000050028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Anthony E.10aAnalysis of Fallow-Farming Systems in Semi-Arid Africa Using a Model to Simulate the Hydrologic Budget  ap. 816-823.  aepub  aA model was developed to predict bare soil evaporation, crop water use, and the distribution of water in the soil. Comparisons with hydrologic budget data obtained in the field with bare soil, cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata (I.,) Walp.), and millet (Pennisetum typhoides (Burm. f.) S. and W.) indicated that the models performed adequately for the conditions and objectives of the study. Simulations of annual fallow, predicted that the amounts of water conserved in the soil would rapidly decrease with decreases in annual rainfall. Simulations of partial year fallow, achieved by weed removal after harvest of 90-day or 75-day millets were evaluated through an 8- year period of wet, dry, wet, and dry years having an average, monomodal rainfall of 502 mm. The simulations predicted that substantial quantities of water may be conserved in the soil by partial fallow during wetter years. More soil moisture would be conserved with the shorter cycle variety, but the longer cycle variety would have greater meed for this moisture in this climatic zone during dry years, indicating a possible advantage of rotations involving short cycle, and long cycle crops. Shorter cycle varieties and partial fallow could also increase ground water recharge. The simulations predicted that present varieties may only use a small proportion of the moisture that may be stored below 150 cm depth in the soil by partial fallow, indicating a possible need for developing varieties with faster growing, deeper, root systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3amillets 3acowpeas 3aAfrica1 aDancette, Claude0 tAgronomy journal.g1978 Sept., v. 70, no. 5 p.816-823dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1978.00021962007000050028x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01766naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005400144245012200198300001600320520062500336592002800961650002400989650002601013650002801039650000901067650001001076650001601086650000901102650001301111650001101124653002001135653002101155653002401176773011601200856007901316852000901395655001201404IND60742921420221122224906.0210727e20210717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074292142DNAL7 a10.1556/066.2021.000012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaridi, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6980-356310aPhysiological characterisation of Calabrian dairy yeasts and their possible use as adjunct cultures for cheese making  ap. 341-348.  aSeventeen samples of Calabrian ewe’s milk, ewe’s cheese (Pecorino del Poro) made with raw milk, goat’s milk, and goat’s cheese (Caprino d’Aspromonte) made with raw milk were used to obtain 124 yeast isolates.

To tackle these issues, the specific urban water management strategy known as Sponge City has been implemented in China since 2013. This is a complex method and one involving many challenges. This paper critically assesses the approaches associated with conventional urban water management. The Sponge City concept and its adoption are then scrutinized to comprehensively assess the limitations and opportunities. It emerges that Sponge City has four main principles, these being: urban water resourcing, ecological water management, green infrastructures, and urban permeable pavement. The uncertainties in Sponge City design and planning, and financial insufficiencies are the most serious problems that can risk the failure of the Sponge City concept. While significant barriers exist, the opportunities for implementing a Sponge City are evident. To obtain multi-ecosystem services of Sponge City, it should be implemented at the watershed scales and be flexible, depending on different decision levels or catchment characteristics. It is essential to apply an intelligent decision-making mechanism and consider the need for close cooperation between various agencies with which the central government can work. A suitable sized and harmonious Sponge City, ensuring a good balance between socio-economic development and environmental conservation, is the ideal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3agreen infrastructure 3aissues and policy 3anatural resources conservation 3apavements 3arisk 3asocioeconomic development 3auncertainty 3aurban planning 3aurbanization 3awater management 3awater pollution 3awater shortages 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aSponge City 0aUrban water management 0aBarriers 0aGreen infrastructures 0aSocio-economic development 0aEnvironmental conservation1 aNgo, Huu Hao1 aGuo, Wenshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5542-28581 aWang, Xiaochang C.1 aRen, Nanqi1 aLi, Guibai1 aDing, Jie1 aLiang, Heng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9100-60070 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Feb. 20, v. 652 p.147-162dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006700150245014700217300001400364520131900378592002801697650002901725650001801754650001701772650002001789650001601809650001301825650001101838653001501849653002601864653001801890653002501908653002301933653002401956700002401980700002402004700002302028700002502051773008402076856008402160852000902244655001202253IND60603640220221120051043.0180716e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060364022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraimakis, Konstantinos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9489-832210aLow grade waste heat recovery with subcritical and supercritical Organic Rankine Cycle based on natural refrigerants and their binary mixtures  ap. 80-92.  aThe Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) is a promising technology for low temperature waste heat-to-power conversion. This work investigates the waste heat recovery potential of the ORC and some of its innovative variations, such as the supercritical cycle and the use of binary zeotropic mixtures. Focus is given to natural hydrocarbons having low ozone depletion and global warming potential. By performing simulations for heat source temperatures ranging from 150 to 300 °C, the optimal operation mode and working fluids are identified. Meanwhile, several technical parameters (such as the turbine size parameter and rotational speed) are calculated. The system exergetic efficiency is affected by the critical temperature of the working fluids and in the case of mixtures by their temperature glide in the condenser. The maximum efficiency ranges from 15 to 40% for heat source temperatures between 150 and 300 °C, respectively. For temperatures above 170 °C, the optimal fluids are mixtures combined with supercritical operation. Compared to the subcritical ORC with R245fa, the achievable efficiency improvement ranges between 10 and 45%. Although smaller turbines can be used due to the lower size parameter values of supercritical mixtures, R245fa has lower volume flow ratio, rotational speed and UA values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglobal warming potential 3aheat recovery 3ahydrocarbons 3aozone depletion 3atemperature 3aturbines 3awastes 0aWaste heat 0aOrganic Rankine Cycle 0aSupercritical 0aNatural refrigerants 0aZeotropic mixtures 0aEfficiency increase1 aPreißinger, Markus1 aBrüggemann, Dieter1 aKarellas, Sotirios1 aPanopoulos, Kyriakos0 tEnergy.g2015 Aug., v. 88 p.80-92dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013600155300002000291520135700311592002801668650000801696650001701704650001301721650001201734650002101746650001201767650000901779650001601788700001101804700001801815700001801833700001901851773012701870856007501997852000902072655001202081IND60535742020221116174602.0160805e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053574202DNAL7 a10.1021/es503161v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guorui10aIdentifying Iron Foundries as a New Source of Unintentional Polychlorinated Naphthalenes and Characterizing Their Emission Profiles  ap. 13165-13172.  aIron foundries have been identified as dioxin sources in previous field investigations. Similar formation mechanisms between dioxins and unintentional polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) have led us to speculate that iron foundries are also potential PCN sources. In this study, PCNs in stack gas and fly ash samples representing atmospheric and residue emissions from 13 typical iron foundry plants were analyzed. The average emission factor of ∑₂–₈PCNs to residue was calculated to be 61 μg t–¹, with a range of 10–107 μg t–¹. The emission factors of ∑₂–₈PCNs to air in two case plants were 267 and 1472 μg t–¹. The derived emission factors might be useful for estimating annual emissions and understanding the contribution of PCNs from iron foundries. The possible formation mechanisms of PCNs, based on the PCN profiles, are discussed. Successive reductions in the abundance of homologues were observed to occur with the increase in chlorine substituted numbers. Abundances of congeners containing more β-position chlorines in the naphthalene skeleton were much higher than those of congeners containing more α-position chlorines for penta-, hexa-, and hepta- homologues, which suggests that the β-positions are favored for chlorination. Potential chlorination pathways from tetra- to octa- homologues are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3achlorination 3achlorine 3adioxins 3aemissions factor 3afly ash 3airon 3anaphthalene1 aLv, Pu1 aJiang, Xiaoxu1 aNie, Zhiqiang1 aZheng, Minghui0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 48, no. 22 p.13165-13172dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes503161v3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001800162245013900180300001600319520131600335592002801651650002401679650001601703650001701719650001501736650001201751650001501763650001401778650001101792700002401803700002301827700002201850773009601872856007701968852000902045655001202054IND50073509620221122195231.0170718e200112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007350962DNAL7 a245776982pmid7 a10.1007/s0044201007652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngel, Volker10aInteractions between extrafloral nectaries, aphids and ants: are there competition effects between plant and homopteran sugar sources?  ap. 577-584.  aBroad bean (Vicia faba), an annual plant bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFN) at the base of the upper leaves, is regularly infested by two aphid species, Aphis fabae and Acyrthosiphon pisum. EFN and A. fabae are commonly attended by the ant, Lasius niger, while Ac. pisum usually remains uninfested. Sugar concentration and sugar composition of extrafloral nectar did not change significantly after aphid infestation. The sugar concentration was significantly higher in EFN (c. 271 µg µl–¹) than in the honeydew of A. fabae (37.5 µg µl–¹). The presence of small A. fabae colonies had no significant effect on ant attendance of EFN, which remained at the same level as that on plants without A. fabae. Obviously, there was no significant competitive effect between the two sugar sources. We suggest that the high sugar concentration in the extrafloral nectar may outweigh the higher quality (due to the presence of melezitose) and quantity of aphid honeydew. Ants and the presence of EFN influenced aphid colony growth. While A. fabae colonies generally grew better in the presence of ants, Ac. pisum colonies declined on plants with EFN or A. fabae colonies. We conclude that EFN may provide some degree of protection for V. faba against those sucking herbivores that are not able to attract ants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aAphis fabae 3aLasius niger 3aVicia faba 3aannuals 3afaba beans 3anectaries 3asugars1 aFischer, Melanie K.1 aWäckers, Felix L.1 aVölkl, Wolfgang,0 tOecologia.g2001 Dec., v. 129, no. 4 p.577-584dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0044201007653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01658naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001600167245010000183300001600283500000900299520080700308592002801115650001301143700001901156773012301175852000901298856009701307655001201404991605313530742620221120190109.0191122e197809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891643452DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1978.00021962007000050044x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWallace, A.10aComplete Neutralization of a Portion of Calcareous Soil as a Means of Preventing Iron Chlorosis  ap. 888-890.  aepub  aSoybeans (Glycine max L.

The objective was to determine if complete neutralization of only a small part of the mass of a calcareous soil could effectively prevent Fe chlorosis. Small acidified spots of soil, equivalent to as little as 0.4% of the CaCO₃ in the 1,000 g of the soil used in each pot, placed 3 cm deep under seedlings, was sufficient to prevent the Fe chlorosis. These glasshouse results suggest that comparable procedures be tried for field experimentation with row crops which are susceptible to Fe chlorosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoybeans1 aMueller, R.

In this field study, we investigated the effects of acetochlor on the photosynthetic characteristics, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and antioxidant enzyme activities in acetochlor-resistant (BWC95) and acetochlor-sensitive (BWC12) near-isogenic lines. We sprayed acetochlor after sowing, using water treatment as the control. After spraying acetochlor, the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and the function of chloroplasts were significantly lower in BWC12 than BWC95, whereas the intercellular CO₂ concentrations and stomatal limitation values were higher. In addition to nonphotochemical quenching, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements obtained using leaves showed that the maximum photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PSII), actual photochemical efficiency of PSII, photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, and electron transport rate were higher in BWC95 than BWC12 after acetochlor treatment. H₂O₂ and O₂˙⁻ levels were higher in BWC12 than BWC95, which resulted in severe membrane lipid peroxidation due to sustained oxidative stress. Thus, the malondialdehyde content increased significantly with the exposure time in BWC12, and the antioxidant enzyme activities were lower in BWC12 than BWC95. The results show that acetochlor resistance is directly related to a high photosynthetic rate and a protective antioxidant enzyme system.  aPublisher supplied data  a31901460cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aZea mays 3aacetochlor 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3aelectron transfer 3aexposure duration 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aphotochemistry 3aphotosystem II 3apollution 3aresearch 3astomatal conductance 3awater treatment 3awaxy corn1 aZhong, Xuemei1 aYao, Yuhan1 aShi, Zhensheng1 aLi, Fenghai1 aWang, Hongwei1 aLv, Xiangling1 aDu, Wanli1 aZhu, Min1 aYang, Hu1 aMeng, Dexuan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Apr., v. 28, no. 15 p.19298-19309dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12043-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014600155300001800301520094900319592002801268650002401296650001801320650001501338650002201353650001101375650002501386650001701411650001701428650002101445650002101466650001201487650001901499650001401518650001901532650002001551650001601571650001601587650002601603650002101629700001501650700001601665700001801681773014101699856007401840852000901914655001201923IND60671041620221116143148.0191002e20150304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067104162DNAL7 a10.1039/c4tb02130d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Tong10aTransferrin-directed preparation of red-emitting copper nanoclusters for targeted imaging of transferrin receptor over-expressed cancer cells  ap. 2388-2394.  aTransferrin (Trf)-functionalized copper nanoclusters (Trf-Cu NCs) were fabricated as a novel red-emitting fluorescent probe for the targeted bioimaging of cancer cells. A one-pot approach was developed to prepare stable, water-soluble and red-emitting Trf-Cu NCs at room temperature via a biomineralization process with Trf as the template and ascorbic acid as a green reducing agent. Trf acted not only as a stabilizer and reducer, but also as a functional ligand for targeting the transferrin receptor. The as-prepared Trf-Cu NCs showed an intense red fluorescence with a red emission peak at 670 nm (quantum yield about 6.2%), suggesting that the probe could potentially be used for bioimaging in vivo. The developed Trf-Cu NCs had excellent photostability and water solubility and exhibited a high specificity to transferrin receptor with negligible cytotoxicity. The probe was successfully applied to the targeted bioimaging of HeLa cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aascorbic acid 3abioimaging 3abiomineralization 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3ahuman cell lines 3aligands 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aphotostability 3areducing agents 3astabilizers 3atransferrin 3atransferrin receptors 3awater solubility1 aHe, Xi-Wen1 aLi, Wen-You1 aZhang, Yu-Kui0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2015 Mar. 4, v. 3, no. 11 p.2388-2394dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4tb02130d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002100167245013500188300001600323520073700339592002801076650002001104650001401124650002901138650001101167650004401178650002601222650001201248650007801260650009601338650003401434650002101468650007201489650001101561650001501572650001501587650001101602650002501613650002401638650002801662650001701690650006201707650001701769650004501786650007201831650003601903700001901939700002001958700002201978700002202000773008402022856008402106852000902190655001202199IND4477056620221119222414.0141111e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447705662DNAL7 a209335872pmid7 a10.1016/j.fitote.2010.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoujir, Laila M.12aA new natural spiro heterocyclic compound and the cytotoxic activity of the secondary metabolites from Juniperus brevifolia leaves  ap. 225-229.  aA new natural spiro compound 3,4-dehydrotheaspirone and the known arctiol [1β,6α-dihydroxy-4(14)-eudesmene] were isolated from Juniperus brevifolia.

However, information concerning the response of rhizosphere microorganisms in seagrass sediment in the presence of different nitrogen sources is lacking. Here, by means of high-throughput sequencing, we investigated how addition of inorganic nitrogen affects the rhizosphere microbiome of the tropical seagrass Thalassia hemperichii. A seagrass culture system was set up to conduct a nitrogen addition (ammonium and nitrate) simulation experiment. We found that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was increased in inorganic nitrogen-enriched samples, whereas that of Acidobacteria decreased under ammonium enrichment, especially after 35 days. High levels of inorganic nitrogen addition caused a significant decrease in the relative abundance of Desulfobacteraceae, Sulfurovaceae, and Spirochaetes, which are primarily involved in sulfur cycling. Additionally, the abundance of microbes in the seagrass rhizosphere reached the highest after the ammonium-enrichment treatment. Among the analyzed seagrass photosynthetic characteristics, seagrass leaves presented the highest light utility in treatments receiving nitrate, followed by the control groups and ammonium-enrichment groups. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional analysis suggested that some functions related to metabolism of amino acids and signal transduction were enriched in samples receiving high ammonium, whereas nitrate addition enriched predicted functions related to diseases. These findings provide new insights into the response of microbial communities to different types of nitrogen additions in seagrass ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  aXDA13020300cStrategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41676163, 41406191, 41676107 and 41976147cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a201806010017cPearl River S&T Nova Program of Guangzhou  aGML2019ZD0402cKey Special Project for Introduced Talents Team of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou)  a2018YFC1406505, 2017YFC0506301 and 2018FY100105cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aISEE2018ZD02cInnovation Academy of South China Sea Ecology and Environmental Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2015A020216016cthe Guangdong Province Public Welfare Research and Capacity Building Project  a2017B030314052cthe Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China 3aAcidobacteria 3aBacteroidetes 3aDesulfobacteraceae 3aSpirochaetes 3aThalassia 3aammonium 3amicrobiome 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3apollution 3aresearch 3arhizosphere 3aseagrasses 3asediments 3asignal transduction 3asulfur1 aDong, Junde1 aDing, Dewen1 aLong, Lijuan1 aSuo, Anning1 aLin, Xiancheng1 aYang, Qingsong1 aLin, Liyun1 aZhang, Yanying1 aLing, Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6700-71650 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Apr., v. 28, no. 15 p.19021-19033dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12048-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03336naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100006100137245012700198300001600325520207100341592002802412650001402440650001302454650001502467650002302482650003002505650001202535650001202547650002002559650001602579650001402595650001202609650002402621651002002645700002002665700002302685700002202708773011502730856007202845852000902917655001202926IND60742921820221122180010.0210627s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074292182DNAL7 a10.1071/IS200442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfeiffer, John M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5368-058910aTaxonomic revision of a radiation of South-east Asian freshwater mussels (Unionidae:Gonideinae:Contradentini+Rectidentini)  ap. 394-470.  aThe tribes Contradentini and Rectidentini (Unionidae) comprise a diverse clade of freshwater mussels endemic to South-east Asia. Our understanding of the diversity and phylogeny of this radiation has improved dramatically in recent years, but this systematic transformation has not yet benefited from comprehensive museum sampling or phylogenomic methods. A synthetic taxonomic revision of the Contradentini+Rectidentini that leverages these useful and accessible methods is needed. We set out to (1) generate a phylogenomic reconstruction of the supraspecific relationships of the Contradentini+Rectidentini using anchored hybrid enrichment, (2) revise the taxonomy and geographic boundaries of the generic and species-level diversity of the radiation, and (3) identify patterns of freshwater mussel diversity and distribution in this clade and discuss the processes that may have precipitated them. Our phylogenomic reconstruction using over 1600 loci, with a total alignment length of over a half a million nucleotides, recovers a well supported phylogeny of the clade that resolves four independent multispecies radiations endemic to the Mekong drainage. We examined, digitised, and imaged 1837 records from 15 natural history museums that provided the necessary data to document the morphological variation and geographic distributions of the focal taxa. We also analysed 860 COI sequences, 519 of which were generated in this study, to better understand the species boundaries and geographic distributions of the recovered clades. We recognise 54 valid species in the tribes Contradentini and Rectidentini, including 9 described herein as new to science. Out of this revision emerged several interesting biogeographic patterns that appear to have resulted from recent stream capture, historical confluence, and intradrainage barriers to dispersal. We hypothesise that these phenomena shaped the diversity and distribution of the Contradentini+Rectidentini, contributing to the formation of several characteristic freshwater mussel provinces in South-east Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnionidae 3adrainage 3afreshwater 3afreshwater mussels 3ageographical distribution 3ahybrids 3amuseums 3anatural history 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3astreams 3ataxonomic revisions 3aSouth East Asia1 aGraf, Daniel L.1 aCummings, Kevin S.1 aPage, Lawrence M.0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2021, v. 35, no. 4 p.394-470dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl3957319x1445-52267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS200443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245017400170520166000344592002802004650002002032650001702052650001902069650001302088650001602101650001102117650002602128650002902154650002002183650002402203650002102227650002102248650001802269650002902287653001302316653001902329653001402348653002702362700001902389700002102408700002402429700002202453773011102475856008602586852000902672655001202681IND60706885920221120220319.0200913e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070688592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.1222782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yan-Hong10aDevelopment of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) method for characterizing caffeine, methylliberine, and theacrine pharmacokinetics in humans  aCoffea liberica possesses stimulant properties without accumulating the methylxanthine caffeine. The basis for this peculiar observation is that methylurates (e.g., theacrine and methylliberine) have replaced caffeine. The stimulant properties of methylurates, alone and in combination with caffeine, have recently been investigated. However, human pharmacokinetics and LC-MS/MS methods for simultaneous measurement of methylxanthines and methylurates are lacking. To address this deficiency, we conducted a pharmacokinetic study in which subjects (n = 12) were orally administered caffeine (150 mg), methylliberine (Dynamine™, 100 mg), and theacrine (TeaCrine®, 50 mg) followed by blood sampling over 24 h. Liquid-liquid extraction of plasma samples containing purine alkaloids and internal standard (¹³C-Caffeine) were analyzed using a C18 reversed-phase column and gradient elution (acetonitrile and water, both containing 0.1% formic acid). A Waters Xevo TQ-S tandem mass spectrometer (positive mode) was used to detect caffeine, methylliberine, theacrine, and IS transitions of m/z 195.11 → 138.01, 225.12 → 168.02, 225.12 → 167.95, and 198.1 → 140.07, respectively. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, selectivity, and linearity and was successfully applied to characterize the oral pharmacokinetics of caffeine, methylliberine, and theacrine in human plasma. Successful development and application of LC-MS/MS-based methods such as ours for the simultaneous measurement of methylxanthines and methylurates are essential for the characterization of potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoffea liberica 3aacetonitrile 3ablood sampling 3acaffeine 3aformic acid 3ahumans 3aliquid chromatography 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3amethylxanthines 3aoral administration 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3aspectrometers 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aLC-MS/MS 0aMethylliberine 0aTheacrine 0aHuman pharmacokinetics1 aMondal, Goutam1 aButawan, Matthew1 aBloomer, Richard J.1 aYates, Charles R.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 1155 p.122278-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2020.1222783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013400209300002000343500001900363520157700382592002801959596017301987650001402160650001902174650001502193650002002208650002502228650001602253650001502269650002802284650001302312650001002325700001902335700001702354773015502371856008302526852000902609655001202618IND60733578520221122142826.0210809e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073357852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-020-12060-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Toshiaki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0746-672210aEstimating household exposure to pyrethroids and the relative contribution of inhalation pathway in a sample of Japanese children  ap. 19310-19324.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral synthetic pyrethroids are suspected to have carcinogenicity or reproductive toxicity. However, there is little knowledge about indoor air pollution in residences or the extent of intake by the residents of the newly developed pyrethroids, transfluthrin, profluthrin, and metofluthrin, although they have been widely used indoors as mosquito repellents and mothproof repellents in recent years. In the present study, the household exposure to pyrethroids through all exposure pathways and the contribution of inhalation pathway in Japanese children were examined by measuring urinary pyrethroid metabolites in the children and the airborne pyrethroids in their residences. Urine excreted first after waking up was collected from subjects aged 6 to 15 years (n = 132), and airborne pyrethroids were sampled in the subjects’ bedrooms for 24 h. Nineteen pyrethroids and their nine urinary metabolites were measured. Their daily intakes estimated were as follows (median, ng/kg b.w./d): bifenthrin, 56; transfluthrin, 22; metofluthrin, 11; profluthrin, 0.86. The contribution rates of the amounts absorbed by inhalation to the amounts absorbed via all of the exposure pathways while at home tended to decrease in the following order: profluthrin (median 15%) ≈ transfluthrin (14%) > metofluthrin (1%) > bifenthrin (0.1%). Transfluthrin was considered to be the most notable pyrethroid as an indoor air pollutant. Our study demonstrated widespread exposure to transfluthrin, metofluthrin, profluthrin, and bifenthrin in a sample of Japanese children.  aPublisher supplied data  a26460820cthe Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of the Japanese Government (MEXT)/Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI 3aCulicidae 3aair pollutants 3abifenthrin 3acarcinogenicity 3aindoor air pollution 3ametabolites 3apyrethrins 3areproductive toxicology 3aresearch 3aurine1 aMimura, Mayumi1 aSakon, Naomi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Apr., v. 28, no. 15 p.19310-19324dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-12060-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03668naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245016200209300001100371506007600382520194400458592002802402506003702430650000802467650002202475650002002497650001502517650001002532650002202542650002502564650003802589650001602627650002502643650001402668650003402682650004302716650001902759650001702778650001402795650001502809651001202824700002402836700001902860700002202879700002402901700002302925773008802948856008103036852000903117655001203126IND60548995620221207095251.0170816e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054899562DNAL7 a10.1186/s12985-016-0533-32doi7 aPMC48590582pmcid7 a271504692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlotu, Amadin A.10aOccult Hepatitis B virus infection in previously screened, blood donors in Ile-Ife, Nigeria: implications for blood transfusion and stem cell transplantation  ap. 76.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission through blood transfusion is reduced by screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). However this method cannot detect the presence of occult hepatitis B virus infection. This study sought to determine the prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection among blood donors in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. For the first time in Nigeria we employed an automated real-time PCR- method to investigate the prevalence of occult HBV in blood donors. METHODS: Blood donors screened with HBsAg immunochromatographic rapid test kits at the blood transfusion units of two hospitals and found to be negative were recruited into the study. Questionnaires to elicit risk factors for HBV infection were administered and then 10 ml of blood was collected from each donor. Plasma samples obtained from these HBsAg negative blood donors were screened again for HBsAg using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, and those found negative were screened for the presence of total antibody to the HBV core antigen (anti-HBc) using ELISA method. Those positive to anti-HBc were then tested for HBV DNA, using an automated real-time PCR method. RESULTS: Five hundred and seven blood donors found HBsAg negative by immunochromatographic rapid test kits at both blood transfusion units, were tested for HBsAg using ELISA and 5 (1 %) were HBsAg positive. The 502 found negative were tested for anti-HBc and 354 (70.5 %) were found positive implying previous exposure to HBV and 19 (5.4 %) of the 354 anti-HBc positive had HBV DNA signifying occult HBV infection. No risk factors were found to be associated with the presence of HBV DNA among those who tested positive. CONCLUSION: Occult HBV infection exists in blood donors in Ile-Ife, Nigeria and the use of HBsAg alone for screening prospective donors will not eliminate the risk of HBV transmission in blood transfusion or stem cell transplantation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aHepatitis B virus 3aanalytical kits 3aantibodies 3ablood 3ablood transfusion 3acell transplantation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahepatitis B 3ahepatitis B antigens 3ahospitals 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aquestionnaires 3arisk factors 3ascreening 3astem cells 3aNigeria1 aOyelese, Adesola O.1 aSalawu, Lateef1 aAudu, Rosemary A.1 aOkwuraiwe, Azuka P.1 aAboderin, Aaron O.0 tVirology journal.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.76-76dBioMed Centralx1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0533-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245008400187300001600271520086700287592002801154650002201182650001801204650001401222650001001236650001401246650001101260650001101271650001901282650001301301650001401314650001801328650003301346650001701379650001601396650002401412650001201436650002301448650002701471650003001498650001401528650001901542650002301561650003701584650001401621650001601635650001701651650002901668700003001697700002601727700003201753700002601785773008801811856008601899852000901985655001201994IND4466807820221120202557.0141110e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446680782DNAL7 a225950962pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.03.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObadiah, Asir10aBiodiesel production from Palm oil using calcined waste animal bone as catalyst  ap. 512-516.  aWaste animal bones was employed as a cost effective catalyst for the transesterification of palm oil. The catalyst was calcined at different temperatures to transform the calcium phosphate in the bones to hydroxyapatite and 800°C was found to give the best yield of biodiesel. The catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). Under the optimal reaction conditions of 20wt.% of catalyst, 1:18 oil to methanol molar ratio, 200rpm of stirring of reactants and at a temperature of 65°C, the methyl ester conversion was 96.78% and it was achieved in 4h. The catalyst performed equally well as the laboratory-grade CaO. Animal bone is therefore a useful raw material for the production of a cheap catalyst for transesterification.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanimal wastes 3abiodiesel 3abones 3acatalysts 3aenergy 3aesters 3ahydroxyapatite 3amethanol 3apalm oils 3araw materials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 3atransesterification 2aAnimals 2aBiofuelsxanalysis 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aBone and Bonesxchemistry 2aCatalysis 2aEsterification 2aMethanolxanalysis 2aPlant Oilsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aRecycling 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aWaste Productsxanalysis1 aSwaroopa, Gnanadurai Ajji1 aKumar, Samuel Vasanth1 aJeganathan, Kenthorai Raman1 aRamasubbu, Alagunambi0 tBioresource technology.g2012 July, v. 116 p.512-516dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.03.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01429naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245012100171300001600292520029400308592002800602650001400630650001300644650001500657650001600672650002800688650002300716653001300739653001400752653001400766653001700780653001800797773017200815856008300987852000901070655001201079IND60594978120221119185040.0180525e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059497812DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.120.1.1672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanborn, Allen F.10aTwo New Species and Revised Species Status for Two Species of Ueana Distant, 1905 (Hemiptera: Cicadoidea: Cicadidae)  ap. 167-179.  aTwo new cicadas, Ueana cambiangulata Sanborn, new species and Ueana mesogramma Sanborn, new species, are described and illustrated.

Consequently, the aim of this study was to measure nocturnal stem sap flow of Acer truncatum and to determine its driving force in an urban green space. Stomatal aperture was measured using surface impression method in a typical clear day of August. Sap flux density was monitored by a thermal diffusive probe system from July to October. Meanwhile, wind speed (WS), relative humidity, air temperature, precipitation and total solar radiation were monitored by an automatic weather station. We found nocturnal stomatal aperture was about 32% of mid-morning, and nocturnal sap flux density was significantly and positively affected by WS and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) (P < 0.001), while nocturnal sap flow volume was significantly and positively related to diurnal sap flow volume (R² = 0.30, P < 0.001).The explanation of VPD and WS to nocturnal sap flux density was less than that of diurnal sap flow. The relationship between nocturnal sap flux density and VPD separated into two distinct models. When VPD≥0.10 kPa, nocturnal sap flux density was significantly and positively correlated with VPD (R² = 0.53, P < 0.001), while there was a significant negative correlation between sap flux density and VPD when VPD<0.10 kPa (R² = 0.18, P < 0.001). The variation of sap flux density showed different patterns in different weather conditions. During a clear night, sap flux density showed a decreasing trend with VPD and WS, while sap flux density only showed a similar trend to precipitation during rainfall. We suggest nocturnal sap flow of Acer truncatum is regulated by nocturnal transpiration and stem refilling, and stem refilling is the fundamental force while transpiration promotes sap flow, and the volume is restricted by soil moisture, stem storage water volume, and the water status of the previous day.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer truncatum 3aair temperature 3agreen infrastructure 3amodels 3arain 3arelative humidity 3asap flow 3asoil water 3asolar radiation 3astomatal movement 3atranspiration 3aurban areas 3avapor pressure deficit 3awind speed 0aNocturnal sap flow 0aNocturnal transpiration 0aNocturnal water use 0aStem refilling 0aNocturnal stomatal aperture 0aThermal dissipation probe 0aAcer truncatum1 aLiu, Haixuan1 aZhu, Jiyou1 aGong, Lan1 aXu, Lijuan1 aJin, Guixiang1 aLi, Jing1 aHauer, Richard1 aXu, Chengyang0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2020 Dec., v. 56 p.126800-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.1268003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003800150245006900188300001600257520131300273592002801586650001001614650001001624650001401634650001201648650001101660650001601671650002501687650001101712650001301723650001201736653002001748653002201768653002401790653001601814700003101830700006501861773008901926856008402015852000902099655001202108IND60603640620221123044037.0180716e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060364062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMady, Carlos Eduardo Keutenedjian12aA thermodynamic assessment of therapeutic hypothermia techniques  ap. 392-402.  aAccording to literature, therapeutic hypothermia has been applied for treating conditions that causes an interruption in the delivery of oxygen to the brain, giving the patient better chances of survival with a neurological recovery and without any irreversible damage to the brain. Hypothermia is also used during surgeries and circulatory arrest. In this article, the objective temperature of hypothermia is 32 °C, which is considered mild: 32–35 °C. Three techniques of hypothermia induction were considered: external blood cooling, endovascular cooling with a catheter insertion and water bath. Energy and exergy analyses were performed to determine the clinical effectiveness of these techniques and to evaluate the best test parameters, from which it was possible to calculate the body internal temperature, destroyed exergy and exergy efficiency. Moreover, it was proposed an exergy performance index, which takes into account the ability of a given technique to change the exergy of the body. Results indicate that therapeutic hypothermia takes the subject to a state of lower destroyed exergy and higher body exergy efficiency. The exergy performance index shows that lower rates of cooling lead to a better transformation of the exergy removed from the body into variation of the body exergy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3abrain 3acatheters 3acooling 3aexergy 3ahypothermia 3ainternal temperature 3aoxygen 3apatients 3asurgery 0aExergy analysis 0aExergy efficiency 0aHuman thermal model 0aHypothermia1 aHenriques, Izabela Batista1 aOliveira, Sílvio de,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2650-75340 tEnergy.g2015 June 01, v. 85 p.392-402dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01582naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015900170300001600329520033700345592002800682650002700710650003500737650002300772650001800795650001100813650000900824650001100833650001300844650001800857650001100875653002100886653001100907653001100918700002200929700002000951700002400971773011700995856005101112852000901163655001201172IND50075050720221120043605.0140410e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007505072DNAL7 a10.1080/09583157.2010.5451042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalog, Adalbert10aAnalysis of soil dwelling rove beetles (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) in cultivated maize fields containing the Bt toxins, Cry34/35Ab1 and Cry1F×Cry34/35Ab1  ap. 293-297.  aIn this study, the potential exposure of non-targeted adult rove beetles and their larvae to Bt toxins (Cry34Ab1, Cry35Ab1, Cry1F (59122 and 1507×59122) designed to target western corn rootworm and European corn borer has been determined.

In recent years, some newly publicized findings have opened a window of opportunity regarding the dietary tuning of colonization by specific groups of gut bacteria. For example, seaweed polysaccharides were shown to enrich specific Bacteroides spp., while galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) could specifically enrich certain strains of Bifidobacterium adolescentis. This review was written with the aim of collecting all available studies of the effects of prebiotics on gut microbiota that attempted to mine the enriching effects of these prebiotics on bacteria at the species or strain level, analyze the possible underlying mechanisms and finally use and/or design tailored prebiotics for the directional enrichment of specific gut bacterial populations.

In this work, the crystal structures and TE properties of polycrystalline materials with nominal compositions Mg₂Si₀.₃₅Sn₀.₆₅–ₓBiₓ (x = 0, 0.015, 0.030, and 0.045) and Mg₂SiySn₀.₉₇–yBi₀.₀₃ (y = 0.30, 0.325, and 0.35) have been investigated. The electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity are strongly affected by the presence of Bi. Undoped samples showed higher values of Seebeck coefficients (below 600 K), lower electrical conductivity, and lower thermal conductivity (above 600 K) in comparison to the Bi-doped samples. Furthermore, the signs of Seebeck coefficients are all negative, confirming that n-type conduction is dominant in these materials. Electrical conductivity was enhanced by increasing the Bi content up to 3% on the Si/Sn site because of the increasing amount of electron donors, and the absolute value of Seebeck coefficient decreased. When the Bi content is greater than 3%, lower zT values were obtained at 773 K. Thermal conductivity values might decrease with increasing Sn alloying for Mg₂SiySn₀.₉₇–yBi₀.₀₃, as mass and strain fluctuation caused by alloying can effectively scatter phonons. However, a different behavior was observed in higher Sn content material, possibly because of the absence of Mg atoms at the interstitial site [Mgᵢ, on (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)] and vacancies of Mg atoms at the (1/4, 1/4, 1/4) site, as confirmed by Rietveld refinements. Outstanding figure of merit values in excess of unity were achieved with all samples, culminating in zTₘₐₓ = 1.35.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth 3acrystal structure 3aelectrical conductivity 3amagnesium 3amaterials science 3asilicon 3athermal conductivity 3atin 0aenergy 0athermoelectric materials 0asolid solutions 0amagnesium 0asilicon 0atin 0abismuth1 aCheng, Xiaoyu1 aRamirez, Daniel1 aMori, Takao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2682-18461 aKleinke, Holger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6777-61400 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Nov. 02, v. 10, no. 47 p.40585-40591dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b151113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014500174300001800319520061400337592002800951650001200979650001800991650002101009650002601030650002101056650001301077650001701090650001201107653001701119653003101136653002501167653001401192653002201206653002601228700002301254700002201277700002501299700003001324773011601354856008601470852000901556655001201565IND60088028020221118013641.0190318e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008802802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrente, Federica10aNovel injectable and in situ cross-linkable hydrogels of dextran methacrylate and scleroglucan derivatives: Preparation and characterization  ap. 1033-1039.  aIn this paper mixtures of two biocompatible polymers, dextran methacrylate (DEX-MA) with different molecular weights and scleroglucan (Scl), in its native form and as carboxymethyl derivative (Scl-CM), were tested as injectable and in situ cross-linkable systems.

On the basis of an interface self-assembly approach, we synthesize mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon/Mo₂C/reduced graphene oxide nanohybrids (denoted as mNC-Mo₂C@rGO), which represent a new type of two-dimensional Mo₂C/carbon hybrid nanomaterials and possess a sandwichlike structure with well-defined mesopores. The method involves the co-self-assembly of spherical micelles formed from polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene oxide), pyrrole (Py) monomers, and molybdate ions (Mo₇O₂₄⁶–) on GO surfaces in aqueous solution, followed by polymerization of Py and calcination of the nanocomposites at 900 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The resultant mNC-Mo₂C@rGO nanosheets possess high N contents, large specific surface areas (SSAs), and 4 nm Mo₂C particles well-distributed in the mesoporous carbon matrix. The Mo₂C content is controllable in the range of 18.4–42.4 wt % by adjusting the feed amount of Mo₇O₂₄⁶–. In particular, mNC-Mo₂C@rGO with an SSA of 344 m²/g and a Mo₂C content of ca. 28 wt % exhibits the highest HER catalytic activity in 1 M KOH electrolyte, with a 95 mV overpotential at 10 mA/cm², a Tafel slope of 49.8 mV/dec, and a long-term stability of 60 h at 20 mA/cm². This study blazes a trail for the synthesis of new functional nanomaterials with potential applications as efficient HER electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrolysis 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen production 3aions 3amicelles 3amolybdates 3ananocomposites 3ananohybrids 3ananosheets 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apolymerization 3aporous media 3apotassium hydroxide 3apyrroles 0aself-assembly 0atwo-dimensional 0amesoporous 0amolybdenum carbide 0ahydrogen evolution reaction1 aZhu, Shuyan1 aTillman, Hoyt Cleveland,1 aWei, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5966-71741 aFeng, Xinliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3885-27031 aMai, Yiyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6373-25970 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Oct. 31, v. 10, no. 47 p.40800-40807dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b152503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245006500205300001600270520096000286592002801246650001601274650001501290650002001305650001401325650001601339650001401355650002101369650001001390650001301400650002501413650000901438650002901447653001901476653002801495653004301523653002001566700005501586700001501641700005601656700005601712773022701768856008201995852000902077655001202086IND60706886220221122051259.0210108e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070688622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgg.2020.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Weizhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0099-404410aDecoding the plant genome: From epigenome to 3D organization  ap. 425-435.  aThe linear genome of eukaryotes is partitioned into diverse chromatin states and packaged into a three-dimensional (3D) structure, which has functional implications in DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcriptional regulation. Over the past decades, research on plant functional genomics and epigenomics has made great progress, with thousands of genes cloned and molecular mechanisms of diverse biological processes elucidated. Recently, 3D genome research has gradually attracted great attention of many plant researchers. Herein, we briefly review the progress in genomic and epigenomic research in plants, with a focus on Arabidopsis and rice, and summarize the currently used technologies and advances in plant 3D genome organization studies. We also discuss the relationships between one-dimensional linear genome sequences, epigenomic states, and the 3D chromatin architecture. This review provides basis for future research on plant 3D genomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA repair 3aDNA replication 3achromatin 3aepigenetics 3aepigenome 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3agenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3arice 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPlant genomics 0aEpigenetic modification 0aChromatin three-dimensional structures 0aGenomic methods1 aCao, Zhilin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6557-29801 aXiong, Dan1 aLi, Guoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1601-66401 aLi, Xingwang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3985-25450 tJournal of genetics and genomics.g2020 Aug., v. 47, no. 8 p.425-435dElsevier LtdaInstitute of Genetics and Developmental Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Genetics Society of ChinawJournal:2201x1673-85277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgg.2020.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009400163300002000257520132900277592002801606650001901634650001701653650002501670650002101695650002501716650001001741650002901751650001901780650002201799650001101821651001501832700002301847773012701870856007501997852000902072655001202081IND60535742620221116182343.0160805e20141118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053574262DNAL7 a10.1021/es503356c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaptich, Michael N.10aBias of Averages in Life-Cycle Footprinting of Infrastructure: Truck and Bus Case Studies  ap. 13045-13052.  aThe life-cycle output (e.g., level of service) of infrastructure systems heavily influences their normalized environmental footprint. Many studies and tools calculate emission factors based on average productivity; however, the performance of these systems varies over time and space. We evaluate the appropriate use of emission factors based on average levels of service by comparing them to those reflecting a distribution of system outputs. For the provision of truck and bus services where fuel economy is assumed constant over levels of service, emission factor estimation biases, described by Jensen’s inequality, always result in larger-than-expected environmental impacts (3%–400%) and depend strongly on the variability and skew of truck payloads and bus ridership. Well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emission factors for diesel trucks in California range from 87 to 1,500 g of CO₂ equivalents per ton-km, depending on the size and type of trucks and the services performed. Along a bus route in San Francisco, well-to-wheel emission factors ranged between 53 and 940 g of CO₂ equivalents per passenger-km. The use of biased emission factors can have profound effects on various policy decisions. If average emission rates must be used, reflecting a distribution of productivity can reduce emission factor biases.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aecological footprint 3aemissions factor 3aenvironmental impact 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3atrucks 3aCalifornia1 aHorváth, Árpád,0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 48, no. 22 p.13045-13052dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes503356c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013800169300001600307520107200323592002801395650000901423650001501432650002201447650001301469650002101482651001001503653002101513653000901534653001901543653001401562653002301576700005401599700001401653700001501667700001901682773008901701856008401790852000901874655001201883IND60603640920221120051040.0180716e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060364092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChong, ChinHao10aLogarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition of coal consumption in China based on the energy allocation diagram of coal flows  ap. 366-378.  aThis manuscript attempted to analyze the influencing factors of coal consumption growth in China using the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition method developed based on the physical processes of coal utilization from raw coal to the end-use sectors. By mapping the energy allocation diagram of coal flows, we built a method to balance the energy allocation of coal flows and derived several technical influencing factors. These factors were used to develop an LMDI decomposition method suitable for analyzing the coal consumption growth of complex coal-use systems, such as that of China. The method is subsequently applied to analyze the influencing factors of China's coal consumption growth from 2001 to 2011. The results indicate the rapid growth of GDP (gross domestic production) per capita, which heavily relied on the expansion of heavy industry as the dominant factor driving coal consumption growth. Improvement in the energy efficiency of coal power generation and coal end-use combustion were the primary factors reducing coal consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy efficiency 3aindustry 3apower generation 3aChina 0aCoal consumption 0aLMDI 0aSankey diagram 0aCoal flow 0aInfluencing factor1 aMa, Linwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9090-04881 aLi, Zheng1 aNi, Weidou1 aSong, Shizhong0 tEnergy.g2015 June 01, v. 85 p.366-378dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2015.03.1003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01503naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006600172300001800238520060100256592002800857650002300885650002300908650001400931650002200945700001900967700001800986700001801004773008901022856008101111852000901192655001201201IND60109393920221122040413.0141109e20110729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010939392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.05.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChou, Shang-Shing P.10aSynthesis and reactions of sulfur-substituted indolizidinones  ap. 5395-5401.  aAn aza-Diels–Alder reaction product 2 was readily converted to a tetrahydropyridine derivative 6, but its N-benzyl group was unexpectedly difficult to cleave under various conditions.

Five, 10 and 15years post-vaccination >94% of subjects had detectable antibodies and 88.2%, 86.4% and 76.7% had a titre ≥10IU/L; GMTs were 269IU/L, 169IU/L and 51IU/L, respectively; 99.1–100% vaccinees reached a titre ≥10IU/l post-booster. GMTs were 118012IU/L, 32477IU/L, and 13946IU/L when the booster was administered 5, 10 or 15 years post-vaccination, respectively. We conclude that vaccination induces immunity in the great majority of vaccinees for at least 15years. The response to a booster dose suggests persistence of immune memory in almost all vaccinees. Although a booster dose increases substantially anti-HBs titres, the clinical relevance of such an increase remains unknown. These results do not support the need of a booster for at least 15years when vaccinating preadolescents with Engerix-B.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3ahepatitis B 3aimmunologic memory 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aHepatitis B 0aVaccination 0aAntibody and immune memory persistence1 aDe Serres, Gaston1 aBoulianne, Nicole1 aMurphy, Donald1 aDe Wals, Philippe1 aOuakki, Manale1 aTrudeau, Gisele1 aMassé, Richard1 aDionne, Marc0 tVaccine.g2013 Jan. 07, v. 31, no. 3 p.448-451dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009800163300001600261520064100277592002800918650001400946650000900960650001600969700001600985773007101001856008201072990002301154852000901177655001201186IND60102855120221119003713.0141106e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010285512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuel.2013.03.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ying10aAnalysis of the influences of gas temperature fluctuation on the soot formation and oxidation  ap. 492-495.  aNumerical analysis is performed to investigate the influences of gas temperature fluctuation on soot formation and oxidation.

Structural and morphological analysis were carried out by using XRD and TEM techniques which revealed that the size of nanoparticles synthesized at pH 9 was smaller as compared to those synthesized at other pH values. The thick films of synthesized samples were deposited on alumina substrate and their sensing response to methanol, ethanol and isopropanol was investigated at different operating temperatures. It was observed that all the sensors gave optimum response at 250°C. It has been observed that sample prepared at pH 9, being a collection of smallest particles as compared to other samples, exhibited high sensing response to alcohol vapour. Sensor response of all the samples tested was significantly higher towards isopropanol vapour than towards methanol or ethanol. In the present study the effect of particle size on intergranular activation energy has been studied as well. It was found that smaller particles possess high activation energy and exhibit higher sensing response as compared to that of larger particles. This type of study may help in the selection of particle suitable for gas sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactivation energy 3aaluminum oxide 3achromium 3acoprecipitation 3aethanol 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avapors1 aOaṅhāra Siṅgha,1 aSingh, Ravi Chand0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 158, no. 1 p.259-264dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001200167245006600179300001200245520056500257592002800822650002400850650001400874650002400888650001200912650002300924650004200947650003500989700001601024773010101040856008201141990002301223852000901246655001201255IND60107396620221119121458.0141108e20110521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010739662DNAL7 a212955962pmid7 a10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, S.12aA mathematical model on fractional Lotka–Volterra equations  ap. 1-6.  aThe article presents the solutions of Lotka–Volterra equations of fractional-order time derivatives with the help of analytical method of nonlinear problem called the homotopy perturbation method (HPM).

The results revealed that the addition of Mn(IV) significantly inhibited PAH biodegradation, the rate of which was about 31–70% lower than the one of the groups without Mn(IV) addition. The amendment of Mn(IV) also showed adverse effect on the population size of enriched PAH-degrading bacteria and bacterial activity. The analysis results on the concentrations of Mn(II) and Mn(IV) indicated that Mn(IV) was converted to Mn(II) fast, the latter was the predominate manganese form in the mangrove sediment slurries through the whole experimental period. The Mn(II) toxicity to microorganisms was considered the main reason for inhibition of the PAH-biodegradation. On the other hand, the inoculation of the enriched PAH-degrading consortia significantly enhanced the biodegradation rates of all four PAHs, and the biodegradation rates of 3-rings (Fl, Phe) and 4-rings (Flua, Pyr) PAHs were enhanced by 14–15% and 21–34%, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3asediments 3aslurries 3aphenanthrenes 3abiodegradation 3atoxicity 3apopulation size 3aadverse effects 3abacteria 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aphenanthrene1 aYe, Chun1 aWong, Yuk-Shan1 aTam, Nora Fung-Yee0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 June 15, v. 190, no. 1-3 p.786-793dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.03.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014100167300001600308520100600324592002801330650002201358650001101380650001001391650001601401700001601417773008701433856008401520990002301604852000901627655001201636IND60103868620221118035203.0141107e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010386862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.05.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Junzheng10aInternal-stress-induced martensitic transformation of Co₅₀Ni₂₀Ga₃₀ ferromagnetic shape memory alloys under high undercooling  ap. 168-171.  aCo₅₀Ni₂₀Ga₃₀ ferromagnetic shape memory alloys with different undercoolings were prepared by glass fluxing combined with superheating cycling; the effect of undercooling on martensitic transformation in the alloy was studied. Results show that undercooling not only causes grain refinement but also introduces internal stress that rises with undercooling increasing and, when large enough, induces martensitic transformation in the alloy as external stress does. At the moderate undercooling of 179K, martensitic transformation is observed in some parts of the austenitic matrix due to stress concentration; at the maximum undercooling of 298K, the internal stress becomes as large as to cause complete martensitic transformation at room temperature. Differential scanning calorimeter proves that transformation temperatures are greatly elevated with undercooling increasing, and X-ray diffraction patterns confirm that the alloy exhibits different phase states at different undercoolings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3aglass 3atemperature1 aLi, Jianguo0 tMaterials letters.g2012 Sept. 15, v. 83 p.168-171dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2012.05.0733Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011300171300001400284520082300298592002801121650001901149650002601168650002301194650001101217650001301228650001401241650001101255650001401266650001701280650001901297651001101316653003201327653002001359653001401379653001001393653003001403653001501433653001301448700002001461700001901481700001601500773009801516856008701614852000901701655001201710IND60108228620221119014700.0161027e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010822862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarel, Romain12aA cost and benefit analysis of future end-of-life vehicle glazing recycling in France: A systematic approach  ap. 54-65.  aAs with other European countries, the French automotive industry needs to improve the end-of-life vehicle (ELV) recycling rate in order to reach the minimum reuse and recovery rate required by EU directives. This paper proposes a model to investigate the potential cost and benefit of ELV glazing recycling for all value-chain stakeholders, and for the network as a whole. Key parameters of future changes, namely glass cullet price, landfill cost, network coverage and transportation costs are identified at the level of field research. A system dynamics approach is then used to simulate the net economic balance of the recycling network under different future scenarios. The simulation reveals an increase in the income and considerable cost savings as a result of the recycling network in some of future scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acost benefit analysis 3acost effectiveness 3aincome 3aindustry 3alandfills 3aprices 3arecycling 3astakeholders 3atransportation 3aFrance 0aCost-benefit analysis (CBA) 0aSystem dynamics 0aRecycling 0aGlass 0aEnd-of-life vehicle (ELV) 0aSimulation 0aScenario1 aYannou, Bernard1 aGhaffari, Asma1 aLeroy, Yann0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 May, v. 74 p.54-65dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.02.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245007300168300001600241520089600257592002801153650001501181650001401196650001001210650000901220650001301229650002601242650002201268650001501290650001601305650001801321650001301339700001501352700002001367700002001387773010301407856008201510852000901592655001201601IND60110649920221118104939.0141109e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011064992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2010.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Bhagwat10aMetabolite identification by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 360-387.  aMetabolite identification (Met ID) is important during the early stages of drug discovery and development, as the metabolic products may be pharmacologically active or toxic in nature.

We critically assess and compare various mass spectrometers, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Citing appropriate examples, we cover recent LC and ion sources, isotopic-pattern matching, hydrogen/deuterium-exchange MS, data dependent analyses, MSᴱ, mass defect filter, 2D and 3D approaches for the elucidation of molecular formula, polarity switching, and background-subtraction and noise-reduction algorithms.

In the periphery, if T cells are stimulated insufficiently by peptide-major histocompatibility complex, they become inactive and their production of cytokines changes, a phenomenon called “T cell anergy”. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that T cell anergy may function to reduce the risk of autoimmunity. The underlying logic is as follows: Since those self-reactive T cells that receive strong stimuli from self-antigens are eliminated in the thymus, T cells that receive strong stimuli in the periphery are likely to be non-self-reactive. As a consequence, when a T cell receives a weak stimulus, the likelihood that the cell is self-reactive is higher than in the case that it receives a strong stimulus. Therefore, inactivation of the T cell may reduce the danger of autoimmunity. We consider the formalism in which each T cell chooses its response depending on the strength of stimuli in order to reduce the risk of autoimmune diseases while maintaining its ability to attack non-self-antigens effectively. The optimal T cell responses to a weak and a strong stimulus are obtained both when the cells respond in a deterministic manner and when they respond in a probabilistic manner. We conclude that T cell anergy is the optimal response when a T cell meets with antigen-presenting cells many times in its lifetime, and when the product of the autoimmunity risk and the number of self-reactive T cells has an intermediate value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aautoimmune diseases 3aautoimmunity 3acytokines 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3arisk 2aAutoimmunityximmunology 2aClonal Anergyximmunology 2aLymphocyte Activationximmunology 2aModels, Immunological 2aRisk Factors 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology1 aIwasa, Yō,0 tJournal of theoretical biology.g2011 May 21, v. 277, no. 1 p.74-82dElsevier Ltdx0022-51937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.02.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01642naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015800169300001800327520049600345592002800841650001400869650002300883650001600906650001800922650002200940700002300962700001900985700002101004700001601025700002001041700002201061700001801083773008901101856008101190852000901271655001201280IND60109394020221122032038.0141109e20110729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010939402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.05.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastillo, M.

Much progress is now being made in prohibition of paid-for advertising and in promotion of smoke-free policies, but mass media campaigns are widely underused, provision of services for smokers trying to quit is generally poor, and price policies are undermined by licit and illicit cheap supplies. Monitoring of prevalence is inadequate in many countries, as is investment in research and capacity to address this largest avoidable cause of death and disability across Europe. However, grounds for optimism are provided by progress in implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and in the development of a new generation of nicotine-containing devices that could enable more widespread adoption of harm-reduction strategies. The effect of commercial vested interests has been and remains a major barrier to progress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadvertising 3adeath 3aissues and policy 3amass media 3amonitoring 3aprices 3atobacco 3aEurope1 aBogdanovica, Ilze0 tlancet.g2013 May 4, v. 381, no. 9877 p.1588-1595dElsevier Ltd.x0140-67367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60814-43Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171300001600268520151000284592002801794650002001822650001301842650001601855650001601871650001301887650001501900650002401915650002501939650002001964650001701984650002202001650001502023650001102038650002102049650001102070650001302081653001702094653002302111653001302134653002402147700002902171700001902200700002602219773011002245856008602355852000902441655001202450IND60111258020221119122701.0190319e20130107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011125802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQadri, Firdausi10aImmune responses and protection in children in developing countries induced by oral vaccines  ap. 452-460.  aOral mucosal vaccines have great promise for generating protective immunity against intestinal infections for the benefit of large numbers of people especially young children. There however appears to be a caveat since these vaccines have to overcome the inbuilt resistance of mucosal surfaces and secretions to inhibit antigen stimulation and responses. Unfortunately, these vaccines are not equally immunogenic nor protective in different populations. When compared to industrialized countries, children living in developing countries appear to have lower responses, but the reasons for these lowered responses are not clearly defined. The most likely explanations relate to undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, microbial overload on mucosal surfaces, alteration of microbiome and microbolom and irreversible changes on the mucosa as well as maternal antibodies in serum or breast milk may alter the mucosal pathology and lower immune responses to interventions using oral vaccines. The detrimental effect of adverse environment and malnutrition may bring about irreversible changes in the mucosa of children especially in the first 1000 days of life from conception to after birth and up to two years of age. This review aims to summarize the information available on lowered immune responses to mucosal vaccines and on interventions that may help address the constraints of these vaccines when they are used for children living under the greatest stress and under harmful adverse circumstances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3abreast milk 3achildren 3aconception 3adeveloped countries 3adeveloping countries 3aimmune response 3amalnutrition 3amaternal immunity 3amicrobiome 3amucosa 3amucosal immunity 3apeople 3avaccines 0aMalnutrition 0aMucosal immunology 0aImmunity 0aHypo-responsiveness1 aBhuiyan, Taufiqur Rahman1 aSack, David A.1 aSvennerholm, Ann-Mari0 tVaccine.g2013 Jan. 07, v. 31, no. 3 p.452-460dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245005800170300001600228520109900244592002801343650002801371650003201399650002701431650001301458650001701471650001601488650002201504650002701526650001101553700001401564773011701578856008801695990002301783852000901806655001201815IND60107292520221120201307.0141108e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010729252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Lizhong14aThe chemo-mechanical coupled model for F₁F₀-motor  ap. 139-148.  aF₁F₀-motor (ATP synthase) is the universal enzyme in biological energy conversion that is present in the membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts and bacteria. It uses the energy of the proton gradient across the membrane to synthesize ATP. Previous theory and model about rotation of the ATP synthase is reviewed, then a novel chemo-mechanical coupled model for rotation of the F₁F₀-motor is proposed. In the model, more events are considered simultaneously that includes the movement of F₁, the movement of F₀, reactions at F₁ and reactions at F₀. Using the model, the possible substep modes of the rotation for F₁F₀ are predicted, the dependence of the motor efficiency and its rotation rate on the rigidity of the γ shaft is investigated. We conclude that the γ shaft has a large rotation rate for a limited driving potential because two ends of the γ shaft can rotate alternately for its flexibility. The flexibility also makes the efficiency of F₁F₀ drop because elastic twisting deformation power is needed during alternate rotation of the γ shaft at two ends.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abacteria 3achloroplasts 3adeformation 3aenergy conversion 3amitochondrial membrane 3amodels1 aLiu, Fang0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2012 Apr., v. 108, no. 3 p.139-148dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2012.01.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01444naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245004000169300001600209520053200225592002800757650001100785650000900796650001300805650001200818650001300830650001300843650001100856700002500867700002400892773011000916856008301026852000901109655001201118IND60101252020221119145425.0141106e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010125202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2010.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBound, Nicola J.10aLingual and renal lymphoma in a cat  ap. 272-275.  aA domestic shorthair cat presented with a progressive history of polydipsia, lingual swelling and ulceration.

This risk can be minimized through the application of the pesticide at a set rate using controlled release formulations (CRFs). In this research, CRFs of isoproturon, imidacloprid and cyromazine have been evaluated in a calcareous soil. The effects of two natural polymers (alginate and lignin) and two modifying sorbents (bentonite and activated carbon) on pesticide release kinetics from CRFs have been investigated, as well as mobility of pesticides using soil columns. The rate of pesticide release in soil from CRFs diminished in all cases in relation to technical products. From the analysis of the time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into soil (T₅₀ₛₒᵢₗ), it can be deduced that the release rate of pesticides can be controlled by using activated carbon in the alginate-based CRFs and mixing the pesticide with kraft lignin. Mobility experiments showed that the use of CRFs clearly reduces the presence of isoproturon and imidacloprid in the leachate compared to technical products, and to a lesser extent for cyromacine due to its high water solubility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aactive ingredients 3aadsorbents 3abentonite 3acalcareous soils 3acyromazine 3agroundwater contamination 3aimidacloprid 3aisoproturon 3aleaching 3alignin 3amixing 3apesticide application 3aplant cultural practices 3arisk 3awater solubility1 aGarrido-Herrera, F.J.1 aGonzález-Pradas, E.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 June 15, v. 190, no. 1-3 p.794-801dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.03.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01371naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008400162300001800246520041800264592002800682650002400710650002000734650001900754650002400773700002400797700002400821773011100845856008100956990002301037852000901060655001201069IND60104176020221119225934.0141107e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010417602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngulo, O.12aA semi-Lagrangian method for a cell population model in a dynamical environment  ap. 1860-1866.  aWe formulate a numerical method on a regular grid, which is based on integration along characteristics curves, to solve a size-structured cell population model in an environment with an evolutionary resource concentration.

In the present work, two model-fitting methods based on the differential and integral forms of the general kinetic equation are evaluated using both simulated and experimental data, showing that the differential method is recommended due to its higher discrimination power. Moreover, the intrinsic limitations of model-fitting methods are highlighted: the use of a limited set of kinetic models to fit experimental data and the ideal nature of such models. Finally, it is concluded that a chain scission model is more appropriate than first order.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aequations 3amodels 3apolystyrenes 3arecycling 3athermal degradation 0aKinetic analysis 0aIntegral methods 0aChain scission 0aKinetic model 0aPolystyrene1 aPérez-Maqueda, Luis A.1 aPerejón, Antonio,1 aCriado, José M.0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 May, v. 74 p.75-81dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009000168300001600258520085600274592002801130650004401158650002301202650002201225650001101247650002201258650002701280700002001307700002501327700002601352700002101378700001301399700002401412773010901436856008601545990002301631852000901654655001201663IND60102295720221120201941.0141106e20110131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010229572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2010.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinitha, R.10aFT-IR, FT-Raman and computational study of 1H-2,2-dimethyl-3H-phenothiazin-4[10H]-one  ap. 316-322.  aFT-IR and FT-Raman spectra of 1H-2,2-dimethyl-3H-phenothiazin-4[10H]-one were recorded and analyzed.

Furthermore, it is shown that a CeO₂ buffer layer can be successfully deposited on the Cu−33at%Ni substrate using dip-coating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acold 3amagnetic properties 3amicrostructure 3atemperature 3atexture1 aSuo, H.L.1 aZhao, Y.1 aMishin, O.V.1 aGrivel, J.-C.0 tMaterials letters.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 108 p.142-144dElsevier B.V.x0167-577X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matlet.2013.06.0713Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01563naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245005200173300001800225520043800243592002800681650002300709650002300732650001700755650002300772650002100795650001000816650001400826653002000840653002700860653002100887653001700908653002000925700002500945700002500970773008900995856008401084852000901168655001201177IND60110175920221122000400.0161019e20131106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011017592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2013.08.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuchanan, Jacob C.10aConcise total synthesis of phidianidine A and B  ap. 6002-6004.  aThe shortest total synthesis of cytotoxic indole alkaloids phidianidine A and B is described.

The as-prepared sample was characterized by XRD and SEM. Results showed that the ceria was cubic fluorite structure and sized in nanometer range. The photocatalytic degradation of phenol was investigated in the presence of a suspended mixture of ceria and activated carbon. A synergy effect was observed with an enhancement of the apparent rate constant by a factor of 5.6 times. The apparent quantum yield of the ceria–AC system was also increased 2.9 times. The activated carbon with strong adsorption activity provided sites for the adsorption of phenol. Then, the adsorbed phenol would migrate continuously to the surface of ceria particles. Some phenol still remained adsorbing on the catalyst when no traces of phenol were detected in the solution. This adsorbed phenol could be degraded by maintaining UV-irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aultraviolet radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aphotocatalysis 3aphenol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysts 3aadsorption 0aphotocatalyst0 tPowder technology.g2011 June 10, v. 210, no. 1 p.1-5dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2011.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011200163300001800275500001500293520187500308592002802183650001802211650002002229650001802249650002402267650001502291653001402306700002102320700001602341700001602357700001902373773011102392856008102503990002302584852000902607655001202616IND60104176220221119230011.0141107e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010417622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.12.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacián, V.12aA view on the internal consistency of linear source identification for I.C. engine exhaust noise prediction  ap. 1867-1875.  a2019-12-04  aConsiderable efforts have been devoted to the development of predictive models that, from a certain set of data related to an engine, and making use of an adequate representation of the effect of the silencing elements, provide an estimate of the exhaust noise emitted. Such models should allow for the consideration of the engine and its interaction with the exhaust system. This is properly achieved by gas-dynamic models, which are becoming the standard, but linear models solved in the frequency domain and representing the engine as a linear time-invariant source may still play a role in exhaust system design, as the engine is treated as a black box. Such a representation is very attractive for engine manufacturers, since it gives the possibility to provide data on the engine without any possibility to trace back to its real characteristics. In order to provide additional criteria for the suitability of the application of a linear time-invariant representation to an engine exhaust, in this paper a multi-load method has been used to extract source characteristics from gas-dynamic simulation results. The details of the method, in which the resulting over-determined system is solved by fitting the values of the source parameters in a least-squares sense, are described, and different approaches are used in order to check the internal consistency of the source representation: the identification of pressure and velocity sources, and the application of the least-squares criterion to the modulus or to the real and imaginary parts separately. In particular, eight different determinations of the source impedance are obtained and, considering the application of the formalism to an engine exhaust, the differences observed provide a suitable criterion for the evaluation of the suitability of the representation and of the particular set of loads chosen.  aPublisher supplied data 3alinear models 3adata collection 3aleast squares 3asystems engineering 3aprediction 0aimpedance1 aTorregrosa, A.J.1 aBroatch, A.1 aNiven, P.C.1 aAmphlett, S.A.0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2013 Apr., v. 57, no. 7-8 p.1867-1875dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2011.12.0183Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012900166300001800295520041400313592002800727650001100755650002300766650002300789650001400812650001300826650001300839650000800852700002900860700002300889700002600912700002400938773009700962856008401059852000901143655001201152IND60109783920221120032339.0141109e20110713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010978392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGul, Kashif10aBimetallic system for the synthesis of diorganyl selenides and sulfides, chiral β-seleno amines, and seleno- and thioesters  ap. 3592-3596.  aThe bimetallic reagent Sn(II)/Cu(II) in [bmim]BF₄ was efficiently used for the cleavage of diaryl diselenides and disulfides and reacts with a variety of organic substrates, such as organic halides, acid chlorides, and β-amino mesylates affording the diorganyl selenides and sulfides within very short reaction times, under mild conditions and with excellent yields, using BMIM-BF₄ as a reusable solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamines 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3achlorides 3asolvents 3asulfides 3atin1 aNarayanaperumal, Senthil1 aDornelles, Luciano1 aRodrigues, Oscar E.D.1 aBraga, Antonio Luiz0 tTetrahedron letters.g2011 July 13, v. 52, no. 28 p.3592-3596dElsevier Ltdx0040-40397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245006400175300001600239520138400255592002801639650001301667650002301680650002301703650001201726650002001738650001501758700002301773700001901796700001501815700001801830700001801848700001701866773010901883856008501992852000902077655001202086IND60101344220221119132048.0141106e20110615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010134422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.03.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundarapandiyan, S.10aEnhancement of chromium uptake in tanning using oxazolidine  ap. 802-809.  aMonocyclic and bicyclic oxazolidines were offered at three different junctures of chrome tanning process viz. prior to BCS offer, along with BCS and after basification. It was found that oxazolidine when offered after basification brought about better chromium uptake and reduction of chromium load in the wastewater. Offer of oxazolidine was also varied. Increase in offer of oxazolidine from 0.25% to 1% was found to enhance the chromium uptake and decrease the chromium load in wastewater. But the increase in uptake was not proportionate to the increase in oxazolidine offer more than 0.75%. Offer of 1% Zoldine ZA 78 (monocyclic oxazolidine) and Zoldine ZE (bicyclic oxazolidine) after basification brought about 63.4% and 73.1% enhancement in chrome content in leather compared to control where oxazolidine was not offered. The tone of the wetblue was found to be altered moderately. However this did not call for any process adjustments in wet-finishing. The oxazolidine treated leathers were found to be immensely fuller and tighter. It was found experimentally that offer of 1% of oxazolidine facilitated reduction in the offer of syntans administered for filling and grain tightening by around 46%. Oxazolidine could bring about significant reduction in cost of chemicals apart from resulting environmental benefits due to enhancement of chromium uptake during tanning.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3acost effectiveness 3aecosystem services 3aleather 3aleather tanning 3awastewater1 aBrutto, Patrick E.1 aSiddhartha, G.1 aRamesh, R.1 aRamanaiah, B.1 aSaravanan, P.1 aMandal, A.B.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 June 15, v. 190, no. 1-3 p.802-809dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.03.1173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012300168300001400291520086500305592002801170650001401198650001201212650002201224650001501246650001201261650002001273650001001293700001701303700001401320700001701334773009201351856008401443852000901527655001201536IND60105948120221120043430.0141108e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010594812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2011.02.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Wancheng10aEfficient synthesis of orthorhombic lithium borate hydroxide micro-rods and their thermal conversion to lithium borate  ap. 67-72.  aUniform orthorhombic Li₃B₅O₈(OH)₂ micro-rods were hydrothermally synthesized at 150–210°C for 6.0–24.0h, using LiOH·H₂O and H₃BO₃ as the reactants.

This enlarged the controllable synthesis of the alkali borates, especially enriched the study on the lithium borates which can be potentially used as a perspective superionic conductor and electrode of lithium ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aborates 3acrystal structure 3aelectrodes 3alithium 3asodium chloride 3awater1 aZhang, Liyun1 aCui, Xili1 aZhang, Qiang0 tPowder technology.g2011 June 10, v. 210, no. 1 p.67-72dElsevier B.V.x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2011.02.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01710naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150242009300165245008000258300001600338520074000354592002801094650001601122650001301138650001501151650001801166700001701184773009101201856008401292990002301376852000901399655001201408IND60105383220221121030548.0141108e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6010538322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.patbio.2009.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaudat, A.10aUne dérive induite par l’acquisition d’un système vidéo affilié à un microscope12aA drift induced by the acquisition of a video system linked to a microscope  ap. 278-280.  aFurther to the acquisition of a new material consisting in a microscope and its video equipment, we report the example of some drift with regards to written, updated and validated procedures.

It is interesting that the size and its distribution of ZnS nanospheres can be easily tuned by adjusting pH value. The photocatalytic activity of the ZnS nanospheres was evaluated by photodegradation reaction of methylene blue.

The critical micelle concentrations (cmc) for different mixing mole fractions at different temperatures have been calculated. To explain and compare the results, theoretical models of Clint, Rubingh and Motomura have been used to obtain the ideal cmc, mixed micelle composition, interaction parameters (βᵐ), free energies of micellization, and activity coefficients. The mixtures show nonideal behavior and the interactions between the surfactants and the hydrotropes are synergistic in nature which is confirmed by high negative βᵐ values and low values of the activity coefficients. Thermodynamic parameters were also obtained from the temperature dependence of the cmc values.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicelles 3amixing 3amodels 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aKhanam, Ahmad Jahan1 aSheikh, Mohmad Shafi1 aKabir-ud-Din, 0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2011 July 15, v. 359, no. 2 p.467-473dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.03.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245009000174300001800264520105400282592002801336650001401364650001201378650001901390650002401409650002001433650002001453650001801473650000901491700001501500700001501515773011201530856008201642990002301724852000901747655001201756IND60107909520221122221251.0141108e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010790952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.02.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuryatriyastuti, M.E.10aUnderstanding the temperature-induced mechanical behaviour of energy pile foundations  ap. 3344-3354.  aThis paper discusses physical process of thermal transfer in energy pile foundations, which function as structural support for the buildings as well as heat exchangers serving energy to the buildings. Derivation of conservation of energy balance is presented, depends on its type of heat transfer within a whole system of soil and foundation. In order to understand the mechanical implication behind their application, simulation numeric with finite difference method is conducted, concerning an energy pile in homogenous soil under static thermal load. The study takes into account two different conditions of contact between soil and pile: perfectly contact and sliding contact using frictional interface elements. The results show that temperature-induced mechanical behaviour of pile and soil is strongly related to the condition of contact between them. Further work is projected to consider a more appropriate law that corresponds to cyclic thermal loading of energy piles due to its seasonal cooling and heating operation throughout the year.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acooling 3aenergy balance 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy transfer 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3asoil1 aMroueh, H.1 aBurlon, S.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 June, v. 16, no. 5 p.3344-3354dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.02.0623Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245019900169300001600368520101600384592002801400650004401428650003701472650001401509650001701523650003701540650001901577650002101596650001701617650001701634650001701651650001901668700002301687700001901710700001701729700001901746773011001765856008201875852000901957655001201966IND60100895620221118080542.0141105e20130315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010089562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.11.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBach, Long Giang10aPoly(allyl methacrylate) functionalized hydroxyapatite nanocrystals via the combination of surface-initiated RAFT polymerization and thiol–ene protocol: A potential anticancer drug nanocarrier  ap. 132-140.  aHydroxyapatite nanocrystals (HAP NCs) were encapsulated by poly(allyl methacrylate) (PolyAMA) employing controlled surface-initiated reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (SI-RAFT) polymerization of allyl methacrylate to afford HAP-PolyAMA nanohybrids.

The utility of the HAP-PolyAMA nanohybrid as drug carrier was also explored. The pendant carboxyl groups on the external layers of nanohybrids were conjugated with anticancer drug cisplatin to afford HAP-Poly(AMA-COOH)/Pt complex.

However, invasive methods of administration, short duration of action, and lack of pulmonary selectivity result in noncompliance and poor patient outcomes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that encapsulation of an investigational anti-PAH molecule fasudil (HA-1077), a Rho-kinase inhibitor, into liposomal vesicles results in prolonged vasodilation in distal pulmonary arterioles. Liposomes were prepared by hydration and extrusion method and fasudil was loaded by ammonium sulfate-induced transmembrane electrochemical gradient. Liposomes were then characterized for various physicochemical properties. Optimized formulations were tested for pulmonary absorption and their pharmacological efficacy in a monocrotaline (MCT) induced rat model of PAH. The entrapment efficiency of optimized liposomal fasudil formulations was between 68.1±0.8% and 73.6±2.3%, and the cumulative release at 37°C was 98–99% over a period of 5days. Compared to intravenous (IV) fasudil, a ~10 fold increase in the terminal plasma half-life was observed when liposomal fasudil was administered as aerosols. The t₁/₂ of IV fasudil was 0.39±0.12h. and when given as liposomes via pulmonary route, the t₁/₂ extended to 4.71±0.72h. One h after intratracheal instillation of liposomal fasudil, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) was reduced by 37.6±5.7% and continued to decrease for about 3h, suggesting that liposomal formulations produced pulmonary preferential vasodilation in MCT induced PAH rats. Overall, this study established the proof-of-principle that aerosolized liposomal fasudil is a feasible option for a non-invasive, controlled release and pulmonary preferential treatment of PAH.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3aanimal models 3aarterioles 3adrugs 3aelectrochemistry 3aencapsulation 3aextrusion 3ahalf life 3ahypertension 3aintravenous injection 3amonocrotaline 3aoral administration 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arats 3avasodilation1 aGupta, Nilesh1 aShaik, Imam H.1 aMehvar, Reza1 aMcMurtry, Ivan F.1 aOka, Masahiko1 aNozik-Grayck, Eva1 aKomatsu, Masanobu1 aAhsan, Fakhrul0 tJournal of controlled release.g2013 Apr. 28, v. 167, no. 2 p.189-199dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2013.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245008900187300001400276500001500290520067000305592002800975650001601003650000901019650002901028650001001057650001101067650000801078650002801086650001101114650001901125650001401144650002601158650001501184650003101199650003601230650002201266650002401288650002601312650003601338650002901374650002201403650002201425650002201447653002401469700002001493700002401513700002201537700002001559700002101579773010101600856008101701852000901782655001201791IND60102051320221119164252.0141106e20110107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010205132DNAL7 a210354582pmid7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2010.10.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvilevitch, Alex10aEffects of Salts on Internal DNA Pressure and Mechanical Properties of Phage Capsids  ap. 18-23.  a2019-12-04  aBased on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements of phage λ, we previously proposed a minimal model describing the effect of water hydrating DNA that strengthens viral capsids against external deformation at wild-type DNA packing density.

The model also predicts the stiffness of other DNA-filled capsids, which we confirm using bacteriophage ϕ29 and herpes simplex virus type 1 particles.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3aions 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 3asalts 3acapsid 3aDNA 3aatomic force microscopy 3amodels 3abacteriophages 3amagnesium 3amechanical properties 3aprediction 2aBacillus Phagesxchemistry 2aBacteriophage lambdaxchemistry 2aCapsidxchemistry 2aCationsxmetabolism 2aDNA, Viralxchemistry 2aHerpesvirus 1, Humanxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Atomic Force 2aOsmotic Pressure. 2aSaltsxmetabolism 2aWaterxmetabolism 0aHuman herpesvirus 11 aRoos, Wouter H.1 aIvanovska, Irena L.1 aJeembaeva, Meerim1 aJönsson, Bengt1 aWuite, Gijs J.L.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2011 Jan. 7, v. 405, no. 1 p.18-23dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2010.10.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011400172300001800286520120300304592002801507650001201535650001901547650002501566650001601591650002201607650001901629650002901648650002101677650002201698650001201720650001801732650000901750650001401759650001901773650001701792650002101809650001501830651001701845700002001862773011201882856008201994990002302076852000902099655001202108IND60107909620221122221244.0141108e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010790962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2011.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Syed Masiur10aMitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon capture and storage in Saudi Arabia  ap. 2446-2460.  aThe main causes of global warming are now attributed to the burning of fossil fuels. Saudi Arabia is the world's largest producer and exporter of total petroleum liquids, and one of the largest consumers of total primary energy. The activities which are mainly responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions are consistently in the upslope. The electricity generation, the solid waste management, and the agricultural sectors are responsible for the highest share of emissions of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O, respectively. The results of current research provided the initial justifications for the renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy conversion, and hybrid systems. The Master Gas Collection System of Saudi Aramco can be considered as a remarkable step forward in lowering CH₄ emissions from the oil and gas fields. The integrated efforts of the public and private sectors are essential for development and implementation of appropriate strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The study provides an overview of Saudi initiatives related to policy, plan, program, and/or project towards the reduction of greenhouse gases and enhancement of carbon capture and storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aburning 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aelectricity 3aenergy conversion 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprimary energy 3asolid wastes 3awaste management 3awind power 3aSaudi Arabia1 aKhondaker, A.N.0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 June, v. 16, no. 5 p.2446-2460dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2011.12.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01469naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011800166300001800284520050200302592002800804650002300832650001100855650001600866650001200882650001300894700002600907700002500933700001800958773008900976856008101065852000901146655001201155IND60109484820221118091233.0141109e20120429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010948482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagrez, Magaly10aEnantioselective 1,4-conjugate addition of diethylzinc to (E)-alkenyl aryl ketones catalysed by Cu/DiPPAM complex  ap. 3507-3511.  aWe report here the use of the DiPPAM-L1 ligand for copper-catalysed asymmetric conjugate addition (ACA) of diethylzinc to various (E)-alkenyl aryl ketones where the aryl ring is either a phenyl group substituted by nitro, chloro or methoxy groups or not substituted, or a naphthyl group.

Their adsorption and rheology behavior was investigated using equilibrium surface tension and rheological techniques. The adsorption parameters, saturation surface excess concentration (Γₘₐₓ), and the minimum area (Aₘᵢₙ) of these copolymers were evaluated. The results show that Γₘₐₓ increased and Aₘᵢₙ correspondingly decreased with increasing hydrophobicity. Aggregation standard free energy of SMA–PEG+C₁₂ and SMA-C₁₂ suggested that increased hydrophobicity enhanced the tendency for aggregation to occur. The distinctive differences in the macroscopic appearance were shown by aqueous samples of the copolymers. The samples of SMA-M behaved as Newtonian fluids at all concentrations (from 1.0wt% to 20.0wt%), indicating that there were no macromolecular chain entanglements or interactions between aggregates in solution. For SMA–PEG+C₁₂, at concentrations above 10.0wt%, the presence of cross-links between aggregates is presumed to be the reason for the viscoelastic behavior. Solid-like elastic behavior could occur at low concentration (5.0wt%) of SMA-C₁₂, suggesting the formation of networks by inter-chain aggregation of the hydrophobic dodecyl chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3aenergy 3aethylene glycol 3ahydrophobicity 3amaleic acid 3apolyethylene glycol 3arheology 3asurface tension 3aviscoelasticity1 aDu, Zhiping1 aWang, Wanxu1 aWang, Tianzhuang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 May 15, v. 374, no. 1 p.187-196dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.01.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245023600167300001300403520102300416592002801439650001001467650001101477650001701488650002001505650001201525700002001537700002601557700002101583700001701604700001601621700002201637700002001659773011801679856008301797990002301880852000901903655001201912IND60103022820221119221613.0141106e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010302282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vascn.2011.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBass, Alan S.10aSafety pharmacology in 2010 and beyond: Survey of significant events of the past 10years and a roadmap to the immediate-, intermediate- and long-term future in recognition of the tenth anniversary of the Safety Pharmacology Society  ap. 7-15.  aIn recognition of the tenth anniversary of the Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS), this review summarizes the significant events of the past 10years that have led to the birth, growth and evolution the SPS and presents a roadmap to the immediate-, intermediate- and long-term future of the SPS.

The yttrium silylamido complexes 1–4 are effective initiators for the ROP of ɛ-caprolactone, showing extremely high turnover frequencies (TOF up to 18000h⁻¹) under mild reaction conditions. All complexes promote the ROP of rac-lactide in toluene solution at room temperature, providing atactic polymers with controlled molecular weights and relatively narrow polydispersities (Mw/Mₙ=1.73–1.99). Interestingly, in THF solution the same catalysts produce heterotactic polylactides with Pᵣ between 0.58 and 0.91 via a chain-end stereocontrol mechanism. The salan complexes 3 and 4 are more active than the binaphthyl salen complexes 1 and 2, reasonably due to the presence of the more electron donating amino groups. On the other hand, the former resulted in a lower stereoselectivity than the latter. The rigidity of the “bridge” between the two nitrogen atoms seems to have a predominant role in governing the selectivity of the corresponding complexes, while the effect of the steric hindrance of the ortho substituents at the phenoxy rings appears less significant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aesters 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3apolylactic acid 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3atoluene 3ayttrium1 aBruno, Massimo1 aLamberti, Marina1 aMazzeo, Mina1 aPellecchia, Claudio0 tJournal of Molecular Catalysis.

As knowledge on the etiopathological mechanisms of these diseases evolved through the years, Cdk5 has also been implicated in additional cellular events that are affected under these pathological conditions. From the role of Cdk5 in the regulation of synaptic functions to its involvement in autophagy deregulation, significant insights have been obtained regarding the role of Cdk5 as a key regulator of neurodegeneration.

To evaluate agreement to describe sonographic features, 28 video images were evaluated twice by eight expert bronchoscopists. The observers reviewed each case for the presence of coagulation necrosis sign (CNS), central hilar structure (CHS), heterogeneity, distinct margin, round shape, size >1 cm and malignancy. Intraobserver agreement was almost perfect for size (κ = 0.826), substantial for CNS (κ = 0.721) and shape (κ = 0.615), and moderate for CHS (κ = 0.565), heterogeneity (κ = 0.441) and margin (κ = 0.407). Interobserver agreement was substantial for size (κ = 0.641), moderate for shape (κ = 0.445), and fair for CNS (κ = 0.340) and margin (κ = 0.274). In conclusion, inter- and intraobserver agreement of the endosonographic features for mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes is good for shape or size but not good enough for the other ultrasonographic features.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulation 3alymph nodes 3anecrosis 3aultrasonography1 aRadua, Joaquim1 aSerra, Pere1 aAndreo, Felipe1 aSanz-Santos, Jose1 aMonsó, Eduard1 aRosell, Antoni1 aCases-Viedma, Enrique1 aFernández-Villar, Alberto1 aNúñez-Delgado, Manuel1 aGarcía-Luján, Ricardo1 aMorera, Josep1 aRuiz-Manzano, Juan0 tUltrasound in medicine & biology.g2012 July, v. 38, no. 7 p.1163-1168dElsevier Inc.x0301-56297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2012.03.0123Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02389naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245011100169300001800280520133800298592002801636650001401664650001601678650001201694650001101706650002101717650001101738650002901749650002501778700002201803773011201825856008201937990002302019852000902042655001202051IND60107909920221122221214.0141108e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010790992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rser.2012.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDallinger, David10aGrid integration of intermittent renewable energy sources using price-responsive plug-in electric vehicles  ap. 3370-3382.  aPlug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are expected to balance the fluctuation of renewable energy sources (RES). To investigate the contribution of PEVs, the availability of mobile battery storage and the control mechanism for load management are crucial. This study therefore combined the following: a stochastic model to determine mobility behavior, an optimization model to minimize vehicle charging costs and an agent-based electricity market equilibrium model to estimate variable electricity prices. The variable electricity prices are calculated based on marginal generation costs. Hence, because of the merit order effect, the electricity prices provide incentives to consume electricity when the supply of renewable generation is high. Depending on the price signals and mobility behavior, PEVs calculate a cost minimizing charging schedule and therefore balance the fluctuation of RES. The analysis shows that it is possible to limit the peak load using the applied control mechanism. The contribution of PEVs to improving the integration of intermittent renewable power generation into the grid depends on the characteristic of the RES generation profile. For the German 2030 scenario used here, the negative residual load was reduced by 15–22% and the additional consumption of negative residual load was between 34 and 52%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectricity 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower generation 3aprices 3arenewable energy sources 3astochastic processes1 aWietschel, Martin0 tRenewable & sustainable energy reviews.g2012 June, v. 16, no. 5 p.3370-3382dElsevier Ltdx1364-03217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2012.02.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02564naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245016200180300001600342520140600358592002801764650002101792650001501813650001501828650001401843650001101857650002201868650001501890650002301905650001101928700002401939700002101963700002001984773010402004856008502108852000902193655001202202IND60101511720150623000000.0141106e20121130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010151172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.09.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahandar Lashaki, Masoud10aEffect of the adsorbate kinetic diameter on the accuracy of the Dubinin–Radushkevich equation for modeling adsorption of organic vapors on activated carbon  ap. 154-163.  aThis paper investigates the effect of the kinetic diameter (KD) of the reference adsorbate on the accuracy of the Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) equation for predicting the adsorption isotherms of organic vapors on microporous activated carbon. Adsorption isotherms for 13 organic compounds on microporous beaded activated carbon were experimentally measured, and predicted using the D–R model and affinity coefficients. The affinity coefficients calculated based on molar volumes, molecular polarizabilities, and molecular parachors were used to predict the isotherms based on four reference compounds (4.3≤KD≤6.8Å). The results show that the affinity coefficients are independent of the calculation method if the reference and test adsorbates are from the same organic group. Choosing a reference adsorbate with a KD similar to that of the test adsorbate results in better prediction of the adsorption isotherm. The relative error between the predicted and the measured adsorption isotherms increases as the absolute difference in the kinetic diameters of the reference and test adsorbates increases. Finally, the proposed hypothesis was used to explain reports of inconsistent findings among published articles. The results from this study are important because they allow a more accurate prediction of adsorption capacities of adsorbents which allow for better design of adsorption systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aequations 3amodels 3aorganic compounds 3aprediction 3asorption isotherms 3avapors1 aFayaz, Mohammadreza1 aNiknaddaf, Saeid1 aHashisho, Zaher0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2012 Nov. 30, v. 241-242 p.154-163dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2012.09.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002200136024001900158040001800177100001900195245004100214300001600255520141200271592002801683650001101711650001901722650001301741650000901754650001901763650001701782650001901799650001701818650001601835650001701851650002001868650003101888650001301919650001701932650001701949650001401966700001801980700002801998773010302026856008802129990002302217852000902240655001202249IND60105555620221118141109.0141108e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010555562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.05.0092doi7 aPMC33581142pmcid7 a216643752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibao, Cyndya10aPharmacotherapy of autonomic failure  ap. 279-286.  aThe clinical picture of autonomic failure is characterized by severe and disabling orthostatic hypotension. These disorders can develop as a result of damage of central neural pathways or peripheral autonomic nerves, caused either by a primary autonomic neurodegenerative disorder or secondary to systemic illness. Treatment should be focused on decreasing pre-syncopal symptoms instead of achieving blood pressure goals. Non-pharmacologic strategies such as physical counter-maneuvers, dietary changes (i.e. high salt diet, rapid water drinking or compression garments) are the first line therapy. Affected patients should be screened for co-morbid conditions such as post-prandial hypotension and supine hypertension that can worsen orthostatic hypotension if not treated. If symptoms are not controlled with these conservative measures the next step is to start pharmacological agents; these interventions should be aimed at increasing intravascular volume either by promoting water and salt retention (fludrocortisone) or by increasing red blood cell mass when anemia is present (recombinant erythropoietin). When pressor agents are needed, direct pressor agents (midodrine) or agents that potentiate sympathetic activity (atomoxetine, yohimbine, pyridostigmine) can be used. It is preferable to use short-acting pressor agents that can be taken on as needed basis in preparation for upright activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanemia 3ablood pressure 3aclothing 3adiet 3adrinking water 3aerythrocytes 3aerythropoietin 3ahypertension 3ahypotension 3anerve tissue 3aneural pathways 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apatients 3asaline water 3atherapeutics 3ayohimbine1 aOkamoto, Luis1 aBiaggioni, I.q(Italo),0 tPharmacology and therapeutics.g2012 June, v. 134, no. 3 p.279-286dElsevier Inc.x0163-72587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2011.05.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245008700168300001800255520138200273592002801655650001501683650001201698650001801710650001101728650001601739650001101755700001801766700001501784700001201799700001901811700001701830700001301847773008501860856008901945990002302034852000902057655001202066IND60104271020221119132502.0141107e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010427102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.measurement.2012.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Wei13aAn improved online dimensional measurement method of large hot cylindrical forging  ap. 2041-2051.  aThe dimensional measurement of large forgings under high temperature plays an important role in product control. Cylindrical forgings belong to the important products in the forging workshop. In this paper, an improved online measurement method based on binocular vision for the dimensions of hot cylindrical forgings is proposed. Firstly, images of hot cylindrical forgings are captured by two CCD cameras, and the distorted light stripes projected onto hot cylindrical forgings can be resolved from the image by the deviated stripe model. Then, an accurate sub-pixel extraction algorithm of center points of the light stripes is developed for making the extraction of center points of the lights stripes more accurate. Moreover, for changing the field of view of cameras to measure different sections of forgings in the process of manufacturing, the fundamental matrix F is automatically calculated by matching the intersecting points of the projected light stripes in different images, without interrupting the forging process. Finally, experiments on measuring the diameters of hot cylindrical forgings in the workshop are conducted, and the experimental results indicate that the proposed measurement method is effective. Besides, an additional experiment in the laboratory verifies that the relative error of measuring diameters by the presented method is less than 0.7%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acameras 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3atemperature 3avision1 aJia, Zhenyuan1 aWang, Fuji1 aMa, Xin1 aWang, Wenqiang1 aJia, Xinghua1 aSong, Di0 tMeasurement.g2012 Oct., v. 45, no. 8 p.2041-2051dElsevier Ltdx0263-22417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2012.05.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014300171300001800314520148000332592002801812650001201840650001001852650001601862650001101878650000701889650002501896650002101921650002001942650001501962650005801977650001002035650001602045650001402061700002002075700001402095700001602109773010402125856008502229852000902314655001202323IND60100354220221119102235.0141105e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010035422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.03.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarkabounas, A.10aHPLC-fluorimetric assay of phospholipase A₂. Application to biological samples with high protein content and various reaction conditions  ap. 1557-1564.  aPhospholipase A₂ (PLA₂) quantitation in real-time, using (7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino-derivatives of phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PCs) as substrates, is influenced by high protein content, color or turbidity. The purpose of the study was to overcome such limitations by a complementary reversed-phase HPLC step to separate the substrates from the products of the reaction. Plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were applied as enzymic sources, while standard porcine PLA₂ and human plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) were employed as positive controls. The method was validated with a radiometric assay and compared with the real-time fluorimetric assay. Regarding PLA₂ and PAF-AH determination, the isocratic elution systems CH₃OH–H₂O (80:20, v/v) and CH₃OH–H₂O–CH₃COOH (60:40:0.2, v/v/v) separated efficiently C₁₂-NBD-FA/C₁₂-NBD-PC and C₆-NBD-FA/C₆-NBD-PC, with 4.4 and 2.2 resolution, respectively. Analysis time was ∼15min/injection. The reproducibility, expressed as relative standard deviation, was ≤13% for PLA₂ and ≤16% for PAF-AH, respectively. The assay was linear for PLA₂ activities extending from 1pmol up to at least 250nmol FA/h/mL sample, similar to the radiometric assay. It was appropriate for samples with high protein content, where the real-time fluorimetric assay was insufficient. The HPLC method was also evaluated under elevated temperatures, various pH values and Ca²⁺ concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acolor 3afluorometry 3ahumans 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphospholipase A2 3aprotein content 3aradiometry 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aswine 3atemperature 3aturbidity1 aKitsiouli, E.I.1 aNakos, G.1 aLekka, M.E.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2011 June 1, v. 879, no. 19 p.1557-1564dElsevier B.V.x1570-02327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2011.03.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002700188245014300215300001400358506007600372520122400448592002801672506003701700650001501737650002301752650001201775650001201787650002001799650003901819650002401858650002401882650002601906653000901932653001001941653000801951653001301959653000801972653001001980653001501990653000802005653000902013653000902022653001502031653000902046653001202055653001002067653001202077653002902089653001102118653001202129653003502141700001702176700001802193773011102211856008102322852000902403655001202412IND60104646320221207051112.0161020e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010464632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2012.12.0042doi7 aPMC35520062pmcid7 a232617052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalaniappan, Murugesan10aStimulatory effect of insulin on theca-interstitial cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins through MTORC1 dependent pathway  ap. 81-89.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study examined the effect of insulin-mediated activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (MTORC1) signaling network on the proliferation of primary culture of theca-interstitial (T-I) cells. Our results show that insulin treatment increased proliferation of the T-I cells through the MTORC1-dependent signaling pathway by increasing cell cycle regulatory proteins. Inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling caused partial reduction of insulin-induced phosphorylation of RPS6KB1 and RPS6 whereas inhibition of PI3-kinase signaling completely blocked the insulin response. Pharmacological inhibition of MTORC1 with rapamycin abrogated the insulin-induced phosphorylation of EIF4EBP1, RPS6KB1 and its downstream effector, RPS6. These results were further confirmed by demonstrating that knockdown of Mtor using siRNA reduced the insulin-stimulated MTORC1 signaling. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated T-I cell proliferation and the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK4, CCND3 and PCNA were also blocked by rapamycin. Taken together, the present studies show that insulin stimulates cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins in T-I cells via activation of the MTORC1 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3ainsulin 3amammals 3aphosphorylation 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aregulatory proteins 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 0aBrdU 0aCCND3 0aCDK 0aEIF4EBP1 0aERK 0aIGF-1 0aMAP kinase 0aMEK 0aMTOR 0aPCNA 0aPI3 kinase 0aRPS6 0aRPS6KB1 0asiRNA 0aInsulin 0aTheca-interstitial cells 0aMTORC1 0aRPS6KB1 0aCell cycle regulatory proteins1 aMenon, Bindu1 aMenon, K.M.J.0 tMolecular and Cellular Endocrinology.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 366 p.81-89dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2012.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01362naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010600171300001800277520028300295592002800578650002300606650002300629650002200652700002800674700002800702700002000730700002100750700002400771700001800795700002100813773009700834856008400931852000901015655001201024IND60110029820221118233700.0141109e20121212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011002982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2012.10.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavey, Paul R.J.10aFacile preparation and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling of N-2-alkylated 2H-1,2,3-triazole 4-boronates  ap. 6849-6852.  aThe preparation of N-2 substituted 2H-1,2,3-triazoles substituted at C-4 with an organometallic moiety has no recognised precedent.

Using semi-native gels and fluorescence anisotropy, we show that Hfq undergoes a cooperative conformational change from monomer to hexamer around 1 μM protein, which is comparable to the in vivo concentration of Hfq and above the dissociation constant of the Hfq hexamer from many RNA substrates. Above 2 μM protein, Hfq hexamers associate in high-molecular-weight complexes. Mutations that impair RNA binding to the proximal face strongly destabilize the hexamer, while the mutation R16A near the outer rim prevents hexamer association. Stopped-flow fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments showed that Hfq subunits interact within a few seconds, suggesting that Hfq monomers, hexamers and multi-hexamer complexes are in dynamic equilibrium. Finally, we show that Hfq is most active in RNA annealing when the hexamer is present. These results suggest that RNA binding is coupled to hexamer assembly and that the biochemical activity of Hfq reflects the equilibrium between different quaternary structures.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3adissociation 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3agels 3amutation 3anon-coding RNA 2aEscherichia colixchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFluorescence Polarization 2aGels 2aHost Factor 1 Proteinxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aModels, Molecular 2aMutant Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Multimerization 2aRNA, Bacterialxmetabolism1 aWoodson, Sarah A.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2012 Apr. 13, v. 417, no. 5 p.406-412dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2012.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007800165300001600243520140200259592002801661650001901689650002201708650002001730650002901750650001501779650002501794650002101819650002001840650000701860650000901867700001301876700001601889700001701905700001701922773011601939856008202055852000902137655001202146IND60100814120221120193201.0141105e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010081412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2012.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Guocheng10aProbing the interactions between chlorpheniramine and 2:1 phyllosilicates  ap. 218-225.  aInteractions between chlorpheniramine (CP), an antihistamine drug used to treat allergy, and 2:1 phyllosilicates were studied under batch kinetic and different solution conditions to investigate the effect of charge density of the substrates on CP removal from solution. The CP removal by Na-montmorillonite was instantaneous, with a very large rate constant and a fast rate, reaching a capacity of 0.64mmol/g, compared to its cation exchange capacity of 0.85mmolc/g. In contrast, CP removal by talc was 10 times lower at 0.06mmol/g. Stoichiometric desorption of exchangeable cations accompanying CP removal by Na-montmorillonite confirmed cation exchange as the dominant interaction mechanism. Solution pH had a minimal effect on CP removal by Na-montmorillonite until pH 11. On the contrary, a slight increase in CP removal by talc was observed as the solution pH increased, due to increased negative charges on the pH-dependent surfaces of talc. Interactions between CP and Na-montmorillonite occurred on both external and interlayer sites, resulting in a d-spacing expansion from 12.5Å to 15.2Å. In contrast, interactions between CP and talc were only limited to the external surfaces. It was the charge density that ultimately controlled the amount of CP removal by 2:1 phyllosilicates. Thus, montmorillonite offers a superior option for the removal of cationic drugs from aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantihistamines 3aaqueous solutions 3acation exchange 3acation exchange capacity 3adesorption 3aexchangeable cations 3ahypersensitivity 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3atalc1 aLiu, Liu1 aLi, Zhaohui1 aLiao, Libing1 aLiu, Meitang0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2012 May 15, v. 374, no. 1 p.218-225dElsevier Inc.x0021-97977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2012.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01950naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245002400170300001600194520097600210592002801186650001301214650001201227650001101239650001101250700001801261700001901279700003601298700001701334700002001351700002601371700001801397773009501415856008101510852000901591655001201600IND60110817320221118061956.0141109e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011081732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tim.2013.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBjarnsholt, Thomas14aThe in vivo biofilm  ap. 466-474.  aBacteria can grow and proliferate either as single, independent cells or organized in aggregates commonly referred to as biofilms. When bacteria succeed in forming a biofilm within the human host, the infection often becomes very resistant to treatment and can develop into a chronic state. Biofilms have been studied for decades using various in vitro models, but it remains debatable whether such in vitro biofilms actually resemble in vivo biofilms in chronic infections. In vivo biofilms share several structural characteristics that differ from most in vitro biofilms. Additionally, the in vivo experimental time span and presence of host defenses differ from chronic infections and the chemical microenvironment of both in vivo and in vitro biofilms is seldom taken into account. In this review, we discuss why the current in vitro models of biofilms might be limited for describing infectious biofilms, and we suggest new strategies for improving this discrepancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3ahumans 3amodels1 aAlhede, Maria1 aAlhede, Morten1 aEickhardt-Sørensen, Steffen R.1 aMoser, Claus1 aKühl, Michael,1 aJensen, Peter Østrup1 aHøiby, Niels0 tTrends in microbiology.g2013 Sept., v. 21, no. 9 p.466-474dElsevier Ltdx0966-842X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2013.06.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245006800168300001800236520130600254592002801560650001601588650001701604650002201621650001701643650001101660650000901671650001801680650001901698650001501717650002601732650002101758650001601779700002501795700001501820773008401835856008501919990002302004852000902027655001202036IND60105782220221121012500.0141108e20130524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010578222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymer.2013.03.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaskan, Tuba10aTough interpenetrating Pluronic F127/polyacrylic acid hydrogels  ap. 2979-2987.  aTough interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels with pH- and temperature sensitivity were prepared by crosslinking copolymerization of acrylic acid (AAc) and N,N′-methylenebis(acrylamide) in 20 w/v% aqueous solutions of F127 (PEO₉₉-PPO₆₅-PEO₉₉). The presence of F127 within the gel network slightly decreases the elastic modulus while the loss factor significantly increases, revealing increasing energy dissipation in IPN hydrogels. Cyclic compression tests show large mechanical hysteresis in IPN hydrogels due to the reversible formation of ionic clusters and hydrophobic associations of F127 molecules. The dissipative mechanisms created by F127 lead to the improvement in the mechanical performance of IPN hydrogels when compared to the polyacrylic acid (PAAc) gel controls. PAAc hydrogel formed at 10% AAc fractures under a compression of 0.2 MPa at 78% strain, while the corresponding IPN hydrogel sustains up to 7 MPa compressions at 98% strain, leading to an increase of toughness from 31 to 335 kJ/m³. IPN hydrogels subjected to the heating–cooling cycles between below and above the micellization temperature of F127 show characteristic features of F127 solutions, i.e., increase of the dynamic moduli on raising the temperature, and thermal hysteresis behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aacrylic acid 3aaqueous solutions 3acrosslinking 3aenergy 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3ahysteresis 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolyacrylic acid 3atemperature1 aTuncaboylu, Deniz C.1 aOkay, Oguz0 tPolymer.g2013 May 24, v. 54, no. 12 p.2979-2987dElsevier Ltdx0032-38617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymer.2013.03.0663Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245014300176300001800319520145700337592002801794650001401822650001801836650001301854650001101867650001601878650001401894700001701908700002201925700002201947773008501969856008902054990002302143852000902166655001202175IND60104271220221119132619.0141107e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010427122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.measurement.2012.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchena, Emiliano10aLinearity dependence on oxygen fraction and gas temperature of a novel Fleisch pneumotachograph for neonatal ventilation at low flow rates  ap. 2064-2071.  aFleisch pneumotachograph response is influenced by gas composition and temperature. Literature analysis shows that the influence of gas properties on the relationship between pressure drop and volumetric flow rate has not been widely investigated from the theoretical standpoint. We fit data reported in literature by multiple linear regression, with the aim to obtain an equation in which the dynamic viscosity of a gas mixture, mainly composed by nitrogen and oxygen, is directly related with gas temperature and oxygen fraction. A low dead space (2mL) Fleisch pneumotachograph was designed and realized for neonatal ventilation, with linear range from −4Lmin⁻¹ to +4Lmin⁻¹. The theoretical model, considering gas dynamic viscosity dependence on temperature and oxygen fraction, is presented and experimentally validated by varying gas temperature (299–310K) and oxygen fraction (21–100%) within the limit conditions for the specific application. Oxygen fraction resulted the most influent factor on gas viscosity and, therefore, on the pneumotachograph response. In the worst case, the maximum variation of gas oxygen fraction produced a measurement shift of about 1Lmin⁻¹, i.e., the 25% of full scale output. The introduction of a correction based on the proposed model allows to reduce the linearity shift, becoming lower than 6%, and may also reduce the need of frequent calibrations due to gas composition and temperature changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3alinear models 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aLupi, Giulia1 aCecchini, Stefano1 aSilvestri, Sergio0 tMeasurement.g2012 Oct., v. 45, no. 8 p.2064-2071dElsevier Ltdx0263-22417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.measurement.2012.05.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002000190245007500210300001600285520102700301592002801328650001701356650001901373650001101392650001501403650001401418650002001432650002201452650002801474650001001502650001201512650001101524650001601535650001101551650001801562650001501580650002301595700001801618700003201636700002001668773008501688856008301773990002301856852000901879655001201888IND60111377020221120235052.0141109e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011137702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2011.06.0262doi7 aPMC31636902pmcid7 a217832222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobert, Jacques10aWaterborne infectivity of the Ranavirus frog virus 3 in Xenopus laevis  ap. 410-417.  aRanaviruses like frog virus 3 (FV3) are responsible for emerging infectious diseases spreading worldwide to fish, amphibian and reptilian species. We have developed, in Xenopus laevis, an experimental model to investigate viral transmission. We show that FV3 released in water by immunocompromised infected adults can infect adult and larval stages of Xenopus within 3h of exposure. Time course of virus load and viral transcription in different tissues suggests that early waterborne FV3 infection through the digestive tract leads to dissemination in the kidney. Finally, a fraction of adult macrophages becomes infected following exposure to waterborne FV3 as visualized by fluorescence microscopy using macrophage- and FV3-specific antibodies. Little cytopathicity and apoptosis were detected in infected macrophages, which is consistent with our proposition that macrophages are permissive to FV3. These data highlight the efficiency of FV3 infectivity by the water route and the ability of FV3 to adapt to its hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrog virus 3 3aXenopus laevis 3aadults 3aantibodies 3aapoptosis 3adigestive tract 3aemerging diseases 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahosts 3akidneys 3alarvae 3amacrophages 3amodels 3apathogenicity 3aviral load 3avirus transmission1 aGeorge, Erica1 aDe Jesús Andino, Francisco1 aChen, Guangchun0 tVirology.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 417, no. 2 p.410-417dElsevier Inc.x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2011.06.0263Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01865naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012000166300001300286520083600299592002801135650001201163650001401175650003001189650001901219650001101238651002001249700001801269700001401287700001201301773009701313856008501410990002301495852000901518655001201527IND60101804820221122221012.0141106e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010180482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmarsys.2012.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Fuwen10aAnomalous oceanic characteristics in the South China Sea associated with the large-scale forcing during 2006–2009  ap. 9-18.  aSatellite observations of sea level anomalies (SLAs), sea surface temperature (SST) and surface winds are used to investigate the anomalous oceanic characteristics in the South China Sea (SCS) during the 2006–2009 ENSO events.

Areca nuts contain several alkaloids and tannins, of which arecoline is the most abundant and known to have several adverse effects in humans, specially an increased risk of oral cancer. On evaluating the effects of arecoline on the male endocrine physiology in Wistar rats, it was found that arecoline treatment led to an overall enlargement and increase in the wet weight of the prostate gland, and a two-fold increase in serum gonadotropin and testosterone levels. Since the prostate is a major target for testosterone, the consequences of arecoline consumption were studied specifically in the prostate gland. Arecoline treatment led to an increase in the number of rough endoplasmic reticulum and reduction of secretory vesicles, signifying a hyperactive state of the prostate. Increased expression of androgen receptors in response to arecoline allowed for enhanced effect of testosterone in the prostate of treated animals, which augmented cell proliferation, subsequently confirmed by an increase in the expression of Ki-67 protein. Cellular proliferation was also the outcome of concomitant over expression of the G₁-to-S cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin D1 and CDK4, both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Taken together, the findings provide the first evidence that regular use of arecoline may lead to prostatic hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and eventually to disorders associated with prostate enlargement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aandrogen receptors 3aarecoline 3abetel nut 3ablood serum 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3ahumans 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3amales 3amastication 3amouth neoplasms 3aprostate gland 3arats 3aregulatory proteins 3arisk 3arough endoplasmic reticulum 3asecretory granules 3atannins 3atestosterone 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aChatterjee, Aniruddha1 aMondal, Anushree1 aMaiti, Bishwa Ranjan1 aChatterji, Urmi0 tToxicology and applied pharmacology.g2011 Sept. 1, v. 255, no. 2 p.160-168dElsevier Inc.x0041-008X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2011.06.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010200170300001400272520182000286592002802106650001302134650002502147650001502172650001602187650001502203650001402218650004102232650004302273650001502316650001202331650001602343650001502359650001502374650000902389650002702398700001602425700001902441700002402460700001802484700002002502700001802522700002202540700002102562773009902583856008402682990002302766852000902789655001202798IND60110580920221116142545.0141109e20110530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011058092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirosawa, Naoko10aEffect of DDVP on urinary excretion levels of pyrethroid metabolite 3-phenoxybenzoic acid in rats  ap. 28-32.  aPyrethroid insecticide (PYR) is used worldwide in agriculture and for indoor extermination of harmful insects. Urinary PYR metabolites (e.g. 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 3PBA) have been used as the most sensitive biomarker for environmental PYR exposure since the late 1990s. In this study, we examined the effect of organophosphorus insecticide (OP) dichlorvos (DDVP) on excretion levels of urinary cis-permethrin-derived 3PBA in rats. Concentration of urinary 3PBA and cis-permethrin in plasma was monitored using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography after cis-permethrin injection (20mg/kg) via the tail vein of rats pretreated intraperitoneally with DDVP (low dose, 0.3mg/kg; high dose, 1.5mg/kg). The amount of urinary 3PBA excretion over 48h after cis-permethrin administration in control was 21.5±5.1μg (mean±S.D.). In the low- and high-dose DDVP groups, the amounts of urinary 3PBA excretion were decreased to 81.1% (17.4±2.7μg) and 70.3% (15.1±2.6μg) of control, respectively. The plasma concentrations of cis-permethrin-derived 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol (3PBAlc), which is a metabolite derived following hydrolysis of cis-permethrin, in high-dose DDVP group (0.18±0.01μg) were significantly lower than in control (0.23±0.03μg) 1h after cis-permethrin injection. Both in the control and high-dose DDVP group, no differences were observed in the excretion levels of urinary 3PBA after injection of 3PBAlc (25mg/kg, i.v.). These results suggested that the effect of DDVP on the amount of urinary 3PBA excretion was caused by the DDVP-induced modification of the cis-permethrin metabolic pathway. In conclusion, the possible decrease in urinary excretion level of 3PBA due to co-exposure to OPs should be considered in the biological monitoring of PYR exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abiochemical pathways 3abiomarkers 3acaudal vein 3adichlorvos 3aexcretion 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysis 3ainsects 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3apyrethrins 3arats 3atumor necrosis factors1 aUeyama, Jun1 aKondo, Takaaki1 aKamijima, Michihiro1 aTakagi, Kenji1 aFujinaka, Sanae1 aHirate, Ayaka1 aHasegawa, Takaaki1 aWakusawa, Shinya0 tToxicology letters.g2011 May 30, v. 203, no. 1 p.28-32dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-42747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxlet.2011.02.0163Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009400166300001900260520164600279592002801925650001101953650001001964650002001974650001401994650001302008650002802021650001702049650002002066650001002086650002002096650002102116650001802137650001402155650001702169650001502186650001402201700001802215700002002233700002102253700002102274700001602295700002202311700001902333700002302352700001902375700003302394700002102427700002302448710002502471773012102496856008202617990002302699852000902722655001202731IND60100194220221121064038.0141105e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010019422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaci.2012.04.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuchs, Oliver10aFarming environments and childhood atopy, wheeze, lung function, and exhaled nitric oxide  ap. 382-388.e6.  aBACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated that children raised on farms are protected from asthma and allergies. It is unknown whether the farming effect is solely mediated by atopy or also affects nonatopic wheeze phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to study the farm effect on wheeze phenotypes and objective markers, such as lung function and exhaled nitric oxide, and their interrelation with atopy in children. METHODS: The GABRIEL Advanced Studies are cross-sectional, multiphase, population-based surveys of the farm effect on asthma and allergic disease in children aged 6 to 12 years. Detailed data on wheeze, farming exposure, and IgE levels were collected from a random sample of 8023 children stratified for farm exposure. Of those, another random subsample of 858 children was invited for spirometry, including bronchodilator tests and exhaled nitric oxide measurements. RESULTS: We found effects of exposure to farming environments on the prevalence and degree of atopy, on the prevalence of transient wheeze (adjusted odds ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.96), and on the prevalence of current wheeze among nonatopic subjects (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.32-0.63). There was no farm effect on lung function and exhaled nitric oxide levels in the general study population. CONCLUSIONS: Children living on farms are protected against wheeze independently of atopy. This farm effect is not attributable to improved airway size and lung mechanics. These findings imply as yet unknown protective mechanisms. They might include alterations of immune response and susceptibility to triggers of wheeze, such as viral infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasthma 3aatopy 3abronchodilators 3achildhood 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3afarm surveys 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin E 3alung function 3amechanics 3anitric oxide 3aodds ratio 3aphenotype1 aGenuneit, Jon1 aLatzin, Philipp1 aBüchele, Gisela1 aHorak, Elisabeth1 aLoss, Georg1 aSozanska, Barbara1 aWeber, Juliane1 aBoznanski, Andrzej1 aHeederik, Dick1 aBraun-Fahrländer, Charlotte1 aFrey, U.q(Urs),1 aMutius, Erika von,2 aGABRIELA Study Group0 tThe Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.g2012 Aug., v. 130, no. 2 p.382-388.e6dMosby, Inc.x0091-67497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2012.04.0493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245013400172300001500306520154400321592002801865650001201893650002401905650001901929650002501948650001301973650001701986650001702003650001302020650000902033650001502042700002002057700002002077700002902097700001902126700002202145700002102167700001902188700001802207700002202225773007302247856008602320852000902406655001202415IND60105472020221123041638.0141108e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010547202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2012.12.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOztuzcu, Serdar10aThr21Met (T21M) but not Ser89Asn (S89N) polymorphisms of the urotensin-II (UTS-II) gene are associated with Behcet's disease (BD)  ap. 97-100.  aBehcet's disease (BD) is multisytemic vasculitis or chronic inflammation that may lead to various autoimmune and autoinflammatory syndromes. Exact etiopathogenesis of BD has not been clarified yet. Urotensin II (UTS-II) is predominantly a vasoactive peptide and Thr21Met polymorphism in UTS-II gene was proved to increasing in some autoimmune diseases. Considering these, our objective was to evaluate whether two UTS-II gene polymorphisms (Thr21Met and Ser89Asn) were responsible in genetic susceptibility to BD in a Turkish population. A total of 198 patients with BD and 275 healthy controls were enrolled. We analyzed the genotype and allele frequencies of two UTS-II gene polymorphisms, Thr21Met and Ser89Asn, in BD patients and in controls. We found that Thr21Met but not Ser89Asn polymorphisms of the UTS-II gene were markedly associated with the risk of developing BD (p<0.0001), The Met21Met genotype was less common among BD patients (6.1% in patients vs. 17.1% in controls; p<0.0001). There was also an increase in the 21Thr allele (54.8% in BD patients vs. 43.8% in controls) and a decrease in 21Met allele frequencies (45.2% in controls vs. 56.2% in patients) in the BD groups (p<0.0044). To the best of our knowledge, for the first time in the literature, our study claims that there is an association between Thr21Met, and not between Ser89Asn polymorphisms in the UTS-II gene and BD. These results put a new player to the field of undiscovered pathogenesis of BD and hopefully provide new insights to the treatment options.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aautoimmune diseases 3agene frequency 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 3ainflammation 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3arisk 3avasculitis1 aUlasli, Mustafa1 aPehlivan, Yavuz1 aÇevik, Muhammer Özgür1 aCengiz, Beyhan1 aGogebakan, Bulent1 aIgci, Yusuf Ziya1 aOkumuş, Seydi1 aArslan, Ahmet1 aOnat, Ahmet Mesut0 tPeptides.g2013 Apr., v. 42 p.97-100dElsevier Inc.x0196-97817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2012.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245012000164300001600284520111100300592002801411650002001439650002101459650001101480650001301491650001701504650001401521650002401535650001301559700002601572700002201598700001801620700002401638700002201662773007601684856008501760852000901845655001201854IND60109157720221119001733.0141109e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010915772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Wen10aDual fluorescence and electrochemical detection of the organophosphorus pesticides—Ethion, malathion and fenthion  ap. 276-283.  aOrganophosphorus (OP) based pesticides are known powerful inhibitors of cholinesterases, thus the toxicity of this class of compounds causes serious environmental and human health concerns. We report that benzodipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (BDPPZ) and 3,6-dimethylbenzodipyrido-[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (DM-BDPPZ) provide independent fluorescent and electrochemical signal transductions in the presence of the organophosphorus (OP) pesticides; fenthion, malathion and ethion. The presence of the methyl groups at the 3 and 6 positions in DM-BDPPZ was found to significantly influence the sensor performance. The difference in the fluorescence and electrochemical signals produced by the interaction of the sensor compound with each of the OP pesticides provides a means for differentiating between the three pesticides. Detection limits of 10⁻⁸M, 10⁻⁹ and 10⁻¹²M were obtained for fenthion, malathion and ethion, respectively. Due to the high sensitivity and ability to minimize false positives these new sensors will be useful for potential integration for future environmental use.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aethion 3afenthion 3afluorescence 3amalathion 3asensors (equipment) 3atoxicity1 aEngelman, Brigitte J.1 aHaywood, Tajay L.1 aBlok, Neil B.1 aBeaudoin, Daniel S.1 aObare, Sherine O.0 tTalanta.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 87 p.276-283dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2011.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008900172300001800261520052700279592002800806650002600834650001600860650001100876650001900887650001100906700002100917773011100938856008101049990002301130852000901153655001201162IND60104174720221119022854.0141107e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010417472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-Meca, Carlos14aThe variational principle in transformation optics engineering and some applications  ap. 1773-1779.  aTransformation optics specializes in the engineering of advanced optical devices, and in combination with differential geometry it allows to control electromagnetic fields with artificial media in an unprecedented manner.

This paper discloses a possibility of their alternative utilization as crude oil substitute via vegetable oil steam cracking to produce short alkenes to be used in polyolefins production industry. During thermal decomposition under conditions matching those of gas-oil steam cracking (short residence time, temperature over 800°C) vegetable oils form similar products as traditional crude-oil-based feedstocks. The yields of major pyrolysis products of various vegetable oils were determined using the apparatus employed previously to laboratory research of hydrocarbon pyrolysis and they were compared to yields obtained by cracking traditional feedstocks. Also the effects of hydrocarbon chain length and saturation of acyls forming the oils were analyzed in detail. The possibilities of processing vegetable oils by co-cracking in mixture with crude oil feedstocks are discussed and supported by experimental data.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3apetroleum 3arecycling 3avegetable oil 3aindustry 3asteam 3ayields 3acracking 3aesters 3apyrolysis 3abiodiesel 3afeedstocks 3arapeseed 3aalkenes 3aEurope 0araw materials1 aBělohlav, Zdeněk1 aŠmidrkal, Jan0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2012 Feb., v. 59 p.47-51dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01483naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003200152245011700184300001600301520056400317592002800881650002200909650002100931650001400952700002100966773010000987856008601087990002301173852000901196655001201205IND60102511920221120075150.0141106e20131105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010251192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2013.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConradie, Marrigje Marianne10aSolid state packing of [Rh(β-diketonato)(CO)₂] complexes.

It incorporates the credibility constrained programming, two-stage stochastic programming and interval programming within an optimization framework, so that uncertainties expressed as intervals, probabilistic and possibilistic distributions can be effectively communicated. The study area is the Xiangxi River Basin of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), the largest reservoir in China. The significant advantage of the ITSCCP water quality management model is that it can reflect the tradeoffs between the predefined economic targets and the associated environmental penalties, as well as the fuzziness of the pollution load capacities. Stable interval solutions can be obtained by using the two-step interactive solution algorithm. A spectrum of potential pollution abatement options with varied levels of system-failure risk can be generated. The resulting solutions show that the proposed method can provide scientific bases for water quality management and other environmental systems problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3apollution control 3apollution load 3arecycling 3arisk 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aCredibility 0aFuzzy 0aStochastic programming 0aOptimization modeling 0aWater quality management 0aThree Gorges Reservoir1 aHuang, Gordon1 aZhang, Yimei1 aLi, Yongping0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 Apr., v. 73 p.122-132dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02037naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013400168300001800302520096500320592002801285650001701313650001401330650002001344650001101364650002801375650001601403700002201419700001601441700001801457773011101475856008101586990002301667852000901690655001201699IND60104174820221119022543.0141107e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010417482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mcm.2011.11.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBru-Juanes, J.M.10aNormal goniometric values to guide decision-making in lower-extremity rotational problems using support vector machine techniques  ap. 1780-1787.  aTorsional analysis of the lower extremities has become an integral part of the decision-making process in treating neuromuscular problems. Solid knowledge of normal development of torsional relationships is essential for treating musculoskeletal problems. As a prerequisite, a normal reference, meaning an objective and quantitative standard of measurement, must be available for comparison prior to making a suitable decision. The aim of this paper is to update normal goniometric values that could be used as a reference for clinical analysis and to discover unknown compensatory mechanisms between the involved segments. A systematic and coherent database made from almost 900 measurements of different parameters has been studied using a process of support vector data description (SVDD) to achieve our outlined targets. The aim is to produce updated decision-making support for clinicians working in the biomechanical exploration of the lower extremities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomechanics 3adatabases 3adecision making 3amodels 3asupport vector machines 3avector data1 aBru-Lázaro, J.M.1 aHerrera, M.1 aIzquierdo, J.0 tMathematical and computer modelling.g2013 Apr., v. 57, no. 7-8 p.1780-1787dElsevier Ltdx0895-71777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2011.11.0493Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01479naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007300168300001800241520049800259592002800757650002300785650002300808650002200831650001900853700002400872700001500896700002200911700001700933700002400950773008900974856008101063852000901144655001201153IND60109393120221120053549.0141109e20110729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010939312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2011.05.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIchinose, Wataru10aSynthesis and duplex formation of the reverse amidohelicene tetramer  ap. 5477-5486.  aThe reverse amidohelicene (P)-tetramer containing (P)-helicenediamine and m-phenylenedicarboxylate was synthesized.

In, different ions with the same 2+ charge, the ion concentration of water—water vapor transfer may be much different. This shows that the 2+ charge of different ions has different attractive force (hydration force). This different attractive force of the charge can be scaled with the relative energy or charge size from Gu's Function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aequations 3aionization 3aions 3atrace elements 3awater vapor0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g1997 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.186-191dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:J000001677x0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02850691  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150242007600167245006500243300001600308520178600324592002802110650002402138650002102162650002302183650001302206650002502219650002502244650002802269650000902297650001102306650001402317650001102331650001402342650001202356650001702368650001702385650002202402650001302424650002702437651001202464773009102476856008402567990002302651852000902674655001202683IND60105382020221120214620.0141108e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||fre||7 aIND6010538202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.patbio.2009.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhajaoui, M.14aLes leishmanioses humaines au Maroc : une diversité nosogéographique10aHuman leishmaniases in Morocco: A nosogeographical diversity  ap. 226-229.  aLeishmaniases in Morocco are endemic diseases. Three forms of leishmaniasis are reported, visceral leishmaniasis, cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania tropica and cutaneous lesions due to Leishmania major. Leishmania infantum, a common parasite inducing visceral leishmaniasis, was observed thereafter in cutaneous lesions. The first case of cutaneous leishmaniasis due to L. tropica was isolated since 1987. But, this parasite was shown to be more polymorphic with almost 8 zymodemes. However, these zymodemes are not all transmitted by Phlebotomus sergenti and not all isolated from human reservoir. Regarding the clinical aspect, cutaneous leishmaniasis with L. tropica is described as a single lesion starting as a nodule at the site of inoculation. A crust develops centrally which may fall away exposing an ulcer which heals gradually. The second cutaneous form is that caused by Leishmania major. It was known in villages located in the southern slopes of the Atlas Mountains. Clinically, the lesion is often severely inflamed and ulcerated and heals in 4–6 months. The epidemiologic cycle of this rural form, include Phlebotomus papatasi as the proven vector and a commensally rodent, Meriones shawi grandis as the reservoir. However, visceral leishmaniasis in Morocco has been known since 1921. It is especially located in the North. The responsible parasite is L. infantum MON 1. Two species of the sand fly are involved in the transmission of this form, P. ariasi and P. perniciosus. In infected man, the clinical signs are non-tender splenomegaly, with or without hepatomegaly, wasting and pallor of mucous membranes. Even though L. infantum MON1 is responsible of the disease, some canine cases were reported to be caused by Leishmania tropica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania infantum 3aLeishmania major 3aLeishmania tropica 3aMeriones 3aPhlebotomus papatasi 3aPhlebotomus sergenti 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3adogs 3ahumans 3amountains 3amucosa 3aparasites 3arodents 3askin lesions 3asplenomegaly 3atopographic slope 3avillages 3avisceral leishmaniasis 3aMorocco0 tPathologie biologie.g2011 Aug., v. 59, no. 4 p.226-229dElsevier SASx0369-81147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patbio.2009.09.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003700113040001800150100001700168245010800185300001800293520139400311592002801705650001301733650001601746650001501762650001301777650001301790650001501803650002401818650002101842650001901863650002201882650002801904650001801932650001401950650001301964650001501977650005101992650006502043650005102108650001102159650002802170650004102198650006002239650004502299650002402344650007702368700002502445700002202470700002402492700001802516700002102534700001902555773010002574856008302674852000902757655001202766IND60103159120221117231025.0141106e20111118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010315912DNAL7 a218677832pmid7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2011.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRylev, Mette10aProteomic and immunoproteomic analysis of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans JP2 clone strain HK1651  ap. 2972-2985.  aThe proteome of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans HK1651 (JP2 clone) and immunoreactive antigens were studied by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS), and 2D immunoblotting. The highly leukotoxic JP2 clone of A. actinomycetemcomitans is strongly associated with aggressive periodontitis (AgP) in adolescents of North-West African descent and the pathogenicity of this bacterium is of major interest. Hence, we developed a comprehensive 2D proteome reference map of A. actinomycetemcomitans proteins with 167 identified spots representing 114 different proteins of which 15 were outer membrane proteins. To unravel immunoreactive antigens, we applied 2D-gel and subsequent immunoblotting analyses using sera from five individuals with A. actinomycetemcomitans infections and one healthy control. The analysis revealed 32 immunoreactive proteins. Antibodies to two outer membrane proteins, YaeT (85kDa) and Omp39 (39kDa), not previously described as immunoreactive, were found only in subjects with current or previous A. actinomycetemcomitans JP2 infection. Further proteome-based studies of A. actinomycetemcomitans combined with analyses of the humoral immune response and targeted against outer membrane proteins may provide important insight into the host relationship of this important pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfricans 3aadolescents 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3abacteria 3adesorption 3agel electrophoresis 3ahumoral immunity 3aimmunoblotting 3amass spectrometry 3aouter membrane proteins 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aproteome 3aproteomics 2aAntigens, Bacterialxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensionalxmethods 2aHumans 2aImmunoblottingxmethods 2aImmunosuppressive Agentsxmetabolism 2aPasteurellaceaeximmunologyxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aPeriodontitisximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aProteomicsxmethods 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionizationxmethods1 aAbduljabar, Ahmed B.1 aReinholdt, Jesper1 aEnnibi, Oum-Keltoum1 aHaubek, Dorte1 aBirkelund, Svend1 aKilian, Mogens0 tJournal of proteomics.g2011 Nov. 18, v. 74, no. 12 p.2972-2985dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2011.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245007400178300001600252520138600268592002801654650001901682650004401701650001701745650001501762650001501777650002201792650003501814650001201849650001601861650001601877650001201893650000901905650000901914650000701923650002601930650001001956650002301966650001701989700002902006700003602035700003602071700002502107773009402132856008402226990002302310852000902333655001202342IND60104478820221120083923.0141107e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010447882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.microc.2010.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Walter N.L.10aBiosorption of Pb(II) and Cd(II) ions by Agave sisalana (sisal fiber)  ap. 269-273.  aThe present work proposes the use of Agave sisalana (sisal fiber) as an natural adsorbent for ions Pb(II) and Cd(II) biosorption from natural waters. The flame atomic absorption spectrometry was used for quantitative determination and study of the ions Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption on the solid phase. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT IR) was used to investigate the sisal structure and the specific BET surface area was analyzed. The biosorption potential of sisal as biosorbent for the removal of the ions Pb(II) and Cd(II) from aqueous solution was investigate considering the followings parameters: pH, biomass amount and contact time. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms were used to evaluate adsorption behavior of the ions on this solid phase. The results showed that sisal has a surface area to adsorption of 0.0233m²g⁻¹, and the OH and CO functional groups are the main involved in the biosorption. The best interpretation for the experimental data was given by Freundlich isotherm that proposes a monolayer sorption with a heterogeneous energetic distribution of active sites, accompanied by interactions between sorbed molecules. The maximum monolayer biosorption capacity was found to be 1.85mgg⁻¹ for Cd (II) and 1.34mgg⁻¹ for Pb (II) at pH 7 and 296K. This phase solid can be used for biosorption of cadmium and lead in polluted natural waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave sisalana 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactive sites 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abiomass 3abiosorbents 3abiosorption 3acadmium 3aions 3alead 3apH 3aquantitative analysis 3asisal 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area1 aCavalcante, Dannuza Dias1 ada Silva, Erik Galvão Paranhos1 adas Virgens, Cesário Francisco1 aDias, Fabio de Souza0 tMicrochemical Journal.g2011 Mar., v. 97, no. 2 p.269-273dElsevier B.V.x0026-265X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.microc.2010.09.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01772naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245009800173300001600271520082700287592002801114650001701142650001001159650001601169700003401185700002001219700002001239773009801259856008101357990002301438852000901461655001201470IND60108542520221117034409.0141108e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010854252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeón-Luis, Sergio F.10aTemperature sensor based on the Er³⁺ green upconverted emission in a fluorotellurite glass  ap. 208-213.  aThe temperature dependence of the green upconverted emission from the two thermally coupled ²H₁₁/₂ and ⁴S₃/₂ levels of the Er³⁺ ion in a fluorotellurite glass has been analyzed as a function of the optically active ion concentration in order to check its availability as a temperature sensor. The infrared-to-green upconverted emission have been observed by the naked eyes after a cw laser diode excitation at 800nm. The fluorescence intensity ratio between the thermally coupled emitting levels as well as the temperature sensitivity has been experimentally obtained up to 540K. A better behaviour as a temperature sensor has been obtained for the less Er³⁺ concentrated glass with a maximum sensitivity of 54×10⁻⁴K⁻¹ at 540K, one of the highest found in rare-earth doped transparent materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3aglass 3atemperature1 aRodríguez-Mendoza, Ulises R.1 aLalla, Emmanuel1 aLavín, Víctor0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 158, no. 1 p.208-213dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02283naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245006800169300001600237500001500253520111800268592002801386650001101414650002201425650001101447650001501458650001701473650000901490650001001499650001601509650001101525650001501536653000901551700001801560700002301578700002601601700002301627773009801650856008101748990002301829852000901852655001201861IND60108542620221117034416.0141108e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010854262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarja, Beatriz C.10aLuminescent Eu(III) hybrid sensors for in situ copper detection  ap. 214-222.  a2019-12-04  aIn this work we used the sol–gel technique to develop luminescent Eu(III) transparent films deposited on glass slides to build for sensor devices capable of monitoring transition metal ions in aqueous solutions. The films were obtained from a bis(trialkoxysilyl) organic precursor synthesized from the amide of the 2,6-pyridinedicarboxylic acid (DPA) with aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in the presence or absence of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant as templating agent and triethylethoxysilane (TEOS) as crosslinker. These sensor devices were used to perform in situ quenching experiments by Cu(II), Fe(III), Co(II) and Ni(II) ions. The results indicate that the templated films allow the detection and quantification of these metals down to ppb levels by means of the values of the Stern–Volmer constants. In particular, it was shown that Cu(II) acts as an extremely efficient quencher (KSV=3.5×10⁵M⁻¹) when compared with the results obtained for the other metals, opening the possibility to use these devices as potential Cu(II) sensors for actual applications in aqueous media.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3aaqueous solutions 3acopper 3amonitoring 3aluminescence 3airon 3aglass 3asurfactants 3anickel 3ametal ions 0aions1 aBari, Sara E.1 aMarchi, M.

In São Paulo Municipality, Brazil, the Sorting and Composting Waste Treatment Plant (SCWTP) is suggested as an appropriated way to manage the 14,000Mg of USW generated daily by 11 million inhabitants in 2010. The argument is that recovering materials from USW is aligned to sustainable development concept, however there is a lack of a deeper sustainability assessment, raising doubts about the benefits received by society on recovering materials. In this sense, emergy accounting (spelled with “m”) suggests to be a good alternative when assessing these benefits under a global scale. The aim of this work is to assess the São Paulo's SCWTP using Emergy Accounting. Results shown that currently there is an emergy balance by sorting paper (ratio of recovered by invested emergy of 0.97), and an emergy benefit for iron&steel (2.65), plastic (2.91) and compost (2.57). However, there is an emergy cost by sorting glass (0.23) and aluminum (0.20). A plausible scenario by increasing the recovering efficiency of glass from current 11.6% to 52.9%, and aluminum from 4.7% to 24.7% (both in wet weight), results in an emergy benefit for all materials. The Net Emergy Benefit indicates the SCWTP as a better alternative when the total net emergy return to society is the focus, because while it makes available about 3.13E+14seJ/Mg of treated USW, the landfills have an average emergy deficit of −3.39E+13seJ, indicating that landfill uses more emergy than makes available. Results indicates that SCWTP must receive political incentives due to its good emergy performance and others social beneficial aspects, however, aiming to improve the overall performance, each individual citizen must collaborate with waste reduction and the separation of non-organic material from the organic ones at origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acomposting 3acomposts 3aemergy 3aglass 3airon 3alandfills 3apaper 3apolitics 3arecycling 3asociety 3asolid wastes 3asustainable development 3awaste reduction 3awaste treatment 3aBrazil 0aComposting 0aEmergy accounting 0aUrban solid waste 0aRecycling1 aAlmeida, Cecília M.V.B.1 aBonilla, Silvia H.1 aSacomano, José B.1 aGiannetti, Biagio F.0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2013 Apr., v. 73 p.143-155dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245012500166300001600291520126300307592002801570650001501598650001501613650001201628650001401640650001701654650001001671650000901681650001101690650001901701650001801720650001701738650001101755700001901766700001701785700001901802700001101821773010001832856008501932852000902017655001202026IND60101413020221117222048.0141106e20111230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010141302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing10aHydrous ferric oxide–resin nanocomposites of tunable structure for arsenite removal: Effect of the host pore structure  ap. 241-246.  aHydrous ferric oxide (HFO) loaded hybrid sorbents are considered to be excellent materials for arsenic removal from water. However, role of the host pore structure in the performance of the composites is still unclear. In the current study five HFO nanocomposites of similar HFO loadings (3.9–5.3% in Fe mass) were fabricated for arsenite removal, using self-synthesized polystyrene (PS) resins of similar particle sizes but different pore structures as hosts. Structure analysis demonstrated that the particle size of HFO aggregates decreased with decreasing pore size of PS. The adsorption of arsenite onto the nanocomposites with PS of smaller average pore size achieved equilibrium faster. Analysis of kinetic data with the intraparticle diffusion model demonstrated that arsenite adsorption onto PS–HFO nanocomposites with larger HFO particles was controlled by intraparticle diffusion whereas the limitation caused by intraparticle diffusion was weakened as the particle size of HFO decreased. The adsorption capacity of the hybrid adsorbents increased with decreased pore size of PS. These results indicated that the pore structure of the support materials would play a significant role in the performance of nanoparticle-loaded porous adsorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3aarsenites 3aferric oxide 3ahosts 3airon 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3aparticle size 3apolystyrenes 3aresins1 aZhang, Shujuan1 aPan, Bingcai1 aZhang, Weiming1 aLv, Lu0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2011 Dec. 30, v. 198 p.241-246dElsevier B.V.x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01351naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245014100170300001800311520041000329592002800739650002300767650002300790650001400813650001200827650001300839700002000852773009600872856008400968852000901052655001201061IND60109783020221117163330.0141109e20110706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010978302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2011.04.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValente, Sergio10aFacile synthesis of 4-acetyl-coumarins, -thiocoumarin and -quinolin-2(1H)-one via very high α-regioselective Heck coupling on tosylates  ap. 3429-3432.  aAn efficient synthesis of a series of methyl ketones at the C4 position of coumarins, coumarin-containing heterocycles and analogous scaffolds is reported via very high α-regioselective Heck coupling using tosylates and in very high yields.

The epidemic has waned significantly since its most recent peak in 2001. A strain-specific vaccine, MeNZB, was introduced to control the epidemic in 2004, achieving 81% coverage of people under the age of 20. The vaccine was rolled out in a staged manner allowing the comparison of disease rates in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals in each year. Vaccine effectiveness in people aged under 20 years is estimated using a Poisson regression model in the years 2001–2008, including adjustments for year, season, age, ethnicity, region and socioeconomic status. Further analyses investigate the dose response relationship, waning of the vaccine effect after one year, and cross-protection against other strains of meningococcal disease. The primary analysis estimates MeNZB vaccine effectiveness to be 77% (95% CI 62–85) after 3 doses and a mean follow-up time of 3.2 years. There is evidence for a protective effect after 2 doses 47% (95% CI 16–67), and no evidence for a waning of effectiveness after one year. Simultaneous modelling of invasive pneumococcal disease and epidemic strain meningococcal B suggests a degree of residual confounding that reduces the effectiveness estimate to 68%. There is evidence for some cross-protection of MeNZB against non-epidemic strains. The MeNZB vaccine was effective against the New Zealand epidemic strain of meningococcal B disease. Between July 2004 and December 2008 an estimated 210 epidemic strain cases (95% CI 100–380), six deaths and 15–30 cases of severe sequelae were avoided in New Zealand due to the introduction of the MeNZB vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplications (disease) 3adose response 3amodels 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aprotective effect 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic status 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aNew Zealand1 aGalloway, Yvonne1 aMcNicholas, Anne1 aO’Hallahan, Jane0 tVaccine.g2011 Sept. 16, v. 29, no. 40 p.7100-7106dElsevier Ltdx0264-410X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.06.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245006700211300001600278520148000294592002801774650002701802650001201829650003801841650001101879650002101890650001601911650001201927650001801939650001901957650001701976650001501993650003302008650000902041650002602050650002202076650001202098650001402110650001302124650003002137700001702167700001802184700001602202700002202218700002302240700002202263700002502285700002602310700002202336773010702358856008302465990002302548852000902571655001202580IND60104802420221122044313.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010480242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.05.0152doi7 aPMC31967632pmcid7 a216847882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngelstad, Holly10aLarge contiguous gene deletions in Sjögren–Larsson syndrome  ap. 356-361.  aSjögren–Larsson syndrome (SLS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity and mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene for fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of fatty aldehyde to fatty acid. More than 70 mutations have been identified in SLS patients, including small deletions or insertions, missense mutations, splicing defects and complex nucleotide changes. We now describe 2 SLS patients whose disease is caused by large contiguous gene deletions of the ALDH3A2 locus on 17p11.2. The deletions were defined using long distance inverse PCR and microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization. A 24-year-old SLS female was homozygous for a 352-kb deletion involving ALDH3A2 and 4 contiguous genes including ALDH3A1, which codes for the major soluble protein in cornea. Although lacking corneal disease, she showed severe symptoms of SLS with uncommon deterioration in oral motor function and loss of ambulation. The other 19-month-old female patient was a compound heterozygote for a 1.44-Mb contiguous gene deletion and a missense mutation (c.407C>T, P136L) in ALDH3A2. These studies suggest that large gene deletions may account for up to 5% of the mutant alleles in SLS. Geneticists should consider the possibility of compound heterozygosity for large deletions in patients with SLS and other inborn errors of metabolism, which has implications for carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aalleles 3acomparative genomic hybridization 3acornea 3acorneal diseases 3afatty acids 3afemales 3agene deletion 3aheterozygosity 3ahomozygosity 3aichthyosis 3ainherited metabolic diseases 3aloci 3amicroarray technology 3amissense mutation 3amutants 3aoxidation 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction1 aCarney, Gael1 aS'Aulis, Dana1 aRise, Janae1 aSanger, Warren G.1 aRudd, M.

The conventional interfacial polymerization method is used to synthesize a sensitive polypyrrole membrane, which shows relatively low roughness and high reflectivity. In general the changes in electrical properties of conductive polymers are explored in sensing applications, however their optical properties have been less explored. In the present study, we evaluate the optical properties of PPy and transfer on the end face of polymer optical fiber (POF) for the detection of VOCs. The change in the reflected optical signal from PPy upon interaction with the VOCs is systematically evaluated. The fabricated PPy FORS shows the excellent sensitivity to the VOCs under test with the detection limit up to 1ppm.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aelectrical properties 3afiber optics 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3areflectance 3aroughness 3avolatile organic compounds1 aKulakarṇī, Atula,1 aZhang, Hang1 aKim, Hojoong1 aJiang, Dong1 aKim, Taesung0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 158, no. 1 p.223-228dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.06.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007700171300001600248520087300264592002801137650001401165650001501179650001501194650001701209650001601226650001601242650001901258650002001277650001101297700002201308700002201330773007601352856008501428852000901513655001201522IND60109158020221119001930.0141109e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010915802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2011.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHikal, Walid M.10aThermo-optical determination of vapor pressures of TNT and RDX nanofilms  ap. 290-294.  aAccurate thermodynamic parameters of thin films of explosives are important for understanding their behavior in the nanometer scale as well as in standoff detection. Using UV-absorbance spectroscopy technique, accurate thermodynamic parameters such as activation energies of sublimation, sublimation rates, and vapor pressures of the explosives cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) were determined. The values of these parameters are in excellent agreement with those reported using traditional experiments based on gravimetry. In terms of the Clapeyron equation, the dependence of RDX and TNT vapor pressures on temperature can be described by the relations LnP (Pa)=39.6−15459/T (K) and LnP (Pa)=34.9−12058/T (K), respectively.

This QRA process comprises: (a) determination of a no-expected-sensitisation-induction-level (NESIL), (b) incorporation of sensitization-assessment-factors (SAFs) reflecting variations between subjects, product use patterns and matrices, and (c) estimation of consumer-exposure-level (CEL). Based on these elements an acceptable-exposure-level (AEL) can be calculated by dividing the NESIL of the product by individual SAFs. Finally, the AEL is compared with the CEL to judge about risks to human health. We propose a simplified approach to risk assessment of hair dye ingredients by making use of precise experimental product exposure data. This data set provides firmly established dose/unit area concentrations under relevant consumer use conditions referred to as the measured-exposure-level (MEL). For that reason a direct comparison is possible between the NESIL with the MEL as a proof-of-concept quantification of the risk of skin sensitization. This is illustrated here by reference to two specific hair dye ingredients p-phenylenediamine and resorcinol. Comparison of these robust and toxicologically relevant values is therefore considered an improvement versus a hazard-based classification of hair dye ingredients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergens 3adata collection 3ahuman health 3aingredients 3alocal lymph node assay 3amodels 3aquantitative risk assessment 3aresorcinol 3arisk1 aDiepgen, Thomas L.1 aKrasteva, Maya1 aSchlatter, Harald1 aNicolas, Jean-Francois1 aBlömeke, Brunhilde1 aCoenraads, Pieter Jan1 aSchnuch, Axel1 aTaylor, James S.1 aPungier, Jacquemine1 aFautz, Rolf1 aFuchs, Anne1 aSchuh, Werner1 aGerberick, G.

Sterculia foetida is one of the possible non-edible feedstocks for biodiesel production. This paper explores and examines the potential biodiesel production from S. foetida. Besides, this study also aimed to optimize the biodiesel production parameters by using design of experiment (DOE). The parameters involved in the optimization process were the amount of catalyst, reaction temperature, agitation speed and reaction time. Crude S. foetida oil has high acid value which is 5.11mgKOH/g. Thus, two stage acid catalyst esterification and base transesterification methods are used to produce biodiesel from S. foetida. The optimum biodiesel conversion efficiency obtained was 93.55% by 1vol.% of sulfuric acid with 12:1 of methanol to oil ratio at 60°C and 1200rpm agitation rate for 3h. On the other hand, the transesterification process condition is 1wt.% sodium hydroxide catalyst with 12:1 methanol to oil at 55°C for 2.5h. The high viscosity (63.90mm²/s) of crude S. foetida oil was reduced to 3.96mm²/s after the transesterification process. Moreover, the properties of the produced S. foetida methyl esters and all the measured properties are within the limits of ASTM D 6751 and EN 14214 specifications. Therefore, S. foetida oil is one of the non-edible feedstocks for biodiesel production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSterculia foetida 3aacid value 3aagitation 3abiodiesel 3acatalysts 3aesterification 3aesters 3aexperimental design 3afeedstocks 3afossil fuels 3amethanol 3aoils 3asodium hydroxide 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3aviscosity1 aOng, H.C.1 aMasjuki, H.H.1 aMahlia, T.M.I.1 aChong, W.T.1 aYusaf, Talal F.0 tFuel.g2013 Sept., v. 111 p.478-484dElsevier Ltdx0016-23617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2013.03.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245008500176300001400261520157500275592002801850650001201878650001301890650001501903650000901918650001401927650001601941650001401957700002401971700002301995773010202018856008702120852000902207655001202216IND60108210520221121215805.0141108e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010821052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Hugo M.R.D.10aAre totally recycled hot mix asphalts a sustainable alternative for road paving?  ap. 38-48.  aThe recycling of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) helps road authorities to achieve their goal of a sustainable road transport system by reducing waste production and resources consumption. The environmental and economic benefits of using RAP in hot mix asphalt (HMA) applications could be pushed up to the limit, by producing totally recycled HMAs (100% RAP), but the performance of this alternative must be satisfactory. In fact, these mixtures could possibly present problems of workability and durability, higher binder aging and low fatigue cracking resistance. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine if totally recycled HMA mixtures could be a good solution for road paving, by evaluating the merit of some rejuvenator agents (commercial product; used engine oil) in improving the aged binders’ properties and the recycled mixture performance. Several binder samples were prepared with the mentioned rejuvenators and characterized (Pen, R&B and dynamic viscosity), in order to select the best rejuvenator contents. The production temperatures of the corresponding recycled mixtures were evaluated based on their workability. Totally recycled HMAs were produced with the best previously observed combinations, and their performance (water sensitivity, rutting resistance, stiffness, fatigue resistance, binder aging) was assessed. The main conclusion of this study is that totally recycled HMAs can be a good alternative for road paving, especially if rejuvenator agents are used to reduce their production temperature and to improve their performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abitumen 3acracking 3adurability 3aoils 3arecycling 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aOliveira, Joel R.M.1 aJesus, Carlos M.G.0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2012 Mar., v. 60 p.38-48dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2011.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245009800179300001600277520126700293592002801560650002001588650001401608650001701622650004201639650002401681650000901705650002401714700002201738700001901760773009901779856008501878990002301963852000901986655001201995IND60100052720221120155912.0141105e20130910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010005272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeuchi-Takahashi, Yuri10aEvaluation of matrix type mucoadhesive tablets containing indomethacin for buccal application  ap. 454-461.  aNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are administered for pain relief from oral mucositis. However, the systemic administration of NSAIDs is limited due to systemic side effects. To avoid these side effects and treat local lesions effectively, a matrix type mucoadhesive tablet was developed. A mixture of hard fat, ethylcellulose (EC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used as a matrix base, and indomethacin (IMC) was used as the principal agent. In tablets consisting of hard fat, EC and IMC, the drug release was sustained. In tablets consisting of hard fat, EC, considerable amounts of PEG and IMC, the drug release was relatively increased and IMC existed as the molecular phase or in an amorphous state. The in vitro adhesive force of the tablets consisting of hard fat, EC, considerable amounts of PEG and IMC was significantly increased as compared with the tablets consisting of hard fat and IMC. A significantly high tissue concentration and significantly low plasma concentration were observed after buccal administration of this matrix type mucoadhesive tablet as compared with that after oral administration of IMC. Thus, the matrix type mucoadhesive tablet has good potential as a preparation for the treatment of pain due to oral aphtha.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aanalgesia 3aindomethacin 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aoral administration 3apain 3apolyethylene glycol1 aSasatsu, Masanaho1 aOnishi, Hiraku0 tSensors and actuators.g2013 Sept. 10, v. 453, no. 2 p.454-461dElsevier B.V.x0378-51737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpharm.2013.06.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle07706naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245015600174300001300330520646800343592002806811650002706839650001106866650001606877650002306893650001406916650001106930650001506941650001106956650001306967650001706980650001606997650002207013650002307035650001407058773011607072856008807188990002307276852000907299655001207308IND60107291920221121065532.0141108e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010729192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao-feng, Pang14aThe properties of bio-energy transport and influence of structure nonuniformity and temperature of systems on energy transport along polypeptide chains  ap. 1-46.  aA new theory of bio-energy transport along protein molecules in living systems, where the energy is released by hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is proposed based on some physical and biological reasons. In the new theory, the Davydov’s Hamiltonian and wave function of the systems are simultaneously modified and extended. A new interaction has been added into Davydov’s Hamiltonian. The wave function of the excitation state of single particles for the excitons in the Davydov model is replaced by a new wave function of two-quanta quasicoherent state. In such a case, the bio-energy is transported by the new soliton, which differs from the Davydov’s soliton. The soliton is formed through self- trapping of two excitons interacting amino acid residues. The exciton is generated by vibrations of amide-I (CO stretching) arising from the energy of hydrolysis of ATP. The properties of the new soliton are extensively studied by analytical method and its lifetime is calculated using the nonlinear quantum perturbation theory and a wide ranges of parameter values relevant to protein molecules. The lifetime of the new soliton at the biological temperature 300K is enough large and belongs to the order of 10⁻¹⁰s, or τ/τ₀≥700, in which the soliton can transports over several hundreds amino acid residues. These studied results show clearly that the new soliton is thermally stable and has so larger lifetime that it can play an important role in biological processes. Thus the new model is a candidate of the bio-energy transport mechanism in protein molecules. In the meanwhile, the influences of structure nonuniformity in protein molecules and temperature of the systems on the states and properties of the soliton transport of bio-energy are numerically simulated and studied by the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. The structure nonuniformity arises from the disorder distributions of masses of amino acid residues, side groups and impurities, which results also in the fluctuations of the spring constant of protein molecules, dipole–dipole interaction between the neighboring amides, exciton–phonon (vibration of amino acids)interaction, chain–chain interaction among the three channels and ground state energy of the systems. We investigated the behaviors and states of the new solitons in a single protein molecular chain and α-Helix protein molecules with three channels under influences of the structure nonuniformity. We prove first that the bio-energy is transported by a soliton, which can move without dispersion, retaining its shape, velocity and energy in a uniform and periodic protein molecule. When the structure nonuniformity exists, although the fluctuations of the spring constant, dipole–dipole interaction constant, exciton–phonon coupling constant and ground state energy and the nonuniformity distributions of masses of amino acid residues can change the states and properties of motion of new soliton, they are still quite stable and very robust against these structure nonuniformities, i.e., even there are a larger structure nonuniformity in the protein molecules, the new solitons cannot be still dispersed. If the effects of thermal perturbation of medium on the soliton in nonuniform proteins is considered again, the new soliton can transport also over a larger spacing of 400 amino acids and has a longer time period of 300ps, it is still thermally stable up to 320K under the influence of the above structure nonuniformities. However, the new soliton disperses in the case of a higher temperature of 325K and in more large structure nonuniformity. Thus, we determine that the new soliton’s lifetime and critical temperature are 300ps and 320K, respectively. These results are also consistent with analytical data obtained via quantum perturbed theory. For α-Helix protein molecules with three channels, the results obtained show that the structure nonuniformity and quantum fluctuation can change the states and features of the new solitons, for example, the amplitudes, energies and velocities of the new soliton are decreased, but the solitons have been not destroyed, they can still transport steadily along the molecular chains retaining energy and momentum. When the quantum fluctuations are larger, such as, structure disorders and quantum fluctuations of 0.67<αK<2, ΔW=±8%W¯, ΔJ=±1%J¯, Δ(χ₁+χ₂)=±3%(χ¯₁+χ¯₂) and ΔL=±1%L¯ and Δɛ₀=ɛ|βₙ|, ɛ=0.1meV, |βₙ|<0.5, the new soliton is still stable. Therefore, the new solitons are quite robust against these nonuniform effects. However, they will be dispersed or disrupted in cases of very large structure nonuniformity. When the influence of temperature on solitons is considered, we find that the new solitons can transport steadily over 333 amino acid residues in the case of a long time period of 120ps, in which the soliton can retain its shape and energy to travel forward along protein molecules after their mutual collision at the biological temperature of 300K. However, the soliton disperses in cases of higher temperatures 325K under action of a larger structure disorder. Thus, its critical temperature is about 320K. When the effects of structure nonuniformity and temperature are considered simultaneously, then the new soliton has still high thermal stability and can transport also along the protein molecular chains retaining its amplitude, energy and velocity, they will disperses in the larger fluctuations, for example, 0.67M¯<Mₖ<2M¯, ΔW=±6%W¯, ΔJ=±1.3%J¯, Δ(χ₁+χ₂)=±2%(χ¯₁+χ¯₂), ΔL=±1.5%L¯ and Δɛ₀=ɛ|βₙ|, ɛ=0.82meV, |βₙ|≤0.5 at T=300K, or at higher temperatures 320K and the fluctuations of 0.67M¯<Mₖ<2M¯, Δ(χ₁+χ₂)=±1%(χ¯₁+χ¯₂), ΔJ=±0.7%J¯, ΔW=±7%W¯, ΔL=±0.8%L¯ and Δɛ₀=ɛ|βₙ|, ɛ=0.4meV, |βₙ|≤0.5. These results mean that the critical temperature of the new soliton is 315K in this condition. Thus, we can conclude from these investigations that the new soliton is quite robust against the structure nonuniformities and thermal perturbation of proteins at 300K in α-helix protein molecules, then it is a carrier of bio-energy transport and the improved model is a candidate for the mechanism of the bio-energy transport in the protein molecules. Finally we gave some experimental evidences for real existence of the soliton and validity of the theory of bio-energy transport in proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aamides 3aamino acids 3aanalytical methods 3abioenergy 3aenergy 3ahydrolysis 3amodels 3amomentum 3apolypeptides 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atransport proteins 3avibration0 tProgress in biophysics and molecular biology.g2012 Jan., v. 108, no. 1-2 p.1-46dElsevier Ltdx0079-61077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.09.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245014000178300001600318520155200334592002801886650001601914650002201930650001701952650001101969650002001980650001102000650002102011650002202032650001302054650001302067650004402080650001102124650001102135650001402146650001002160650000902170700002402179700003502203700002002238700002602258700002402284700002802308700002502336700002702361700001702388700002502405773010102430856008602531990002302617852000902640655001202649IND60102431720221119002659.0141106e20130130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010243172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.09.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarza-Ortíz, Ariadna10aCobalt(II)-mediated synthesis of 2,6-bis[5,7-di-tert-butyl-1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl]-pyridine: Structural analysis and coordination behavior  ap. 265-274.  aThe oxidative cyclization of 2,6-bis[2,4-di-tert-butyl-6-(methylidenylamino)phenol]-pyridine (L1) in acetonitrile, through the cobalt(II) coordination compound of L1, has resulted in a convenient route for the preparation of 2,6-bis[5,7-di-tert-butyl-1,3-benzoxazol-2-yl]-pyridine (L3). The X-ray diffraction analysis of L3 shows a planar molecule, with the oxygen atoms from the benzoxazole rings oriented to the pyridine nitrogen atom (conformer L3a). Ab initio calculations indicate that from the three possible planar conformers of L3, the more stable is L3a. The solid state conformation of the free ligand L3 and the relative energy of the three calculated conformers indicated stabilizing N→O interactions. Calculations of the protonated derivative of L3, compound 7, indicated that the most stable conformer has the benzoxazole nitrogen atoms pointing to the protonated pyridine NH (7c). The X-ray crystal analysis of ligand L3 coordinated to cobalt(II) nitrate, compound 4 is presented and conformer L3c is found in this compound. Two acid:base complexes [Zn(NO₃)₂(H₂O)₂][L3c]₂, compound 5, and [NEt₂H₂Cl][L3c], compound 6, have also been investigated. Complex 5 crystallized and its X-ray diffraction analysis is reported, whereas compound 6 was studied in solution by NMR, mass spectrometry and ab initio calculations. Both complexes show that conformer L3c can form stable hydrogen bonding associations, with molecules having the motif YH₂ (Y=N or O), that are of interest for building up supramolecular associations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetonitrile 3acobalt 3acrystallization 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amass spectrometry 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aphenol 3apyridines 3awater 3azinc1 aMartínez, Pablo A.1 aDuarte-Hernández, Angelica M.1 aMijangos, Edgar1 aFlores-Álamo, Marcos1 aPérez-Casas, Carol1 aCamacho-Camacho, Carlos1 aContreras, Rosalinda1 aFlores-Parra, Angelina1 aReedijk, Jan1 aBarba-Behrens, Norah0 tJournal of molecular structure.g2013 Jan. 30, v. 1032 p.265-274dElsevier B.V.x0022-28607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molstruc.2012.09.0783Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014900173300001600322520150300338592002801841650002101869650002001890650001301910650001501923650002001938650002001958650001901978650002801997650001402025650001402039650001002053650001602063650001302079650001202092650001402104650002102118650002502139650001202164651001102176651002902187653002102216653000902237653001602246653001302262653001302275700001702288700002202305700002202327700002002349700002302369700002102392700002302413700002202436773009602458856008602554852000902640655001202649IND60111257620221121004951.0190319e20130107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011125762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStewart, Meredith10aBluetongue virus serotype 8 virus-like particles protect sheep against virulent virus infection as a single or multi-serotype cocktail immunogen  ap. 553-558.  aSince 1998, there have been multiple separate outbreaks of Bluetongue disease (BT) in Europe with the largest outbreak ever recorded in Northern Europe caused by Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8). Coinciding with the BTV-8 outbreak, a virulent strain of BTV-1 emerged and co-infections of these two serotypes were reported. In response, we generated VLPs for BTV-8 and tested the efficacy of BTV-8 VLPs as a single immunogen and as a component of a multivalent vaccine, with VLPs of BTV-1 and BTV-2, in order to test if there was any interference between serotypes. All pre-Alps sheep vaccinated with BTV-8 VLPs developed a strong neutralising antibody response to BTV-8 and multivalent VLP vaccinated animals also developed neutralising antibodies to BTV-1 and BTV-2. There were no side effects observed due to the vaccination with either the single- or multivalent VLP cocktail. All VLP-vaccinated animals had no clinical manifestation of BT or viraemia after challenge with a virulent BTV-8 isolate. This data indicates that BTV-8 VLPs delivered as a single immunogen or as a component of a multivalent vaccine are highly efficacious. Moreover, there was no interference on the development of a strong protective immune response due to the combination of different phylogenetically unrelated BTV serotypes in the vaccinated animals. This report further highlights that BTV VLPs are safe and efficacious immunogens that are able to afford complete protection against a virulent virus challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBluetongue virus 3aadverse effects 3aantigens 3abluetongue 3aimmune response 3amixed infection 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aphylogeny 3aserotypes 3asheep 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviremia 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3avirus-like particles 3aviruses 3aEurope 3aNorthern European region 0aBluetongue virus 0aVLPs 0aMultivalent 0aCocktail 0aVaccines1 aDubois, Eric1 aSailleau, Corinne1 aBréard, Emmanuel1 aViarouge, Cyril1 aDesprat, Alexandra1 aThiéry, Richard1 aZientara, Stéphan1 aRoy, P.q(Polly),0 tVaccine.g2013 Jan. 07, v. 31, no. 3 p.553-558dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.11.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01675naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245006700163300001600230520064000246592002800886650001200914650001400926650001000940650001300950650001700963650001400980700001700994700001901011700001501030700001801045700001701063700001901080773008601099856008401185990002301269852000901292655001201301IND60103794120221119053559.0141106e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010379412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2011.10.1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Li12aA bluish green chlorosilicate phosphor for UV based white LEDs  ap. 111-113.  aA bluish green phosphor divalent (Eu²⁺) doped calcium chlorosilicate (Ca₇(SiO₄)₂Cl₆:Eu²⁺) was synthesized by conventional solid state reaction method and its luminescent property was investigated in this paper.

We have developed a new fusion protein expression system based on PagP and demonstrated its utility in the expression of the unstructured N-terminal region of human cardiac troponin I (residues 1–71). A yield of 100mg fusion protein per liter M9 minimal media was obtained. The troponin I fragment was removed from PagP using cyanogen bromide cleavage at methionine residues followed by nickel affinity chromatography. We further demonstrate that optimal cleavage requires complete reduction of methionine residues prior to cyanogen bromide treatment, and this is effectively accomplished using potassium iodide under acidic conditions. The PagP-based fusion protein system is more effective at targeting proteins into inclusion bodies than a commercially available system that uses ketosteroid isomerase; it thus represents an important advance for producing large quantities of unfolded peptides or proteins in Escherichia coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aaffinity chromatography 3acyanogen 3ahumans 3ainclusion bodies 3amembrane proteins 3amethionine 3anickel 3apeptides 3apotassium iodide 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal peptide 3atroponin I1 aPan, Jonathan S.1 aSykes, Brian D.0 tProtein expression and purification.g2012 Sept., v. 85, no. 1 p.148-151dElsevier Inc.x1046-59287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pep.2012.07.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008200170300001800252520137200270592002801642650001301670650002301683650001001706650001301716650001701729650001501746650001101761650001401772650001401786700002101800700001901821700002001840700001601860700001201876700002201888700002301910773008801933856008502021990002302106852000902129655001202138IND60103461920221118011545.0141106e20130427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010346192DNAL7 a10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60319-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChopra, Mickey10aEnding of preventable deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea: an achievable goal  ap. 1499-1506.  aGlobal under-5 mortality has fallen rapidly from 12 million deaths in 1990, to 6·9 million in 2011; however, this number still falls short of the target of a two-thirds reduction or a maximum of 4 million deaths by 2015. Acceleration of reductions in deaths due to pneumonia and diarrhoea, which together account for about 2 million child deaths every year, is essential if the target is to be met. Scaling up of existing interventions against the two diseases to 80% and immunisation to 90% would eliminate more than two-thirds of deaths from these two diseases at a cost of US$6·715 billion by 2025. Modelling in this report shows that if all countries could attain the rates of decline of the regional leaders, then cause-specific death rates of fewer than three deaths per 1000 livebirths from pneumonia and less than one death per 1000 livebirths from diarrhoea could be achieved by 2025. These rates are those at which preventable deaths have been avoided. Increasing of awareness of the size of the problem; strengthening of leadership, intersectoral collaboration, and resource mobilisation; and increasing of efficiency through the selection of the optimum mix of a growing set of cost-effective interventions depending on local contexts are the priority actions needed to achieve the goal of ending preventable deaths from pneumonia and diarrhoea by 2025.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3acost effectiveness 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3aimmunization 3aleadership 3amodels 3amortality 3apneumonia1 aMason, Elizabeth1 aBorrazzo, John1 aCampbell, Harry1 aRudan, Igor1 aLiu, Li1 aBlack, Robert E.,1 aBhutta, Zulfiqar A0 tlancet.g2013 Apr. 27, v. 381, no. 9876 p.1499-1506dElsevier Ltd.x0140-67367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60319-03Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245005900168300001600227520130200243592002801545650002201573650001301595650001701608650001301625650001501638650001001653650001301663650001301676650002401689700001601713700002001729700002201749700002101771700001801792700002201810773010701832856008301939990002302022852000902045655001202054IND60104802620221122044321.0141107e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010480262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymgme.2011.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangold, Sarah10aCerebral folate deficiency: A neurometabolic syndrome?  ap. 369-372.  aBACKGROUND: Cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) is increasingly recognized in various neurological conditions, raising the question of whether it might represent a clear-cut clinical syndrome. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients with low cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) values was performed. RESULTS: 58 pediatric patients with low (-2nd to -3rd standard deviation) and 45 patients with very low 5MTHF values (<3rd standard deviation) were identified, including 22 patients with defined underlying neurological conditions. The leading symptoms were mental retardation (n=84), motor retardation (n=75), epilepsy (n=53), ataxia (n=44) and pyramidal tract signs (n=37). There was no relationship between 5MTHF levels and the severity of clinical disease, the duration of clinical disease, distinct neurological symptoms and antiepileptic drug treatment, respectively. Genetical analysis for mutations in the folate receptor 1 gene proved normal in all 16 children studied. CONCLUSIONS: For the majority of patients CFD is not a clear-cut neurometabolic syndrome but the common result of different genetic, metabolic or unknown processes.

Direct electrochemistry of GOD in the film was obtained, proved by one pair of well-defined, quasi-reversible redox peaks with the formal potential of −0.504V in pH 7.0 phosphate buffer solution at the scan rate of 100mVs⁻¹. And the electron transfer rate constant of the direct electron communication between GOD and the electrode was calculated to be 2.2s⁻¹. The biomediated AuNPs play an important role in facilitating the electron exchange between the electroactive center of GOD and the electrode. Furthermore, the fabricated electrode displayed a linear amperometric response in the glucose concentration range from 0.5 to 8.0mM with a relatively high sensitivity of 16.6μAmM⁻¹cm⁻². Therefore, the AuNPs based biosensor described here provides a different mode to design electrochemical devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abiocomposites 3abiosensors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agold 3ananogold 3ananotubes 3apH1 aMeng, Zuchao1 aWang, Qi1 aZheng, Jianbin0 tSensors and actuators.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 158, no. 1 p.23-27dElsevier B.V.x0925-40057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2011.04.0573Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01288naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007800168300001600246520044700262592002800709650002300737650001100760650001600771700002000787773008700807856008400894990002300978852000901001655001201010IND60103868120221118035239.0141107e20120915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6010386812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.matlet.2012.05.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, A.S.10aEnergy of Ni/Ni₃Al interface: A temperature-dependent theoretical study  ap. 100-103.  aUsing plane wave ab-initio and Monte Carlo techniques, the Ni/Ni₃Al interfacial energy is studied and the results from the different techniques are critically compared.

Our results show that the total emissions of various HAPs (SO₂, NOX, CO, PM, Hg, Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, As, Ni and Cu) have rapidly increased by about 1–21 times at an annual average growth rate of 1–10% over the past three decades. Remarkably uneven spatial allocation features of these pollutants among provinces are observed. HAPs emissions are primarily concentrated in the eastern and coastal provinces due to the concentration of cement plants and their huge volume of coal consumption. We predict the future emission trends of HAPs through 2050 based on industry construction and policy guidance, and our scenario analysis indicates that HAPs emissions will drop substantially because of the combined effects of cement production yields reduction and the increasing application rate of various air pollution control devices. The study suggests that highlighted attention should be paid to this energy-intensive industry to ensure stricter emission standards are implemented for these HAPs emissions in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aapplication rate 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acadmium 3acement 3achromium 3acoal 3aconstruction industry 3acopper 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3akilns 3alead 3amercury 3anickel 3apollutants 3apollution control 3asulfur dioxide 3azinc 3aChina 0aHazardous air pollutants 0aEmission inventory 0aCement production 0aTemporal trend 0aSpatial distribution 0aScenario analysis1 aTian, Hezhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3638-84951 aWang, Kun1 aZhu, Chuanyong1 aGao, Jiajia1 aMa, Yilin1 aXue, Yifeng1 aWang, Yong1 aDuan, Shiheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1516-852X1 aZhou, Junrui0 tAtmospheric environment.g2016 Mar., v. 128 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2015.12.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012200159520135500281592002801636650001601664650002501680650002001705650002201725650002501747650001801772650001201790650001101802650001101813650002401824650001901848650001901867650001401886650002801900651001001928700001601938700001301954700001701967700002601984700001902010773012702029856007402156852000902230655001202239IND60652203620221118003856.0190712e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065220362DNAL7 a10.3390/su100306722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiaoxue10aManufacturing Decisions and Government Subsidies for Electric Vehicles in China: A Maximal Social Welfare Perspective  aIn order to address challenges in the sustainable development of transportation, economy, and environment, governments of China and conventional automobile manufacturers are extremely concerned about the development of the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing industry and market. However, owing to the limitations of EVs and the government economic policies on decreasing subsidies in China, many manufacturers are worried about entering the EV market. Given the low consumer preference for EVs, using a leader-follower Stackelberg game model, we investigate the impact of government a subsidy on the optimal production and pricing decisions of an auto manufacturer who could produce both EVs and conventional vehicles. We characterize whether/under what conditions the manufacturer’s decision to offer EV products under government subsidy, whilst increasing its profits (a win-win situation). On the policy side, we delineate how government a subsidy can be set to realize the inherent economic, environmental, and social benefits of EV production (the triple win of EV production). We further investigate the impact of EV manufacturing- and society-related factors on the balance among manufacturer profits, environmental impact and social welfare. This study also finds that the adoption of EVs is not bound to be beneficial for the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3aconsumer preferences 3aeconomic policy 3aelectric vehicles 3aenvironmental impact 3amanufacturing 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3aprofits and margins 3asocial benefit 3asocial welfare 3asubsidies 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aLin, Haiyan1 aLiu, Zhi1 aLi, Dengfeng1 aLlopis-Albert, Carlos1 aZeng, Shouzhen0 tSustainability.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100306723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012300170520079700293592002801090650004401118650002501162650002101187650001301208650001801221650004401239650001801283650002701301650002201328650001501350653001301365653002401378653002001402700001801422700001501440700001301455700001501468700001901483773010601502856008701608852000901695655001201704IND60687387920221119141228.0201209e20200720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068738792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1247632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yanqing10aSelf-assembly, rheological properties and antioxidant activities of chitosan grafted with tryptophan and phenylalanine  aIn this study, aromatic amino acid-conjugated chitosan are designed and developed, as viewed by multi-spectral methods.

The evaluation of environmental impact is a must for decision-makings related to sustainable urbanization. This paper assessed the dynamic environmental performance of 285 cities in China from 2005 to 2013 based on the Malmquist-Luenberger index, an expanded data envelopment analysis (DEA) model. To ensure comparability among cities, a two-step clustering method was used to classify all cities into three types. From the results, we found (1) 166 and 185 cities’ environmental conditions remained the improvement during the research period under the meta-frontier and group frontier respectively. (2) Low and Medium energy intensity cities performed better than high energy intensity cities. (3) The environmental performance under the group frontier was overestimated compared with the meta-frontier. (4) The trends of environmental improvement and economic growth are significantly inconsistent. Overall, all ways to decrease undesirable outputs and increase desirable outputs, such as technological innovation, industrial structure optimization and regional cooperation, should be encouraged to achieve urban, regional and country sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aenergy 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3amodels 3asupply balance 3atechnology 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aXue, Xiaolong1 aShi, Yue1 aWang, Zeyu1 aJi, Ankang0 tSustainability.g2018 Mar. 19, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100308623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245010100176300001300277520178500290592002802075650002002103650001102123650001302134650001402147650002302161650002302184650002702207650002602234650001802260650001602278650001902294650001802313650002102331650001402352650002402366650001402390650002002404650001102424650001102435650002002446650001802466650001702484650002502501653003002526653002902556653001302585653001702598653001002615653002502625700002002650773011102670856008402781852000902865655001202874IND60535457420221116195939.0190403e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053545742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2015.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbd El-Mageed, Taia A.10aOrgano mineral fertilizer can mitigate water stress for cucumber production (Cucumis sativus L.)  ap. 1-10.  aSupplying organo mineral fertilizer [a 2:10:1 (w/w/w) mixture of sulfur, compost and potassium humate] under deficit irrigation conditions could be a practical solution to compensate the negative effect of water stress on cucumber crop. For this purpose, two consecutive field experiments (summer and fall seasons) were conducted during 2014. Three organo mineral fertilizer (OMF) levels (0, 5 and 10tha−1) were supplied as a soil amendment combined with three irrigation levels (100, 80 and 60% of crop evapotranspiration). Under full irrigation, seasonal water use by cucumber was 397mm over 76 days in summer season and 292mm over 86 days in fall season, respectively. Cucumber fruit quality, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) were significantly (p<0.05) affected by season and both irrigation quantity and organo mineral fertilizer application. Leaf area, dry matter, relative water content (RWC %), membrane stability index (MSI %), and harvest index (HI) were also significantly (p<0.05) affected by irrigation quantity and organo menial fertilizer and were not significantly affected by season except for dry matter. Interaction between growing season and both irrigation and organo mineral fertilizer were not significantly affected. The highest fruit yields (19.76tha−1 and 15.94tha−1 in fall and summer season) were recorded under full irrigation and 10tha−1 of OMF. Organo mineral fertilizer of 10tha−1 and 5tha−1 significantly (p≤0.05) increased fruit yield by 53.49 and 15.93% compared to control. The results suggest that the detrimental effects of drought stress can be reduced by using organo mineral fertilizer as a soil amendment for vegetable crops. Combining deficit irrigation and organo mineral fertilizer maximized crop water productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aautumn 3acomposts 3acucumbers 3adeficit irrigation 3aevapotranspiration 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3agrowing season 3aharvest index 3airrigation rates 3aleaf area 3amineral fertilizers 3apotassium 3asoil amendments 3asulfur 3asummer 3avegetable crops 3awater content 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 0aOrgano mineral fertilizer 0aChlorophyll fluorescence 0aCucumber 0aWater stress 0aYield 0aWater use efficiency1 aSemida, Wael M.0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Sept., v. 159 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03224naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245013200212300001600344520176800360592002802128650002002156650001902176650001902195650001602214650001402230650002302244650002102267650001502288650001102303651001002314700006002324700006002384700002302444700007202467700006202539773013302601856008302734852000902817655001202826IND60751216620221122080633.0220225e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075121662DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-021-03745-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen Hamouda, Ghaieth1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4182-073710aImpacts of climate change and rising atmospheric CO2 on future projected reference evapotranspiration in Emilia-Romagna (Italy)  ap. 801-820.  aThe continuous increase of atmospheric CO₂ content mainly due to anthropogenic CO₂ emissions is causing a rise in temperature on earth, altering the hydrological and meteorological processes and affecting crop physiology. Evapotranspiration is an important component of the hydrological cycle. Thus, understanding the change in evapotranspiration due to global warming is essential for better water resources planning and management and agricultural production. In this study, the effect of climate change with a focus on the combined effect of temperature and elevated CO₂ concentrations on reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was evaluated using the Penman–Monteith equation. A EURO-CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) ensemble was used to estimate ETo in five locations in the Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) during the period 2021–2050. Then, its projected changes in response to different CO₂ concentrations (i.e., 372 ppm and 550 ppm) under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (i.e., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) were analyzed. Simulation results with both scenarios, without increasing CO₂ levels (372 ppm), showed that the annual and summertime ETo for all locations increased by an average of 4 to 5.4% with regard to the reference period 1981–2005, for an increase of air temperature by 1 to 1.5 °C. When the effect of elevated CO₂ levels (550 ppm) was also considered in combination with projected changes in temperature, changes in both annual and summer ETo demand for all locations varied from − 1.1 to 2.2% during the 2021–2050 period with regard to the reference period 1981–2005. This shows that higher CO₂ levels moderated the increase in ETo that accompanies an increase in air temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate models 3aclimatology 3aequations 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrologic cycle 3aphysiology 3asummer 3aItaly1 aTomozeiu, Rodica1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3420-47681 aPavan, Valentina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9608-19031 aAntolini, Gabriele1 aSnyder, R.

These receptors, other than intracellular receptors, which are membrane proteins expressed on the cell membrane, can detect extracellular stimuli. Many researchers have utilized cells with natural receptors embedded in the cellular membrane for human sense-mimicking platforms based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalances, surface plasmon resonance, and surface acoustic waves. In addition, integration of conducting nanomaterials and natural receptors allows highly sensitive and selective responses toward target molecules, enabling, for example, nanobioelectronic noses for odorants, nanobioelectronic tongues for tastants, and G-protein-coupled receptor sensors for hormones, dopamine, cadaverine, geosmin, trimethylamine, etc. Moreover, as a part of nanobioelectronic sensors, natural receptors can be produced in various forms, such as peptides, proteins, nanovesicles, and nanodiscs, and each sensor can provide an ultralow limit of detection. In this Review, we discuss biosensors with natural receptors and then especially focus on natural receptor-conjugated conducting nanomaterial sensors. To provide a fundamental understanding, the sections encompass (1) the fabrication of conducting nanomaterials, (2) the production of natural receptors, (3) the characteristics of natural receptors, (4) the technology for immobilizing both components, and (5) their sensing applications. Finally, perspective is given on a new development in the use of natural receptors in a wide range of industries, such as food, cosmetics, and healthcare. In addition, artificial olfactory codes will be characterized by signal processing in the near future, leading to human olfactory standardization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3abiosensors 3abiotechnology 3acadaverine 3acell membranes 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adopamine 3aelectronic nose 3ageosmin 3ahormones 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aion channels 3ananomaterials 3aodor compounds 3apeptides 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asounds 3asurface plasmon resonance 3atrimethylamine1 aSong, Hyun Seok1 aPark, Tai Hyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4254-06571 aJang, Jyongsik1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0415-802X0 tChemical reviews.g2018 Oct. 29, v. 119, no. 1 p.36-93dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b001593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01373naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245005300159300001800212520036100230592002800591650001500619650001900634650002000653650002100673650001100694653001600705653001900721653002300740653001900763700001500782773015200797856007700949852000901026655001201035IND60522036920221122171719.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052203692DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1995-08042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunkely, H.10aPhotochemistry of Aqueous Tetrathioantimonate(V)  ap. 1155-1157.  aThe electronic spectrum of [SbS₄]³⁻ in 10⁻³ M NaOH displays an absorption band at λₘₐₓ = 285 nm which is assigned to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transition.

Canonical APP proteolysis occurs via α-, β-, and γ-secretases. APP is also actively degraded by protein degradation systems. By pharmacologically inhibiting protein degradation with ALLN, we observed an accumulation of several novel APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs). The two major novel CTFs migrated around 15 and 25 kDa and can be observed across multiple cell types. The process was independent of cytotoxicity or protein synthesis. We further determine that the accumulation of the novel CTFs is not mediated by proteasome or calpain inhibition, but by cathepsin L inhibition. Moreover, these novel CTFs are not generated by an increased amount of BACE. Here, we name the CTF of 25 kDa as η-CTF (eta-CTF). Our data suggest that under physiological conditions, a subset of APP undergoes alternative processing and the intermediate products, the 15 kDa CTFs, and the η-CTFs aret rapidly degraded and/or processed via the protein degradation machinery, specifically, cathepsin L.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3acalpain 3acathepsin L 3acytotoxicity 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteolysis1 aSang, Nianli1 aZhang, Can1 aRaghupathi, Ramesh1 aTanzi, Rudolph E.1 aSaunders, Aleister0 tBiochemistry.g2015 May 12, v. 54, no. 18 p.2806-2816dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.biochem.5b003293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011100173300001200284520103900296592002801335650001501363650001601378650001201394650002001406650001801426650001201444650001501456650001701471650001101488650000901499650001201508650001401520650000901534650002001543651001901563651003001582653001501612653001001627653001401637653001901651653000901670700002601679700002401705700002101729700002001750773010001770856008401870852000901954655001201963IND60545841920221118222151.0170606e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054584192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBond, Alexander L.10aTrace element concentrations in harvested auks from Newfoundland: Toxicological risk of a traditional hunt  ap. 1-6.  aCommon (Uria aalge) and Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) are apex predators in the North Atlantic Ocean, and are also subject to a traditional hunt in Newfoundland and Labrador during the winter months, along with small numbers of illegally harvested Razorbills (Alca torda). Because of their high trophic position, auks are at risk from high contaminant burdens that bioaccumulate and biomagnify, and could therefore pose a toxicological risk to human consumers. We analysed trace element concentrations from breast muscle of 51 auks collected off Newfoundland in the 2011–2012 hunting season. There were few differences in contaminant concentrations among species.

Shatavari contains phytoestrogenic compounds that bind to the estradiol receptor. Postmenopausal estradiol deficiency contributes to sarcopenia and osteoporosis. In a randomised double-blind trial, 20 postmenopausal women (68.5 ± 6 years) ingested either placebo (N = 10) or shatavari (N = 10; 1000 mg/d, equivalent to 26,500 mg/d fresh weight shatavari) for 6 weeks. Handgrip and knee extensor strength were measured at baseline and at 6 weeks. Vastus lateralis (VL) biopsy samples were obtained. Data are presented as difference scores (Week 6—baseline, median ± interquartile range). Handgrip (but not knee extensor) strength was improved by shatavari supplementation (shatavari +0.7 ± 1.1 kg, placebo −0.4 ± 1.3 kg; p = 0.04). Myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation, a known marker of improved myosin contractile function, was increased in VL following shatavari supplementation (immunoblotting; placebo −0.08 ± 0.5 a.u., shatavari +0.3 ± 1 arbitrary units (a.u.); p = 0.03). Shatavari increased the phosphorylation of Aktˢᵉʳ⁴⁷³ (Aktˢᵉʳ⁴⁷³ (placebo −0.6 ± 0.6 a.u., shatavari +0.2 ± 1.3 a.u.; p = 0.03) in VL. Shatavari supplementation did not alter plasma markers of bone turnover (P1NP, β-CTX) and stimulation of human osteoblasts with pooled sera (N = 8 per condition) from placebo and shatavari supplementation conditions did not alter cytokine or metabolic markers of osteoblast activity. Shatavari may improve muscle function and contractility via myosin conformational change and further investigation of its utility in conserving and enhancing musculoskeletal function, in larger and more diverse cohorts, is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3abone metabolism 3acytokines 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3ahand strength 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3amuscles 3amyosin 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoporosis 3aphosphorylation 3aplacebos 3apostmenopause 3asarcopenia1 aJackman, Sarah R.1 aSabou, Vlad R.1 aCampbell, Matthew I.1 aTang, Jonathan C.

Due to climate change and decreased grazing of domestic animals, the treelines expand both upwards into the mountains and northwards into the tundra. To quantify and understand the biophysical radiative climatic feedback effect due to this expansion, it is necessary to establish measurement strategies of fine-spatial albedo by which relationships with the tree structure and snow-masking effect can be quantified. In this study, we measured single-tree Norway spruce albedo for small trees using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The platform allows the measurement of proximal remotely sensed albedo, enabling the provision of fine-spatial reflectance distributed over larger geographical areas. The albedo measurements varied from 0.39 to 0.99. The interaction between the diurnal course of the sun and sloping terrain constituted the most important driving factor on the albedo. Surprisingly, all tree structural variables revealed smaller correlations with the albedo than typically found for boreal and boreal–alpine summertime albedo. The snow-masking effect of the trees on the albedo was statistically significant and was found to be stronger than the effects of tree structural variables. Only the canopy density had a statistically significant effect on the albedo among the tree structural variables. This was likely explained by the imprecise heading of the hoovering positions of the UAV and insufficient spatial resolution of the reflected radiation measurements. For further development of fine-spatial UAV-measured albedo, we recommend the use of UAVs with high-precision navigation systems and field-stop devices to limit the spatial size of the measured reflected radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea abies 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3aecotones 3aheading 3alandscapes 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asnow 3asummer 3atreeline 3atrees 3atundra 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3awinter1 aGobakken, Terje 1 aNæsset, Erik 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Mar. 18, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140614823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01315naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010500156300002000261520031700281592002800598650002500626650002100651650001500672650001300687650001100700650002300711700001600734700001600750700001500766773012500781856007400906852000900980655001200989IND60669458320221119051352.0190920e20151022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066945832DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra20260d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, J.

In this pathway, proteins attached to receptors and the internalized materials are encapsulated in clathrin coated membrane vesicles that subsequently fuse with or transform into intracellular compartments (early and late endosomes) as their contents are being directed to the lysosomes for degradation. The following proteins are commonly used to mark the pathway at various stages: Rab5 (early endosome), Rab7 (late endosome), and LAMP-1 (lysosome). In this work, we studied the distribution and co-localization of these marker proteins in two cell lines (C2C12 and A549) to determine whether these markers are unique for specific endosome types or whether they can co-exist with other markers. We estimate the densities and sizes of the endosomes containing the three markers, as well as the number of marker antibodies attached to each endosome. We determine that the markers are not unique to one endosome type but that the extent of co-localization is different for the two cell types. In fact, we find endosomes that contain all three markers simultaneously. Our results suggest that the use of these proteins as specific markers for specific endosome types should be reevaluated. This was the first successful use of triple image cross correlation spectroscopy to qualitatively and quantitatively study the extent of interaction among three different species in cells and also the first experimental study of three-way interactions of clathrin mediated endocytic markers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclathrin 3aendocytosis 3aendosomes 3alysosomes 3aspectroscopy 0aAnalytical chemistry 0aPhysical chemistry 0aBiophysics 0aCell biology 0aCell imaging 0aImage correlation spectroscopy 0aFluorescence microscopy1 aPetersen, Nils O.0 tHeliyon.g2019 Sept., v. 5, no. 9 p.e02375-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e023753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013700162520155400299592002801853650001401881650001001895650002001905650001401925650002401939650001101963650002801974650001202002650001302014650003102027650002202058650001302080650001002093700002402103700001702127700002202144700001902166700002302185700002402208700002302232700001802255700002002273700002302293773012202316856007402438852000902512655001202521IND60742679820221122041916.0210624e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074267982DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130620662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hsin-Liang,10aTolerability and Safety of a Novel Ketogenic Ester, Bis-Hexanoyl (R)-1,3-Butanediol: A Randomized Controlled Trial in Healthy Adults  aNutritional ketosis is a state of mildly elevated blood ketone concentrations resulting from dietary changes (e.g., fasting or reduced carbohydrate intake) or exogenous ketone consumption. In this study, we determined the tolerability and safety of a novel exogenous ketone diester, bis-hexanoyl-(R)-1,3-butanediol (BH-BD), in a 28-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial (NCT04707989). Healthy adults (n = 59, mean (SD), age: 42.8 (13.4) y, body mass index: 27.8 (3.9) kg/m²) were randomized to consume a beverage containing 12.5 g (Days 0–7) and 25 g (Days 7–28) of BH-BD or a taste-matched placebo daily with breakfast. Tolerability, stimulation, and sedation were assessed daily by standardized questionnaires, and blood and urine samples were collected at Days 0, 7, 14, and 28 for safety assessment. There were no differences in at-home composite systemic and gastrointestinal tolerability scores between BH-BD and placebo at any time in the study, or in acute tolerability measured 1-h post-consumption in-clinic. Weekly at-home composite tolerability scores did not change when BH-BD servings were doubled. At-home scores for stimulation and sedation did not differ between groups. BH-BD significantly increased blood ketone concentrations 1-h post-consumption. No clinically meaningful changes in safety measures including vital signs and clinical laboratory measurements were detected within or between groups. These results support the overall tolerability and safety of consumption of up to 25 g/day BH-BD.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3ablood 3abody mass index 3abreakfast 3acarbohydrate intake 3aesters 3agastrointestinal system 3aketosis 3aplacebos 3arandomized clinical trials 3asafety assessment 3asedation 3aurine1 aBlonquist, Traci M.1 aMah, Eunice 1 aSanoshy, Kristen 1 aBeckman, Dawn 1 aNieman, Kristin M.1 aWinters, Barbara L.1 aAnthony, Joshua C.1 aVerdin, Eric 1 aNewman, John C.1 aStubbs, Brianna J.0 tNutrients.g2021 June 16, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130620663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03944naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006200149245011100211520209500322592002802417650001602445650001302461650003902474650001902513650002502532650000902557650001802566650002202584650002002606650002402626650002002650650002402670650001502694650001302709650002202722650000902744650002102753650002402774650001302798651001002811653002402821653002102845653002102866653003402887653002002921700002502941700002102966700002402987700001603011700005903027700002203086700001603108700001703124773010803141856008403249852000903333655001203342IND60734555720221120122025.0210619e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073455572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.still.2021.1050002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyawira, Sylvia S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4913-138910aSimulating soil organic carbon in maize-based systems under improved agronomic management in Western Kenya  aImproved management practices should be implemented in croplands in sub-Saharan Africa to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and/or reduce losses associated with land-use change, thereby addressing the challenge of ongoing soil degradation. DayCent, a process-based biogeochemical model, provides a useful tool for evaluating which management practices are most effective for SOC sequestration. Here, we used the DayCent model to simulate SOC using experimental data from two long-term field sites in western Kenya comprising of two widely promoted sustainable agricultural management practices: integrated nutrient management (i.e. mineral fertilizer and crop residues/farmyard manure incorporation) and conservation agriculture (i.e. minimum tillage and crop residue retention). At both sites, correlations between measured and simulated SOC were low to moderate (R² of 0.25−0.55), and in most cases, the model produced fairly accurate prediction of the SOC trends with a low relative root mean squared error (RRMSE < 7%). Consistent with field measurements, simulated SOC declined under all improved management practices. The model projected annual SOC loss rates of between 0.32 to 0.35 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ in continuously tilled maize (Zea mays) systems without fertilizer or organic matter application over the period 2003–2050. The most effective practices in reducing the losses were the combined application of 4 Mg ha⁻¹ of farmyard manure and 2 Mg ha⁻¹ of maize residue retention (reducing losses up to 0.22 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), minimum tillage in combination with maize residue retention (0.21 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹), and rotation of maize with soybean (Glycine max) under minimum tillage (0.17 Mg C ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹). Model results suggest that response of the passive SOC pool to the different management practices is a key driver of the long-term SOC trends at the two study sites. This study demonstrates the strength of the DayCent model in simulating SOC in maize systems under different agronomic management practices that are typical for western Kenya.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aZea mays 3aagricultural conservation practice 3aanimal manures 3acarbon sequestration 3acorn 3acrop residues 3aecological models 3aland use change 3amineral fertilizers 3aminimum tillage 3anutrient management 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asimulation models 3asoil 3asoil degradation 3asoil organic carbon 3asoybeans 3aKenya 0aSoil organic carbon 0aDayCent Modeling 0aLong-term trials 0aManure and residue management 0aMinimum tillage1 aHartman, Melannie D.1 aNguyen, Trung H.1 aMargenot, Andrew J.1 aKihara, Job1 aPaul, Birthe K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5994-53541 aWilliams, Stephen1 aBolo, Peter1 aSommer, Rolf0 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 July, v. 211 p.105000-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.1050003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013000169520171700299592002802016650002102044650001602065650001402081650002102095650001902116650001602135650001502151650001902166650001902185650001602204650002002220650001002240650001502250650001802265650001902283650002102302650002002323650002202343650004302365650002102408653000702429653000802436653001002444653000802454653000802462653000802470653000802478653001002486653001302496653001502509653001802524653001402542653003302556700002402589700001802613700006902631700002002700700002002720700002402740700006102764773008802825856008302913852000902996655001203005IND60647510920221118071444.0190718e20190830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064751092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2019.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYarahmadi, Sahar10aInhibition of sirtuin 1 deacetylase by miR-211-5p provides a mechanism for the induction of cell death in breast cancer cells  aSirtuin 1 is one of the regulators of cell growth and survival and its inhibition is suggested as a suitable mechanism to overcome breast cancer development. In this study we explored the role of miR-211-5p in SIRT1/p53 pathway and its influence on breast cancer cell viability and apoptosis. Cells were transfected with miR-211-5p mimic and inhibitor to modulate cellular miR-211-5p levels in breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. Gene expression of miR-211-5p and SIRT1 were measured with real-time PCR. SIRT1 protein level and the acetylation of p53 as well as SIRT1 activity were evaluated by Western blotting and fluorometry, respectively. In order to explore the direct attachment of miR-211-5p to the 3′-UTR of SIRT1 mRNA, luciferase reporter assay was applied. Cell viability in response to miR-211-5p was studied by MTT assay and apoptosis was assessed by annexin V labeling followed by flow cytometry. Results showed that SIRT1 gene and protein expression were inhibited by miR-211-5p and the 3′-UTR of SIRT1 was found to be directly targeted by miR-211-5p. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression resulted in its reduced activity. Up-regulation of miR-211-5p was also followed by a significant decline in the acetylation status of p53 which was associated with remarkable decreased cell viability and induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Antisense oligonucleotide of miR-211-5p acted as its inhibitor and exerted opposite effects both on SIRT1 expression and cell apoptosis. In conclusion, inhibition of SIRT1 by miR-211-5p could effectively reduce breast cancer cell survival and cause cell death and therefore might be considered a seemly mechanism for designing anticancer therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aacetylation 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3acell lines 3acell viability 3aflow cytometry 3afluorometry 3agene expression 3agenes 3aluciferase 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasm cells 3aoligonucleotides 3aprotein content 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atoxicity testing 0aBC 0aUTR 0aSIRT1 0aNAD 0aMRE 0aPEI 0aBCA 0aGAPDH 0amicroRNA 0amiR-211-5p 0aBreast cancer 0aSirtuin 1 0aTumor suppressor protein p531 aAbdolvahabi, Zohreh1 aHesari, Zahra1 aTavakoli-Yaraki, Masoumeh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4449-92481 aYousefi, Zeynab1 aSeiri, Parvaneh1 aHosseinkhani, Saman1 aNourbakhsh, Mitra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6716-03540 tGene.g2019 Aug. 30, v. 711 p.143939-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2019.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003400139245010200173500001900275520107400294592002801368650002101396650001201417650001601429650002801445650001601473650002201489650001701511650000901528650002001537650001301557700002301570700002801593773012001621856007301741852000901814655001201823IND60738942520221123020453.0210524e20210514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073894252DNAL7 a10.3390/v130509092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrimadharsini, Putu  Prathiwi10aMechanism of Cross-Species Transmission, Adaptive Evolution and Pathogenesis of Hepatitis E Virus  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHepatitis E virus (HEV) is the leading cause of acute hepatitis worldwide. While the transmission in developing countries is dominated by fecal-oral route via drinking contaminated water, the zoonotic transmission is the major route of HEV infection in industrialized countries. The discovery of new HEV strains in a growing number of animal species poses a risk to zoonotic infection. However, the exact mechanism and the determinant factors of zoonotic infection are not completely understood. This review will discuss the current knowledge on the mechanism of cross-species transmission of HEV infection, including viral determinants, such as the open reading frames (ORFs), codon usage and adaptive evolution, as well as host determinants, such as host cellular factors and the host immune status, which possibly play pivotal roles during this event. The pathogenesis of hepatitis E infection will be briefly discussed, including the special forms of this disease, including extrahepatic manifestations, chronic infection, and fulminant hepatitis in pregnant women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthohepevirus A 3aanimals 3acodon usage 3aevolutionary adaptation 3ahepatitis E 3aindustrialization 3apathogenesis 3arisk 3awater pollution 3azoonoses1 aNagashima, Shigeo 1 aOkamoto, H.q(Hiroaki),0 tViruses.g2021 May 14, v. 13, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130509093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03955naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245015200178520247000330592002802800650003002828650001002858650001902868650001002887650001302897650001902910650001002929650001902939650001702958650001402975650001202989651001103001700001903012700001903031700002103050700002303071700002303094700002103117700002003138700002403158700002703182700002803209700002303237773012303260856008103383852000903464655001203473IND60742697220221122034817.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074269722DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100607682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Cordón, Pedro J.10aEvaluation of Lesions and Viral Antigen Distribution in Domestic Pigs Inoculated Intranasally with African Swine Fever Virus Ken05/Tk1 (Genotype X)  aThe understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms and the clinicopathological forms caused by currently circulating African swine fever virus (ASFV) isolates is incomplete. So far, most of the studies have been focused on isolates classified within genotypes I and II, the only genotypes that have circulated outside of Africa. However, less is known about the clinical presentations and lesions induced by isolates belonging to the other twenty-two genotypes. Therefore, the early clinicopathological identification of disease outbreaks caused by isolates belonging to, as yet, not well-characterised ASFV genotypes may be compromised, which might cause a delay in the implementation of control measures to halt the virus spread. To improve the pathological characterisation of disease caused by diverse isolates, we have refined the macroscopic and histopathological evaluation protocols to standardise the scoring of lesions. Domestic pigs were inoculated intranasally with different doses (high, medium and low) of ASFV isolate Ken05/Tk1 (genotype X). To complement previous studies, the distribution and severity of macroscopic and histopathological lesions, along with the amount and distribution of viral antigen in tissues, were characterised by applying the new scoring protocols. The intranasal inoculation of domestic pigs with high doses of the Ken05/Tk1 isolate induced acute forms of ASF in most of the animals. Inoculation with medium doses mainly induced acute forms of disease. A less severe but longer clinical course, typical of subacute forms, characterised by the presence of more widespread and severe haemorrhages and oedema, was observed in one pig inoculated with the medium dose. The severity of vascular lesions (haemorrhages and oedema) induced by high and medium doses was not associated with the amount of virus antigen detected in tissues, therefore these might be attributed to indirect mechanisms not evaluated in the present study. The absence of clinical signs, lesions and detectable levels of virus genome or antigen in blood from the animals inoculated with the lowest dose ruled out the existence of possible asymptomatic carriers or persistently infected pigs, at least for the 21 days period of the study. The results corroborate the moderate virulence of the Ken05/Tk1 isolate, as well as its capacity to induce both the acute and, occasionally, subacute forms of ASF when high and medium doses were administered intranasally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAfrican swine fever virus 3ablood 3adisease course 3aedema 3agenotype 3ahistopathology 3aswine 3aviral antigens 3aviral genome 3avirulence 3aviruses 3aAfrica1 aFloyd, Tobias 1 aHicks, Daniel 1 aCrooke, Helen R.1 aMcCleary, Stephen 1 aMcCarthy, Ronan R.1 aStrong, Rebecca 1 aDixon, Linda K.1 aNeimanis, Aleksija 1 aWikström-Lassa, Emil 1 aGavier-Widén, Dolores,1 aNuñez, Alejandro,0 tPathogens.g2021 June 18, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100607683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245012300157300002000280500001900300520112500319592002801444650001501472650001101487650001301498650001501511653002901526653002301555653002001578653003601598653002401634700001301658700001601671700001501687700001201702700001801714700005401732700005401786700001601840700005501856773014301911856007802054852000902132655001202141IND60713758520221119131641.0201023e20200917xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071375852DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c139932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Ran10aNoncovalently Fused-Ring Electron Acceptors with C₂ᵥ Symmetry for Regulating the Morphology of Organic Solar Cells  ap. 46220-46230.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFour noncovalently fused-ring electron acceptors p-DOC6-2F, o-DOC6-2F, o-DOC8-2F, and o-DOC2C6-2F have been designed and synthesized. p-DOC6-2F and o-DOC6-2F have the same molecular backbone but different molecular shapes and symmetries. p-DOC6-2F has an S-shaped molecular backbone and C₂ₕ symmetry, whereas o-DOC6-2F possesses a U-shaped molecular backbone and C₂ᵥ symmetry. The molecular shape and symmetry can influence the dipole moment, solubility, optical absorption, energy level, molecular packing, and film morphology. Compared with the corresponding p-DOC6-2F, o-DOC6-2F exhibits better solubility, a wider band gap, and a larger dipole moment. When blended with the donor polymer PBDB-T, the C₂ᵥ symmetric o-DOC6-2F can form an appropriate active layer morphology, whereas the C₂ₕ symmetric p-DOC6-2F forms oversized domains. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on p-DOC6-2F, o-DOC6-2F, o-DOC8-2F, and o-DOC2C6-2F obtained power conversion efficiencies of 9.23, 11.87, 11.23, and 10.80%, respectively.

These maps, which may be based on prior yield, soil texture, topography, or soil electrical conductivity data, are often manually applied at the beginning of an irrigation season and remain static. The problem with static prescription maps is that they ignore spatiotemporal changes in crop water status. In a two-year study (2012 and 2013), a plant feedback system, including a wireless sensor network of infrared thermometers (IRTs), was used to develop dynamic prescription maps to accomplish adaptive irrigation scheduling for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). One-half of a center pivot field was divided into manually and plant feedback-controlled irrigation treatment plots. Irrigation treatments were at three levels, 75, 50 and 25 percent of full as defined by either replenishment of crop water use to field capacity or by the equivalent threshold of the IRT sensed crop water stress. The system accepted user input to control irrigation for the manual treatment plots (I75M, I50M, and I25M), and calculated and compared a thermal stress index for each plant feedback-controlled treatment plot (I75C, I50C and I25C) with a pre-determined threshold for automated irrigation scheduling. The effectiveness of the plant feedback irrigation scheduling system was evaluated by comparing measured lint yield, crop water use (ETc), and water use efficiency (WUE) with the manually scheduled treatment plots. Results for both years indicated that average lint yields were similar between the manual and plant feedback-control plots at the I75 level (181 and 182gm−2, respectively, in 2012; 115 and 103gm−2, respectively, in 2013) and I50 level (146 and 164gm−2, respectively, in 2012; 95 and 117gm−2, respectively, in 2013). At the I25 level, average lint yield was significantly greater for the plant feedback-compared with the manual-control treatment plots (142gm−2 and 92gm−2, respectively), but the mean amount of irrigation was twice that of the manual-control plots. Mean water use efficiencies (WUE) within the same irrigation treatment levels were similar between methods. Importantly, the automatic plant feedback system did not require the time consuming and expensive manual reading of neutron probe access tubes that was required to schedule the manual treatments. These results demonstrate that the integration of a plant feedback system with a commercial VRI system could be used to control site-specific irrigation management for cotton at higher irrigation treatment levels, i.e., I75 percent and I50 percent of full. Such a system can facilitate the use of a VRI system by automating prescription map coding and providing dynamic irrigation control instructions to meet variable crop water needs throughout the irrigation season. As of yet, further research is required to maintain automatic deficit irrigation at a level equivalent to 25 percent replenishment of crop water use relative to field capacity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3adeficit irrigation 3aelectrical conductivity 3afield capacity 3airrigation rates 3airrigation scheduling 3alint yield 3asoil texture 3athermal stress 3athermometers 3atopography 3awater stress 3awater use efficiency 0aCenter pivot 0aInfrared thermometry 0aIrrigation scheduling 0aPlant feedback 0aWireless sensor network1 aEvett, Steven R.1 aColaizzi, Paul D.0 tAgricultural water management.g2015 Sept., v. 159 p.123-138dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2015.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001700156245010800173300001400281520159500295592002801890650001301918650001501931650001601946650001501962650001401977650001601991650001202007650002302019650001402042650001302056650001102069650001402080650001402094650001102108650001902119650001502138650001102153700002102164773009702185856005702282852000902339655001202348IND50085911820221118050217.0140412e198403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008591182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.1984.tb00590.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, Ann,10aNutritional factors affecting the behaviour of Uromyces viciae‐fabae uredospores on broad bean leaves  ap. 71-80.  aBoth germination of Uromyces viciae‐fabae uredospores and growth of germ tubes were increased when spores were leached for 12 h at 0.4 ml/min water flow whereas leaching at aflow rate of 2.8 ml/min completely inhibited germination. Washing uredospores once in water caused a reduction in growth of germ tubes and in the numbers of lesions produced on detached leaves of the host, broad bean (Vicia faba). During germination uredospores from recently formed pustules leaked considerably moreendogenous nutrients on hydration than older uredospores. However, the majority of the leaked compounds were reabsorbed by young uredospores within a few hours. Concentrations ofglucose and leucine equivalents leaked from uredospores and from leaves were compared. Leaf leachates stimulated growth of uredospore germ tubes to an extent similar to that caused by low concentrations of glucose and amino acids but the addition of pollen inhibited growth of germ tubes. A variety of nutrients caused stimulation of uredospore germination and growth of germ tubes at low concentrations whereas higher concentrations of exogenous nutrients inhibited these processes. The response of uredospores was affected by their age. Utilization of exogenous ¹⁴C‐labelled nutrients by germinating uredospores was very low compared with that of cells of a leaf surface yeast, Cryptococcus sp. Cryptococcus; cells could consume over 90% of the glucose in a solution of glucose and amino acids of concentrations similar to those in leaf leachates before germinating U. viciae‐fabae uredospores had taken up 10%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUromyces 3aVicia faba 3aamino acids 3afaba beans 3agerm tube 3agermination 3aglucose 3agrowth retardation 3aleachates 3aleaching 3aleaves 3anutrients 3anutrition 3apollen 3aurediniospores 3awater flow 3ayeasts1 aBlakeman, J.

Previous phylogenetic studies largely restricted to few mitochondrial markers found many species in the grasshopper subfamily Gomphocerinae to be para- or polyphyletic, presumably because of incomplete lineage sorting and ongoing hybridization between putatively young lineages. Resolving the phylogeny of the Chorthippus biguttulus species complex is important because many morphologically cryptic species occupy overlapping ranges across Eurasia and serve important ecological functions. We investigated whether multispecies coalescent analysis of 540 genes generated by transcriptome sequencing could resolve the phylogeny of the C. biguttulus complex and related Gomphocerinae species. Our divergence time estimates confirm that Gomphocerinae is a very young radiation, with an age estimated at 1.38 (2.35–0.77) mya for the C. biguttulus complex. Our estimated topology based on complete mitogenomes recovered some species as para- or polyphyletic. In contrast, the multispecies coalescent based on nuclear genes retrieved all species as monophyletic clusters, corroborating most taxonomic hypotheses. Our results underline the importance of using nuclear multispecies coalescent methods for studying young radiations and highlight the need of further taxonomic revision in Gomphocerinae grasshoppers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChorthippus biguttulus 3acryptic species 3agrasshoppers 3ahybridization 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 3apolyphyly 3ataxonomic revisions 3atopology 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aEurasia 0aCaelifera 0aChorthippus 0aCoalescent 0aMolecular clock 0aPseudochorthippus 0aTaxonomy1 aOrtiz, Edgardo M.1 aNoori, Sajad1 aWebster, Kathleen C.1 aHusemann, Martin1 aPereira, Ricardo J.0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2022 May, v. 170 p.107439-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2022.1074393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03607naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015500165300002000320520176800340592002802108596006902136596012902205596012902334650001502463650001502478650001702493650001802510650001302528650001102541650000702552650001402559650001902573650001302592650001302605650002302618650001902641650002102660700002702681700002502708700002002733700003702753700002002790700005602810773015502866856008303021852000903104655001203113IND60751229920221121220548.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075122992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13757-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuiz, Isabel10aSynthesis, characterization, and assessment of novel sulfonated polynorbornene dicarboximides as adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from water  ap. 52014-52031.  aThe occurrence of heavy metals in the natural aquatic systems arising from anthropogenic sources is an issue of global and environmental concern because of their extremely harmful effects to living beings even in rather low concentrations. The synthesis and ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) of novel norbornene dicarboximides bearing highly aromatic pendant groups, specifically, N-4-tritylphenyl-norbornene-5,6-dicarboximide (2a) and N-2,4,6-(triphenyl)phenyl-norbornene-5,6-dicarboximide (2b), their hydrogenation and further polymer sulfonation to render them adsorbents for the uptake of heavy metal ions from water is reported in this study. The macromolecules were characterized by means of FT-IR, ¹H NMR, and thermal analysis, among others. A thoroughly kinetic and isothermal study of adsorption in single and ternary aqueous solutions of Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, and Ni²⁺ was performed considering several experimental variables for instance initial metal concentration, contact time and solution pH. In general, the experimental data were adjusted more efficiently to the pseudo-second order kinetic model and to the Freundlich isotherm model, respectively. The maximum removal amounts were found to be 55.7 mg/g for Pb²⁺, 33.9 mg/g for Cd²⁺, and 10.2 mg/g for Ni²⁺ in the sulfonated trityl-bearing polymer 5a while those found for the sulfonated triphenyl-bearing polymer 5b were 31.5 mg/g for Pb²⁺, 26.6 mg/g for Cd²⁺, and 7.0 mg/g for Ni²⁺, respectively. The higher heavy metal removal capacity of polymer 5a was attributed to its also higher degree of sulfonation. The outcomes indicate that these novel sulfonic acid containing polymer-based adsorbents are effective for the uptake of heavy metallic elements from water.  aPublisher supplied data  aSEP-CONACYT CB:239947cConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología  aDGAPA-UNAM PAPIIT IN106819cDirección General de Asuntos del Personal Académico, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México  aDGAPA-UNAM PAPIIT IA103019cDirección General de Asuntos del Personal Académico, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogenation 3akinetics 3amodels 3apH 3apollution 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aresearch 3asorption isotherms 3asulfonic acids 3athermal analysis1 aCorona-García, Carlos1 aSantiago, Arlette A.1 aAbatal, Mohamed1 aTéllez Arias, Mercedes Gabriela1 aAlfonso, Ismeli1 aVargas, Joel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9227-83540 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 37 p.52014-52031dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13757-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245015200202300001800354500002000372506007600392520135900468592002801827506003701855650002201892650002601914650001201940650001101952650001001963650001401973650002301987650003402010650001202044650001002056650001802066650002202084650001402106650001902120650000802139650002302147650001402170650001402184650001002198700001902208700001802227700003102245700002202276700001702298700001602315700002002331700001802351700001902369700002402388700002102412700002202433700002402455700002202479700002302501700001902524700001502543700001702558773010002575856007302675852000902748655001202757IND60571441620221207121136.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057144162DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.143722doi7 aPMC53478692pmcid7 a279350412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPraz, Coraline R.10aAvrPm2 encodes an RNase‐like avirulence effector which is conserved in the two different specialized forms of wheat and rye powdery mildew fungus  ap. 1301-1314.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is a large diversity of genetically defined resistance genes in bread wheat against the powdery mildew pathogen Blumeria graminis (B. g.) f. sp. tritici. Many confer race‐specific resistance to this pathogen, but until now only the mildew avirulence gene AvrPm3ᵃ²/ᶠ² that is recognized by Pm3a/f was known molecularly. We performed map‐based cloning and genome‐wide association studies to isolate a candidate for the mildew avirulence gene AvrPm2. We then used transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana to demonstrate specific and strong recognition of AvrPm2 by Pm2. The virulent AvrPm2 allele arose from a conserved 12 kb deletion, while there is no protein sequence diversity in the gene pool of avirulent B. g. tritici isolates. We found one polymorphic AvrPm2 allele in B. g. triticale and one orthologue in B. g. secalis and both are recognized by Pm2. AvrPm2 belongs to a small gene family encoding structurally conserved RNase‐like effectors, including Avrₐ₁₃ from B. g. hordei, the cognate Avr of the barley resistance gene Mla13. These results demonstrate the conservation of functional avirulence genes in two cereal powdery mildews specialized on different hosts, thus providing a possible explanation for successful introgression of resistance genes from rye or other grass relatives to wheat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBlumeria graminis 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aalleles 3abarley 3afungi 3agene pool 3agenetic resistance 3agenome-wide association study 3agrasses 3ahosts 3aintrogression 3amolecular cloning 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3arye 3asequence diversity 3atriticale 3avirulence 3awheat1 aBourras, Salim1 aZeng, Fansong1 aSánchez‐Martín, Javier1 aMenardo, Fabrizio1 aXue, Minfeng1 aYang, Lijun1 aRoffler, Stefan1 aBöni, Rainer1 aHerren, Gerard1 aMcNally, Kaitlin E.1 aBen‐David, Roi1 aParlange, Francis1 aOberhaensli, Simone1 aFlückiger, Simon1 aSchäfer, Luisa K.1 aWicker, Thomas1 aYu, Dazhao1 aKeller, Beat0 tnew phytologist.g2017 Feb., v. 213, no. 3 p.1301-1314dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.143723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245018300174300001800357520145000375592002801825650003001853650003101883650001401914650002201928650002101950650001701971650001901988650002202007650001802029650001602047650001902063650001602082650002102098650001302119650002002132650001302152650001302165650001502178650001702193650003202210651001302242653001002255653001502265653000902280700002002289700002602309700002702335700002402362700002302386700006202409773013302471856008502604852000902689655001202698IND60649685420221123040718.0190705e20190606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064968542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b001662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWithatanung, Patoo10aQuantitative Proteomics Reveals Differences in the Response of Neutrophils Isolated from Healthy or Diabetic Subjects to Infection with Capsule-Variant Burkholderia thailandensis  ap. 2848-2858.  aIn Thailand, diabetes mellitus is the most significant risk factor for melioidosis, a severe disease caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. In this study, neutrophils isolated from healthy or diabetic subjects were infected with B. thailandensis E555, a variant strain with a B. pseudomallei-like capsular polysaccharide used here as a surrogate micro-organism for B. pseudomallei. At 2 h post-infection, neutrophil proteins were subjected to 4-plex iTRAQ-based comparative proteomic analysis. A total of 341 proteins were identified in two or more samples, of which several proteins involved in oxidative stress and inflammation were enriched in infected diabetic neutrophils. We validated this finding by demonstrating that infected diabetic neutrophils generated significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-17 compared to healthy neutrophils. Our data also revealed that infected neutrophils from healthy or diabetic individuals undergo apoptotic cell death at distinctly different rates, with infected diabetic neutrophils showing a diminished ability to delay apoptosis and an increased likelihood of undergoing a lytic form of cell death, compared to infected neutrophils from healthy individuals. Increased expression of inflammatory proteins by infected neutrophils could contribute to the increased susceptibility to infection and inflammation in diabetic patients in melioidosis-endemic areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia pseudomallei 3aBurkholderia thailandensis 3aapoptosis 3adiabetes mellitus 3adisease severity 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amelioidosis 3amicroorganisms 3aneutrophils 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3arisk factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aThailand 0aiTRAQ 0aneutrophil 0aBTCV1 aKurian, Dominic1 aTangjittipokin, Watip1 aPlengvidhya, Nattachet1 aTitball, Richard W.1 aKorbsrisate, Sunee1 aStevens, Joanne M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9992-28540 tJournal of proteome research.g2019 June 06, v. 18, no. 7 p.2848-2858dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b001663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013000169300001600299520101000315592002801325596009801353650002001451650001001471650002001481650001301501650001401514650001401528650001601542650001101558650001401569650002001583650001801603650001801621650002701639653002301666653001501689653001601704653001301720653002501733653002001758700001901778773012201797856008501919852000902004655001202013IND60638859720221121225256.0190430e20190304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063885972DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2017.14054002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Wen-Wen10aMultiple-physiological benefits of bird’s nest fern (Asplenium australasicum) frond extract for dermatological applications  ap. 736-741.  ap-coumaric acid and fucose-rich polysaccharide have been studied for many bio-functions in skin including cutaneous protection from oxidative damage and antiageing, respectively, as well as wound healing. The physiological activities of various bird’s nest fern extracts (BNFE), containing considerable fucose-rich mucilage and p-coumaric acid, on fibroblast and human skin were first investigated. BNFE with higher polysaccharide content generally contributed to a better moisture holding capability. Furthermore, BNFE showed pronouncedly enhancing effect on collagen production and growth of fibroblast (NIH-3T3), clinical trial results revealed that the emulsions with 1% BNFE showed good moisturising effect and improved the elasticity of human skins effectively. The potential of BNFE for cosmetics and medical applications such as natural moisturiser, antiageing and wound repairing was possibly related to the fucose-rich mucilage and various phenolic compounds including p-coumaric acid in BNFE.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSC 101-2313-B-005 -048 -MY3cNational Science Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001868 3aAsplenium nidus 3abirds 3aclinical trials 3acollagen 3acosmetics 3aemulsions 3afibroblasts 3ahumans 3amucilages 3ap-coumaric acid 3askin (animal) 3atissue repair 3awater holding capacity 0aBird’s nest fern 0afibroblast 0askin ageing 0acollagen 0afucose-rich mucilage 0ap-coumaric acid1 aLai, Lih-Shiuh0 tNatural product research.g2019 Mar. 4, v. 33, no. 5 p.736-741dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2017.14054003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04193naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245015400172506010400326506007600430520241700506592002802923506003702951650002302988650002003011650001403031650001403045650001003059650002203069650001503091650001403106650002203120650002003142650002503162650001803187650001303205651001003218651001003228651000903238651001003247653002303257653001303280653002203293653002403315653002203339700001703361700001803378700002003396700001403416773011503430856008503545852000903630655001203639IND60767936620221207111433.0220326e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076793662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2022.1052522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNehra, Anil Kumar10aMolecular insights into the population structure and haplotype network of Theileria annulata based on the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) gene  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present study was conducted to elucidate the population genetic diversity and haplotype network of Theileria annulata based on all available nearly complete 18S rRNA gene sequences in the GenBank™. In total, 52 sequences of the nuclear 18S rRNA gene used to assess the relationship of T. annulata with their country of origin identified 34 haplotypes. Haplotype 4 was widespread, occurring in India, China, Turkey and Iran, while the remaining haplotypes were singleton and unique to one country. Haplotype 4 displayed numerous single haplotypes around it and the stellate shape of the network suggested a rapid population expansion. India exhibited the largest number of haplotypes (h = 25) followed by Turkey (h = 6), China (h = 4), and Iran and Italy (h = 1). No geographical clustering of haplotypes was recorded. Nucleotide diversity was the highest in the Turkish followed by the Indian and Chinese populations. Similarly, haplotype diversity was the highest in China followed by Turkey, and the lowest in India. The overall dataset exhibited a low nucleotide diversity (0.00253 ± 0.00035), but high haplotype diversity (0.917 ± 0.034). It suggested the presence of only minor differences (01–11 nucleotide) between haplotypes which was also evident from the haplotype network. A high level of genetic diversity was documented within the Indian, Chinese and Turkish populations of T. annulata, whereas little genetic differentiation was noticed among these populations with a very high level of gene flow. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) of T. annulata sequences revealed higher genetic variation within countries (83.58%) as compared to the variation among countries (16.42%). Neutrality indices, viz., Tajima's D, Fu and Li's F, Fu's Fₛ, and R₂, along with the unimodal mismatch distributions demonstrated a recent population expansion of T. annulata in India and the overall dataset. However, the non-significant values of Tajima's D, Fu and Li's F, and Fu's Fₛ for the Chinese population along with a bimodal mismatch distribution signified a constant population size. For the Turkish population, the neutrality and mismatch distribution tests either indicated a constant or a slight increase in population size. The present study provides novel insights into the population genetics and haplotype network of T. annulata based on the 18S rRNA gene for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTheileria annulata 3adata collection 3aevolution 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ainfection 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3apopulation structure 3aribosomal RNA 3avariance 3aChina 3aIndia 3aIran 3aItaly 0aTheileria annulata 0a18S rRNA 0aGenetic diversity 0aPopulation genetics 0aHaplotype network1 aKumari, Ansu1 aKundave, V.R.1 aVohra, Sukhdeep1 aRam, Hira0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2022 Apr., v. 99 p.105252-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2022.1052523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01054naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008900157300001600246520024600262592002800508650001400536650001900550650001600569651001300585773010800598856007300706852000900779655001200788IND60082576620221119023111.0141029e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008257662DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.004182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManit Kidyoo,10aCeropegia suddeei sp. nov.

This study investigated and compared spatial distribution and variability of carbon storage in 8 sympodial bamboo species in China. The results of this study showed that average carbon densities (CDs) in the different organs decreased in the order: culms (0.4754 g g⁻¹) > below-ground (0.4701 g g⁻¹) > branches (0.4662 g g⁻¹) > leaves (0.4420 g g⁻¹). Spatial distribution of carbon storage (CS) on an area basis in the biomass of 8 sympodial bamboo species was in the order: culms (17.4–77.1%) > below-ground (10.6–71.7%) > branches (3.8–11.6%) > leaves (0.9–5.1%). Total CSs in the sympodial bamboo ecosystems ranged from 103.6 Mg C ha⁻¹ in Bambusa textilis McClure stand to 194.2 Mg C ha⁻¹ in Dendrocalamus giganteus Munro stand. Spatial distribution of CSs in 8 sympodial bamboo ecosystems decreased in the order: soil (68.0–83.5%) > vegetation (16.8–31.1%) > litter (0.3–1.7%). Total current CS and biomass carbon sequestration rate in the sympodial bamboo stands studied in China is 93.184 × 10⁶ Mg C ha⁻¹ and 8.573 × 10⁶ Mg C yr⁻¹, respectively. The sympodial bamboos had a greater CSs and higher carbon sequestration rates relative to other bamboo species. Sympodial bamboos can play an important role in improving climate and economy in the widely cultivated areas of the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBambusa textilis 3aDendrocalamus giganteus 3abamboos 3abiomass 3abranches 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aculms 3acultivation area 3aecosystems 3aleaves 3asoil 3avegetation 3aChina 0aSympodial bamboo 0aCarbon density (CD) 0aCarbon storage (CS) 0aSpatial distribution 0aCarbon sequestration rate1 aXiang, Tingting1 aHuang, Zhangting1 aWu, Jiasen1 aJiang, Peikun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4504-86361 aMeng, Cifu1 aLi, Yongfu1 aFuhrmann, Jeffry J.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 168 p.46-52dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.11.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245007500177300001600252520136700268592002801635650001901663650002501682650001101707650001801718650001801736650002601754650001301780650001801793650001901811650003101830650001401861650001201875650001801887650001601905650001101921653001801932653001801950653002301968653002501991700002902016700003202045700003602077700001602113700002502129700002902154700003002183773013502213856008402348852000902432655001202441IND50076270220221119115533.0150325e20130101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007627022DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2013.7453712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia-Ortuño, Teresa10aEvaluation of the Different Uses of Washingtonia robusta Pruning Waste  ap. 623-631.  aThis research work was conducted to investigate the possibility of using Washingtonia robusta H.

In the growing media experiment, variable factors were the particle size (0.25–4, 2–4, 1–2, and 0.25–1 mm), and in the particleboard experiment, the variables wereg the particle size (2–4, 1–2, and 0.25–1 mm), press temperature (120 and 140 ᵒC), and press pressure (15.7 and 21.0 kg cm ⁻²). The main physical and chemical properties of the growing media were determined and the experimental panels were tested for their mechanical and physical properties according to the procedures defined by European Union (EN) standards. With respect to agricultural value, the W. robusta pruning waste had low macro- and microelement contents [except in the case of potassium (K)] and high carbon (C) / nitrogen (N) ratio values (C/N ratio >130), and the majority of the studied physical properties were not inside the interval of values for an ideal substrate. On the other hand, in general, the physical and mechanical properties of the particleboards from the W. robusta pruning waste were appropriate according to the EN standards for particleboards. These properties were more significantly affected by the particle size than by the board manufacturing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aWashingtonia robusta 3acarbon 3agrowing media 3amanufacturing 3amechanical properties 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3aparticleboards 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotassium 3apruning 3araw materials 3atemperature 3awastes 0aParticleboard 0apruning waste 0asoilless substrate 0aWashingtonia robusta1 aAndreu-Rodriguez, Javier1 aFerrandez-Garcia, M.

E185-E192.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA strong positive correlation between vegetation canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region and foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration (%N) has been reported in some temperate and boreal forests. This relationship, if true, would indicate an additional role for nitrogen in the climate system via its influence on surface albedo and may offer a simple approach for monitoring foliar nitrogen using satellite data. We report, however, that the previously reported correlation is an artifact—it is a consequence of variations in canopy structure, rather than of %N. The data underlying this relationship were collected at sites with varying proportions of foliar nitrogen-poor needleleaf and nitrogen-rich broadleaf species, whose canopy structure differs considerably. When the BRF data are corrected for canopy-structure effects, the residual reflectance variations are negatively related to %N at all wavelengths in the interval 423–855 nm. This suggests that the observed positive correlation between BRF and %N conveys no information about %N. We find that to infer leaf biochemical constituents, e.g., N content, from remotely sensed data, BRF spectra in the interval 710–790 nm provide critical information for correction of structural influences. Our analysis also suggests that surface characteristics of leaves impact remote sensing of its internal constituents. This further decreases the ability to remotely sense canopy foliar nitrogen. Finally, the analysis presented here is generic to the problem of remote sensing of leaf-tissue constituents and is therefore not a specific critique of articles espousing remote sensing of foliar %N.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aboreal forests 3acanopy 3aclimate 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3awavelengths 0aradiative effect 0aspurious regression 0aplant ecology 0acarbon cycle1 aSchull, Mitchell A.1 aStenberg, Pauline1 aMõttus, Matti1 aRautiainen, Miina1 aYang, Yan1 aMarshak, A.q(Alexander),1 aLatorre Carmona, Pedro1 aKaufmann, Robertq(Robert K.),1 aLewis, Philip1 aDisney, Mathias I.1 aVanderbilt, Vern1 aDavis, A.

We now report a competing rearrangement, revealed by CASPT2(14,12) and B3LYP calculations, in which C-phenylnitrile imines 8 undergo ring expansion to 1-diazenyl-1,2,4,6-cycloheptatetraenes 12 akin to the phenylcarbene—cycloheptatetraene rearrangement. Amino-, hydroxy-, and thiol-groups in the meta positions of C-phenylnitrile imine lower the activation energies for this rearrangement so that it becomes potentially competitive with the cyclization to 1H-diazirines and hence rearrange to carbodiimides. The diazenylcycloheptatetraenes 12 thus formed can evolve further to cycloheptatetraene 30 and 2-diazenyl-phenylcarbene 16 over modest activation barriers, and the latter carbenes cyclize very easily to 2H- and 3H-indazoles, from which 6-methylenecyclohexadienylidene, phenylcarbene, fulvenallene, and their isomers are potentially obtainable. Moreover, another new rearrangement of benzonitrile imine forms 3-phenyl-3H-diazirine, which is a precursor of phenyldiazomethane and hence phenylcarbene. This reaction is competitive with the ring expansion. The new rearrangements predicted here should be experimentally observable, for example, under matrix photolysis or flash vacuum pyrolysis conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acarbenes 3acycloaddition reactions 3aimines 3aisomers 3aorganic chemistry 3aphotolysis 3apyrolysis1 aDargelos, Alain1 aWentrup, Curt1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0874-71440 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2019 June 07, v. 84, no. 13 p.8668-8673dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.9b011833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010100164300001600265520086700281592002801148650001201176650004301188650001901231650002301250650003101273650002001304650001901324650000901343650002201352650004701374650004501421650001501466700001601481700001301497700001301510700001501523700001301538773010801551856008101659852000901740655001201749IND60550222220221118163434.0160909e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055022222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-005-2010-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagihara, E.10aMolecular mapping of a fertility restorer gene for Owen cytoplasmic male sterility in sugar beet  ap. 250-255.  aWe report here the molecular mapping of a fertility restorer gene (named Rf1) for Owen cytoplasmic male sterility in sugar beet. Eight AFLP and two RAPD markers, tightly linked to the Rf1 locus, were identified using bulked segregant analysis. Three AFLP markers, mAFEM972, mAFEM976 and mAFEM985, were found to co-segregate with the Rf1 allele in our mapping populations. With the help of RFLP markers, previously mapped on the sugar beet genome, we showed that Rf1 is positioned in the terminal region of linkage group Kiel III/Koeln IV. This map location agrees well with that found for the restorer gene X, which suggests that the Rf1 locus corresponds to the X locus. The availability of the molecular markers will facilitate the selection of maintainer–pollinator lines in breeding program and provide the foundation for map-based cloning of the Rf1 gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abreeding lines 3achromosome mapping 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3agenetic markers 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amolecular cloning 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asugar beet1 aItchoda, N.1 aHabu, Y.1 aIida, S.1 aMikami, T.1 aKubo, T.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2005 July, v. 111, no. 2 p.250-255dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-005-2010-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011300154520167700267592002801944650002001972650001901992650001302011700001602024700001502040773012802055856007502183852000902258655001202267IND60771417920221121225113.0220325e20220316xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077141792DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140614362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Bo 13aAn Adaptively Attention-Driven Cascade Part-Based Graph Embedding Framework for UAV Object Re-Identification  aWith the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), object re-identification (Re-ID) based on the UAV platforms has attracted increasing attention, and several excellent achievements have been shown in the traditional scenarios. However, object Re-ID in aerial imagery acquired from the UAVs is still a challenging task, which is mainly due to the reason that variable locations and diverse viewpoints in UAVs platform are always resulting in more appearance ambiguities among the intra-objects and inter-objects. To address the above issues, in this paper, we proposed an adaptively attention-driven cascade part-based graph embedding framework (AAD-CPGE) for UAV object Re-ID. The AAD-CPGE aims to optimally fuse node features and their topological characteristics on the multi-scale structured graphs of parts-based objects, and then adaptively learn the most correlated information for improving the object Re-ID performance. Specifically, we first executed GCNs on the parts-based cascade node feature graphs and topological feature graphs for acquiring multi-scale structured-graph feature representations. After that, we designed a self-attention-based module for adaptive node and topological features fusion on the constructed hierarchical parts-based graphs. Finally, these learning hybrid graph-structured features with the most correlation discriminative capability were applied for object Re-ID. Several experimental verifications on three widely used UAVs-based benchmark datasets were carried out, and comparison with some state-of-the-art object Re-ID approaches validated the effectiveness and benefits of our proposed AAD-CPGE Re-ID framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aremote sensing 3atopology1 aZhang, Rui 1 aChen, Hao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Mar. 16, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140614363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245013900172300001600311520131400327592002801641650001501669650002801684650001701712650001901729650001101748650001601759650000901775650001901784650001801803650003101821650001501852650001701867650001701884650003001901653000901931653000801940653000801948653000801956653000901964653000701973653000901980653000901989653000801998653000802006653001302014653000802027653000802035653000802043653000802051653002002059653002502079653000902104653001402113653001002127653002502137700002102162700002002183700001902203700001302222700001602235700001902251773012302270856008902393852000902482655001202491IND60549684320221120133023.0190410e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054968432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.08.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Li-Jun10aAntitumor activity evaluation of meso-tetra (pyrrolidine substituted) pentylporphin-mediated photodynamic therapy in vitro and in vivo  ap. 224-231.  aPhotodynamic therapy is a minimally invasive and promising new method in cancer treatment and has attracted considerable attention in recent years. An ideal photosensitizer is a crucial element to photodynamic therapy. In the present paper, a novel porphyrin derivative, 5, 10, 15, 20-tetrakis (5-(pyrrolidin-1-yl) pentyl) porphin (TPPP) was synthesized. Its spectroscopic and physicochemical properties, therapeutic efficacy as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy for human bladder cancer in vitro and in vivo were investigated. TPPP had strong absorption at 648nm (ε=1.75×104M−1cm−1), and two fluorescence emission peaks at 652nm and 718nm. PDT with TPPP showed low dark toxicity and high phototoxicity to human bladder cancer T24 cells in vitro. In bearing T24 tumor nude mice, the growth of tumor was significantly inhibited by combining use of 5mg/kg TPPP with 100J/cm2 (650nm, 180mW/cm2) laser irradiation at 3h following injection of TPPP. The antitumor effect was also confirmed with histopathological assay. The histopathological study results revealed that PDT using TPPP and 100J/cm2 (650nm, 180mW/cm2) laser irradiation induced tumor cells shrunken and necrotic. These results indicate that TPPP is useful as a new photosensitizer in PDT for cancer, and deserves further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantineoplastic activity 3afluorescence 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3airradiation 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3aphototoxicity 3aphysicochemical properties 3aporphyrins 3aspectroscopy 3atherapeutics 3aurinary bladder neoplasms 0aTPPP 0aPDT 0aROS 0a1O2 0aDPBF 0aMS 0aDMEM 0aDMSO 0aDMF 0aPBS 0aT24 cell 0aFBS 0aH&E 0aHpD 0aMTT 0aPhotosensitizer 0aPhotodynamic therapy 0aTPPP 0aPorphyrin 0aTumor 0aHuman bladder cancer1 aZhang, Xiang-Hua1 aLiao, Ping-Yong1 aSun, Jing-Jian1 aWang, Li1 aYan, Yi-Jia1 aChen, Zhi-Long0 tJournal of photochemistry and photobiology.g2016 Oct., v. 163 p.224-231dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6193x1011-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2016.08.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02423naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010700173520109000280592002801370650002401398650002301422650001601445650002501461650001401486650001301500650001701513650001401530651003701544700002101581700002001602700003101622700002401653700002201677700001901699700002101718700002401739700002501763773012301788856008101911852000901992655001202001IND60742706720221122220157.0210624e20210608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074270672DNAL7 a10.3390/pathogens100607202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVieri, Melissa Krizia10aSerotonin Levels in the Serum of Persons with Onchocerciasis-Associated Epilepsy: A Case-Control Study  aOnchocerciasis-associated epilepsy (OAE) is a devastating childhood disorder occurring in areas with high Onchocerca volvulus transmission. Despite epidemiological evidence showing the association between O. volvulus and epilepsy, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Since high levels of serotonin are known to induce seizures, we investigated serotonin levels in persons with OAE and controls selected from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Serum serotonin levels were determined by ELISA in 19 persons with OAE, 32 persons with epilepsy without O. volvulus infection, 18 with O. volvulus infection but without epilepsy, and 35 with neither O. volvulus infection nor epilepsy. O. volvulus infection was diagnosed by skin snip testing and/or OV16 antibody detection. Serum serotonin levels were significantly decreased in persons with OAE compared to persons with O. volvulus infection and no epilepsy. In conclusion, an increased serotonin level is unable to explain the pathogenesis of OAE. Other hypotheses to identify the causal mechanism of OAE will need to be investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOnchocerca volvulus 3aantibody detection 3ablood serum 3acase-control studies 3achildhood 3aepilepsy 3apathogenesis 3aserotonin 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo1 aHotterbeekx, An 1 aMandro, Michel 1 aSiewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson1 aDusabimana, Alfred 1 aNyisi, Francoise 1 aMukendi, Deby 1 aGwatsvaira, Joe 1 aKumar-Singh, Samir 1 aColebunders, Robert 0 tPathogens.g2021 June 08, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27146x2076-08177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens100607203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02183naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245011100160300001600271520108700287592002801374650000901402650001501411650002401426650002401450650002101474650002101495650001301516650001101529650001701540700002101557700001701578773015201595856007701747852000901824655001201833IND60765238420221121045032.0220422e20171222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076523842DNAL7 a10.17221/50/2017-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetr, Šařec10aTechnological and economic evaluation of manure production using an activator of biological transformation  ap.

Concerning manure production, the application of the Z'fix agent enhanced quality, structure and nutrient content (N total by 23%, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> by 42%, K<sub>2</sub>O by 17%) in the manure from deep litter housing. Compared to the untreated control, differences in the nutrient content of N total and K<sub>2</sub>O were statistically significant, NH<sub>3</sub> emissions dropped significantly by almost 35%. The economic benefit of manure production with the use of the Z'fix agent demonstrated overall savings at the level of 1,369 CZK/LU/year. The influence of manure produced combined with the PRP Sol application was tested in terms of a boost of crop yield potential of silage maize and of winter wheat.

This study examined the effect of decreasing photoperiod on the herbage growth of cicer milkvetch. Spaced plants of the component polycross progenies of the cultivar Monarch were grown in the field under irrigation on a Nunn clay loam soil (fine, montmorillonitic, mesic Aridic Argiustoll). These progenies were subjected to one of four clipping treatments, removing the top growth on 18 July, 25 July, 1 August, or 8 August. Substantial variability was detected among plants within each clipping treatment date for extended height, which suggests that photoperiod was the primary factor controlling plant growth. Therefore, growth chamber studies were designed that exposed polycross progenies of selected germ plasm and Monarch to a constant 15-h photoperiod and a gradually decreasing photoperiod equivalent to the natural daylength at Fort Collins, CO, from 1 August through 15 September. Plants under the decreasing photoperiod treatment were 23% shorter and produced 25% less shoot dry matter than those under the constant photoperiod. Under the decreasing photoperiod there were also fewer flowering plants and fewer racemes per plant than under the 15-h photoperioil. Considerable variability for extended height and shoot dry weight was detected among plants under both photoperiods. These studies demonstrated the presence of a photoperiod-induced dormancy trait in cicer milkvetch.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aAstragalus cicer 3aharvest date 3aphotoperiod 3aforage 3agrowth chambers 3ashoots 3adry matter accumulation 3adormancy 3aregrowth 3agermplasm 3aclay loam soils 3aColorado0 tAgronomy journal.g1993 Nov., v. 85, no. 6 p.1146-1150dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500060010x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02847naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001700186245011800203300002000321506007600341520116300417592002801580506003701608650001301645650002901658650001401687650001801701650001801719650001501737650001801752650001601770650002501786650001601811650001301827650001401840650001701854650001401871653002001885653001701905653002201922653002301944700001801967700001901985700002502004700002502029773017502054856007902229852000902308655001202317IND60173838320221207081937.0150603e20131008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017383832DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13112611102doi7 aPMC37993752pmcid7 a240658202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBajic, Goran10aStructural insight on the recognition of surface-bound opsonins by the integrin I domain of complement receptor 3  ap. 16426-16431.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aComplement receptors (CRs), expressed notably on myeloid and lymphoid cells, play an essential function in the elimination of complement-opsonized pathogens and apoptotic/necrotic cells. In addition, these receptors are crucial for the cross-talk between the innate and adaptive branches of the immune system. CR3 (also known as Mac-1, integrin α Mβ ₂, or CD11b/CD18) is expressed on all macrophages and recognizes iC3b on complement-opsonized objects, enabling their phagocytosis. We demonstrate that the C3d moiety of iC3b harbors the binding site for the CR3 αI domain, and our structure of the C3d:αI domain complex rationalizes the CR3 selectivity for iC3b. Based on extensive structural analysis, we suggest that the choice between a ligand glutamate or aspartate for coordination of a receptor metal ion-dependent adhesion site–bound metal ion is governed by the secondary structure of the ligand. Comparison of our structure to the CR2:C3d complex and the in vitro formation of a stable CR3:C3d:CR2 complex suggests a molecular mechanism for the hand-over of CR3-bound immune complexes from macrophages to CR2-presenting cells in lymph nodes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadhesion 3aantigen-antibody complex 3aapoptosis 3aaspartic acid 3abinding sites 3acomplement 3aglutamic acid 3alymph nodes 3amacrophage-1 antigen 3amacrophages 3aopsonins 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3areceptors 0ainnate immunity 0aphagocytosis 0aintegrin receptor 0astructural biology1 aYatime, Laure1 aSim, Robert B.1 aVorup-Jensen, Thomas1 aAndersen, Gregers R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Oct. 8, v. 110, no. 41 p.16426-16431dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13112611103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02115naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001700160245005100177300001800228500000900246520108200255592002801337650001301365650001601378650002601394650002301420650002601443650002001469700002001489700001901509700001801528773012501546852000901671856009701680655001201777IND2037907320221123044320.0191122e199309  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203790732DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500050027x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrerichs, R.10aOne-Row Machine for the Harvest of Corn Stover  ap. 1096-1097.  aepub  aMany corn (Zea mays L.) experiments require total dry matter determination in addition to grain yield. Mechanized small-plot grain harvest is a common practice, but determination of total dry matter is usually accomplished by hand harvesting. Hand harvesting is time consuming and labor intensive. Our objective was to construct a mechanized stover sampling system that would reduce the labor requirements for collecting dry matter data. A machine was assembled that cuts, chops, and delivers corn stover to a bag without hand cutting and carrying. A New Holland 707 forage harvester was modified and rear-mounted on a Model 1910 Ford tractor to harvest a single row with a minimum width of 0.76 m. Chopped corn stover is blown through a tube over the top of the tractor to a platform on the front of the tractor where the material is collected and weighed. By using this machine, the number of people needed for data collection is reduced from eight to three, and longer rows can be harvested to increase experimental precision.

In this Missouri study, one-time overseedings of blends and mixtures of Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. commutata Gaud.), hard fescue (Festuca longifolia Thuill.), and creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. rubra Gaud.) were made on established plots of KSU S-16 and ‘Midiron’ bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.]. One-half of each plot was subjected to simulated traffic beginning 18 mon after overseeding, using a modified Brinkman traffic simulator. Quality of four mixtures (bermudagrass + Kentucky bluegrass, bermudagrass + perennial ryegrass, bermudagrass + perennial ryegrass + Kentucky bluegrass, and bermudagrass + perennial ryegrass + Kentucky bluegrass + Chewings fescue) remained in an acceptable range at most observation dates after 3 yr of spring-and-fall traffic. Bermudagrass control plots were in poor or marginal condition at most observation dates during the same period. Bermudagrass plus fine leaf fescues were severely damaged by simulated traffic. Quality of turf receiving no simulated traffic was generally good and varied seasonally in response to changing environmental conditions. Higher-impact absorption measurements, based on peak deceleration (maximum g) on turf receiving simulated traffic vs. no traffic, were consistent with decreasing thatch and verdure. Traction (in N-m) decreased on trafficked turf as thatch and aboveground biomass deteriorated. Kentucky bluegrass and perennial ryegrass dominated mixtures with bermudagrass after 3 yr, and showed good tolerance to simulated traffic.

But little has been done in the comparison of the lipids between Tibet and other areas. This study gives in-depth analysis of the species, concentration and composition of lipid subclasses at the molecular level of the Tibetan human milk. There were averagely 132 ± 30 species of lipids, among which triglycerides (TAGs), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and sphingomyelin (SM) accounted for 79.78% of the total species number in the Tibetan human milk samples. The contents of TAG, SM, phosphatidylcholine (PC), and PE in the Tibetan human milk were 85.84%, 17.79%, 25.94% and 55.81% of those in the comparative human milk of China, respectively. The contents of TAGs and diglycerides (DAGs) with PUFAs in Tibetan human milk were significantly lower than those in the comparative group. However, the content and percentage of TAGs and DAGs with odd-chain saturated fatty acids were both higher in the Tibetan human milk than those in the comparative human milk. In total, 18 molecular species of lipids were downregulated and 5 ones were upregulated in the Tibetan human milk compared with those in the comparative human milk of China. The profile of lipids in the Tibetan human milk at the molecular level provided the scientific basis for maternal diet and supplemented the Chinese human milk lipids database.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast milk 3adatabases 3adiacylglycerols 3afood research 3afoodways 3alipid composition 3amaternal nutrition 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3asphingomyelins 3aChina 0aLipids subclasses 0aMolecular level 0aPolar lipids 0aCholine 0aOdd-chain fatty acids 0aDietary supplement 0aPLs 0aPE 0aPC 0aPI 0aPG 0aSM 0aCer 0aTAGs 0aDAGs 0aOCFAs 0aPLS-DA 0aVIP 0aFDR 0aFC 0aLA 0aALA 0aAA 0aDHA1 aZhao, Junying1 aLiu 刘妍, Yan1 aQiao, Weicang1 aJiang, Tiemin1 aWang, Yaling1 aLiu, Yanpin1 aLuo, Zhang1 aYudron, Tsering1 aHou, Juncai1 aLiu 刘言, Yan1 aChen, Lijun0 tFood research international.g2022 July, v. 157 p.111025-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1110253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011200166300001600278520140000294592002801694650001501722650001101737651001201748653001401760653001901774653001201793653000801805773011301813856008401926852000902010655001202019IND60122064820221121083459.0150324e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012206482DNAL7 a10.1080/1523908X.2013.8342482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Lucy10aLiving-With Others, Living-With an ‘Eco-Home’: From Frustration to Transformation in an Eco-Development  ap. 221-240.  aThis paper considers how ‘ordinary’ families and individuals who would not consider themselves to have ‘environmental values’ or undertake sustainable practices are being transformed through ‘living-with’ eco-homes. The transformative process is unpicked, showing that frustrations with eco-developments not being ‘eco-enough’ may be more influential on the evolution of environmental values than the components of an eco-home which are prescribed and assessed by policy-makers. The findings are based on a single case study—the extension of Allerton Bywater in West Yorkshire, England. As a Millennium Community, the 520 dwellings were designed to the BRE EcoHomes standard ‘Excellent’. The development was first inhabited in 2007 and the fieldwork for this research was conducted in 2007–2008 while inhabitants were getting acquainted with their eco-homes and adjusting to new ways of living. While other research focuses on scripting, appropriation and normalization, this research proposes the concept of ‘living-with’ as a model for understanding transformation in sustainable practices. The in-depth interviews were undertaken with couples and neighbours who shed new light on how individuals incentivize and motivate one another in the uptake of new sustainable practices, thus demonstrating the contingent and contextual embeddedness of sustainable practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainterviews 3amodels 3aEngland 0aEco-homes 0asustainability 0ahousing 0aSTS0 tJournal of environmental policy & planning.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 16, no. 2 p.221-240dRoutledgex1522-72007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2013.8342483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006400168300001200232520178100244592002802025650002302053650002002076650000902096650001002105650002202115650001102137650002402148650001002172650001702182650001202199650001402211650001102225650000902236650001102245651001102256651001202267700002702279700002902306700002702335773011302362856008302475852000902558655001202567IND60712804820221122224512.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071280482DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04264-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeak, Georgiana10aDermatobia hominis in a dog imported from Brazil to Romania  ap. 386.  aBACKGROUND: Dermatobia hominis (Diptera: Oestridae: Cuterebrinae) is a parasite with an important zoonotic and economical impact in the cattle industry, distributed in Central and South America, inhabiting wooded areas along rivers and lowlands. It infests mammals including humans. Lately, there has been a growing trend for people to travel on holidays with their pet dog and also international trade of dogs has increased significantly in the last two decades. Hence, the risk of importation of exotic parasites, including agents of myiasis has increased. Dermatobia hominis has been commonly reported as an imported parasite to various countries, mostly as human cases and currently there are only two published cases of D. hominis imported with dogs to Europe. Herein, we report a case of D. hominis infestation in Romania in a dog recently imported from Brazil. METHODS: Larvae were manually extracted from nodules of a 4-month old non-neutered male, Fila Brasileiro in Arad, Romania. The larvae were morphologically identified, and one specimen was characterized molecularly by amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene (cox1). RESULTS: All larvae were morphologically identified as L3 of Dermatobia hominis. The BLAST analysis revealed a 98.81% nucleotide similarity to two D. hominis isolates from Brazil. The sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under the accession number MT364820. CONCLUSIONS: The travel history of dogs is an important part of the veterinary anamnesis questions and should be thoroughly conducted in the daily practice. Also, prior to and after the importation of dogs from tropical regions, a thorough check of the body surface to detect the presence of nodules is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDermatobia hominis 3acattle industry 3adogs 3agenes 3agenetic databases 3ahumans 3ainternational trade 3amales 3amitochondria 3amyiasis 3aparasites 3apeople 3arisk 3atravel 3aBrazil 3aRomania1 aIonică, Angela Monica1 aNădășan-Cozma, Giulia1 aMihalca, Andrei Daniel0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.386-386dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04264-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014600156520165400302592002801956650002001984650001102004650002802015650001602043650002602059650001702085650001902102650002202121650001002143650001002153650000902163651001002172700002902182700001902211700001702230700001702247700001702264773011902281856007402400852000902474655001202483IND60769847320221121015404.0220310e20220223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076984732DNAL7 a10.3390/w140507082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Dongyu 10aOptimizing Center Pivot Irrigation to Regulate Field Microclimate and Wheat Physiology under Dry-Hot Wind Conditions in the North China Plain  aThe dry-hot wind climate is one of the major agro-meteorological disasters associated with high temperature, low humidity, and specific wind forces, which seriously affects the yield of wheat in the North China Plain. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the field microclimate, net photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll content of flag leaves, grain filling rate, and wheat yield after sprinkler misting under the condition of a dry-hot wind climate in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Two travel speeds, full and half speed, and the corresponding irrigation amounts of 2.5 and 5 mm were used by a center pivot irrigation system during dry-hot wind conditions. A treatment without irrigation was applied as a control. The results showed that the air temperature and relative air humidity were greatly improved within 60 min after irrigation, especially in the upper part of the canopy. The net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves under 5 mm irrigation was higher than that under 2.5 mm irrigation during the middle and late grain filling periods. The adverse effects of dry-hot wind on the chlorophyll content of the flag leaves were mainly concentrated in the late grain filling stage. In the two years of the experiment, the average 1000-grain weights of 5 and 2.5 mm of irrigation treatments were 4.3 and 2.8% higher, and the grain yields were 5.8 and 3.3% higher, respectively, than those of the non-irrigated yields. Overall, applying a small amount of water between 12:00–14:00 with a center pivot before the occurrence of dry-hot wind is an effective means to regulate the field microclimate and produce more yield in the North China Plain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acanopy 3acenter pivot irrigation 3achlorophyll 3afield experimentation 3amicroclimate 3aphotosynthesis 3arelative humidity 3awater 3awheat 3awind 3aChina1 aShoukat, Muhammad Rizwan1 aZheng, Yudong 1 aTan, Haibin 1 aMeng, Fanyu 1 aYan, Haijun 0 tWater.g2022 Feb. 23, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140507083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02325naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014100168300001400309520077500323592002801098650002201126650003701148650001801185650001601203650001301219650001501232650001901247650001901266650001501285650001201300650001501312650003301327650003801360650003701398650002001435653001801455653001901473653003001492653002301522700001201545700001501557700002001572700001901592700001801611773009701629856008401726852000901810655001201819IND60601141020221118054830.0180706e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060114102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Guohua10aGrowth of N-doped BiOBr nanosheets on carbon fibers for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants under visible light irradiation  ap. 84-89.  aAiming at effectively utilizing visible light and convenient separation of the photocatalysts from the water treatment system, the N-doped BiOBr photocatalysts with nanosheets structure and visible light photocatalytic properties have been immobilized on the surface of carbon fibers (CFs) by a facile solvothermal route.

To know how reducing residential energy demand could be achieved, this study develops a set of static and dynamic models to investigate and identify the impact of socio-economic and demographic characteristics, building age, energy prices, and weather conditions on residential energy demand at the state level from 2005 to 2013. Next, this study proposes two alternative scenarios to reduce residential energy demand based on the most precise model. For every 10,000 dollars of per capita income in each state: (1) increasing residential electricity price by 1 cent per kWh and (2) decreasing average building age by 1%. In the first scenario, the findings indicate that annual residential electricity demand would decrease by 7.3% on average, with the highest reductions in Washington (11.9%), North Dakota (10.9%), and Idaho (9.7%). In the second scenario, residential gas demand would decrease by an average of 15.8% annually, with the highest reduction in Connecticut (33.2%) followed by New York (33.0%) and Massachusetts (30.7%). These proposed scenarios assist policymakers in optimizing decisions and investments to reduce residential energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademography 3adynamic models 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3aper-capita income 3asocioeconomics 3aweather 3aConnecticut 3aIdaho 3aMassachusetts 3aNew York 3aNorth Dakota 3aWashington (state) 0aResidential energy demand 0aStatic models 0aDynamic models 0aState-level analysis 0aOwn-price and income elasticities 0aReducing residential energy consumption1 aJavid, Roxana J.0 tEnergy policy.g2016 Nov., v. 98 p.637-649dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245013900214300001200353520160200365592002801967650001501995650001002010650001202020650001002032650001802042650001602060650001702076650002202093650001202115650001302127650001002140650001502150650003502165650001502200650001202215650002202227650001502249650001402264651001402278653002102292653001602313653002002329653002402349653002802373653002202401700002402423700002302447700002302470773010302493856008502596852000902681655001202690IND60532046720221119221923.0190215e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053204672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2016.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobinson, Natasha M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0421-868310aAre forest gullies refuges for birds when burnt? The value of topographical heterogeneity to avian diversity in a fire-prone landscape  ap. 1-7.  aIn forest ecosystems, uniformity in fire spread may be moderated by topography such that sheltered areas (e.g. gullies) escape fire. However, gullies are not immune to fire and, under extreme fire weather conditions, can burn. This may compromise their habitat value, and diminish differences in faunal communities across topographical gradients. We investigated the extent to which differences in avian communities persist when subjected to uniform fire severity and fire history across the gully and slope components of a forest site. We predicted that there would be less difference with increasing fire severity or long absence of fire. Birds were surveyed at 91 paired gully/slope sites in foothill eucalypt forests, two to three years after a large, severe wildfire in south-eastern Australia. Sites were stratified in relation to four levels of fire severity (unburnt through to crown burnt) and two levels of fire history prior to the wildfire (burnt <3years, or >20years). Under similar conditions of fire severity and fire history, gullies maintained greater species richness and abundance than did slopes; averaging 13% greater species richness and 32% greater abundance, along with a distinct bird assemblage. However, contrary to predictions, topographical differences for most avian responses did not diminish with increasing fire severity or in the long absence of fire prior to the wildfire.

As important methods of deep learning technology, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can hierarchically extract higher-level spatial features from images, providing CNNs with a more powerful recognition ability for target detection and scene classification in high-resolution remote sensing images. However, the input of the traditional CNN is an image patch, the shape of which is scarcely consistent with a given segment. This inconsistency may lead to errors when directly using CNNs in object-based remote sensing classification: jagged errors may appear along the land cover boundaries, and some land cover areas may overexpand or shrink, leading to many obvious classification errors in the resulting image. To address the above problem, this paper proposes an object-based and heterogeneous segment filter convolutional neural network (OHSF-CNN) for high-resolution remote sensing image classiﬁcation. Before the CNN processes an image patch, the OHSF-CNN includes a heterogeneous segment filter (HSF) to process the input image. For the segments in the image patch that are obviously different from the segment to be classified, the HSF can differentiate them and reduce their negative influence on the CNN training and decision-making processes. Experimental results show that the OHSF-CNN not only can take full advantage of the recognition capabilities of deep learning methods but also can effectively avoid the jagged errors along land cover boundaries and the expansion/shrinkage of land cover areas originating from traditional CNN structures. Moreover, compared with the traditional methods, the proposed OHSF-CNN can achieve higher classification accuracy. Furthermore, the OHSF-CNN algorithm can serve as a bridge between deep learning technology and object-based segmentation algorithms thereby enabling the application of object-based segmentation methods to more complex high-resolution remote sensing images.  aThis work was jointly supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871236]; Foundation of Jilin Provincial Science & Technology Department [20180101020JC,20180622006JC].  aPublisher supplied data  a41871236cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a20180101020JCa20180622006JCcFoundation of Jilin Provincial Science & Technology Department 3aalgorithms 3aland cover 3aneural networks 3aremote sensing 3ashrinkage1 aZhao, Jian1 aXu, Jun0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Aug. 3, v. 40, no. 15 p.5892-5916dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2019.15846873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03165naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002300185245008300208506007600291520172100367592002802088506003702116650001802153650001602171650001802187650002202205650001202227650001502239650001402254650001202268650002402280650001102304650001402315650001802329650001202347650001202359650002702371700002302398700001802421700002402439700001502463773011802478856007802596852000902674655001202683IND60649350220221207110523.0190704e20170518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064935022DNAL7 a10.3390/insects80200522doi7 aPMC54920662pmcid7 a285241062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiederegger, Senta10aConnecting the Dots: From an Easy Method to Computerized Species Determination  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDifferences in growth rate of forensically important dipteran larvae make species determination an essential requisite for an accurate estimation of time since colonization of the body. Interspecific morphological similarities, however, complicate species determination. Muscle attachment site (MAS) patterns on the inside of the cuticula of fly larvae are species specific and grow proportionally with the animal. The patterns can therefore be used for species identification, as well as age estimation in forensically important dipteran larvae. Additionally, in species where determination has proven to be difficult—even when employing genetic methods—this easy and cheap method can be successfully applied. The method was validated for a number of Calliphoridae, as well as Sarcophagidae; for Piophilidae species, however, the method proved to be inapt. The aim of this article is to assess the utility of the MAS method for applications in forensic entomology. Furthermore, the authors are currently engineering automation for pattern acquisition in order to expand the scope of the method. Automation is also required for the fast and reasonable application of MAS for species determination. Using filters on digital microscope pictures and cross-correlating them within their frequency range allows for a calculation of the correlation coefficients. Such pattern recognition permits an automatic comparison of one larva with a database of MAS reference patterns in order to find the correct, or at least the most likely, species. This facilitates species determination in immature stages of forensically important flies and economizes time investment, as rearing to adult flies will no longer be required.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCalliphoridae 3aPiophilidae 3aSarcophagidae 3aage determination 3aanimals 3aautomation 3adatabases 3afilters 3aforensic entomology 3aimagos 3aimmatures 3ainsect larvae 3amuscles 3arearing 3aspecies identification1 aDöge, Klaus-Peter1 aPeter, Marcus1 aEickhölter, Tobias1 aMall, Gita0 tInsects.g2017 May 18, v. 8, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects80200523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02550naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013400166300001400300520108700314592002801401650001901429650002401448650001201472653000701484653000701491653000801498653000801506653000801514653000701522653000901529653000801538653000901546653000701555653001101562653000901573653000901582653000901591653000801600653000801608653003301616653002501649653003001674653002201704653001501726653001801741700002301759700002101782773011201803856008401915852000901999655001202008IND60601141220221118054720.0180706e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060114122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Tingwen10aReprint of "CFD simulations of circulating fluidized bed risers, part II, evaluation of differences between 2D and 3D simulations  ap. 13-22.  aTwo-dimensional (2D) numerical simulations have been widely reported in the literature for qualitative, even quantitative, study of the complex gas–solids flow behavior in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers. It is generally acknowledged that there exist quantitative differences between 2D and three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations. However, no detailed study evaluating such differences can be found for simulations of CFB risers. This paper presents 2D and 3D numerical simulations of three different CFB risers. Axial pressure gradients from both 2D and 3D simulations are compared with the experimental data. It has been clearly demonstrated that the 2D simulation cannot satisfactorily reproduce the 3D simulation results. A further comparison of radial profiles of void fraction and solids velocity for an axi-symmetric riser configuration is reported and the quantitative differences between 2D and 3D simulations are analyzed. In conclusion, 2D simulation is only recommended for qualitative evaluation and 3D modeling is recommended for predictive simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluidized beds 3amathematical models 3apowders 0a2D 0a3D 0aCFB 0aCFD 0aDEM 0aEE 0aEMMS 0aFCC 0aHDPE 0aLE 0aMP-PIC 0aMFIX 0aNETL 0aPSRI 0aTFM 0aUDF 0aComputational fluid dynamics 0aNumerical simulation 0aCirculating fluidized bed 0aGas–solids flow 0aRiser flow 0aPressure drop1 aPannala, Sreekanth1 aShahnam, Mehrdad0 tPowder technology.g2014 Oct., v. 265 p.13-22dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01788naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245005900175300001600234520080400250592002801054650001601082650001001098650001901108650001601127651001301143651001201156651001601168651001301184700002501197700002301222773010801245856008801353852000901441655001201450IND60082577820221119023139.0141029e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008257782DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.00290.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTetsana, Naiyana10aLiparis rubescens sp. nov.

Morphologically, it is particularly similar to L. dumaguetensis Ames from the Philippines, but it differs in the shape of the lateral sepals and in several characters of the labellum. Among the Liparis species already known from Thailand, L. atrosanguinea Ridl. bears a certain resemblance to the new species, but not so much as to make misidentifications likely. So far, L. rubescens is only known from Khao Nan National Park in the southern Thai province of Nakhon Si Thammarat, but we suggest that it should also be searched for in other parts of peninsular Thailand, southernmost Myanmar and Peninsular Malaysia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrchidaceae 3acalyx 3anational parks 3anew species 3aMalaysia 3aMyanmar 3aPhilippines 3aThailand1 aPedersen, Henrik Æ.1 aSridith, Kitichate0 tNordic journal of botany.g2014 Oct., v. 32, no. 5 p.555-558dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0107-055X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1756-1051.2013.00290.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011700167300001600284520130900300592002801609650001501637650001401652650001001666650001501676650001901691650001501710650001701725650002501742650001501767650001501782650001201797651001701809653002401826653001701850653001701867653001801884700001801902773015501920856008302075852000902158655001202167IND60549704920221120034717.0190412e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054970492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rama.2016.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHilger, Hannah10aQuantifying Optimal Rates of Litter Retention to Maximize Annual Net Primary Productivity on Mixed-Grass Prairie  ap. 219-224.  aOptimal rates of litter retention for maximizing annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) were investigated in native mixed-grass rangelands in Saskatchewan, Canada. The study was conducted on 18 independent study sites on brown and dark brown Chernozem (Mollisol) soils during the 2011 and 2012 growing seasons. Each site contained 30 treatment plots with two control plots and 28 treatment plots receiving between 1 and 2 290 g/m2 of added plant litter sourced from a reference site. Soil moisture values were recorded for each plot in May, June, and July, while forb, graminoid, and total ANPP were harvested at the end of the growing season. Soil moisture-litter relationships were driven by weather patterns with significant differences between years. Graminoid ANPP-litter relationships were nonlinear with peaks in productivity between 54 and 412 g/m2 of litter mass in the brown soil zone and between 27 and 157 g/m2 of litter mass in the dark brown soil zone. Forb ANPP was highest at the lowest litter masses and was not significantly influenced by study year or soil zone. The recommended litter retention rates in provincial range health assessment guidelines are accurate for the dark brown soil zone but are lower than the levels identified here for the more arid brown soil zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aMollisols 3aforbs 3agraminoids 3agrowing season 3aguidelines 3aplant litter 3aprimary productivity 3arangelands 3asoil water 3aweather 3aSaskatchewan 0alitter accumulation 0aproductivity 0arange health 0asoil moisture1 aLamb, Eric G.0 tRangeland ecology & management.g2017 Mar., v. 70, no. 2 p.219-224dElsevier Inc.aThe Society for Range ManagementwJournal:jnl44569x1550-74247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rama.2016.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04799naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002000181245015800201300001600359506007600375520243200451592002802883506003702911650001202948650001602960650001602976650001202992650001303004650002603017650002703043650001103070650002603081650001403107650002503121650001603146650001603162650001203178650002103190650001203211650004603223650001403269650002603283650001403309650002703323650001603350650003403366650002403400650005503424651001403479651001403493653003603507653001903543653001603562653002003578653002303598653002103621653002403642653002503666653001403691653002603705653002803731653001503759653002603774700002303800700002303823773010003846856007403946852000904020655001204029IND60115137920221207073727.0150202e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011513792DNAL7 a242522812pmid7 aPMC38903922pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mct2392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosacov, Andrea10aGeographical differentiation in floral traits across the distribution range of the Patagonian oil-secreting Calceolaria polyrhiza: do pollinators matter?  ap. 251-266.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims The underlying evolutionary processes of pollinator-driven floral diversification are still poorly understood. According to the Grant–Stebbins model speciation begins with adaptive local differentiation in the response to spatial heterogeneity in pollinators. Although this crucial process links the micro- and macroevolution of floral adaptation, it has received little attention. In this study geographical phenotypic variation was investigated in Patagonian Calceolaria polyrhiza and its pollinators, two oil-collecting bee species that differ in body size and geographical distribution. Methods Patterns of phenotypic variation were examined together with their relationships with pollinators and abiotic factors. Six floral and seven vegetative traits were measured in 45 populations distributed across the entire species range. Climatic and edaphic parameters were determined for 25 selected sites, 2–16 bees per site of the most frequent pollinator species were captured, and a critical flower–bee mechanical fitting trait involved in effective pollination was measured. Geographical patterns of phenotypic and environmental variation were examined using uni- and multivariate analyses. Decoupled geographical variation between corolla area and floral traits related to the mechanical fit of pollinators was explored using a Mantel test. Key Results The body length of pollinators and the floral traits related to mechanical fit were strongly correlated with each other. Geographical variation of the mechanical-fit-related traits was decoupled from variation in corolla size; the latter had a geographical pattern consistent with that of the vegetative traits and was mainly affected by climatic gradients. Conclusions The results are consistent with pollinators playing a key role in shaping floral phenotype at a geographical scale and promoting the differentiation of two floral ecotypes. The relationship between the critical floral-fit-related trait and bee length remained significant even in models that included various environmental variables and an allometric predictor (corolla area). The abiotic environment also has an important role, mainly affecting floral size. Decoupled geographical variation between floral mechanical-fit-related traits and floral size would represent a strategy to maintain plant–pollinator phenotypic matching in this environmentally heterogeneous area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aApoidea 3aCalceolaria 3abody length 3acorolla 3aecotypes 3aenvironmental factors 3ageographical variation 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apollination 3apollinators 2aAnimals 2aBeesxphysiology 2aClimate 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aGeography 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aPollination 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aRegression Analysis 2aScrophulariaceaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 3aArgentina 0aArgentina 0aAbiotic environmental gradients 0abee morphology 0aCalceolaria 0afloral ecotypes 0ageographical range 0alocal adaptation 0aoil-collecting bees 0aoil-offering flowers 0aPatagonia 0aphenotypic covariance 0aspecialized pollination 0aspeciation 0avegetative morphology1 aCocucci, Andrea A.1 aSérsic, Alicia N.0 tAnnals of botany.g2014 Jan., v. 113, no. 2 p.251-266dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mct2393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245012600167300001600293520173700309592002802046650001402074650001502088650001502103650001302118650002102131650002102152650002002173650001802193650001102211650001502222650001902237650001102256653002702267653001002294653003202304653002102336653003102357653002702388700001802415700002002433700002702453700001902480700001902499700001902518700001902537700002302556773011102579856008302690852000902773655001202782IND60565553120221122002554.0180831e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056555312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.03.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamiati, Samar10aAcoustic and hybrid 3D-printed electrochemical biosensors for the real-time immunodetection of liver cancer cells (HepG2)  ap. 500-506.  aThis study presents an efficient acoustic and hybrid three-dimensional (3D)-printed electrochemical biosensors for the detection of liver cancer cells. The biosensors function by recognizing the highly expressed tumor marker CD133, which is located on the surface of liver cancer cells. Detection was achieved by recrystallizing a recombinant S-layer fusion protein (rSbpA/ZZ) on the surface of the sensors. The fused ZZ-domain enables immobilization of the anti-CD133 antibody in a defined manner. These highly accessible anti-CD133 antibodies were employed as a sensing layer, thereby enabling the efficient detection of liver cancer cells (HepG2). The recognition of HepG2 cells was investigated in situ using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), which enabled the label-free, real-time detection of living cells on the modified sensor surface under controlled conditions. Furthermore, the hybrid 3D additive printing strategy for biosensors facilitates both rapid development and small-scale manufacturing. The hybrid strategy of combining 3D-printed parts and more traditionally fabricated parts enables the use of optimal materials: a ceramic substrate with noble metals for the sensing element and 3D-printed capillary channels to guide and constrain the clinical sample. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements confirmed the efficiency of the fabricated sensors. Most importantly, these sensors offer low-cost and disposable detection platforms for real-world applications. Thus, as demonstrated in this study, both fabricated acoustic and electrochemical sensing platforms can detect cancer cells and therefore may have further potential in other clinical applications and drug-screening studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3aceramics 3aelectrochemistry 3ahuman cell lines 3aliver neoplasms 3amanufacturing 3ametals 3amonitoring 3aneoplasm cells 3aquartz 0aS-layer fusion protein 0aQCM-D 0aHybrid 3D-printed biosensor 0aElectrochemistry 0aLiver cancer cells (HepG2) 0aCD133 cancer biomarker1 aKüpcü, Seta1 aPeacock, Martin1 aEilenberger, Christoph1 aZamzami, Mazin1 aQadri, Ishtiaq1 aChoudhry, Hani1 aSleytr, Uwe B.1 aSchuster, Bernhard0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 94 p.500-506dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.03.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245011900210300001800329520183400347592002802181650000802209650001102217650001102228650002502239650001202264650001302276650002502289650002202314650001402336650001602350650001102366650001902377650001402396650000902410650001502419650000902434650001402443650001502457650002102472650000802493650001302501650001602514653003702530653002602567653002302593653001902616653002602635700002802661700002002689700002202709773014302731856008502874852000902959655001202968IND60627076020221117004012.0190128e20181226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062707602DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b046572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHossain, Rumana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5585-931X10aSustainable Recovery of Cu and Sn from Problematic Global Waste: Exploring Value from Waste Printed Circuit Boards  ap. 1006-1017.  aThere is a continuous quest for “mining” electronic waste for valuable materials. Currently, e-waste is either disposed of in landfills or transported often to underdeveloped nations where the materials are either disassembled mechanically or incinerated. These processes, unfortunately, can result in toxic pollutants, like dioxins, furans, and lead, contaminating air, soil, and water. In this study, a new pathway, based on thermal micronizing (TM), is used for the controlled transformation of metals present in waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) into value-added tin and copper-based alloys. This fast heating process in a reducing atmosphere recovered tin-based alloy at 500 °C and copper-based alloy at 1000 °C from the waste PCB. Low-temperature heat treatment, short heating times, and decrease in process steps made it possible to remove the lead with tin-based alloy effectively. This prevented the lead evaporating to the atmosphere or diffusing in solid copper of waste PCBs due to the low solubility of lead in copper. After removing the tin-based alloy, the thermal transformation of waste PCBs at 1000 °C facilitated the formation of copper-based alloy droplets, leaving behind the PCB residue. Tin-based alloy is known to be soldering material, and copper is known to be a highly conductive element in electrical applications. Recovered tin-based alloy demonstrated an increased ultimate tensile strength of ∼30% compared to a standard Sn-9%Zn solder alloy. The recovered copper demonstrated ∼80% of IACS (International Annealed Copper Standard) conductivity which makes it favorable for application in various electrical appliances. This simple, low-cost approach opens the opportunity for e-waste processing in the industrial or informal sectors with minimal toxic emissions and encouraging safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalloys 3acopper 3adeveloping countries 3adioxins 3adroplets 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronic wastes 3aemissions 3aevaporation 3afurans 3aheat treatment 3alandfills 3alead 3apollutants 3asoil 3asoldering 3asolubility 3atensile strength 3atin 3atoxicity 3avalue added 0aSelective thermal transformation 0aPrinted circuit board 0aHazardous emission 0aMetal recovery 0aValue-added materials1 aNekouei, Rasoul Khayyam1 aMansuri, Irshad1 aSahajwalla, Veena0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Dec. 26, v. 7, no. 1 p.1006-1017dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b046573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245018200159520145000341592002801791650001701819650002701836650002101863650002001884650002601904650002001930650001901950650001001969650000901979650000701988650001401995650001102009650002202020650001102042650001802053650002102071650001902092650002002111650001502131651001002146700001602156700001902172700001902191773011902210856007402329852000902403655001202412IND60769839820221120080219.0220310e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076983982DNAL7 a10.3390/w140507782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhi-Min 10aSurface Water Quality Assessment and Contamination Source Identification Using Multivariate Statistical Techniques: A Case Study of the Nanxi River in the Taihu Watershed, China  aUnderstanding the spatiotemporal patterns of water quality is crucial because it provides essential information for water pollution control. The spatiotemporal variations in water quality for the Nanxi River in the Taihu watershed of China were evaluated by a water quality index (WQI) and multivariate statistical techniques; additionally, the potential sources of contamination were identified. The data set included 22 water quality parameters collected during the monitoring period from 2015 to 2020 for 14 monitoring stations. WQI assessment revealed that approximately 85% of monitoring stations were classified as “medium-low” water quality, and most showed continuous improvement in water quality. Cluster analysis divided the 14 monitoring stations into three clusters (low contamination, medium contamination and high contamination). Discriminant analysis identified pH, petroleum, volatile phenol, chemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, F, S, fecal coliform, SO₄, Cl, NO₃-N, total hardness, NO₂-N and NH₃ as important parameters affecting spatial variations. Factor analysis identified four potential contamination source types: nutrient, organics, feces and oil. This study demonstrated the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques in assessing large data sets, identifying contamination source types, and better understanding spatiotemporal variations in water quality to restore and protect water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achemical oxygen demand 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3afactor analysis 3afecal bacteria 3afeces 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3aphenol 3apollution control 3arivers 3asurface water 3atotal phosphorus 3awater hardness 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aZhang, Fei 1 aDu, Jing-Long 1 aChen, De-Chao 0 tWater.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w140507783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001600150245012700166300001800293500001500311520103800326592002801364650002101392650001301413650002101426650002301447650001701470650002301487650001001510650001601520650001101536650001901547650002501566650001601591650001701607650001701624650001901641653001201660700001801672700001801690700001901708700001601727773009201743856008601835852000901921655001201930IND4465459120221121141020.0141111e20120815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446545912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.02.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, In-Hah10aDevelopment of a defatted mustard meal-based composite film and its application to smoked salmon to retard lipid oxidation  ap. 1501-1509.  a2019-12-06  aAn antioxidant composite film was developed from defatted mustard meal (DMM) without incorporating external antioxidants and its applicability as a coating to smoked salmon has been investigated. Film-forming variables included the concentration of xanthan, heat treatment, and high pressure homogenisation. Tensile strength, elongation, water vapour permeability, and water solubility of composite films of DMM and xanthan were 5.1â8.8MPa, 2.9â5.0%, 1.5â2.4gmm/kPa/h/mÂ², and 1.1â1.6%, respectively. The composite film with xanthan at 5% (w/w) demonstrated antioxidant properties and the coating with the solution forming the composite film (5% xanthan) retarded lipid oxidation and significantly reduced volatile changes in smoked salmon during storage at 4, 10, and 20Â°C for 21days. Coated salmon was preferred to uncoated salmon in glossiness and fish smell. The composite coating improved the stability of smoked salmon against lipid oxidation without imparting a negative sensory quality to the salmon.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater solubility 3acoatings 3atensile strength 3alipid peroxidation 3amustard meal 3asensory properties 3asmell 3axanthan gum 3asalmon 3aheat treatment 3aantioxidant activity 3awater vapor 3aantioxidants 3apermeability 3ahomogenization 0amustard1 aYang, Hee-Jae1 aNoh, Bong-Soo1 aChung, Seo-Jin1 aMin, Sea C.0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Aug. 15, v. 133, no. 4 p.1501-1509dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04054naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011000169300001600279520275100295592002803046650001903074650001103093650001003104650002303114650002003137650002203157650001103179650001203190650001903202650001003221650002303231650001203254650001203266650002003278650001103298650002003309650001103329700002703340700001903367773013203386856008103518852000903599655001203608IND60478921820221121034445.0160116e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047892182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-015-1000-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTähkämö, Leena10aLife cycle cost comparison of high-pressure sodium and light-emitting diode luminaires in street lighting  ap. 137-145.  aPURPOSE: Cities and municipalities are facing a great challenge in 2015 when the widely used high-pressure mercury lamps are banned from the European Union market. This results to approximately 18 million lamps to be changed to other light source technologies suitable for outdoor lighting. The most probable replacement technologies are high-pressure sodium and light-emitting diode luminaires. The article provides economic information for the cities and municipalities to use when making the decision on the choice of technology. METHODS: A life cycle cost analysis was conducted for the high-pressure sodium and light-emitting diode luminaires including the investment costs, operating costs and residual value over 30-year time frame. The investment costs included the purchase prices of all parts, freight and installation costs. The operating costs accounted for the energy and maintenance costs, and the residual value was calculated using the 25 % estimate of the initial purchase price. The approach of the calculation considered only the luminaires to be installed; the scope of the study excluded the previous installations, which may contain any light source technology or be inexistent. The analysis excluded the poles, wiring and other infrastructure. A sensitivity analysis additionally studied six scenarios, in which relevant calculation parameters were changed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The life cycle cost analysis of the two road lighting luminaire technologies showed that the HPS luminaire was normally a more economical solution compared to the light-emitting diode (LED) luminaire. The total life cycle costs of the HPS luminaire were 45 % lower than those of the LED luminaire per kilometre. However, the scenarios in the sensitivity analysis indicated that there were circumstances where the cost-efficiency of the LED luminaire was particularly improved. In order for the LED technology to become fully competitive against the HPS technology, several scenarios have to take place simultaneously. The life cycle costs of the LED luminaire were reduced compared to the HPS luminaire by increased electricity price, exclusion of spot replacements, reduced purchase price and modularity of the LED luminaire. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the greater luminous efficacy, the LED luminaire was found to have greater life cycle costs compared to the HPS luminaire. However, the LED technology is expected to become more economical in the future due to the development in luminous efficacy, improved product quality, reduction in the purchase price and the enhanced competition in the LED segment. Despite the unfavourable cost structure, the LED technology offers other benefits, such as lighting controls and colour characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3acities 3acolor 3acost effectiveness 3adecision making 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3afreight 3ainfrastructure 3alamps 3alife cycle costing 3amarkets 3amercury 3aoperating costs 3aprices 3aproduct quality 3asodium1 aRäsänen, Rami-Samuli1 aHalonen, Liisa0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2016 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.137-145dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-015-1000-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02245naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013400157520129400291592002801585650001701613650001101630650001701641651001001658700001601668700002001684700001301704700001301717773012901730856007501859852000901934655001201943IND60781081920221118033748.0220623e20220617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078108192DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141229112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wenting 12aA Framework for Assessing the Dynamic Coastlines Induced by Urbanization Using Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Fujian, China  aThe coastline plays an important role in indicating the conditions of social-economic development in the coastal zone. In this study, an integrated assessment framework was proposed to address the provincial and county-level spatiotemporal dynamics of continental coastlines from the perspectives of length, position, composition, and anthropogenic utilization quantitatively, and to explore the exact impacts of urbanization on coastline changes in the Fujian Province over the period from 1985 to 2020. Results showed that the total length of coastlines decreased first and then increased due to the different patterns of economic development. The proportion of artificial coastlines and the index of coastal utilization degree increased rapidly during the same period. Moreover, the seaward movement of coastlines due to the coastal reclamation projects resulted in a considerable increment in land areas. The pressure brought by the continuous concentration of population, built-up areas, and industrial districts under the rapid urbanization was the primary factor that increased the degree of anthropogenic disturbances in the coastal zone. Furthermore, the policies issued by the local or central government can be critical tipping points for coastline changes in different periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acoasts 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aGao, Yiwei 1 aChen, Chunpeng 1 aSun, Yu 1 aSu, Hua 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 17, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141229113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010500173300001000278520167300288592002801961650001301989650001902002650002502021650002602046650001402072650002702086650002602113650001802139650001302157650002602170650001402196650001302210650001602223700001902239773011502258856008202373852000902455655001202464IND60550223020221118163028.0180619e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055022302DNAL7 a10.1186/s10152-016-0467-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Campenhout, Jelle10aClosely related intertidal and deep-sea Halomonhystera species have distinct fatty acid compositions  ap. 8.  aThe deep-sea free-living nematode Halomonhystera hermesi, dominant in the sulphidic sediments of the Håkon Mosby mud volcano (1280 m, Barent sea slope), is part of the mainly estuarine Halomonhystera disjuncta species complex consisting of five cryptic species (GD1–GD5). Cryptic species have a very similar morphology raising questions on their specific environmental differences. This study analyzed total fatty acid (FA) compositions of H. hermesi and GD1, one of H. hermesi’s closest relatives. Additionally, we experimentally investigated the effect of a temperature reduction, salinity increase and sulphide concentrations on GD1’s FA composition. Because nematodes are expected to have low amounts of storage FA, total FA compositions most likely reflect FA contents of cellular membranes. The deep-sea nematode H. hermesi had significantly lower saturation levels and increased highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFAs) proportions due to the presence of docosahexanoic acid (DHA—22:6ω3) and higher eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA—20:5ω3) proportions. HUFAs were absent in H. hermesi’s food source indicating the ability and need for this nematode to synthesize HUFAs in a deep-sea environment. Our experimental data revealed that only a decrease in temperature resulted in lower saturated fatty acids proportions, indicating that the FA content of H. hermesi is most likely a response to temperature but not to sulphide concentrations or salinity differences. In experimental nematodes, EPA proportions were low and DHA was absent indicating that other factors than temperature, salinity and sulphides mediate the presence of these HUFAs in H. hermesi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNematoda 3acell membranes 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aestuaries 3afatty acid composition 3afree-living nematodes 3alittoral zone 3asalinity 3asaturated fatty acids 3asediments 3asulfides 3atemperature1 aVanreusel, Ann0 tHelgoland marine research.g2017 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.8-8dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000000238x1438-387X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s10152-016-0467-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012200158300002000280520145700300592002801757650001601785650001601801650002301817650001701840650002801857650001901885650001501904650001701919650001601936650000901952650001801961650001901979650002601998650001102024650001502035653002002050653002702070653001202097653002502109653002502134700001602159700001702175700001302192700002302205700002202228773012602250856007502376852000902451655001202460IND60527771420221119194536.0160715e20141112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052777142DNAL7 a10.1021/am505298q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Jae-Hong10aHigh Capacitance, Photo-Patternable Ion Gel Gate Insulators Compatible with Vapor Deposition of Metal Gate Electrodes  ap. 19275-19281.  aA facile fabrication route to pattern high-capacitance electrolyte thin films in electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) was demonstrated using a photoinitiated cross-linkable ABA-triblock copolymer ion gel. The azide groups of poly(styrene-r-vinylbenzylazide) (PS-N₃) end-blocks can be chemically cross-linked via UV irradiation (λ = 254 nm) in the self-assembly of poly[(styrene-r-vinylbenzylazide)-b-ethylene oxide-b-(styrene-r-vinylbenzylazide)] (SOS-N₃) triblock copolymer in the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMI][TFSI]). Impedance spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that ion transport and microstructure of the ion gel are not affected by UV cross-linking. Using a photoinduced cross-linking strategy, photopatterning of ion gels through a patterned mask was achieved. Employing a photopatterned ion gel as the high-capacitance gate insulator in thin film transistors (TFTs), arrays of TFTs exhibited uniform and high device performance. Specifically, both p-type (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) (P3HT) and n-type (ZnO) transistors displayed high carrier mobility (hole mobility of ∼1.4 cm²/ (V s) and electron mobility of ∼0.7 cm²/ (V s) and ON/OFF current ratio (∼10⁵) at supply voltages below 2 V. This study suggests that photopatterning is a promising candidate to conveniently incorporate high-capacitance ion gels into TFTs in the fabrication of printed electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acapacitance 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric power 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3agels 3aionic liquids 3amicrostructure 3aultraviolet radiation 3avapors 3azinc oxide 0aphotopatterning 0achemical cross-linking 0aion gel 0athin-film transistor 0ametal gate electrode1 aGu, Yuanyan1 aHong, Kihyon1 aXie, Wei1 aFrisbie, C.

In this study, a full-length cDNA encoding HMGR (BdHMGR) was cloned from the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). The open reading frame of BdHMGR encoded 928 amino acids and shared a high degree of identity with other known HMGRs. The expression levels of BdHMGR were high during the early and lately pupal stages, and were low at the larval and mid pupal stages. In the adult stages, the highest level of BdHMGR was detected on day-10 of the adult lifecycle, and the expression levels in females were greater than those in males. The highest tissue-specific expression was in the ovary, followed by fat body and other tissues. Injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of BdHMGR into adult females significantly reduced BdHMGR transcript levels, and inhibited ovarian development and affected the expression of two yolk protein genes. After dissection, we found that one or two of the spheroids of ovaries from the BdHMGR dsRNA-injected flies were amorphous and reduced in size as compared with the controls. The results suggest that BdHMGR is required for ovarian development in B. dorsalis and may be a potential target for pest control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactrocera dorsalis 3aadults 3aamino acids 3acoenzyme A 3acomplementary DNA 3adouble-stranded RNA 3afat body 3afemales 3agenes 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (NADH) 3ainsect development 3ajuvenile hormones 3alarvae 3amales 3aopen reading frames 3aovarian development 3apest control 3apupae 0aBactrocera dorsalis 0aHMGR 0aGene expression 0aRNA interference 0aOvarian development1 aXu, Kang-Kang1 aDou, Wei1 aLi, Can1 aWang, Jin-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8777-52680 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2018 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.1071-1078dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03425naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005400145245006300199300001800262500002000280520143000300592002801730596007301758650002201831650003001853650001101883650002101894650001401915650001401929650001601943650002301959650001201982650002501994650001402019650001302033650002202046650001302068650001102081650002902092650001402121651002202135700001902157700005702176700002202233700002102255700001902276700001902295700001502314700002302329700001802352700006302370700002102433700001802454700001802472700001802490700005902508773013202567856007902699852000902778655001202787IND60751181720221120021348.0210923e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075118172DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.156292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLasa, Aide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4027-178312aA deep‐sea bacterium related to coastal marine pathogens  ap. 5349-5363.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEvolution of virulence traits from adaptation to environmental niches other than the host is probably a common feature of marine microbial pathogens, whose knowledge might be crucial to understand their emergence and pathogenetic potential. Here, we report genome sequence analysis of a novel marine bacterial species, Vibrio bathopelagicus sp. nov., isolated from warm bathypelagic waters (3309 m depth) of the Mediterranean Sea. Interestingly, V. bathopelagicus sp. nov. is closely related to coastal Vibrio strains pathogenic to marine bivalves. V. bathopelagicus sp. nov. genome encodes genes involved in environmental adaptation to the deep‐sea but also in virulence, such as the R5.7 element, MARTX toxin cluster, Type VI secretion system and zinc‐metalloprotease, previously associated with Vibrio infections in farmed oysters. The results of functional in vitro assays on immunocytes (haemocytes) of the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and of the early larval development assay in Mytilus support strong toxicity of V. bathopelagicus sp. nov. towards bivalves. V. bathopelagicus sp. nov., isolated from a remote Mediterranean bathypelagic site, is an example of a planktonic marine bacterium with genotypic and phenotypic traits associated with animal pathogenicity, which might have played an evolutionary role in the origin of coastal marine pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data  a201728ZA49_002cMinistero dell'Università e della Ricerca PRIN 2017 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aMytilus galloprovincialis 3aVibrio 3aaquatic bacteria 3aevolution 3ahemocytes 3aimmunocytes 3alarval development 3amussels 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aplankton 3asequence analysis 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3atype VI secretion system 3avirulence 3aMediterranean Sea1 aAuguste, Manon1 aLema, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3955-30111 aOliveri, Caterina1 aBorello, Alessio1 aTaviani, Elisa1 aBonello, Guido1 aDoni, Lapo1 aMillard, Andrew D.1 aBruto, Maxime1 aRomalde, Jesús L.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4786-47731 aYakimov, Michail1 aBalbi, Teresa1 aPruzzo, Carla1 aCanesi, Laura1 aVezzulli, Luigi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4368-14540 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.5349-5363dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245015900170300001600329520207500345536011902420592002802539650001902567650002102586650002002607650001502627650001502642650002502657650001502682650002202697650001402719650001302733650000902746650001702755651001202772653003202784653003802816653002202854653002102876773011902897856008003016852000903096655001203105IND60645190220221119074355.0190528e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064519022DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642187991302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarley, Tennille L.10aIndigenous Data Sovereignty: University Institutional Review Board Policies and Guidelines and Research with American Indian and Alaska Native Communities  ap. 722-742.  aAmerican Indians, Alaska Native, and other Indigenous people throughout the world have undergone and continue to experience research abuses. Qualitative data such as intellectual property, Indigenous knowledge, interviews, cultural expressions including songs, oral histories/stories, ceremonies, dances, and other texts, images, and recordings are at risk of exploitation, appropriation, theft, and misrepresentation and threaten the cultural sovereignty of American Indians, Alaska Native, and other Indigenous people. These issues are potentially magnified with the increasing use of big data. Partly as a result of past and current research abuse, the Indigenous data sovereignty, the control, ownership, and governance of research and data, is growing. In this article, I discuss American Indian political sovereignty, cultural sovereignty, and Indigenous data sovereignty, with an emphasis on qualitative data sovereignty. In addition, I explore whether Arizona’s public universities—Northern Arizona University, Arizona State University, and University of Arizona—policies and guidelines support Indigenous data sovereignty and the extent to which they align with the Arizona Board of Regent’s tribal consultation policy that governs relations between the three Arizona universities and Arizona American Indian nations. Overall expectations, requirements, and processes do not go far enough in supporting Indigenous data sovereignty. Although each university has specific research policies that follow the Arizona Board of Regent’s tribal consultation policy, the university guidelines differ in scope in term of supporting Indigenous data sovereignty. In addition, none of the policies address qualitative data sharing, including those in big data sets. Based on the findings I make several recommendations for researchers, including supporting the Indigenous sovereignty movement and to reconsider big data use and past positions about qualitative data ownership and sharing with regard to American Indians, Alaska Native, and other Indigenous people.  aFunding The author received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlaska Natives 3aAmerican Indians 3adata collection 3agovernance 3aguidelines 3aindigenous knowledge 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3aownership 3apolitics 3arisk 3auniversities 3aArizona 0aIndigenous data sovereignty 0aAmerican Indian and Alaska Native 0aIndigenous people 0aqualitative data0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g2019 May, v. 63, no. 6 p.722-742dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x1552-33817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642187991303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245007400179300001400253500000900267520154300276592002801819650002101847650000901868650001101877650003701888700001801925700001801943700001801961773011901979852000902098856009802107655001202205IND8604369920221118194302.0191122e198601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860436992DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1986.0011183X002600010010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorden, A. J.10aGenotype ✕ Environment Interactions in Peanut Multiline Populations  ap. 46-48.  aepub  aThe stabilities of four peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) multiline populations plus their component lines were determined over a 4-year period, 1980-1983, at two locations in Florida. The study was undertaken to provide information concerning the stability of both yield and market quality factors of multiline cultivars vs. the component lines which form them. Each multiline was obtained from a different cross, and was formed by compositing in equal proportions the seed from four early generation, phenotypically similar sib-lines. The interactions of genotype (population) with environments was highly significant (P = < 0.01) for pod yield and five quality factors (percentage fancy pod, shelling percentage, weight per 100 seeds, percentage of extra large kernels and sound mature kernel yield) studied. Large differences in yield and market quality traits were not found between sib-lines. However, differences were found in stability estimated from regression coefficients and deviation from regression of multilines compared to their component lines, possibly due to the buffering action resulting from greater genetic variability. Multilines did not have greater stability in all cases, but the difference between the multiline and its least stable component line was generally greater than the difference between the multiline and its most stable component line.

A Flexible Multicomponent Rate Recommendation System  ap. 1186-1192.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aA recently developed system to predict the optimum N fertilizer rate for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. emend. Thell) at Zadoks growth stage (GS) 30 is based on the relationship between measured economic optimum N rate at GS 30 and wheat tissue N content measured at GS 30. However, winter wheat often needs an earlier application of spring N to achieve optimum yield. We therefore developed a test to determine which fields need this earlier (GS 25) application, and to predict the optimum N rate with split-application management using the tissue test or as a single spring application. The optimum N rate at GS 25 was measured over 5 yr, both with and without GS 30 N applications. These measured optimum N rates were regressed against a variety of possible predictor variables measured in the same fields. Tiller density at GS 25 was a good predictor of optimum N rate at GS 25 in a split spring application program. Using this relationship along with the GS 30 tissue test to make N recommendations for winter wheat increased estimated profit relative to using the tissue test alone. Soil NO₃ measured to 0.9 m depth was the best predictor of optimum N rate at GS 25 when that is to be the only spring N application, and improved estimated profit relative to applying 90 kg N ha⁻¹ at all sites; however, the economic performance of split spring N applications was substantially better than for any single spring applications. The recommendation system developed by integrating these component relationships is powerful and flexible, and provides field-specific N rate recommendations for all spring N applications to winter wheat, regardless of management decisions about splitting spring N applications.

One of these meristems, the cambium, is responsible for extended root and stem thickening. Strikingly, although the pivotal role of the plant hormone auxin in promoting cambium activity has been known for decades, the molecular basis of auxin responsiveness on the level of cambium cells has so far been elusive. Here, we reveal that auxin-dependent cambium stimulation requires the homeobox transcription factor WOX4. In Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescence stems, 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid–induced auxin accumulation stimulates cambium activity in the wild type but not in wox4 mutants, although basal cambium activity is not abolished. This conclusion is confirmed by the analysis of cellular markers and genome-wide transcriptional profiling, which revealed only a small overlap between WOX4-dependent and cambium-specific genes. Furthermore, the receptor-like kinase PXY is required for a stable auxin-dependent increase in WOX4 mRNA abundance and the stimulation of cambium activity, suggesting a concerted role of PXY and WOX4 in auxin-dependent cambium stimulation. Thus, in spite of large anatomical differences, our findings uncover parallels between the regulation of lateral and apical plant meristems by demonstrating the requirement for a WOX family member for auxin-dependent regulation of lateral plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aapical meristems 3aauxins 3acambium 3aindeterminate growth 3ainflorescences 3amessenger RNA 3aplant hormones 3aroots 3astem cells 3astems 3atranscription factors 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCambiumxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aAgusti, Javier1 aSánchez, Pablo,1 aSchwarz, Martina1 aGreb, Thomas0 tplant cell.g2011 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.3247-3259dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.0878743Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03810naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158520207700270592002802347650002302375650004002398650001502438650002102453650002702474650002002501650001702521650002702538650001902565650001802584650002602602650002302628650001402651650002102665650001302686650002602699650001302725650001902738650000902757700002402766700002502790700002102815700002102836700001502857700002102872700002002893700002302913700002202936700002502958700002102983700002303004773012203027856007403149852000903223655001203232IND60742684920221122081648.0210624e20210620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074268492DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130621132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNotz, Quirin 10aClinical Significance of Micronutrient Supplementation in Critically Ill COVID-19 Patients with Severe ARDS  aThe interplay between inflammation and oxidative stress is a vicious circle, potentially resulting in organ damage. Essential micronutrients such as selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) support anti-oxidative defense systems and are commonly depleted in severe disease. This single-center retrospective study investigated micronutrient levels under Se and Zn supplementation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and explored potential relationships with immunological and clinical parameters. According to intensive care unit (ICU) standard operating procedures, patients received 1.0 mg of intravenous Se daily on top of artificial nutrition, which contained various amounts of Se and Zn. Micronutrients, inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte subsets and clinical data were extracted from the patient data management system on admission and after 10 to 14 days of treatment. Forty-six patients were screened for eligibility and 22 patients were included in the study. Twenty-one patients (95%) suffered from severe ARDS and 14 patients (64%) survived to ICU discharge. On admission, the majority of patients had low Se status biomarkers and Zn levels, along with elevated inflammatory parameters. Se supplementation significantly elevated Se (p = 0.027) and selenoprotein P levels (SELENOP; p = 0.016) to normal range. Accordingly, glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3) activity increased over time (p = 0.021). Se biomarkers, most notably SELENOP, were inversely correlated with CRP (rₛ = −0.495), PCT (rₛ = −0.413), IL-6 (rₛ = −0.429), IL-1β (rₛ = −0.440) and IL-10 (rₛ = −0.461). Positive associations were found for CD8⁺ T cells (rₛ = 0.636), NK cells (rₛ = 0.772), total IgG (rₛ = 0.493) and PaO₂/FiO₂ ratios (rₛ = 0.504). In addition, survivors tended to have higher Se levels after 10 to 14 days compared to non-survivors (p = 0.075). Sufficient Se and Zn levels may potentially be of clinical significance for an adequate immune response in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19 ARDS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aacute respiratory distress syndrome 3abiomarkers 3adisease severity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3ainformation management 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3aintravenous injection 3amanagement systems 3anutrition 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aretrospective studies 3aselenium 3aselenoproteins 3azinc1 aHerrmann, Johannes 1 aSchlesinger, Tobias 1 aHelmer, Philipp 1 aSudowe, Stephan 1 aSun, Qian 1 aHackler, Julian 1 aRoeder, Daniel 1 aLotz, Christopher 1 aMeybohm, Patrick 1 aKranke, P.q(Peter),1 aSchomburg, Lutz 1 aStoppe, Christian 0 tNutrients.g2021 June 20, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130621133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02046naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245008200161300002000243520085500263592002801118650001601146650001301162650002301175650002901198650002301227650003601250650001201286650001101298700001801309700001801327700001601345700001901361700005701380773014901437856007701586852000901663655001201672IND60756082920221120201026.0211110e20211027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075608292DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.1c097972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jintong10aNickel-Catalyzed Enantioselective Arylative Activation of Aromatic C–O Bond  ap. 18380-18387.  aThe pioneering nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of C–O electrophiles was unlocked by Wenkert in the 1970s; however, the transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric activation of aromatic C–O bonds has never been reported. Herein the first enantioselective activation of an aromatic C–O bond is demonstrated via the catalytic arylative ring-opening cross-coupling of diarylfurans. This transformation is facilitated via nickel catalysis in the presence of chiral N-heterocyclic carbene ligands, and chiral 2-aryl-2′-hydroxy-1,1′-binaphthyl (ArOBIN) skeletons are delivered axially in high yields with high ee. Moreover, this versatile skeleton can be transformed into various synthetic useful intermediates, chiral catalysts, and ligands by using the CH- and OH-based modifiable sites. This chemistry features mild conditions and good atom economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3acarbenes 3acatalytic activity 3across-coupling reactions 3aenantioselectivity 3aheterocyclic nitrogen compounds 3aligands 3anickel1 aSun, Tingting1 aZhang, Zishuo1 aCao, Haiqun1 aBai, Zhushuang1 aCao, Zhi-Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5496-44250 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Oct. 27, v. 143, no. 44 p.18380-18387dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c097973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005000092040001800142100001900160245011600179300001600295500000900311520223000320592002802550650002302578650002302601650002502624650001902649650002202668700001902690773012202709852000902831856009702840655001202937IND8800226620221119235642.0191122e198803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880022662DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1988.00021962008000020021x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodgson, A. S.10aSeasonal and Soil Fertility Effects on the Response of Waterlogged Cotton to Foliar-Applied Nitrogen Fertilizer  ap. 259-265.  aepub  aThe majority of irrigated cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) soils in Australia are poorly drained, and the short-term waterlogging associated with extended furrow irrigation reduces cotton yield, partly by reducing the uptake of N. Foliar application of N before irrigation can overcome a transient shortage, but yield responses have been variable. Seasonal and soil N fertility effects on the response of waterlogged cotton to foliar-applied N fertilizer were studied over three seasons at Narrabri, N.S.W., Australia. A cracking grey clay soil (Typic Pellustert) was waterlogged by furrow irrigations lasting 4 to 32 h. Climatic and soil fertilizer conditions included a cool, moist season with optimal soil fertilizer N, a hot, arid season with high soil fertilizer N; and a hot, arid season with a wide range of soil fertilizer N. Foliar N was applied at 0, 5, 10, and 20 kg ha⁻¹ in the first season, 0, 15, 30, and 60 kg ha⁻¹ in the second season, and 0, 60, 120, and 180 kg ha⁻¹ in the third season. Increased waterlogging reduced N uptake and lint yield. Nevertheless, there was no response to foliar N in the cool, moist season because factors other than N limited growth and yield whether or not N was supplied to the foliage. Lack of response to foliar N in the hot, arid season with high soil N fertility was attributed to high uptake of N (163 kg N ha⁻¹) by untreated shoots, which compensated for reduced uptake by the roots during waterlogging. A three-factor interaction in the third season confirmed that more cotton yield was recovered by applying foliar N under more severe waterlogging when soil N levels were not high. At N rates of 120 and 180 kg ha⁻¹, shoots recovered more soil-applied N than foliar-applied N. Recoveries were similar at 60 kg N ha⁻¹. The results confirmed that foliar N can ameliorate the effects of waterlogging in cotton, defined some of the conditions under which responses to foliar N occur, and explained some of the variability in response to foliar N found under commercial conditions.

In this study, we have investigated the antibacterial activity of a nanohybrid of three-dimensional Mg–Al layered double hydroxide–reduced graphene oxide (LDH–rGO) on the Gram negative coccobacilli bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli). A biocompatibility test by a sulphorhodamine-B (SRB) assay inferred that LDH–rGO is biocompatible up to a concentration of 2 mg mL⁻¹. The concentration and time-dependent antibacterial studies confirmed that 125 μg mL⁻¹ of LDH–rGO is sufficient to inhibit 95.4 ± 1.1% E. coli cells in 60 min. A systematic study shows that the nanohybrid is capable of developing oxidative stress by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), while LDH and rGO does not. However, both rGO and the nanohybrid are capable of developing oxidative stress by oxidizing glutathione. Further, the effect of oxidative stress on one of the biological entities (protein) of E. coli was also studied. We thereby propose the antibacterial mechanism of the nanohybrid on the basis of size, morphology, glutathione loss, and protein degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abiocompatibility 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 3aglutathione 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananohybrids 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein degradation 3areactive oxygen species1 aDoshi, Sejal1 aMohammed, Aslam1 aBahadur, Dhirendra0 tRSC advances.g2016 Apr. 22, v. 6, no. 46 p.40389-40398dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04511a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01484naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010500166300001600271520053600287592002800823650001500851650001100866650001600877650001300893650001900906700002300925700001800948700002700966773012000993856004801113852000901161655001201170IND50062586920221117173313.0130322e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006258692DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-012-2165-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKargar, Mojgan10aUse of Glycerol Carbonate in an Efficient, One-Pot and Solvent Free Synthesis of 1,3-sn-Diglycerides  ap. 259-264.  aAn efficient solvent-free synthesis of a variety of highly pure 1,3-sn-diglycerides (1,3-sn-diacylglycerols) in a two-step one pot process is described. Heating glycerol carbonate (4-hydroxymethyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one) with fatty acid anhydrides 2a–d affords 1:1 mixtures of glycerol carbonate fatty esters 3a–3d and the corresponding fatty acids.

The optimum pH and temperature of the two PPOs were found to be same (5.49 and 45 °C). The apparent substrate specificities were established from Vₘₐₓ/Kₘas follows: caffeic acid > 4-methylcatechol > catechol > pyrogallol for two enzymes. There were marked differences between the two enzymes in terms of thermal stability. The effects of inhibitors varied in a dose-dependent manner. The degree of inhibition exerted by the inhibitors tested varied according to the harvest year.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3acatechol oxidase 3agrapes 3apH 3apyrogallol 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aŞener, Aysun0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2014 Apr., v. 238, no. 4 p.613-619dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-013-2138-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009400165300001800259520027900277592002800556650001600584650001800600650001200618650002200630650001200652653002900664653003100693653002400724653002200748653002000770700001300790700001400803700002000817700001700837700001800854773008200872856008100954852000901035655001201044IND60531996520221119025335.0161019e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053199652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2016.07.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Dongyang10aRh-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of racemic aldimines via dynamic kinetic resolution  ap. 5541-5547.  aCatalyzed by a rhodium complex of P-stereogenic diphosphine ligand trichickenfootphos (TCFP), asymmetric hydrogenation of racemic aldimines via dynamic kinetic resolution has been realized for the preparation of chiral arylglycines with good yields and enantioselectivities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenantiomers 3ahydrogenation 3aligands 3aorganic compounds 3arhodium 0aAsymmetric hydrogenation 0aDynamic kinetic resolution 0aChiral arylglycines 0aRacemic aldimines 0aRhodium complex1 aLu, Jian1 aLiu, Yang1 aZhang, Zhenfeng1 aLiu, Yangang1 aZhang, Wanbin0 tTetrahedron.g2016 Sept. 01, v. 72 p.5541-5547dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2016.07.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002300192245012900215300001400344506007600358520099000434536070901424592002802133596010802161596009302269596009602362596004302458506003702501650002902538650001602567650001002583650002802593650002002621650002502641650002202666650001902688650002902707650002602736650001702762653002902779653002202808653003402830653001202864653001202876653001302888700002002901700002502921700002102946700002102967700002202988773010303010856008603113852000903199655001203208IND60595790620221207094820.0180822e20180102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059579062DNAL7 a10.1080/21501203.2017.14199952doi7 aPMC60590802pmcid7 a301236622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMardones, Wladimir14aThe genome sequence of the soft-rot fungus Penicillium purpurogenum reveals a high gene dosage for lignocellulolytic enzymes  ap. 59-69.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe high lignocellulolytic activity displayed by the soft-rot fungus Penicillium purpurogenum has made it a target for the study of novel lignocellulolytic enzymes. We have obtained a reference genome of 36.2 Mb of non-redundant sequence (11,057 protein-coding genes). The 49 largest scaffolds cover 90% of the assembly, and Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) analysis reveals that our assembly captures almost all protein-coding genes. RNA-seq was performed and 93.1% of the reads aligned to the assembled genome. These data, plus the independent sequencing of a set of genes of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes, validate the quality of the genome sequence. P. purpurogenum shows a higher number of proteins with CAZy motifs, transcription factors and transporters as compared to other sequenced Penicillia. These results demonstrate the great potential for lignocellulolytic activity of this fungus and the possible use of its enzymes in related industrial applications.  aThis work was funded by grants from the “Fondo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología” (FONDECYT) [grant number 1130180] to Jaime Eyzaguirre, Universidad Andrés Bello [grant numbers DI-478-14/R and DI-31-12/R] to Jaime Eyzaguirre, “Fondo de Financiamiento en Areas Prioritarias” (CRG-Fondap) [grant number 1509007] to Alejandro Maass and a “Mejoramiento de la calidad de la Educación Superior” (MECESUP) Fellowship [grant number UAB 0802] to Wladimir Mardones.

To identify head groups capable of monolayer formation on germanium surfaces, we studied thiol-, hydroxyl-, and carboxyl-terminated carboranes. These films were successfully formed with carboxylic acid head groups instead of the archetypal thiol, suggesting that the carborane cluster significantly affects headgroup reactivity. Film characterization included X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopies as well as contact angle goniometry. Using these carboranes, the germanium surface work function was tailored over 0.4 eV without significant changes to wetting properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3agermanium 3aisomers 3athiols 0agermanium 0aself-assembled monolayers 0aultrathin film 0awork function 0acarborane 0aligand1 aAnderson, Mary E.1 aSaleh, Liban M.

The prepared colloidal medium was thoroughly characterized in terms of its ionic conductivity, rheological and thermal properties. The colloid exhibited sharp reversible sol ↔ gel transitions at 50–55 °C. The phase transitions were associated with drastic changes in viscosity (10⁻² to 10² Pa s) and ionic conductivity (0.5–12.67 mS cm⁻¹). The sharp transition at ambient temperature helps to preserve the dispersed state of different nanoparticles obtained via sonication in the medium. The soft solid nature of the colloid can be considered to mimick a biological environment and was evaluated as a soft electrolytic medium for monitoring enzyme kinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aammonium salts 3acolloids 3aelectrolytes 3aenzyme kinetics 3aethylene glycol 3agels 3amonitoring 3ananoparticles 3aphase transition 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asonication 3athermal properties 3aviscosity1 aLakshminarayanan, V.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 16, v. 5, no. 107 p.87956-87962dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra13303c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014100169300001200310520167000322592002801992650000802020650002002028650002202048650001002070650002202080650001302102650001502115650001102130650000902141650003102150650001102181650001402192650002502206651001202231700005902243700003102302700002502333700002502358700002102383700002402404773011302428856008202541852000902623655001202632IND60712804920221122224532.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071280492DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04248-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostache, Carmen10aFirst multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of Giardia duodenalis isolates from humans in Romania [Erratum: December 2021, Vol.14(1), p.325]  ap. 387.  aBACKGROUND: Giardia duodenalis is one of the most prevalent and highly diverse human parasites, encompassing a complex of eight genetically distinct assemblages, each further divided into sub-assemblages. While in recent years, G. duodenalis genotype distribution patterns in humans have been intensely studied, there is still very little information available on the diversity of Giardia genotypes and sub-assemblages infecting people in Romania. In the present study, we investigated the genetic diversity of Giardia duodenalis in asymptomatic patients from Romania. METHODS: Over an 11-month period, human feces from 7805 healthy adults were screened by microscopic analysis for G. duodenalis cysts during their obligatory periodic check-ups. DNA extraction was performed from microscopic-positive fecal samples, followed by multilocus sequence typing of four genetic loci of the ITS region, gdh, tpi and bg genes, followed by DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using EpiInfo 2000 software. RESULTS: The prevalence of giardiasis in the present study was 0.42% (33/7805). Twenty-three samples (76.67%) were successfully genotyped at each locus. The bg and tpi genes had the highest typing success rate (100%). The identified assemblages were assemblage A in 27 cases (subtypes A2 and A3), and B in 3 cases. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the present study is the first report of multilocus sequence typing of G. duodenalis isolated from humans in Romania. The present results may shed light on G. duodenalis infection in humans at a regional and national level, thus increasing awareness against this parasitic infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGiardia lamblia 3acomputer software 3afeces 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agiardiasis 3ahumans 3aloci 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apeople 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3aRomania1 aKalmár, Zsuzsa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4492-83831 aColosi, Horațiu Alexandru1 aBaciu, Alina Mihaela1 aOpriş, Răzvan Vlad1 aGyörke, Adriana1 aColosi, Ioana Alina0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.387-387dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04248-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003000146245007900176300002000255520105100275592002801326596009401354596009401448596009401542596009901636650001501735650001001750650001801760650001901778700001901797700002601816700005601842773017301898856008102071852000902152655001202161IND60788992720221120183648.0220818e20220804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078899272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c017242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGebremedhin, Kiday Fiseha10aScalable Fabrication of Anisotropic Nanocellular Foam by Hot-Press Foaming  ap. 11790-11803.  aNanocellular foam has raised much interest because its physical and mechanical properties are superior to those of microcellular foams. The hot-bath foaming method has been common on a laboratory scale due to its faster heat transfer rate. However, because of the nature of the free foaming process, the hot-bath foaming method may not be capable of making large, flat samples. This study uses the hot-press process to produce nanocellular foam. The results of hot-bath and hot-press foaming methods were compared with theoretical simulations. Both processes were able to produce cell sizes lower than 40 nm. The hot-press foamed samples exhibited larger cell size, higher expansion ratio, and higher aspect ratio (AR) than the hot-bath foamed samples. The hot-press foaming process demonstrated that it has the potential to create sizable and flat nanocellular samples. The AR of cells foamed in the hot-press method was as high as 1.93, creating a new manufacturing method for anisotropic nanocellular foam with a cell size of less than 100 nm.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOSTc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663  aMOSTc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663  aMOSTc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663  aMOSTc-TE4 , Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663 3aanisotropy 3afoams 3aheat transfer 3aprocess design1 aTseng, Po-Chih1 aDemewoz, Nigus Maregu1 aYeh, Shu-Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9131-51330 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 Aug. 04, v. 61, no. 32 p.11790-11803dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c017243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013300170300001600303520146900319592002801788650002101816650001301837650001401850650001201864650002401876650001001900650001701910650001601927650001601943650001001959700001401969700001801983700001902001773011002020856008402130852000902214655001202223IND60082578420221119023149.0141029e198206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008257842DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-3040.ep115724172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJEFFERIES, C.J.10aExperimental systems and a mathematical model for studying temperature effects on pollen‐tube growth and fertilization in plum  ap. 231-236.  aCross and self pollen tubes were cultured in ‘Victoria’ plum flowers (Prunus domestica L.) at 5, 10, 15 and 20°C. Pollen‐tube lengths measured at intervals were fitted by S‐shaped growth curves (logistic function) and the parameters of the curves used to derive a generalized model for pollen‐tube growth based on accumulated temperatures. Above the threshold of 2.5°C, maximum growth rate was 0.34 mm per day‐degree and the tubes reached half their final length at 16.6 day‐degrees above 2.5°C. The model indicates that fertilization of plum flowers requires 16–20 d at a constant temperature of 5°C after pollination, but only 3–4 d at 15°C. Mathematical expressions based on the model are given for estimating pollen‐tube penetration and growth rate from values of cumulated temperature since pollination, and for estimating the cumulated temperature necessary for pollen tubes to penetrate a given distance. Pollen‐tube growth rates were the same in detached flowers, flowers attached to twigs, and flowers on young, grafted trees in pots. In detached flowers growth stopped before fertilization could occur, but some embryo sacs were fertilized in both the remaining treatments. Accurate pollen‐tube growth assessments can therefore be made with detached flowers which are most convenient to use and can be accommodated in small incubators. Studies on fertilization, however, must use flowers on bulky and expensive grafted trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus domestica 3abranches 3aflowering 3aflowers 3amathematical models 3aplums 3apollen tubes 3apollination 3atemperature 3atrees1 aBRAIN, P.1 aStott, K.

Although research indicates that tributary inputs have the potential to dilute these effects, knowledge at the food‐web level is still scarce. Here, we examined the riverine food‐web structure of the Colorado River below Glen Canyon Dam, focusing on organic matter sources, trophic diversity and food chain length. We asked how these components respond to pulsed flows from tributaries following monsoon thunderstorms that seasonally increase streamflow in the American Southwest. Tributaries increased the relative importance of terrestrial organic matter, particularly during the wet season below junctures of key tributaries. This contrasted with the algal‐based food‐web present immediately below Glen Canyon Dam. Tributary inputs during the monsoon also increased trophic diversity and food chain length: food chain length peaked below the confluence with the largest tributary (by discharge) in Grand Canyon, increasing by >1 trophic level over a 4–5 km reach possibly due to aquatic prey being flushed into the mainstem during heavy rain events. Our results illustrate that large tributaries can create seasonal discontinuities, influencing riverine food‐web structure in terms of allochthony, food‐web diversity and food chain length. Synthesis and applications. Pulsed flows from unregulated tributaries following seasonal monsoon rains increase the importance of terrestrially derived organic matter in large, regulated river food webs, increasing food chain length and trophic diversity downstream of tributary inputs. Protecting unregulated tributaries within hydropower cascades may be important if we are to mitigate food‐web structure alteration due to flow regulation by large dams. This is critical in the light of global hydropower development, especially in megadiverse, developing countries where dam placement (including completed and planned structures) is in tributaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic food webs 3abiodiversity 3adeveloping countries 3aenergy flow 3afood chain 3amonsoon season 3aorganic matter 3arain 3arivers 3astorms 3astream flow 3atrophic levels 3awater power 3awet season 3aColorado River 3aSouthwestern United States1 aCaron, Melanie1 aDoucett, Rick1 aDibble, Kimberly L.1 aRuhi, Albert1 aMarks, Jane C.1 aHungate, Bruce A.1 aKennedy, Ted A.0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2018 July, v. 55, no. 4 p.1884-1895dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57298x0021-89017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.131093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02882naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245010800169300001600277520150600293592002801799650002201827650002501849650002301874650002601897650002001923650001101943650001101954650001301965650001001978650001201988650002302000650001902023650001102042650001802053650001302071650001402084650001102098650001202109650002602121651001502147700001802162700002002180773011002200856008102310852000902391655001202400IND60550223520221118163001.0160909e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055022352DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-016-0237-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLehtimäki, Maria14aThe role of oxygen conditions in the microbial dissolution of biogenic silica under brackish conditions  ap. 355-371.  aRegeneration of biogenic silica (BSi) is essential for the constant supply of dissolved silica (DSi) to diatoms in aquatic ecosystems, where these primary producers play an important role in carbon (C) drawdown. Increased DSi concentrations have been detected in the oxygen (O₂) depleted bottom waters of e.g. the brackish Baltic Sea, which is suffering from one of the largest anoxic or hypoxic marine areas in the world. As hypoxia is likely to become more frequent also in coastal areas, the effects of suboxic conditions on the silicon (Si) cycle should be explored. To examine the effects of hypoxia on microbially mediated DSi release from diatom detritus and sediment to brackish seawater, a batch laboratory experiment was conducted. Hypoxic conditions facilitated more complete dissolution of diatoms than oxic conditions. However, the age, origin and physiological condition of the BSi significantly affected the dissolution rate, and the presence of sedimentary material decreased BSi dissolution. Inhibition of bacterial activity reduced the dissolution of diatoms under both oxic and hypoxic conditions, and T-RFLP of 16S rRNA genes confirmed that O₂ conditions affected the composition of the bacterial community. Taken together, these results demonstrate that oxygen conditions and microbes play a fundamental role in regeneration of diatom BSi. Moreover, the results may explain the elevated DSi concentrations associated with O₂ depletion in the bottom waters of the Baltic Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abacterial communities 3abiogeochemistry 3acarbon 3acoasts 3adrawdown 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3aoxygen 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater 3asediments 3asilica 3asilicon 3atrophic relationships 3aBaltic Sea1 aSinkko, Hanna1 aTallberg, Petra0 tBiogeochemistry.g2016 Sept., v. 129, no. 3 p.355-371dSpringer International Publishingx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-016-0237-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245008600171300001600257520145100273592002801724650001301752650001401765650002501779650001401804650001201818650000901830650000901839650000901848650001001857650002201867650002101889700002501910700002001935773011001955856004802065852000902113655001202122IND50063058820221120235148.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006305882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-012-1470-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Lieshout, Emile10aConsequences of paternal care on pectoral fin allometry in a desert-dwelling fish  ap. 513-518.  aPositive static allometry is a scaling relationship where the relative size of traits covaries with adult body size. Traditionally, positive allometry is thought to result from either altered physiological requirements at larger body size or from strongly condition-dependent allocation under sexual selection. Yet, there are no theoretical reasons why positive allometry cannot evolve in fitness-related traits that are solely under the influence of natural selection. We investigated scaling and sexual dimorphism of a naturally selected trait, pectoral fin size, in comparison to a trait important in male–male combat, head width in natural populations of a fish, the desert goby Chlamydogobius eremius. Male desert gobies provide uniparental care and use their pectoral fins to fan the brood (often under hypoxic conditions); hence, larger fins are expected to be more efficient. Male pectoral fins do not appear to fulfil a signalling function in this species. We found that, for both pectoral fin size and head width, males exhibited positive allometric slopes and greater relative trait size (allometric elevation) than females. However, for head width, females also showed positive allometry, albeit to a lesser degree than males. Because fin locomotory function typically does not result in positive allometry, our findings indicate that other naturally selected uses, such as paternal care, can exaggerate trait scaling relationships.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGobiidae 3aallometry 3aanaerobic conditions 3abody size 3afemales 3afins 3afish 3ahead 3amales 3asexual dimorphism 3asexual selection1 aSvensson, P.

During tissue inflammation, specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) facilitate the resolution of inflammation. SPMs regulate the pulmonary immune response during infection and allergic asthma; however, the role of SPMs in O₃-induced pulmonary injury and inflammation is unknown. We hypothesize that O₃ exposure induces pulmonary inflammation by reducing SPMs. To evaluate this, male C57Bl/6J mice were exposed to filtered air (FA) or 1 ppm O₃ for 3 h and necropsied 24 h after exposure. Pulmonary injury/inflammation was determined by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) differentials, protein, and lung tissue cytokine expression. SPMs were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and SPM receptors leukotriene B₄ receptor 1 (BLT-1), formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2), chemokine-like receptor 1 (ChemR23), and SPM-generating enzyme (5-LOX and 12/15-LOX) expression were measured by real time PCR. 24 h post-O₃ exposure, BAL PMNs and protein content were significantly increased compared to FA controls. O₃-induced lung inflammation was associated with significant decreases in pulmonary SPM precursors (14-HDHA, 17-HDHA), the SPM PDX, and in pulmonary ALX/FPR2, ChemR23, and 12/15-LOX expression. Exogenous administration of 14-HDHA, 17-HDHA, and PDX 1 h prior to O₃ exposure rescued pulmonary SPM precursors/SPMs, decreased proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, and decreased BAL macrophages and PMNs. Taken together, these data indicate that O₃-mediated SPM reductions may drive O₃-induced pulmonary inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data  aR01AT008375cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  aP30ES025128cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002  cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciencesdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000066  aR01ES027574cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000002 3aair 3aasthma 3achemokines 3aenzymes 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amales 3anecropsy 3aozone 3apeptide receptors 3aprotein content 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicology 0aspecialized pro-resolving mediators 0apulmonary inflammation1 aReece, Sky W1 aCrouch, Miranda J1 aLuo, Bin1 aBoone, Andria D1 aYaeger, Michael1 aHodge, Myles1 aPsaltis, Christine1 aHannan, Johanna L1 aManke, Jonathan1 aArmstrong, Michael L1 aReisdorph, Nichole1 aTighe, Robert M1 aShaikh, Saame Raza1 aGowdy, Kymberly M0 tToxicological sciences.g2018 June 01, v. 163, no. 2 p.466-477dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl4010831x1096-09297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfy0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03339naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245016100207300001600368500001500384520174400399592002802143650001702171650000902188650001602197650001802213650001502231650002002246650001802266650001402284650002202298650001902320650001202339650001802351650001202369650001602381650001302397650001202410651001102422653001702433653002202450653002102472653001902493653002502512700001402537700001802551700001902569700001802588773009502606856008702701852000902788655001202797IND60565553820221122130359.0190408e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056555382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrovato, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7081-064810aRisky behaviours from the production to the consumption of bivalve molluscs: Involving stakeholders in the prioritization process based on consensus methods  ap. 426-435.  a2019-12-06  aThe most recent data show that shellfish farming represents approximately 60% of the total aquaculture production in Europe. Bivalves molluscs are internationally recognized as a potential vehicle for foodborne diseases especially when consumed raw or improperly cooked. Bivalves are filter-feeding animals that may accumulate particles present in the surrounding water, including viruses and pathogenic microorganisms. For these reasons consumers have to be careful during purchasing, handling and cooking of this food. In Europe several regulations have been adopted to protect consumers’ health. However in the development of new food safety strategies it is also crucial to find an effective approach to guide authorities’ decisions on priorities for controlling foodborne risks. In the article a study for the selection and ranking of behavioural information on bivalve risks is reported. The “consensus methods” provide a means of synthesising information and of harnessing the insights of experts to enable decisions shared and validated by the scientific community. The Delphi method and Nominal Group technique (NGT) were applied for their capability to assess the level of agreement and to develop consensus among participants. In the article, the NGT is presented as a way to involve relevant stakeholders in the ranking of risky behaviours from the production to the consumption of bivalve molluscs previously selected by scientific experts through the Delphi method. The inclusion of a full range of experts and stakeholders in a community participatory research project regarding food risk management represents an innovative approach in the Italian public health context, especially in the analysis of bivalve risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3astakeholders 3arisk 3aaquaculture 3apublic health 3apurchasing 3arisk management 3aDelphi method 3ashellfish 3afoodborne illness 3aprioritization 3aviruses 3arisk behavior 3acooking 3afood safety 3aBivalvia 3aexperts 3aEurope 0aStakeholders 0aConsensus methods 0aMolluscs bivalve 0amicroorganisms 0aRisks prioritization1 aPinto, A.1 aArcangeli, G.1 aMascarello, G.1 aRavarotto, L.0 tFood control.g2017 Aug., v. 78 p.426-435dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007200165300001600237520095500253592002801208650002301236650001401259650001001273650001701283650001901300650001101319650001601330650000901346700001901355700001701374773011501391852000901506856008201515655001201597IND4393573320221120034359.0190314e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439357332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-006-0841-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhuong, Le Xuan10aEffects of heat treatment on brittleness of Styrax tonkinensis wood  ap. 181-186.  aA new approach is proposed for the evaluation of the brittleness of heat-treated Styrax tonkinensis wood. Heat treatment made wood more brittle when wood was heated at a higher temperature or for a longer time. The brittleness increased to four times that of the control when wood was heated at 200°C for 12 h. For treatment at 160°C, the increase in brittleness without any change in weight is thought to be possibly caused by the relocation of lignin molecules. At higher temperatures, loss of amorphous polysaccharides due to degradation is thought to become the main factor affecting brittleness. The crystallites that were newly formed after 2 h of treatment showed brittleness that was different from that of the inherent crystallites remaining after 12 h of heat treatment. This inherent crystalline cellulose possibly plays a role in brittleness. There is also the possibility of using color to predict the brittleness of heat-treated wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStyrax tonkinensis 3acellulose 3acolor 3acrystallites 3aheat treatment 3alignin 3atemperature 3awood1 aShida, Satoshi1 aSaito, Yukie0 tJournal of wood science.g2007 June, v. 53, no. 3 p.181-186dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-006-0841-03Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01444naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011600155300001800271520028800289592002800577650002700605650002300632650001300655650001500668650001600683700001400699700002000713700001900733700002100752700002200773700002000795700001700815700002000832773013400852856007500986852000901061655001201070IND60658800720221121124304.0190826e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065880072DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03306e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yizhu10aN-fused carbazole–zinc porphyrin–free-base porphyrin triad for efficient near-IR dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 4010-4012.  aN-fused carbazole–zinc porphyrin–free-base porphyrin triad featuring an ethynyl-linkage was synthesized; efficient sensitization as long as 900 nm was demonstrated and an overall light-to-electricity conversion effciency of 5.21% was achieved under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3alighting 3aporphyrins 3asolar cells1 aLin, Hong1 aDy, Joanne Ting1 aTamaki, Koichi1 aNakazaki, Jotaro1 aNakayama, Daisuke1 aUchida, Satoshi1 aKubo, Takaya1 aSegawa, Hiroshi0 tChemical communications.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 47, no. 13 p.4010-4012dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc03306e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245010700170300001800277520070500295592002801000650002301028650001101051650001701062650001101079700002001090700001801110700002101128773013401149856007401283852000901357655001201366IND60635357520221122010255.0190329e20190326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063535752DNAL7 a10.1039/c8cc09610d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArévalo-López, Angel M.14aThe hidden story in BaNiO₃ to BaNiO₂ transformation: adaptive structural series and NiO exsolution  ap. 3717-3720.  aBaNiO₃ crystal to BaNiO₂ crystal transformation is reported.

A composite approach was used to solve the novel structure for x ∼ 1/6 with charge ordered Ni²⁺ and Ni⁴⁺. We argue that this NiO exsolution is responsible for the increased oxygen enhanced reactivity recently reported. Upon re-oxidation, oxygen-deficient mixed valent BaNi³/⁴⁺O₃₋ₓ are obtained such that the full redox cycle is irreversible and goes through a diversity of structural and nickel valence adaptative oxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3anickel 3anickel oxide 3aoxygen1 aHuvé, Marielle1 aSimon, Pardis1 aMentré, Olivier0 tChemical communications.g2019 Mar. 26, v. 55, no. 26 p.3717-3720dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8cc09610d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245004900164520177800213592002801991650001202019650001502031650002402046650001102070650001702081650001302098650002202111650002002133650002502153650001602178650002102194650001702215650001602232650001702248651001302265700003002278700001702308700002002325700002702345700002002372700002702392773012902419856007502548852000902623655001202632IND60781082620221118033808.0220623e20220618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078108262DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141229202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolswijk, Giovanna 10aCan Mangrove Silviculture Be Carbon Neutral?  aMatang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in peninsular Malaysia has been managed for pole and charcoal production from Rhizophora stands with a 30-year rotation cycle since 1902. The aim of this study is to estimate the carbon budget of the MMFR by considering the carbon stock of the forest, evaluated from remote sensing data (Landsat TM and ETM+, JERS-1 SAR, ALOS PALSAR, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, SRTM, TANDEM-X, and WorldView-2) for aboveground carbon and field data for belowground carbon. This was investigated in combination with the emissions from the silvicultural activities in the production chain, plus the distribution and consumer-related activities covering the supply chain, estimated with appropriate emission factors. The aboveground biomass carbon stock of the productive forest was of 1.4 TgC, while for the protective forest (not used for silviculture) it was at least equal to 1.2 TgC. The total soil carbon of ca. 32 TgC shows the potential of the MMFR as a carbon sink. However, the commercial exploitation of mangroves also generates greenhouse gasses with an estimate of nearly 152.80 Mg C ha⁻¹ during charcoal production and up to 0.53 Mg C ha⁻¹ during pole production, for a total emission of 1.8 TgC. Consequently, if the productive forest alone is considered, then the carbon budget is negative, and the ongoing silvicultural management seems to be an unsustainable practice that needs a reduction in the exploited area of at least 20% to achieve carbon neutrality. However, even with the current management, and considering the protective forest together with the productive zones, the MMFR carbon budget is slightly positive, thus showing the importance of mangrove conservation as part of the management for the preservation of the carbon stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aRhizophora 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3acharcoal 3aforest management 3aforest reserves 3aglobal carbon budget 3agreenhouses 3amangrove forests 3asilviculture 3asoil carbon 3asupply chain 3aMalaysia1 aBarrios Trullols, Africa 1 aHugé, Jean 1 aOtero, Viviana 1 aSatyanarayana, Behara 1 aLucas, Richard 1 aDahdouh-Guebas, Farid 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 June 18, v. 14, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141229203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03616naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245021100199506007600410520205200486592002802538506003702566650001402603650001602617650002002633650001402653650002002667650001102687650002202698650001802720650001802738650001202756650001702768650001002785650001202795650003302807650001202840650001102852650002402863651001902887700002302906773012202929856007403051852000903125655001203134IND60650720320221207095905.0190710e20190217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065072032DNAL7 a10.3390/nu110204222doi7 aPMC64126402pmcid7 a307815512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalla, Luigi 10aDiurnal Patterns of Energy Intake Derived via Principal Component Analysis and Their Relationship with Adiposity Measures in Adolescents: Results from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey RP (2008–2012)  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMounting evidence points towards the existence of an association between energy intake in the evening and an increased prevalence and risk of being overweight and of obesity.

The DEP were derived using a principal component analysis on the correlation matrix. Three orthogonal diurnal patterns were interpretable as (i) a linear contrast (8% of total system variation) between breakfast and an earlier lunch vs. a later lunch, late dinner, and evening/night snack, renamed &ldquo;phase shift&rdquo; DEP; (ii) a linear contrast (6.0% of system variation) between midmorning snacks, late lunch, and early dinner vs. breakfast, early and late morning snacks, early lunch, midafternoon snacks, and late dinner, renamed &ldquo;early eating and grazing&rdquo; DEP; (iii) a linear contrast (6.0% of system variation) between late main meals vs. early main meals and night snacks which was renamed &ldquo;early main meals and night snacks vs. late main meals&rdquo; DEP. After the adjustment for confounders, every 1 unit increase in the &ldquo;early main meals and night snacks vs. late main meals&rdquo;&rsquo; DEP score was significantly associated with a 0.29 kg/m2 and 11.6 mm increase in Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference, respectively. There were no significant associations with the other two main DEPs. In conclusion, adolescents who tended to eat large early main meals and night snacks rather than slightly later main meals without night snacks had higher BMI and waist circumference. Further research is required to explore the determinants of DEP and to explore the impact of the context of eating and socioecological factors in the development of specific DEP.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadiposity 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3abreakfast 3adietary surveys 3adinner 3adiurnal variation 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3aenzymes 3afood records 3alunch 3aobesity 3aprincipal component analysis 3arolling 3asnacks 3awaist circumference 3aUnited Kingdom1 aAlmoosawi, Suzana 0 tNutrients.g2019 Feb. 17, v. 11, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu110204223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245012200159300001400281520132200295592002801617650001901645650002401664650001801688650001001706650001401716650001201730650001701742650001401759650002301773650001101796650001401807650000901821650001001830651001001840700001301850700001301863700001701876700002201893773010801915856008102023852000902104655001202113IND60477949620221122055948.0160129e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047794962DNAL7 a10.1007/s12603-016-0680-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Q.10aUnderstanding risk in the oldest old: Frailty and the metabolic syndrome in a Chinese community sample aged 90+ years  ap. 82-88.  aOBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between frailty and the metabolic syndrome and to evaluate how these contribute to mortality in very old people. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from the Project of Longevity and Aging in Dujiangyan. SETTING: Community sample from Sichuan Province, China. PARTICIPANTS: People aged 90+ years (n=767; baseline age=93.7±3.4 years; 68.0% women. MEASUREMENTS: After a baseline health assessment, participants were followed for four years (54.0% died). A frailty index (FI) was calculated as the sum of deficits present, divided by the 35 health-related deficits considered. Relationships between the FI and the metabolic syndrome were tested; their effect on death was examined. RESULTS: The mean FI was 0.26 ±0.11. Higher FI scores were associated with a greater risk of death, adjusted for age, sex, education, and metabolic syndrome items. The hazard ratio was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 1.02, 1.04) for each 1% percent increase of the FI. The mortality risk did not change with the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio=0.99; 0.71-1.36). CONCLUSIONS: In the oldest old, frailty was a significant risk for near-term death, regardless of the metabolic syndrome. Even using age-adjusted models, the epidemiology of late life illness may need to account for frailty routinely.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3aconfidence interval 3adata analysis 3adeath 3aeducation 3aelderly 3aepidemiology 3alongevity 3ametabolic syndrome 3amodels 3amortality 3arisk 3awomen 3aChina1 aSong, X.1 aYang, M.1 aDong, Birong1 aRockwood, Kenneth0 tjournal of nutrition, health & aging.g2016 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.82-88dSpringer Parisx1279-77077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12603-016-0680-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245008900205300001600294520129500310592002801605650001201633650001701645650001101662650002401673650002001697650002401717650001301741650001601754650001401770653003001784653002401814653002001838653002401858653001601882700005501898773009101953856008502044852000902129655001202138IND60647507120221119005127.0190718e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064750712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Liang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3361-078312aA data-driven approach for industrial utility systems optimization under uncertainty  ap. 559-569.  aEnergy optimization of utility system helps to reduce the operating cost and save energy for the industrial plants. Widespread uncertainties such as device efficiency and process demand pose new challenges for this issue. A hybrid modeling framework is presented by introducing the operating data into mechanism model to adapt the changes of device efficiency and operating conditions. Mathematical models of boilers, steam turbines, and letdown valves are then developed in the framework. Based on the process historical data of a real-world plant, a Dirichlet process mixture model is used to capture the support information of uncertain parameters. Bridging data-driven robust optimization (DDRO) and utility system optimization under uncertainty, a robust mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model is developed by utilizing the derived uncertainty set. The robust counterpart of the developed model can be reformulated as a tractable MINLP problem including conic quadratic constraints that could be solved efficiently. A real-world case study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in protecting against uncertainties and achieving a good trade-off between optimality and robustness of the operational decisions for industrial utility systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboilers 3acase studies 3aenergy 3amathematical models 3aoperating costs 3asystem optimization 3aturbines 3auncertainty 3autilities 0aIndustrial utility system 0aEnergy optimization 0aHistorical data 0aRobust optimization 0aUncertainty1 aYou, Fengqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9609-42990 tEnergy.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 182 p.559-569dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03188naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245010400205300002000309506007600329520144000405592002801845506003701873650000801910650002701918650000801945650002701953650003101980650001302011650002402024650002102048650001902069650001002088650002402098650001302122650001302135650001502148653001002163653001302173653002502186653003502211700001502246700002502261700002002286700001702306700002402323700002202347773017702369856007902546852000902625655001202634IND60173817820221207045201.0150603e20130924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017381782DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13135871102doi7 aPMC37857312pmcid7 a239403602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Zhonggang10aEfficient genome engineering in human pluripotent stem cells using Cas9 from Neisseria meningitidis  ap. 15644-15649.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome engineering in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) holds great promise for biomedical research and regenerative medicine. Recently, an RNA-guided, DNA-cleaving interference pathway from bacteria [the type II clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) pathway] has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells, greatly facilitating genome editing. Only two CRISPR-Cas systems (from Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus thermophilus), each with their own distinct targeting requirements and limitations, have been developed for genome editing thus far. Furthermore, limited information exists about homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated gene targeting using long donor DNA templates in hPSCs with these systems. Here, using a distinct CRISPR-Cas system from Neisseria meningitidis , we demonstrate efficient targeting of an endogenous gene in three hPSC lines using HDR. The Cas9 RNA-guided endonuclease from N. meningitidis (NmCas9) recognizes a 5′-NNNNGATT-3′ protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) different from those recognized by Cas9 proteins from S. pyogenes and S. thermophilus (SpCas9 and StCas9, respectively). Similar to SpCas9, NmCas9 is able to use a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) to direct its activity. Because of its distinct protospacer adjacent motif, the N. meningitidis CRISPR-Cas machinery increases the sequence contexts amenable to RNA-directed genome editing.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aNeisseria meningitidis 3aRNA 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3abacteria 3abiomedical research 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene targeting 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3amedicine 3aproteins 3astem cells 0acrRNA 0atracrRNA 0aembryonic stem cells 0ainduced pluripotent stem cells1 aZhang, Yan1 aPropson, Nicholas E.1 aHowden, Sara E.1 aChu, Li-Fang1 aSontheimer, Erik J.1 aThomson, James A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Sept. 24, v. 110, no. 39 p.15644-15649dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13135871103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005800148245016700206300002000373520169500393592002802088650001302116650002302129650002602152650002102178650001402199650002402213650001302237650002402250650001502274650001202289650001302301650001502314650001602329650001202345650001402357650001902371650001402390650001302404650000902417700006202426700005602488700005602544773015502600856008302755852000902838655001202847IND60751225020221122040107.0220411e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075122502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-14376-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeskin, Feyyaz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2813-994X10aElement concentration, daily intake of elements, and health risk indices of wild mushrooms collected from Belgrad Forest and Ilgaz Mountain National Park (Turkey)  ap. 51544-51555.  aThe aim of this study was to determine the element content of wild edible and inedible mushroom species (Agaricus campestris, Armillaria ostoyae, Boletus reticulatus, Bondarzewia mesenterica, Bovistella utriformis, Cantharellus cibarius, Marasmius oreades, Megacollybia platyphylla, Meripilus giganteus, Neoboletus erythropus, Panellus stipticus, Phaeotremella foliacea, Pleurotus ostreatus, Podoscypha multizonata, Russula aurea, R. chloroides, R. virescens, T. versicolor, Trametes gibbose, and Trichaptum biforme) collected from the Belgrad Forests and the Ilgaz Mountain National Park.

Mass transfer rate coefficients were used to determine the impact of water chemistry and common bleach disinfection rinses on the removal and inactivation of the pathogen. Attachment mass transfer rate coefficients generally increased with ionic strength. Detachment mass transfer rate coefficients were nearly the same in KCl and AGW rinses; however, the detachment phase lasted longer in KCl than AGW (18 ± 4 min and 4 ± 2 min, respectively), indicating that the ions present during attachment play a significant role in the cells' ability to remain attached. Specifically, increasing bleach rinse concentration by two orders of magnitude was found to increase the detachment mass transfer rate coefficient by 20 times (from 5.7 ± 0.7 × 10−11 m/s to 112.1 ± 26.8 × 10−11 m/s for 10 ppb and 1000 ppb, respectively), and up to 88 ± 4% of attached cells remained alive. The spinach leaf texture was incorporated within a COMSOL model of disinfectant concentration gradients, which revealed nearly 15% of the leaf surface is exposed to almost 1000 times lower concentration than the bulk rinse solution.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture U.S. Department of Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3ableaching agents 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3ahydrochemistry 3aionic strength 3aions 3aleaves 3amass transfer 3amodels 3apathogens 3apotassium chloride 3aspinach 3atexture 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aFoodborne pathogens 0aBacterial attachment 0aDisinfection 0aProduce 0aSpinach1 aMayton, Holly M.1 aLuth, Madeline R.1 aWalker, Sharon L.0 tFood microbiology.g2017 Apr., v. 62 p.212-220dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34976x0740-00207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2016.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle01810naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245010500179520076400284592002801048650001401076650003201090650002701122650002901149650003001178650001601208650001101224650002601235700001901261700002001280773009401300856008101394852000901475655001201484IND60725036220221121170207.0210124e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072503622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2019.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarl, Asger Alexander Wendt10aElectricity production and consumption data from Danish power grid and governmental office buildings  aThis data article is the second component of the two-part study on the effects of high-resolution energy data on building life cycle assessments (LCAs) (Environmental performance assessment of the use stage of buildings using dynamic high-resolution energy consumption and data on grid composition, in press) [1].

DBS were prepared from nine BoHV-1 seropositive plasma samples spiked with erythrocytes. Spots were extracted automatically on a DBS-MS 500 HCT autosampler, as well as manually using a 3.2 mm puncher. DBS were equally prepared from 20 bovine seronegative EDTA-blood samples and extracted automatically. Extracts were tested in a commercial BoHV-1 antibody ELISA and results were compared with those from liquid plasma. Eight seropositive DBS samples were additionally tested in the ELISA after storage for four weeks at different conditions. After automated extraction all DBS samples yielded qualitatively correct results and were in full accordance with those obtained from liquid plasma. Automated extraction using a 6 mm extraction head was more sensitive than a 4 mm head. Stability of DBS was highest at − 20 °C and decreased with increasing temperature. Even after four weeks at 37 °C, most seropositive samples yielded a positive result in the ELISA. The minimal invasiveness, biosafety, and simplicity of DBS collection together with automated extraction represents an interesting, high-throughput compatible alternative to liquid blood samples for BoHV-1 monitoring or eradication programs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aantibodies 3aantibody detection 3aautomation 3abiosafety 3acattle 3aerythrocytes 3ahead 3aliquids 3aseroprevalence 3atemperature 0aAutomated extraction 0aBoHV-1 0aDBS-MS 500 HCT 0aDried blood spot 0aELISA1 aGehrig, Oliver1 aLuginbühl, Marc1 aFraefel, Cornel1 aGaugler, Stefan0 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Dec., v. 310 p.114626-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.114626  aDNAL 7aarticle03043naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245019400197300001800391500002000409520146600429592002801895596006201923650002201985650001102007650002002018650001702038650002002055650001702075650001502092650001002107650001002117650001802127650004302145650001802188651001602206700001902222700001802241700002002259700002002279700001502299700002002314700002302334773012202357856007302479852000902552655001202561IND60714385820221121232248.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071438582DNAL7 a10.1111/jpy.130142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovis, Phil M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8802-498410aLindavia intermedia (Bacillariophyceae) and Nuisance lake Snow in New Zealand: Chitin Content and Quantitative PCR Methods to Estimate Cell Concentrations and Expression of Chitin Synthase1  ap. 1232-1244.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLake snow, caused by the freshwater centric diatom Lindavia intermedia, has become problematic in several large, oligotrophic New Zealand lakes over the past decade. Macroaggregates produced by L. intermedia foul fishing lines, intake screens, and water filters, and have a negative impact on recreational values. It was confirmed that the fibers constituting lake snow are composed of chitin, two chitin synthase genes (chs1 and 2) from L. intermedia were characterized, new qPCR‐based tools to quantify the abundance of the species and measure expression of chs2 relative to the reference gene act1 (the product of which has cytoskeletal functions) were developed. The strong heterogeneity and mucilaginous nature of lake snow samples create particular difficulties for calibrations of gene or transcript copy numbers with cell densities and obtaining high yields of mRNA. However, data collected from four lakes during November 2018 and February and May 2019 show that abundance of L. intermedia is always high when lake snow is also abundant, but that a full range of L. intermedia abundance can occur when lake snow is absent, suggesting that chitin production is not obligate in L. intermedia. This result is consistent with the available data for chs2 expression, which suggest higher transcription when lake snow is abundant. Lake snow production by L. intermedia therefore requires an as yet undetermined stimulus independent of cell abundance.  aPublisher supplied data  aC09X1711cMinistry of Business, Innovation and Employment 3aBacillariophyceae 3achitin 3achitin synthase 3acytoskeleton 3adata collection 3afishing line 3afreshwater 3agenes 3alakes 3amessenger RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3awater filters 3aNew Zealand1 aSales, Ruth E.1 aGordon, Keith1 aManning, Nathan1 aDuleba, Mónika1 aÁcs, Éva1 aDressler, Mirko1 aSchallenberg, Marc0 tJournal of phycology.g2020 Oct., v. 56, no. 5 p.1232-1244dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl23523x0022-36467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jpy.130143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02406naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012100164300001800285500001400303520107100317592002801388650000901416650002501425650001801450650001501468650001201483650001001495650001001505650001701515650002101532650001401553653001601567653002201583653001901605700002101624700001801645700001801663700002301681773018601704856007301890852000901963655001201972IND60692353920221119174809.0200502e20071123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069235392DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.704092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aICHINOMIYA, Masayuki12aA Protein Kinase C-Encoding Gene, pkcA, Is Essential to the Viability of the Filamentous Fungus Aspergillus nidulans  ap. 2787-2799.  aNAL-light  aA protein kinase C (PKC)-encoding gene (pkcA) was isolated from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans. Although we attempted to isolate pkcA deletion mutants, we obtained only heterokaryons that had both ΔpkcA and pkcA ⁺ nuclei. Conidia produced by the heterokaryon germinated. The germ tubes, however, lysed frequently and no colony formation was observed, indicating that the pkcA gene is essential to the viability of A. nidulans. We constructed conditional mutants (alcA(p)-pkcA mutants) that expressed pkcA under the control of the alcA promoter (alcA(p)). Under alcA(p)-repressing conditions, their colonies were smaller than those of the wild-type strains and their hyphae lysed frequently. These phenotypes were not remedied under moderate- or high-osmolarity conditions; the growth defect deteriorated further under the latter. Under alcA(p)-inducing conditions, the alcA(p)-pkcA mutants also showed growth-sensitivity to cell wall destabilizing agents. These results indicate that pkcA plays an important role in the maintenance of cell integrity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlca 3aAspergillus nidulans 3abiotechnology 3acell walls 3aconidia 3afungi 3agenes 3aheterokaryon 3aprotein kinase C 3aviability 0aAspergillus 0afilamentous fungi 0acell integrity1 aUCHIDA, Hirotaka1 aKOSHI, Yukako1 aOHTA, Akinori1 aHORIUCHI, Hiroyuki0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2007 Nov. 23, v. 71, no. 11 p.2787-2799dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.704093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014400165300001400309520119900323592002801522650004401550650002601594650002201620650001101642650002901653650002101682650002101703650002501724650001301749650002001762650002401782650001401806650002101820650002401841650000901865650001401874650001501888650001601903650003301919650001401952650001101966650003701977653001902014653002502033653002702058653001702085653002002102653002502122700001602147700001702163700001502180700002202195700005402217700002002271700001502291700001802306773012402324856008302448852000902531655001202540IND60597094720221121002009.0200318e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059709472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.04.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yanbin10aCorrosion resistance and antibacterial properties of polysiloxane modified layer-by-layer assembled self-healing coating on magnesium alloy  ap. 43-50.  aMagnesium (Mg) alloys have shown great potential in biomedical materials due to their biocompatibility and biodegradability. However, rapid corrosion rate, which is an inevitable obstacle, hinders their clinical applications. Besides, it is necessary to endow Mg alloys with antibacterial properties, which are crucial for temporary implants. In this study, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and polymethyltrimethoxysilane (PMTMS) were introduced into AZ31 Mg alloys via layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly and siloxane self-condensation reaction. The characteristics of the composite films were investigated by SEM, UV–vis, FT-IR, and XRD measurements. Corrosion resistance of the samples was measured by electrochemical and hydrogen evolution tests. Antibacterial activities of the films against Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated by plate-counting method. The results demonstrated that the composite film with smooth and uniform morphologies could enhance the corrosion resistance of Mg alloys owing to the physical barrier and the self-healing functionality of polysiloxane. Moreover, the composite coating possessed antibacterial properties and could prolong the release of assembled silver ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiodegradability 3abiomedical materials 3acoatings 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogen production 3aions 3amagnesium 3ananosilver 3aplate count 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asiloxanes 3asilver 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aLayer-by-layer 0aCorrosion resistance 0aAntibacterial property 0aSelf-healing 0aMagnesium alloy 0aSilver nanoparticles1 aShi, Liqian1 aJi, Xiaojing1 aLi, Jichen1 aHan, Zhuangzhuang1 aLi, Shuoqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7138-37131 aZeng, Rongchang1 aZhang, Fen1 aWang, Zhenlin0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 526 p.43-50dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.04.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245015500177500002200332520137900354592002801733650003201761650003301793650002001826650002101846650002201867650001001889650002001899650001401919650002301933650001001956650000901966650003401975650001902009650001202028650001802040650001702058650001402075653001902089653000902108653002902117653003702146700002302183700002402206700002502230700002202255700002402277700002702301700001502328700002002343700002602363773011002389856005302499852000902552655001202561IND60795447220221121205058.0221004e20220927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079544722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.1146272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuntawang, Thunyamas10aDevelopment of an immunochromatographic strip test for antigen detection of elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus)  aPre-press version  aElephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV) is the causative agent of EEHV-hemorrhagic disease (EEHV-HD) in elephants worldwide. This disease is highly virulent and a predominant cause of fatalities in young Asian elephants. Rapid diagnosis and aggressive therapies have been determined to be a key strategy in the successful treatment of this disease. Herein, we have developed the immunochromatographic strip test for EEHV detection. Accordingly, 31.2kDa of partial EEHV DNA polymerase (DNApol) protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and used to generate rabbit polyclonal anti-EEHV DNApol antibodies. These were then used to develop an ICS test for EEHV antigen detection using the double-antibody sandwich colloidal gold method. Anti-EEHV DNApol antibodies conjugated with 40nm colloidal gold solution were used as a detector, while rabbit anti-EEHV DNApol and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies immobilized on the nitrocellulose membrane were used as the test and control lines, respectively. The test had a detection limit of 1.25 ×10⁵ viral genome copies (vgc)/mL of EEHV obtained from blood samples. Moreover, no specialized equipment or laboratory infrastructure was required in the administration of this test. This developed ICS test for EEHV antigen detection can be used in field application for the rapid detection of EEHV in resource-limited environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aElephantid betaherpesvirus 1 3aElephas maximus 3aEscherichia coli 3aantigen detection 3ablood 3adetection limit 3aequipment 3aetiological agents 3agoats 3agold 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3ainfrastructure 3arabbits 3arapid methods 3aviral genome 3avirulence 0aDNA polymerase 0aEEHV 0aEEHV-hemorrhagic disease 0aimmunochromatographic strip test1 aSittisak, Tidaratt1 aSrivorakul, Saralee1 aPhotichai, Kornravee1 aAiumurai, Pisinee1 aThitaram, Chatchote1 aSthitmatee, Nattawooti1 aXu, Weili,1 aSookrung, Nitat1 aPringproa, Kidsadagon0 tJournal of virological methods.g2022 Sept. 27,  p.114627-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12356x0166-09347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2022.114627  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010000165246009300265300001600358520093100374592002801305650001501333650001301348650001001361650001001371650001101381650001801392700002201410700001801432700001901450700002001469700002101489700002201510773011801532856004801650852000901698655001201707IND4469479120221120044255.0120815e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446947912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-012-0607-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuta, Satoshi10aSchallabsorption und Formbeständigkeit eines neu entwickelten Wärme- und Schalldämmmaterials3 aSound absorption and form retention of newly developed heat-insulating/acoustic material  ap. 697-704.  aA wooden mat to be used as heat-insulating/acoustic material was developed using wood shavings in their raw curled flake form as the primary material. This report discusses the influences of fabrication conditions on sound absorption and form retention. The results showed that the form retention was increased with kenaf composition. However, the normal incidence absorption coefficient decreased with increasing kenaf composition and improved with increasing shavings composition. The increase of airflow resistivity was shown as the reason. Moreover, element’s internal loss of solid-borne sound transmission and the influences of various acoustic parameters that the shape of the element brought were considered as the reason. Sound absorption coefficient in a reverberation room was measured under optimum fabrication conditions, and the performance of the mat was found to be approximately equal to that of glass wool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair flow 3aglass 3akenaf 3asounds 3awood shavings1 aNishizawa, Miyoko1 aTakasu, Yasuo1 aOhta, Yukinobu1 aMori, Tatsunori1 aYamasaki, Mariko1 aSasaki, Yasutoshi0 tEuropean Journal of Wood and Wood Products.g2012 Sept., v. 70, no. 5 p.697-704dSpringer-Verlagx0018-37687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00107-012-0607-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011500167300001600282520171500298592002802013650001202041650001702053650002402070650001702094650001202111650002202123650001402145650001902159650001502178650002202193650001002215650001502225650001602240650001302256650003302269650001302302650001902315650001502334650001502349650000902364650001402373651001302387653001402400653001702414653001502431653001202446700002002458700001902478700002002497773010802517856008402625852000902709655001202718IND60636768220221118041334.0190815e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063676822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2019.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegife, Arega10aLand use land cover dynamics, its drivers and environmental implications in Lake Hawassa Watershed of Ethiopia  ap. 178-190.  aLake Hawassa watershed is characterized by decades of deterioration with mismanagement of natural resources. Hence, the current study was aimed at assessing the magnitude and transformation patterns of land use land cover categories over the last 45 years, the major drivers of land use land cover changes and the environmental implications of land use land cover dynamics in Lake Hawassa Watershed. The study triangulated data from Landsat images (1972, 1992 and 2017), focus group discussions, interviews and farmers’ lived experiences through household survey to evaluate the change and examine the underlying factors and its implications. The land use land cover change detection results revealed significant conversion from shrubland, woodland, and forest to built-up, bare land cultivated land and agroforestry. The proportion of cultivated land and agroforestry increased from 24.2% of the watershed in 1972 to 62% in 2017. These two land uses have gained large parcel of land from naturally vegetated land covers. Overall, about 74.34% of the watershed experienced changes in land cover in 45 years. The changes were driven by proximate and underlying drivers. The identified drivers were expansion of agricultural activities, urban and infrastructure expansion, wood extraction, biophysical factors, demographic factors and land tenure policy. Consequently, the natural resource base of the watershed is degrading. We concluded that unmanaged conversions of land covers were affecting the natural vegetation base and hydrology of the watershed. Hence, it was suggested that integrated lake watershed planning and management has a paramount importance in maintaining economic and ecological benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagroforestry 3afinancial economics 3afocus groups 3aforests 3ahousehold surveys 3ahydrology 3ainfrastructure 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3aland cover 3aland tenure 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3ashrublands 3awatersheds 3awood 3awoodlands 3aEthiopia 0aWatershed 0aAgroforestry 0aPerception 0aDrivers1 aH̲āylu Warqu,1 aGizaw, Shumete1 aLegesse, Abiyot0 tRemote sensing applications.g2019 Apr., v. 14 p.178-190dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2019.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245013100161300001300292520130400305592002801609650001201637650001401649650001201663650002301675650001101698650001801709650001801727650001101745653003401756653002101790653003101811653002101842700001801863700001801881700001801899700001701917700001601934773012301950856008302073852000902156655001202165IND60597094820221121001934.0200318e20180915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059709482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2018.04.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Bin12aA surfactant-free microemulsion consisting of water, ethanol, and dichloromethane and its template effect for silica synthesis  ap. 9-17.  aA new type of surfactant-free microemulsion (SFME) containing water/ethanol/dichloromethane was constructed, and three microregions water-in-dichloromethane (W/O), bicontinuous (B.C.) and dichloromethane-in-water (O/W) regions were identified. The polarity environment of the SFME was investigated. Solid silica nanoparticle (SSN) was selected as a model nanomaterial to investigate the feasibility of the water/ethanol/dichloromethane SFME for the preparation of nanomaterials. In the O/W SFME region of the microemulsions, uniform spherical solid silica nanoparticles (SSNs) were synthesized. Under the same experimental conditions, they are of smaller particle size and have narrower range of diameter distribution, than the SSNs synthesized from ethanol and water mixture. The effects of tetraethylorthosilicate concentration (CTEOS), ammonia hydroxide concentration (CNH3∙H2O) and dichloromethane content on the size and morphology of the SSNs were investigated. The average diameters of the SSNs increased with increasing CTEOS andCNH3∙H2O. However, the effect of increasing CNH3∙H2O on the particle size is more significant. The time evolution of the morphology and diameter of the SSNs were also investigated to elucidate the growth mechanism for the SSNs synthesized in the O/W SFMEs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aemulsions 3aethanol 3amethylene chloride 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3asilica 0aSurfactant-free microemulsion 0aMicroenvironment 0aSolid silica nanoparticles 0aGrowth mechanism1 aChai, Jinling1 aChai, Ziqiang1 aZhang, Xiaoyu1 aCui, Xiaocui1 aLu, Jianjun0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 526 p.9-17dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2018.04.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245016600167520143700333592002801770650001701798650001701815650002901832650000901861650001501870650003501885650000901920650001701929700002001946700001901966700002701985700003602012700002602048700001702074773011802091856007602209852000902285655001202294IND60748592320221121042817.0210827e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074859232DNAL7 a10.3390/land100808082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSponagel, Christian 10aExpert-Based Maps as a Regional Planning Tool Supporting Nature Conservation and Production-Integrated Compensation—A German Case Study on Biodiversity Offsets  aMany countries worldwide have developed guidelines for offsetting impacts on nature and landscape. Suitable locations are the prerequisite for the implementation of these measures, and this might lead to conflicts with agriculture. In addition, comprehensive planning is often lacking and potential added values for nature conservation are not exploited. Concepts such as the so-called production-integrated compensation (PIC) have been introduced to give farmers the opportunity to actively participate in the offsetting process and improve cooperation. However, up to now, PIC has only rarely been put into practice. Against this backdrop, we have developed a regional planning tool for the implementation of PIC in practice. Based on geodata such as soil data, agricultural structure, or natural conditions at the field and landscape level, the general suitability, and specific measure-based recommendations for each plot can be verified with the help of a decision support system. These factors are assessed from both a nature and an agricultural perspective. The goal here is to highlight synergy effects and increase the likelihood of the proposed measures being implemented. Our tool facilitates the integrated planning of biodiversity offsets at regional level. In this way, it can promote the bundling and networking of measures. However, on-site analyses should be undertaken to complement the implementation of measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3adecision support systems 3aland 3alandscapes 3anatural resources conservation 3asoil 3aspatial data1 aRaichle, Andre 1 aMaier, Martin 1 aZhuber-Okrog, Susanne 1 aGreifenhagen-Kauffmann, Ulrike 1 aAngenendt, Elisabeth 1 aBahrs, Enno 0 tLand.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100808083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245009200165300001400257520136200271592002801633650002001661650002201681650001001703650002301713650002201736650001301758650001301771650001201784653001301796653002701809653002201836653001801858653002001876700001501896700001401911773010201925856008502027852000902112655001202121IND60486040520221120024109.0160218e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048604052DNAL7 a10.1080/11250003.2016.11391952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerec, M.10aEffect of an alien turtle predator on movement activity of European brown frog tadpoles  ap. 68-76.  aAn increasing amount of attention has been devoted to studying the impact of non-native plant and animal species on native species. In this paper, we examined the antipredator response of naïve European brown frog (Rana temporaria Linnaeus, 1758) tadpoles to water-borne chemical cues from invasive red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans Wied, 1838) in the presence and the absence of conspecific tadpoles. The level of swimming activity was expressed as the length of the tadpoles’ trajectory. The tadpoles showed a decrease in swimming activity when predator stimuli were present, which was highly significant when the tadpoles were measured individually and did not have contact (visual and chemical) with other tadpoles. In the absence of chemical cues of slider turtles, the presence of other tadpoles had no effect on the level of swimming activity. Moreover, for the first time in tadpoles, we found that the decrease in swimming activity was also accompanied by changes in swimming trajectory, with tadpoles exposed to predator cues swimming in more zigzagged trajectories. Our experiment shows that invasive slider turtles, as a novel predator, have a measurable influence on the swimming behaviour of European brown frog tadpoles. Consequences of the reduced swimming activity of tadpoles, like its impact on growth, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRana temporaria 3aTrachemys scripta 3afrogs 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aswimming 3atadpoles 3aturtles 0aTadpoles 0aantipredator behaviour 0aswimming activity 0achemical cues 0aalien predators1 aKlapka, V.1 aZemek, R.0 tItalian journal of zoology.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 83, no. 1 p.68-76dTaylor & Francisx1748-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250003.2016.11391953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100003500142245013700177500001900314520066800333592002801001650001601029650001701045650001301062650001301075650001201088650001301100651001101113651001301124653001701137653001201154653000901166653001301175653001201188653001601200700002401216700001901240773011401259856007701373852000901450655001201459IND60728560020221120024959.0210308e20160901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072856002DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.4.e102742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, Paulo Alexandre Vieira10aSpecies conservation profile of the cave spider Turinyphia cavernicola (Araneae, Linyphiidae) from Terceira Island, Azores, Portugal  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTurinyphia cavernicola Wunderlich, 2008 is one of the two endemic cavernicolous spiders known from the Azorean archipelago (Portugal).

The markers were tested on 61 Crested Serpent Eagle individuals. The number alleles ranged from 2 to 8 per locus (average = 3.8), and the effective number of alleles ranged from 1.13 to 6.07 (average = 2.34). In the new marker set, there were 11 markers with high polymorphism (PIC > 0.5), and the average HE and HO over all loci was 0.50 and 0.49, respectively. The results showed that the new marker set was highly polymorphic as an individual genetic marker compared to the existing cross-species markers previously used for population genetic structure monitoring of the Taiwan Crested Serpent Eagle. In conclusion, the microsatellite marker set developed can be applied as a molecular tool to investigate the genetic structure or phylogeny of the Crested Serpent Eagle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHoya 3aalleles 3agenetic markers 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonitoring 3aphylogeny 3aTaiwan1 aDing, Shih-Torng1 aChang, Yi-Ying1 aChao, Ming-Chieh1 aTsao, Hsien-Shao1 aChan, Fang-Tse1 aHsu, Chi-Chen1 aYuan, Hsiao-Wei1 aWang, Pei-Hwa0 tConservation genetics resources.g2013 June, v. 5, no. 2 p.417-420dSpringer-Verlagx1877-72527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12686-012-9817-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245014300164520121100307592002801518650001601546650001701562650001001579650001101589650002501600650001501625650001501640650001301655650000901668650001601677650001901693650000901712650002101721650002301742650001101765650001701776650001501793650001001808650001801818651001401836700002301850700002101873700001601894773011801910856007602028852000902104655001202113IND60748592420221121020640.0210827e20210801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074859242DNAL7 a10.3390/land100808092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartigan, Martin 10aDeveloping a Metropolitan-Wide Urban Forest Strategy for a Large, Expanding and Densifying Capital City: Lessons from Melbourne, Australia  aUrban forests provide many ecosystem services, such as reducing heat, improving air quality, treatment of stormwater, carbon sequestration, as well as biodiversity benefits. These benefits have resulted in increasing demand for urban forests and strategies to maintain and enhance this natural infrastructure. In response to a broader resilience strategy for Melbourne, Australia, we outline how a metropolitan-wide urban forest strategy (Living Melbourne) was developed, encompassing multiple jurisdictions and all land tenures. To this end, we mapped tree cover within the Melbourne metropolitan area, modelled potential habitat for some bird species, and investigated the role of tree cover for urban heat island mitigation. We outline the consultation and governance frameworks used to develop the strategy, the vision, goals and actions recommended, including canopy and shrub cover targets for different parts of the metropolitan area. The metropolitan-wide urban forest strategy acts as an overarching framework to guide local government authorities and various stakeholders towards a shared objective of increasing tree cover in Melbourne and we discuss the outcomes and lessons from this approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3abiodiversity 3abirds 3acanopy 3acarbon sequestration 3aecosystems 3agovernance 3ahabitats 3aheat 3aheat island 3ainfrastructure 3aland 3alocal government 3ametropolitan areas 3ashrubs 3astakeholders 3astormwater 3atrees 3aurban forests 3aAustralia1 aFitzsimons, James 1 aGrenfell, Maree 1 aKent, Toby 0 tLand.g2021 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100808093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04288naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245014900166300001600315520274900331592002803080596005203108650001803160650002503178650001803203650001803221650001803239650002103257650002403278650001203302650001803314650002103332650001203353650003003365650002603395650003003421650002203451650001703473700001603490700002003506700001403526700001703540700001503557773014203572856008303714852000903797655001203806IND60736227220221119132729.0210731e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073622722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-020-02320-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Yanhua10aCharacterization on gut microbiome of PCOS rats and its further design by shifts in high-fat diet and dihydrotestosterone induction in PCOS rats  ap. 953-964.  aPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with gut microbiota disturbance. Emerging evidence has shown that gut microbiota plays a major role in the development of PCOS. To better understand how the gut microbiota contributes to the development of PCOS, we investigated the influences of high-fat diet and hyperandrogenism, independently or synergistically, have on the gut microbiota in rats. Furthermore, we explored the associations between gut microbiota and hyperandrogenism or other hallmarks of PCOS. Twenty female SD rats were randomized at aged 3 weeks into 4 groups (n = 5, each); HA: PCOS rats fed with ordinary diet; HF: rats with high-fat diet (HFD); HA-HF: PCOS rats fed with HFD; and C: control rats with ordinary diet. PCOS rat model was induced by 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) injection for 6 weeks. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), plasma insulin, testosterone, free testosterone, TNF-α, MDA, SOD, LPS, TLR4, TG, TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels were measured. The molecular ecology of the fecal gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that rats in the HA and HA-HF group displayed abnormal estrous cycles with increasing androgen level and exhibited multiple large cysts with diminished granulosa layers in ovarian tissues. Compare with the C group, relative abundance of the Bacteroidetes phylum decreased significantly in the other groups (P < 0.05). The Chao1 was the highest in the group C and significantly higher than the HA-HF group (P < 0.05). T, FT, insulin, MDA, LPS, and TNF-α levels had the negative correlation with the richness of community (Chao1 index) in the gut. The rats in the HF and HA-HF groups tended to have lower Shannon and Simpson indices than the C group (P < 0.01, respectively). However, there were no significant differences between C group and the HA group in the Shannon and Simpson values. Beta diversity analysis was then performed based on a weighted UniFrac analysis. The PCoA plots showed a clear separation of the C group from the other groups. ANOSIM analysis of variance confirmed that there were statistically significant separations between the C group and the HA, HA-HF, and HF groups (P < 0.01, respectively). These results showed that DHT with HFD could lower diversity of the gut microbial community. Both HFD and DHT could shift the overall gut microbial composition and change the composition of the microbial community in gut. Furthermore, our analyses demonstrated that the levels of TG, MDA, TNF-α, LPS, TLR4, T, FT, FINS, and HDL-C were correlated with the changes of in the gut microbiome. HFD and DHT were associated with the development and pathology of PCOS by shaping gut microbial communities.  aPublisher supplied data  a81704107cNatural Science Foundation of Chinese 3aBacteroidetes 3aanalysis of variance 3aanimal models 3abioprocessing 3ablood glucose 3adigestive system 3adihydrotestosterone 3afemales 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperandrogenism 3ainsulin 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amicrobial communities 3apolycystic ovary syndrome 3aspecies diversity 3atestosterone1 aYu, Jingwei1 aLiang, Chengjie1 aLi, Shuna1 aWen, Xiaohui1 aLi, Yanmei0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2021 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.953-964dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-020-02320-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245013100175500002200306520133000328592002801658650002301686650002401709650003201733650001601765650002201781650001501803650001101818650002401829650001201853650001101865650001901876650001201895651001401907653004001921653001401961653003801975653002202013653001902035653002002054700001502074773005802089856008302147852000902230655001202239IND60584172020221121223024.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058417202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoi, Tian Sheng Allan10aAnalysing Households’ Responsiveness towards Socio-economic Determinants of Residential Electricity Consumption in Singapore  aPre-press version  aThe research of household electricity use is still relatively new for Singapore, where apart from some government surveys and sparingly available papers, not much has been done to understand the underlying socio-economic determinants that affect residents’ energy demand. Here, we seek to quantify price and income elasticities, as well as provide reasonable justification for price asymmetry in Singapore using a panel approach across dwelling types and geographical areas. We find that households do not react much to prices, and that price elasticities may decrease as income rises. There is also some evidence of price asymmetry, with surprising results putting responsiveness towards price decreases larger than price increases. This points towards similar behavioural patterns with the rebound effect for household energy efficiency, if found present in future studies. Our findings suggest that there will only be positive responses towards dynamic pricing and higher churn rates if more transparent information is provided on related cost savings, when households are exposed to retail choice in the electricity market after full retail competition is introduced in 2018. In addition, a large role will have to come from cultivating the young to engage in sustainable practices to achieve energy efficiency targets.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3ademand elasticities 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aenergy efficiency 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aincome elasticities 3amarkets 3aprices 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys 3aSingapore 0aResidential electricity consumption 0aSingapore 0aElectricity Market liberalization 0aEnergy efficiency 0aPanel Analysis 0aPrice Asymmetry1 aNg, Jia Le0 tEnergy Policy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.09.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01887naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245007800213300001600291520067500307592002800982650001901010650001201029650001301041650001701054650001501071650001101086650001001097650001201107650003101119650001301150650000901163651001601172653001901188653001101207653001201218653002101230653001201251773010601263856008701369852000901456655001201465IND60536216220221116141557.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053621622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcda, Menandro N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0353-117910aFuel pellets from downed coconut (Cocos nucifera) in super typhoon Haiyan  ap. 539-542.  aThe study investigated the physical and chemical properties of fuel pellets from downed coconut (Cocos nucifera L) in super typhoon Haiyan that struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013.

Mountains exhibit varying ecological conditions along their elevation gradient that may impose divergent selection on elevationally widespread species, causing intraspecific plumage divergence. For example, UV light environments often vary between montane and lowland habitats, which could potentially cause differences in plumage UV reflection between birds occurring in the two types of habitats. However, few studies have examined the effects of elevation on plumage evolution. In this study, we quantified the plumage coloration of the Rufous‐capped Babbler Cyanoderma ruficeps from montane and lowland habitats on a mountainous island, Taiwan. We aimed to examine whether their plumage showed differences associated with changing ecological environments across the elevational gradient. The results supported that the plumage of babblers occupying montane habitats had higher UV‐reflectance and brightness than that of lowland birds, corresponding to the higher UV intensity in montane than lowland background light environments. The elevational differences were mainly found across the ventral parts of babblers that had relatively higher levels of UV reflectance compared with their dorsal parts. Alternatively, the brighter plumage, with higher UV‐reflectance in montane than lowland birds, might be mediated by physiological adaptation to other ecological factors, such as parasite pressures. The elevational differences in plumage UV‐reflectance and brightness were more dramatic in males than in females. However, we found significant sexual dichromatism in different body parts between montane and lowland babblers in which females had brighter or stronger UV‐associated coloration than males, suggesting that sexual selection has little impact on babbler plumage. Our study suggests the importance of elevational divergent selection associated with UV light or other ecological environments on avian plumage evolution.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOST 106‐2311‐B‐001‐036‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology 3aCyanoderma 3aaltitude 3abirds 3acolor 3amountains 3aparasites 3aplumage 3areflectance 3asexual selection 3aultraviolet radiation 3aTaiwan1 aYao, Cheng‐Te1 aHsu, Yu‐Cheng1 aHung, Chih‐Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4785-63700 tIbis.g2022 Jan., v. 164, no. 1 p.151-167dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.130093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245017900179300001600358520116600374592002801540650002501568650001801593650001901611650001501630650000901645650000901654650002601663650002901689700002501718700002701743773009601770856008401866852000901950655001201959IND60113124720221120144406.0141111e20131025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011312472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Villalba, Anna10aUltra-high performance liquid chromatography–atmospheric pressure chemical ionization–tandem mass spectrometry for the analysis of benzimidazole compounds in milk samples  ap. 119-131.  aIn this work the atmospheric pressure ionization behavior and the tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation of 19 benzimidazoles was studied. Several atmospheric pressure ionization (API) sources (ESI, APCI and APPI) were evaluated showing that APCI was the best option, mainly for KETO-TCB that provided a 20 times improvement versus ESI. From the studies of tandem mass spectrometry, fragmentation pathways were proposed thus characterizing the most abundant and interesting product ions and selecting the most abundant and selective ones for the confirmatory quantitative method performed in SRM mode in a triple quadrupole mass analyzer. For quantitative analysis, the 19 benzimidazoles were separated in less than 7min using a C₁₈ column packed with superficially porous particles providing high efficiency within the range of UHPLC.

The major open questions and suggestions for future research priorities are outlined to narrow the gap between the present understanding of the contribution of both anthropogenic and biogenic aerosols to radiative forcing resulting from the spatial non-uniformity, intermittency of sources, unresolved composition and reactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aatmospheric sciences 3achemical composition 3aphysical properties 0aAerosols 0aHistorical aspects 0aChemical composition 0aSources 0aResearch perspectives1 aAlves, C.1 aCastro, A.1 aPont, V.1 aVicente, A.M.1 aFraile, R.0 tAtmospheric research.g2013 Feb., v. 120-121 p.1-28dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.09.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016800167300001600335520173800351592002802089650001802117650002202135650001102157650001202168650001602180650001802196650002102214650002602235650001102261650001302272650001802285650001402303650001502317650001802332650001302350650001102363650001102374650001102385650001602396650001402412650001102426651001602437700002602453700002702479700002102506773009102527856008102618852000902699655001202708IND60080817220221120132313.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008081722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-014-9489-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahmoudi, Nemat10aEnvironmental variables and their interaction effects on chlorophyll-a in coastal waters of the southern Caspian Sea: assessment by multiple regression grey models  ap. 351-365.  aMain and interaction effects of environmental parameters on variations of chlorophyll-a along the coast of the southern Caspian Sea were determined. Parameters such as temperature, conductivity, turbidity salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, chlorophyll-a and nutrients were evaluated monthly in four transects and different depths (0, 5, 10, 20, 35 and 50 m), using multiple regression and grey relational analysis. Additionally, the long-term data (1994–2009) on the seasonal phytoplanktonic variation were included in our discussion. There was a good agreement between the observed and predicted values in the models that included the interaction effects during spring, summer, autumn and winter, with the adjusted R²of 0.64, 0.63, 0.60 and 0.54, respectively. Temperature and its interactions were found to be the most important factor on chlorophyll-a throughout the year. Overall, the most effective factors were seasonally categorized as: organic phosphorus, ammonium and their interactions (spring); organic phosphorus, nitrate, DO, silica and their interactions (summer); organic phosphorus, pH, DO and their interactions (autumn); pH, ammonium, DO and their interactions (winter). Thermocline, riverine transport, nitrification and the presence of Mnemiopsis leidyi and Cyanophyta were found to be the most important phenomena affecting the dynamics of nutrients and phytoplanktonic biomass in the area. In the distribution of chlorophyll-a, the interaction effects of different environmental parameters proved to be more important than their individual effects. The multiple regression and grey analyses were also found to be useful tools to understand the interactions between phytoplankton and environmental factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aMnemiopsis leidyi 3aautumn 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3acoastal water 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3amodels 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3asalinity 3asilica 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3aturbidity 3awinter 3aCaspian Sea1 aAhmadi, Mohammad Reza1 aBabanezhad, Manoochehr1 aSeyfabadi, Jafar0 tAquatic ecology.g2014 Sept., v. 48, no. 3 p.351-365dSpringer-Verlagx1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-014-9489-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011700168300001600285520183400301592002802135650002302163650001802186650001302204650002102217650001902238650001902257650001702276650001302293650001602306650001902322650001402341650001102355650001102366650002002377650001202397650001802409650001002427650001502437650001002452700001502462700001902477700002002496700001902516700002402535773011002559852000902669856008102678945002502759946001302784655001202797IND60438781020221120120529.0151023e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-002-1001-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shaoliang 10aOsmotic Stress and Ion-Specific Effects on Xylem Abscisic Acid and the Relevance to Salinity Tolerance in Poplar  ap. 224-233.  aWe designed two experiments to investigate the osmotic stress and ion-specific effects on xylem abscisic acid (ABA) and the relevance to salinity tolerance in one-year-old seedlings of Populus euphratica Oliv. (a salt-resistant genotype) and one-year-old rooted cuttings of P. 'popularis 35-44' (P. popularis) (a salt-sensitive genotype). Net photosynthetic rates (Pn) and unit transpiration rates (TRN) of the two genotypes were significantly decreased upon osmotic shock caused by PEG 6000 (osmotic potential = -0.24 MPa) or iso-NaCl (50 mM). Shoot xylem ABA concentrations in both genotypes increased rapidly after the onset of PEG stress, resulting from a decreased water flow. NaCl-treated trees of P. euphratica maintained considerably greater concentrations of ABA than PEG-treated plants in a longer term, whereas salinized P. popularis exhibited a transient accumulation of ABA in the shoot. TRN was greatly enhanced in both genotypes when pressure (0.24 MPa) was applied to counteract the osmotic suction of 50 mM NaCl. Pressurizing of root systems diluted solutes in the root xylem, but the dilution effect was more pronounced in P. popularis. Root xylem ABA concentrations in P. euphratica steadily increased with salt stress although pressurization lowered its levels. In contrast, there were no observed changes in ABA response to salinity in pressured P. popularis. Therefore, we concluded that the salt-tolerant P. euphratica had a greater capacity to synthesize ABA under saline conditions, which may partially result from specific salt effects. In addition, P. euphratica exhibited a higher capacity for salt (Na+ and Cl-) transport control under salt stress, compared with P. popularis. The possible association between ABA and salt transport limitation, and the relevance to salinity tolerance were discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus euphratica 3aabscisic acid 3agenotype 3aosmotic pressure 3aosmotic stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aroot systems 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3atranspiration 3atrees 3awater flow 3axylem1 aLi, Jinke 1 aWang, Tianhua 1 aWang, Shasheng 1 aPolle, Andrea 1 aHüttermann, Aloys,0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2002 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.224-233dSpringer-Verlagx0721-75957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-002-1001-43Available from publisher's site  aINDdMKSe2004/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle02644naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245011000208520155000318592002801868653001601896653002101912653004101933653002201974653001201996653001002008700001702018700001602035700002702051700005602078773008802134856008702222852000902309655001202318IND60656129920221119071510.0190809e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065612992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1136962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Qinghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3622-330510aLow-energy-consumption and environmentally friendly CO2 capture via blending alcohols into amine solution  aThe conventional regeneration processes for aqueous amine-based sorbents require high regeneration temperature and are very energy intensive. In this work, a low-temperature and energy-saving CO2 capture technology has been successfully developed by using alcohols-amines-water mixtures as sorbents. The addition of certain amounts of alcohols [especially ethanol (EtOH)] to amines can significantly increase the CO2 desorption rates and cyclic CO2 capture capacities in comparison with those of monoethanolamine-water, diethanolamine-water, and methyldiethanolamine-water systems. The sorbent containing 40 wt% EtOH, 20 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA), and 20 wt% H2O can increase cyclic CO2 capture capacity by 6.8 times and a maximum improvement of 236 times in CO2 desorption rate at 75 °C, which makes the use of the low-temperature waste heat in power plants for CO2 capture or self-supported CO2 capture in power plants possible. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations have been used to confirm that ethanol in EtOH-MEA-H2O can change the reaction pathway by forming C2H5OCO2− instead of HCO3−, which is difficult to decompose. In addition, the experimental results confirm that the new technology can significantly avoid amine degradation – a common challenge of the state-of-the-art CO2 capture technologies. Therefore, the new CO2 capture technology is promising from the perspectives of energy saving and environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCO2 capture 0aMonoethanolamine 0aLow-temperature sorbent regeneration 0aAmine degradation 0aEthanol 0aAmine1 aKong, Lingli1 aGong, Weibo1 aRussell, Armistead G.,1 aFan, Maohong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5929-40720 tApplied energy.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 254dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1136963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245008800176300001600264520110300280592002801383650002401411650002001435650002401455650001801479650001901497650002401516650000901540650002001549650001101569650002301580650001901603650002201622650001001644650001501654650001301669650001601682650001901698650001101717650002001728650002501748650001301773650002001786700002001806700001801826700002601844700001901870773011001889852000901999856008102008945002502089946001302114655001202127IND60438781120221120120356.0151023e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-002-0013-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Cadenas, Aurelio 10aAbscisic Acid Reduces Leaf Abscission and Increases Salt Tolerance in Citrus Plants  ap. 234-240.  aThis paper describes the physiological effects of abscisic acid (ABA) and 100 mM NaCl on citrus plants. Water potential, leaf abscission, ethylene production, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and chloride accumulation in roots and leaves were measured in plants of Salustiana scion [Citrus sinensis (L) Osbeck] grafted onto Carrizo citrange (Citrus sinensis [L.] Osbeck × Poncirus trifoliata [L.] Raf) rootstock. Plants under salt stress accumulated high amounts of chloride, increased ethylene production, and induced leaf abscission. Stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rates rapidly dropped after salinization. The addition of 10 mM ABA to the nutrient solution 10 days before the exposure to salt stress reduced ethylene release and leaf abscission. These effects were probably due to a decrease in the accumulation of toxic Cl- ions in leaves. In non-salinized plants, ABA reduced stomatal conductance and CO2 assimilation, whereas in salinized plants the treatment slightly increased these two parameters. The results suggest a protective role for ABA in citrus under salinity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitroncirus webberi 3aCitrus sinensis 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3aabscisic acid 3acarbon dioxide 3aethylene production 3aions 3aleaf abscission 3aleaves 3anutrient solutions 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotective effect 3aroots 3arootstocks 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3ascions 3asodium chloride 3astomatal conductance 3atoxicity 3awater potential1 aArbona, Vicent 1 aJacas, Josep 1 aPrimo-Millo, Eduardo 1 aTalon, Manuel 0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2002 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.234-240dSpringer-Verlagx0721-75957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-002-0013-43Available from publisher's site  aINDdMKSe2004/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle03327naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245014300162300001800305500002000323520138400343592002801727596008201755596005901837596006501896596007701961650002502038650001402063650002002077650002102097650002402118650001402142650002102156650001802177650001402195650001802209650001502227650001002242650001302252650001702265650002502282700002002307700001502327700001902342700005502361700005502416700001402471700001502485700005902500773012502559856008002684852000902764655001202773IND60769149020221117173820.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076914902DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.160152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qi‐rui10aWhole mulberry leaves as a promising functional food: From the alteration of phenolic compounds during spray drying and in vitro digestion  ap. 1230-1243.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis study investigated the potential of processing whole mulberry leaves as nutraceutical foods rich in phenolic compounds by spray drying with different drying aids. The results indicated that the spray‐dried product 6 (24.2% whey protein isolate [WPI], 33.3% mulberry leaves solid, 38.7% maltodextrin, 3.8% soybean lecithin) with high WPI/mulberry leaves solid ratio possessed the best physical properties, the highest total phenolic compounds level and antioxidant capacity among all the products. Specifically, free chlorogenic acid and rutin were increased by two to three times, but free isoquercitrin and astragalin lost more than 50% in product 6 compared with fresh mulberry leaves. For in vitro digestion, rutin, isoquercitrin, and astragalin (the antioxidative phenolic compounds in mulberry leaves) showed higher bioaccessibility than chlorogenic acid (p < 0.05) in product 6. Meanwhile, the phenolic compounds bioaccessibility of product 6 was 10–20 times higher than that of fresh whole mulberry leaves. Considering the increased level and bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds, whole mulberry leaves could be developed as potential functional foods by spray drying under the protection of WPI. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The spray‐dried whole mulberry leaves can be consumed as a beverage, meal replacement powder, or used as additive during food processing.  aPublisher supplied data  aPY2018cFoundation of Young Teachers of Medical School of Nanchang University  a81860578cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aGrant 31671853cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20181BAB215034cNatural Science Foundation for Youth of Jiangxi Province 3aantioxidant activity 3abeverages 3abioavailability 3achlorogenic acid 3adietary supplements 3adigestion 3afunctional foods 3aisoquercitrin 3alecithins 3amaltodextrins 3amulberries 3arutin 3asoybeans 3aspray drying 3awhey protein isolate1 aLai, Peng‐wei1 aChen, Fang1 aYu, Yan‐fang1 aZhang, Bing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6040-52431 aLi, Hongyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1153-75541 aLiu, Rong1 aFan, Yawei1 aDeng, Ze‐yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5650-15070 tJournal of food science.g2022 Mar., v. 87, no. 3 p.1230-1243dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.160153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04515naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245012800208300001600336520231500352592002802667650002302695650001502718650001402733650001802747650002502765650001702790650001702807650001102824650002602835650001002861650001402871650000902885650001102894650001802905650001502923650001402938650000902952650001002961650001702971650002502988650001303013650001503026650001003041650001903051650002103070650001303091650001903104650001303123650002103136650001203157650001203169650001003181650001503191650001203206653002103218653002003239653001303259653002303272653002303295653002703318700006103345700002003406700006103426700001903487700002003506773013903526856008303665852000903748655001203757IND60720946120221116143224.0210608e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072094612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2020.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurav, Nilambari1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6369-996110aDevelopment and evaluation of aphrodisiac potential of a classical ayurvedic formulation, ‘Kaamdev ghrita’ in rat model  ap. 294-301.  aGhee is widely considered as the Indian name for clarified butterfat and processing of ghee with therapeutic herbs i.e. ghrita is renowned for augmenting their medicinal properties. Kaamdev ghrita (also known as ‘VajikaranaRasayana’) is cow ghee based classical Ayurvedic formulation from the aphrodisiac category, which is used to ameliorate and potentiate sexual performance and also in the treatment of sexual dysfunctions, infertility, and premature ejaculation.Present research work deals with the organoleptic, physicochemical, and biological assessment of Kaamdev ghrita for its aphrodisiac activity using in-vivo animal models.Kaamdev ghrita was prepared using Indian cow’s ghee as per standard Ayurvedic classical texts and subjected to organoleptic (color, odor, taste, texture, touch), physicochemical (acid value, peroxide value, iodine value, saponification value, unsaponifiable matter, extractive values, refractive index, and specific gravity) analyses as per the standard pharmacopeial procedures. The aphrodisiac potential of ghrita in rat model was evaluated by monitoring sexual behavioral performance using different parameters (mount frequency and latency, intromission frequency and latency, anogenital grooming and sniffing) at the dose of 150 and 300 mg/kg body weight.The physicochemical evaluation of Kaamdev ghrita showed higher acid value, iodine value, refractive index, and specific gravity whereas the lower saponification and peroxide value than the plain ghee. Kaamdev ghrita revealed the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, sterols, terpenoids, coumarins, tannins, and showed remarkable antioxidant activity by in-vitro assays. It augmented the sexual performance in a dose-dependent manner as indicated by significant improvement (P < 0.05) in mount frequency and latency, intromission frequency and latency, anogenital grooming, and sniffing as compared to plain ghee treated control group. The present investigation has corroborated the ethnopharmacological claim of Kaamdevghrita for its aphrodisiac potential.Kaamdev ghrita exhibited aphrodisiac activity which may be attributed to the presence of antioxidant herbs present in it. It is the first scientific report on validation of the traditional claim of Kaamdev ghrita for its aphrodisiac potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aacid value 3aalkaloids 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aaphrodisiacs 3aassays 3abiological assessment 3acolor 3acoumarins 3acows 3adosage 3adose response 3aflavonoids 3afrequency 3aghee 3aherbs 3aiodine value 3amedicinal properties 3amilk fat 3amonitoring 3aodors 3aperoxide value 3arefractive index 3aresearch 3asaponification 3asaponins 3aspecific gravity 3asterols 3atannins 3ataste 3aterpenoids 3atexture 0aAyurvedic ghrita 0aIndian cow ghee 0aAyurveda 0aSexual performance 0aVajikaranaRasayana 0aPolyherbal formulation1 aGurav, Shailendra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5564-21211 aWanjari, Manish1 aPrasad, Satyendra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4762-97331 aWayal, Sandesh1 aRarokar, Nilesh0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2021 Apr.,  June, v. 12, no. 2 p.294-301dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2020.09.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03678naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245012200203300001400325500002000339520240600359592002802765596006502793650001202858650001502870650001402885650001102899650002002910650002302930650002002953650001402973650001102987651001402998651001003012651001203022700005803034773010503092856007403197852000903271655001203280IND60759489120221119213043.0211212e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075948912DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.129852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGorleri, Fabricio C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7992-783110aMisidentifications in citizen science bias the phenological estimates of two hard‐to‐identify Elaenia flycatchers  ap. 13-26.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCitizen science initiatives contain a large volume of observations that can be useful to address ecological questions for a wide array of organisms. However, one limitation of citizen science data is the potential for species misidentification. Although recent studies have shown that citizen science data are relatively accurate for many taxa, the effect of misidentification errors in hard‐to‐identify species remains poorly explored. If misidentification events occur at large scales, ecological estimates can be compromised. Here, we show that misidentifications contained in citizen science databases biased phenological estimates in a pair of migratory and partially overlapping Neotropical flycatchers: the Chilean Elaenia Elaenia chilensis and the Small‐billed Elaenia Elaenia parvirostris. We reviewed and re‐classified 4399 photos of these species from Argentina, Chile and Uruguay. We found that overall identification accuracy was high (c. 90%) for both species when they were allopatric, but dramatically low for Small‐billed Elaenia during autumn migration (from 28.6% to 84.6%) because migrating individuals of Chilean Elaenia were systematically reported as Small‐billed. The phenological estimates for both Elaenias were biased due to the large number of misidentifications concentrated towards the autumn migration period. These errors caused a 1‐week advancement in the estimated arrival, and a 2‐week delay in the estimated departure for Small‐billed Elaenia. For Chilean Elaenia, errors caused a 1‐week delay for the estimated spring peak passage and underestimation of the magnitude of the autumn passage. Our results highlight the importance of performing critical assessments of records when using citizen science databases to describe ecological patterns in species that are hard to identify. The large volume of information provided by citizen science initiatives is useful to describe spatio‐temporal patterns in birds, particularly in those of poorly known regions. However, to further enhance the usefulness of such databases, it is imperative actively to post‐process and contrast patterns derived from documented (and undocumented) records, with a special focus on misidentifications. This will only be possible through a thorough review of the documented data, together with an intimate understanding of the natural history of the study species.  aPublisher supplied data  cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas 3aElaenia 3aNeotropics 3aallopatry 3aautumn 3acitizen science 3amigratory behavior 3anatural history 3aphenology 3aspring 3aArgentina 3aChile 3aUruguay1 aAreta, Juan I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8588-30300 tIbis.g2022 Jan., v. 164, no. 1 p.13-26dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.129853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009300171300001600264520130200280592002801582650001301610650002301623650003501646650002001681650001401701650001101715650000701726650001601733650000901749650002201758650001901780650001401799650000901813653001901822653002301841653001701864700002201881773013501903856008702038852000902125655001202134IND60591717820221118054729.0190725e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValles, Diego,10aAntiacanthain A: New proteases isolated from Bromelia antiacantha Bertol.

By single step cation exchange chromatography (Hi-trap SP-HP) of partially purified CE, the protease with the lowest pI, Antiacanthain A (AntA), was isolated. It showed maximum activity at pH9, and 75% of remaining activity was maintained over a wide pH range (pH6–10). The AntA activity exhibits a constant increase up to 70°C. Maintains almost 100% of its activity at 45 at pH6 and 9. A 60% of AntA was active by titration with specific inhibitor, E64. Amidasic activity was studied with pyroglutamyl-phenyl-leucyl-paranitroaniline (PFLNA) substrate having higher AntA catalytic efficiency of (kcat/Km=470s−1M−1) relative to stem bromelain (kcat/Km=305s−1M−1). Esterase activity using p-nitrophenyl esters of N-α-CBZ-l-Lysine (z-L-LysONp) showed a 10-fold higher catalytic efficiency for AntA (kcat/Km=6376s−1M−1) relative to stem bromelain (kcat/Km=688s−1M−1). Incubation with 8M Urea did not affect AntA activity and remained unchanged for 18h, with 6M GndHCl resulted in a 41% decrease in activity after 30min incubation, maintained this activity 18h. AntA exhibits high sequence identity with proteases of the Bromeliaceae family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBromelia 3acatalytic activity 3acation exchange chromatography 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3aesters 3apH 3aproteolysis 3apulp 3asequence analysis 3astem bromelain 3atitration 3aurea 0aPlant protease 0aCysteine peptidase 0aBromeliaceae1 aCantera, Ana M.B.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 July 01, v. 113 p.916-923dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245010200170300001600272520142800288592002801716650001101744650001501755650001701770650001701787650002401804650001901828650001801847650001101865650000701876650001801883650001701901650000901918650001401927650002001941650001301961650001601974650001401990653001402004653002902018653001302047653002302060700001302083700001302096700001402109700005402123773009202177856009002269852000902359655001202368IND60644882720221118065610.0200804e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064488272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yandan10aEffects of particle size and solution chemistry on Triclosan sorption on polystyrene microplastic  ap. 308-314.  aPS microplastic particle (<5 mm) is an emerging contaminant of concern in aquatic and sediment systems with reported negative impacts on environmental and human health. TCS is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial which can affect ecosystems and result in long-term human health risks. The interaction between TCS and PS microplastic, partly determines the behavior and dispersion of TCS in the environment. In this study, the sorption kinetics and isotherms for TCS and PS microplastic were investigated. The influences of temperature, pH, ionic strength and coexisting heavy metals were assessed in batch experiments. The pseudo-second-order model (PSOM) was found to effectively describe the sorption kinetics of TCS on PS. TCS sorption on PS was found to be higher within the pH range of 3.0–6.0, while a decrease occurred at pH > 6.0. This result indicates that TCS⁰ was the major species contributing to the sorption process through hydrophobic interaction. Temperature did not affect the sorption of TCS on polystyrene, with sorption Kd values of 0.15, 0.16, 0.18 and 0.17 L/g at 288, 298, 308 and 318 K, respectively. Furthermore, the sorption amount of TCS showed no obvious variation with NaCl concentrations varying between 0.001 and 0.1 M. Finally, the coexistence of Cu(II)/Zn(II) had no significant influence on TCS sorption on PS, as Cu(II)/Zn(II) and TCS had different mechanisms of sorption on PS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3aecosystems 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahydrophobic bonding 3aionic strength 3amicroplastics 3amodels 3apH 3aparticle size 3apolystyrenes 3arisk 3asediments 3asodium chloride 3asorption 3atemperature 3atriclosan 0aTriclosan 0aPolystyrene microplastic 0aSorption 0aSolution chemistry1 aLi, Miao1 aLi, Zhen1 aYang, Lei1 aLiu, Xiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0617-55440 tChemosphere.g2019 Sept., v. 231 p.308-314dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03834naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003100152245016700183300001600350520259400366592002802960650001102988650001602999650001103015650001903026650001503045650000903060650001603069651001003085651001703095653001303112653002903125653001403154653002903168700002803197700002503225773009103250856008603341852000903427655001203436IND60089269020221120041836.0160903e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008926902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodla, Venkata Bhaskar Rao13aAn assessment of cumulus parameterization schemes in the short range prediction of rainfall during the onset phase of the Indian Southwest Monsoon using MM5 Model  ap. 249-267.  aThe performance of cumulus parameterization schemes in the short range prediction of rainfall during onset phase of the Indian Southwest Monsoon (ISM) was evaluated using Fifth-Generation Pennsylvania State University / National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5). MM5 model was used to predict rainfall at 30km resolution up to 72h over the Indian subcontinent for each day during the period 1–30 June 2002, which corresponds to the onset phase of the ISM. Experiments were performed with 5 different cumulus parameterization schemes of Anthes–Kuo (AK), Grell (GR), Betts–Miller (BM), Kain–Fritsch (KF) and Kain–Fritsch2 (KF2). Rainfall prediction assessment was made over five zones through comparison with corresponding APHRODITE gridded precipitation data and for selected location with station observations by analyzing the statistical parameters of correlation coefficient, mean absolute error and Hanssen–Kuipers score. Monthly mean zone-wise rainfall was well predicted by GR and AK schemes up to 48hours and slight overestimation beyond. GR scheme predicted higher rainfall over west coast, central parts of India and low rainfall over southeast peninsula. BM and KF schemes showed overestimation with prediction of rainfall over dry southeast peninsula. All the schemes underestimated the coefficient of variability (CV) over all the five zones. AK and GR schemes had the mean and CV nearer to the APHRODITE observations, with AK scheme slightly better than GR scheme over Zones 1, 2 and 3 while GR scheme had the best agreement over Zones 4 and 5. GR scheme had also shown higher CC values and lower MAE over most of the zones up to 72h, while BM had the least predictability with lower CC and HK scores and higher MAE over most of the zones. Over Western Ghats, the uncertainty limits could be higher than shown due to dominant heavy rains. Of the ten stations selected for verification, GR scheme had shown better prediction with significant positive CC values at nine of the ten stations and consistently lower MAE values and higher HK scores. Further analysis has shown that GR scheme predicted higher grid-scale and nighttime rainfall agreeing with earlier studies concerning monsoon rainfall. All other schemes predicted the features contrarily with higher convective and daytime rainfall. GR scheme alone was found to have provided the best prediction considering the mean monthly, daily zone-wise and station rainfall predictions. The present study concludes that GR cumulus parameterization scheme is the most suitable at 30km resolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acorrelation 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3aprediction 3arain 3auncertainty 3aIndia 3aPennsylvania 0aRainfall 0aIndian southwest monsoon 0aMM5 model 0aCumulus parameterization1 aRatna, Satyaban Bishoyi1 aDesamsetti, Srinivas0 tAtmospheric research.g2013 Feb., v. 120-121 p.249-267dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03927naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245009100174300001400265520243600279592002802715650001202743650002802755650001702783650003002800650001102830650000902841650001902850650001602869650001302885650001302898650001502911650001102926650001602937650002702953650001802980651001402998653001803012653002103030653003203051653002803083653001803111653002003129700001703149700005903166773010203225856008503327852000903412655001203421IND60584172620221120222921.0171024e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058417262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.09.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekaluvu, Lawrence10aEvaluation of constraints to water quality improvements in the Western Lake Erie Basin  ap. 85-98.  aSevere environmental and health impacts have been experienced in the Western Lake Erie Basin (WLEB) because of eutrophication and associated proliferation of harmful algae blooms. Efforts to improve water quality within the WLEB have been on-going for several decades. However, water quality improvements in the basin have not been realized as anticipated. In this study, factors affecting water quality within the WLEB were evaluated with a view to differentiating their impacts and informing further assessments in the basin. Over the long-term (1966–2015) and basin-wide, total annual precipitation increased significantly by about 2.4 mm/year while mean monthly streamflows also increased during the same period although the increase was not significant (p = 0.36). There was, however, a significant increase in spring streamflows during this period (p = 0.003). Patterns in water quality parameters showed significant reductions in total suspended solids (TSS) (p < 0.001) and total phosphorus (TP) (p = 0.018) while soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) increased significantly (p < 0.001), and in particular from about 1995. Results of near-term (2005–2015) analysis showed a non-significant (p = 0.262) reduction in TSS concentrations of about 0.25 mg/L/year. TP concentrations did not vary substantially during the same period while a 0.11 mg/L/year increase in nitrate and a 0.001 mg/L/year increase in SRP were observed, with increases in nitrates being significant (p = 0.013). TP and SRP concentrations, however, remained high within the basin with daily values ranging between 0.03 and 1.84 mg/L and less than 0.002–0.52 mg/L, respectively. Basin-wide, both spring precipitation and spring streamflows increased significantly during the period 2005–2015 (p < 0.001). Overall, no substantial changes in land use were observed, suggesting that water quality responses might be attributable to management. Based on recent data, corn acreage in the basin and fertilizer applied to corn increased by 33% and 10% respectively. Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs) and impoundments were also important factors due to their prevalence in the basin. Based on the analysis, changes in agricultural management, increase in spring precipitation, CSOs, legacy phosphorus, and the presence of dams were thought to present constraints to water quality improvements despite conservation efforts within the basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacreage 3aagricultural management 3aalgal blooms 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3acorn 3aeutrophication 3afertilizers 3aland use 3anitrates 3aphosphorus 3aspring 3astream flow 3atotal suspended solids 3awater quality 3aLake Erie 0aWater quality 0aTotal Phosphorus 0aSoluble Reactive Phosphorus 0aWestern Lake Erie Basin 0aPrecipitation 0aLand management1 aZhang, Lefei1 aGitau, Margaret1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4931-70470 tJournal of environmental management.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 205 p.85-98dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.09.0633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02049naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011700167300001600284520094600300592002801246650001301274650001501287650002301302650001901325650002201344650001201366650001501378650001401393650001101407650002401418773010901442852000901551856008101560930003301641946001301674655001201687IND60438781420221120120601.0151023e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-007-0004-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinder, Brad M.10aRapid Kinetic Analysis of Ethylene Growth Responses in Seedlings: New Insights into Ethylene Signal Transduction  ap. 131-142.  aEthylene is a phytohormone that influences diverse processes in plants. Ethylene causes various changes in etiolated seedlings that differ between species and include reduced growth of shoots and roots, increased diameter of shoots, agravitropic growth, initiation of root hairs, and increased curvature of the apical hook. The inhibition of growth in etiolated seedlings has become widely used to screen for and identify mutants. This approach has led to an increased understanding of ethylene signaling. Most studies use end-point analysis after several days of exposure to assess the effects of ethylene. Recently, the use of time-lapse imaging has re-emerged as an experimental method to study the rapid kinetics of ethylene responses. This review outlines the historical use of ethylene growth kinetic studies and summarizes the recent use of this approach coupled with molecular biology to provide new insights into ethylene signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethylene 3aetiolation 3agrowth retardation 3aimage analysis 3amolecular biology 3amutants 3aroot hairs 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asignal transduction0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2007 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.131-142dSpringer-Verlagx0721-75957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-007-0004-63Available from publisher's site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02493naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245014500159520130000304592002801604650001501632650001001647650002001657650001501677650003801692650000901730650001201739650001301751650000701764650001401771650001601785700001701801700001601818700002001834700001801854700001601872773012001888856007802008852000902086655001202095IND60757685020221120032318.0211125e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075768502DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101126542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Tianyu 10aDevelopment of Indirect Competitive ELISA and Visualized Multicolor ELISA Based on Gold Nanorods Growth for the Determination of Zearalenone  aIn this study, a zearalenone (ZEN) hapten was designed and prepared against the mycotoxin ZEN, and the original coating ZEN-ovalbumin (ZEN-OVA) was prepared by conjugation with OVA. Based on the gold nanorods (AuNRs) of uniform size and stable properties synthesized by the seed-mediated method, the indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA) and the AuNRs growth-based multicolor ELISA for detecting ZEN toxin were further established. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the coating amount of ZEN-OVA: 0.025 μg/well, antibody (Ab) dilution factor: 32,000 times, blocking solution: 0.5% skimmed milk powder, enzyme-labeled secondary Ab diluted 10,000 times, and a pH of the PBS buffer at 7.4, the sensitivity (IC₅₀) of the established ic-ELISA for ZEN detection reached 0.85 ± 0.04 μg/L, and the limit of detection (IC₁₅) reached 0.22 ± 0.08 μg/L. In the multicolor ELISA based on the growth of AuNRs, as the content of ZEN increased, the mixed solution exhibited a significant color change from brownish red to colorless. ZEN concentration as low as 0.1 μg/L can be detected by the naked eye (brown red to dark gray). This study provided an effective analysis strategy for the rapid screening and accurate monitoring of the ZEN contaminant in foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acolor 3adetection limit 3adried milk 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agold 3ahaptens 3ananorods 3apH 3askim milk 3azearalenone1 aLiu, Kaixin 1 aYang, Xiao 1 aYang, Jingying 1 aPan, Mingfei 1 aWang, Shuo 0 tFoods.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101126543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008200165300001600247520107100263592002801334650001601362650000801378650001901386650001101405650001701416650001301433650001701446650001801463650002401481650001601505650002001521650001101541650002901552700001701581773012701598856008101725852000901806655001201815IND60438781520221120120429.0151023e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-007-0015-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hongjiang10aMolecular Basis of the Ethylene Signaling and Response Pathway in Arabidopsis  ap. 106-117.  aThe gaseous phytohormone ethylene is a key regulator in plant growth and developmental process as well as biotic and abiotic stress response.

Notable new findings include identification of a specific regulator of the ethylene receptor ETR1, discovery of protein degradation and RNA turnover processes in modulating EIN3-dependent transcriptional regulation, demonstration of the involvement of auxin biosynthesis in ethylene-mediated inhibition of root growth, and determination of possible integration points between ethylene and other hormonal and environmental signals (gibberellin, jasmonic acid, light, and sugar) in various plant processes. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of the ethylene-signaling and ethylene-response pathway in Arabidopsis might provide a framework for understanding how other plant species sense and respond to ethylene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aRNA 3aabiotic stress 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3aethylene 3agibberellins 3ajasmonic acid 3aprotein degradation 3aroot growth 3astress response 3asugars 3atranscription (genetics)1 aGuo, Hongwei0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2007 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.106-117dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl33237x0721-75957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-007-0015-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245008100203300001800284500002000302520201500322592002802337596006302365596004002428596007102468596008102539596009802620596009802718650002802816650001002844650001702854650001802871650003202889650002102921650001202942650001702954650001302971700001502984700001502999700001803014700001403032700001503046700001203061700001703073700001603090700001403106700001503120700001603135700001703151773012503168856008003293852000903373655001203382IND60769149420221117170836.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076914942DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.160792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Jingzhuo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2523-186010aPharmacological effects and safety of Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.)

However, its main effects and underlying pharmacological mechanism have not been thoroughly characterized, and its safety has not been sufficiently investigated. The present study aimed to predict and visualize the potential targets and pathways, clarify the main pharmacological effects, and investigate the toxicological properties of AP extract (APE). First, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was performed to directly predict AP's therapeutic targets and pathways; main pharmacological effects of AP were speculated based on IPA results and confirmed by pharmacodynamics experiments. Rodent toxicity studies were then performed through administration of a single dose of 10 g/kg or daily doses of 2, 1, or 0.5 g/kg for 8 weeks to evaluate the safety of APE, and a similar repeated‐dose study was performed using dogs with doses equal to half of the above‐mentioned doses. Thus, repeated‐dose toxicity studies were performed with both rodents and nonrodents. The IPA analysis and confirmatory pharmacodynamics experiments revealed that the main pharmacological effect of APE was anti‐inflammation, which might be achieved by influencing various targets (e.g., AR, AKT, and BAX) and pathways (IL‐8). In the single‐dose toxicity test, no death or abnormal consequences were observed, and maximum tolerated dose of APE was 10 g/kg. Results from the repeated‐dose toxicity tests did not reveal any obvious toxic effects from the repeated daily intragastric administration of APE at 1 g/kg for 8 weeks. In conclusion, APE at a dose of 1 g/kg did not exert any adverse effects, and administration of APE could be beneficial for the inflammatory diseases’ treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Andrographis paniculata (Burm.f.) Nees is a plant that exerts clearing and detoxification effects and is widely used around the world, but a comprehensive analysis of its efficacy and safety is needed.  aPublisher supplied data  a82174073cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  aCI2021A04801cCACMS Innovation Fund  aGH201919cthe China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Foundation  aZZ‐13‐035‐10cthe China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences Foundation  aZXKT 19014cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central public welfare research institutes  aZXKT 20022cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central public welfare research institutes 3aAndrographis paniculata 3adeath 3afood science 3ainterleukin-8 3aintragastric administration 3apharmacodynamics 3arodents 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aLi, Flora,1 aMeng, Jing1 aWang, Lianmei1 aTong, Yan1 aZhao, Yong1 aYi, Yan1 aZhang, Yushi1 aXian, Zhong1 aPan, Chen1 aLiu, Suyan1 aHan, Jiayin1 aLiang, Aihua0 tJournal of food science.g2022 Mar., v. 87, no. 3 p.1319-1330dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.160793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02992naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245007100173300001600244520174800260592002802008650001402036650001302050650002402063650001502087650001202102650001802114650001902132650001202151650002302163650002602186650002602212650001402238650002202252650003102274700002002305773010902325852000902434856008102443930003302524946001302557655001202570IND60438781620221120120417.0151023e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878162DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-007-0014-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Dahl, Caroline C.10aDeciphering the Role of Ethylene in Plant–Herbivore Interactions  ap. 201-209.  aMost plants emit ethylene in response to herbivory by insects from many different feeding guilds. The elicitors of these ethylene emissions are thought to be microorganisms or oral secretion-specific compounds that are transferred when the attacking insect feeds. To find the receptors for these elicitors and describe the signaling cascades that are subsequently activated will be the challenge of future research. Past experiments on the function of herbivore-induced ethylene, which were biased toward the use of chemical treatments to manipulate ethylene, identified seven ethylene-dependent defense responses. In contrast, a genetic toolbox that consists of several mutants has rarely been used and to date, mutants have helped to identify only one additional ethylene-dependent defense response. Ethylene-dependent responses include the emission of specific volatile organic compounds as indirect defense, the accumulation of phenolic compounds, and proteinase inhibitor activity. Besides being ethylene regulated, these defenses depend strongly on the wound-hormone jasmonic acid (JA). That ethylene requires the concomitant induction of JA, or other signals, appears to be decisive. Rather than being the principal elicitor of defense responses, ethylene modulates the sensitivity to a second signal and its downstream responses. Given this modulator role, and the artifacts associated with the use of chemical treatments to manipulate ethylene production and perception, future advances in the study of ethylene’s function in plant–herbivore interactions will likely come from the use of signaling mutants or transgenic plants. It will be exciting to see if adaptive phenotypic plasticity is largely an ethylene-mediated response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelicitors 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3aherbivores 3ainsects 3ajasmonic acid 3amicroorganisms 3amutants 3aphenolic compounds 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areceptors 3atransgenic plants 3avolatile organic compounds1 aBaldwin, Ian T.0 tJournal of plant growth regulation.g2007 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.201-209dSpringer-Verlagx0721-75957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-007-0014-43Available from publisher's site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03580naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005300155245018600208300001600394520172400410592002802134650002702162650001902189650002102208650001202229650001202241650001602253650002002269650001602289650001702305650002202322650001302344650002102357650002602378650002102404650002102425650001702446650001902463650001402482650001502496650001902511650001702530650001202547650000902559653001202568653000902580653001202589653003002601653001902631700001502650700001502665700001602680700001902696700006002715773009202775856009002867852000902957655001202966IND60644883020221118065635.0190801e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064488302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Ran1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0025-578610aComparison of the feasibility of different washing solutions for combined soil washing and phytoremediation for the detoxification of cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) in contaminated soil  ap. 510-518.  aSoil heavy metal contamination is a serious environmental problem needed to be addressed due to the toxicities of metals to both humans and living organisms. In this study, the remediation efficiencies of washing-coupled phytoremediation on Cd and Zn contaminated soils were evaluated with multiple washing reagents (i.e., hydrochloric acid (HCl), ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), several biodegradable natural low molecular mass organic acids (LMMOAs)) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Results indicated that soil washing with different reagents (at 100 mM) effectively removed metals from contaminated soils with the rates ranged from 4.73% to 81.0% and from 12.3% to 43.5% for Cd and Zn, respectively. Metal varieties and the properties washing reagents affected the detoxification performance. As for Cd, the removal rates decreased from over 80% to less than 10% in the order of EDTA > HCl > NTA > LMMOAs. By comparison, HCl and LMMOAs had higher removal efficiencies for Zn than other chelating reagents. The leaching of metals in the acid-extractable fraction was the main contribution to the overall metal removed. Additionally, soil nutrient contents, Ca specifically, were significantly decreased after washing, and the germination and growth of ryegrass were partly inhibited. Despite that, soil biota and enzyme activities responded differently among different treatments. This research also showed LMMOAs, especially citric acid (CA), were more suitable than HCl, EDTA, and NTA as reagents for the combined soil washing and phytoremediation, regarding their comparable metal removal efficiencies and less disturbing on soil fertilities and plant growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aLolium perenne 3abiodegradability 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acitric acid 3aenzyme activity 3agermination 3aheavy metals 3ahydrochloric acid 3aleaching 3amolecular weight 3anitrilotriacetic acid 3anutrient content 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3apolluted soils 3apollution 3asoil biota 3asoil nutrients 3asoil washing 3awashing 3azinc 0aCadmium 0aZinc 0aWashing 0aEnhanced phytoremediation 0aDetoxification1 aAli, Amjad1 aWang, Ping1 aLi, Ronghua1 aTian, Xiaohong1 aZhang, Zengqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6860-93280 tChemosphere.g2019 Sept., v. 230 p.510-518dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009000176300001600266520072900282592002801011650001501039650002301054650002201077650001901099650001901118650002601137650006601163650002401229700001801253700002101271773009501292856008401387852000901471655001201480IND60113125420221120154413.0141111e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011312542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.09.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalik, Muhammad Imran10aSeparation of telechelic oligomers according to architecture by liquid chromatography  ap. 180-187.  aTelechelic oligomers based on diethylene glycol or lower polyethylene glycols and caprolactone or butene oxide can be separated according to their architecture by means of liquid chromatography under adsorption conditions for the hydrophobic block and critical or exclusion conditions for PEG.

This study features a large-scale process design and comprehensive analysis of an industrial-scale (400,000 tons dry feedstock per year) poly-generation pyrolysis process that utilizes 3rd generation biofuel feedstock, Saccharina japonica brown seaweed, and produces diesel-range hydrocarbon fuel, heat, and power. Process design relied predominately on published experimental data regarding fast pyrolysis of S. japonica in a fixed-bed reactor system, followed by dewatering and catalytic upgrading of the produced biocrude. The design featured acid wash pretreatment for the reduction of mineral content, and subsequently a Rankine power cycle utilizing biochar. The design also considered two distinct cases of on-site hydrogen production and hydrogen purchase. Based on the experimental data, a rigorous steady-state flowsheet model was constructed using Aspen Plus for each design case. The results of comprehensive techno-economic assessment, sensitivity, and Monte Carlo analyses provided insight into capital cost for the process, minimum product selling price, and selling price ranges. Finally, the process is compared with traditional crude oil extraction and processing in terms of significant reductions in CO2 emissions, hence providing strong evidence of its environmental sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aSaccharina japonica 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3acapital 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3adewatering 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afeedstocks 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3amacroalgae 3amarket prices 3amineral content 3apetroleum 3aprocess design 3apyrolysis 0aSeaweed fast pyrolysis 0a3rd generation biofuel 0aproduct selling price range 0aCO2 reduction1 aJay Liu, J.1 aLim, Hankwon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1074-02510 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 03, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245011100199300001600310500002000326520183300346592002802179650001602207650001002223650000902233773010702242856007402349852000902423655001202432IND60759489520221119214709.0211212e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075948952DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.129892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrieco, Fabrizio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9006-419510aPervasive low‐frequency vocal modulation during territorial contests in Eurasian Scops Owls (Otus scops)  ap. 282-297.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn several animal species, including birds, individuals are known to produce low‐frequency vocalizations during aggressive interactions with conspecifics. In this study, I investigated territorial interactions between male Eurasian Scops Owls Otus scops that occupied territories in a densely packed area. The single‐note hoot of the Scops Owl is generally thought to be highly repeatable; however, extensive recording of male–male interactions identified previously unrecognized variation in the structure of hoots. Male Scops Owls gave hoots at a frequency lower than usual when engaging in short‐distance contests with neighbouring males. Within‐subject analysis revealed that the caller’s average hoot frequency was positively correlated with the distance from its rival. During contests, males gradually reduced their hoot frequency as they approached one another, perhaps reflecting changes in the degree of escalation. Furthermore, there is evidence that male Scops Owls have voluntary control of their hoot frequency also on a very short time scale. Males gave deeper hoots immediately after the rival initiated countersinging, and returned to their usual frequency range at the end of the interaction. This study confirms in part the findings of other authors’ experimental work, where male owls adjusted their vocal frequency when challenged by an opponent. However, that study suggested that vocal frequency would encode information about the caller’s bodyweight. In contrast, the results of the present study cannot exclude the hypothesis that the hoot of the Scops Owl is a variable, conventional signal that reflects the willingness to escalate the conflict. The reliability of the signal could be maintained by the risk of retaliation by the opponent, usually located a few metres from the caller.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight 3amales 3arisk0 tIbis.g2022 Jan., v. 164, no. 1 p.282-297dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.129893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012600168300001600294500001900310520190400329592002802233650002302261650001602284650002502300650002502325650001302350650001602363650001202379650001902391650002302410650002002433650002102453650002402474650002002498650001702518700002302535700002502558700002602583700006602609773010902675856008202784852000902866655001202875IND60736228220221119132424.0210506e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073622822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10528-021-10030-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhoshal, Kakali10aAdiponectin Genetic Variant and Expression Coupled with Lipid Peroxidation Reveal New Signatures in Diabetic Dyslipidemia  ap. 781-798.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncreasing burden of non-communicable diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disorders has made the global health scenario more challenging. Dyslipidemia in diabetes is a compounding risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, but there is dearth of identifying appropriate signatures to address this issue. The protein, adiponectin, is actively involved in regulating glucose levels as well as fatty acid breakdown playing crucial role in dyslipidemia and vascular complications. To identify the underlying genetic and molecular profile of adiponectin metabolic pathway in diabetic dyslipidemia and to correlate it with known biochemical and oxidative stress parameters of T2DM, we performed a case–control study in a total 264 individuals belonging to three categories such as diabetes with dyslipidemia (n = 88), diabetes without dyslipidemia (n = 86) and normal healthy controls (n = 90). Expression of adiponectin (ADIPOQ) and its receptors (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2) were measured in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues. A significant downregulated expression of ADIPOQ and its receptors in adipose tissues and PBMCs were linked with diabetic dyslipidemic condition. A multiple linear regression followed by MDR analysis implicated the elevated plasma malondialdehyde and decreased adiponectin level to be correlated with diabetic dyslipidemia. More interestingly, two single nucleotide polymorphisms of ADIPOQ (rs2241766 and rs1501299) were genetically associated with the risk of developing dyslipidemia. Other important biochemical factors found to be increased in diabetic dyslipidemic conditions included plasma C-reactive protein and 4-hydroxynonenal adducts. Our results explore, a complex interplay of genetic and biochemical parameters in diabetic dyslipidemia which is significant from the perspective of risk stratification and novel therapeutic strategy development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aadiponectin 3abiochemical pathways 3acase-control studies 3adiabetes 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3aoxidative stress 3aregression analysis 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors1 aChatterjee, Tanima1 aChowdhury, Subhankar1 aSengupta, Sanghamitra1 aBhattacharyya, Maitree1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6420-43420 tBiochemical genetics.g2021 June, v. 59, no. 3 p.781-798dSpringer USwJournal:jnl44655x0006-29287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-021-10030-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007200166300001600238520122100254592002801475650001901503650001201522650001301534650002101547650002301568650001101591650001401602650001701616700002301633700003401656773010901690852000901799856008101808930003301889946001301922655001201935IND60438781820221120120540.0151023e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-006-0124-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierik, Ronald10aGrowth Control by Ethylene: Adjusting Phenotypes to the Environment  ap. 188-200.  aPlants phenotypically adjust to environmental challenges, and the gaseous plant hormone ethylene modulates many of these growth adjustments. Ethylene can be involved in environmentally induced growth inhibition as well as growth stimulation. Still, ethylene has long been considered a growth inhibitory hormone. There is, however, accumulating evidence indicating that growth promotion is a common feature in ethylene responses. This is evident in environmental challenges, such as flooding and competition, where the resulting avoidance responses can help plants avoid adversity. To show how ethylene-mediated growth enhancement can facilitate plant performance under adverse conditions, we explored a number of these examples. To escape adversity, plants can optimize growth and thereby tolerate abiotic stresses such as drought, and this response can also involve ethylene. In this article we indicate how opposing effects of ethylene on plant growth can be brought about, by discussing a unifying, biphasic ethylene response model. To understand the mechanistic basis for this multitude of ethylene-mediated growth responses, the involvement of ethylene in processes that control cell expansion is also reviewed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3adrought 3aethylene 3agrowth promotion 3agrowth retardation 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aplant growth1 aSasidharan, Rashmi1 aVoesenek, Laurentius A.

However, the molecular mechanism of PavSVP regulating flowering and dormancy in sweet cherry remains unknown. We identified a MADS-box gene SVP-like named PavSVP from sweet cherry, which was closely to PmSVP and PpSVP from Prunus mume and Prunus persica by using phylogenetic tree analysis, suggesting a conserved function with these evolutionarily closer SVP homologs. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that, PavSVP was localized in the nucleus and cytomembrane. PavSVP expression in sweet cherries were observed in vegetative and floral tissues, but much higher level in flower buds. The seasonal expression level of PavSVP was higher during the stage of summer growth in flower buds, and declined gradually toward dormancy and flower initiation. Ectopic expression of PavSVP induced a delayed flowering and the occurrence of abnormal flowers, including curly sepals and plicated siliques in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, protein interaction analysis showed that PavSVP interacted with PavSEP, PavAP1 and PavJONITLESS. Unlike PavSVP, over-expression of PavSEP in Arabidopsis caused early flowering phenotype. In addition, the expression of PavSEP in flower buds was low in summer. These results will help reveal the molecular mechanisms of PavSVP in maintaining the suppression phase of flowering in sweet cherry during summer and winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aPrunus avium 3aPrunus mume 3aPrunus persica 3adormancy 3agenes 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3asiliques 3asummer 3atranscription factors 3awinter 0aSweet cherry 0aFlowering 0aMADS-Box transcription factor1 aJiu, Songtao1 aXu, Yan1 aSabir, Irfan Ali1 aWang, Lei1 aMa, Chao1 aXu, Wenping1 aWang, Shiping1 aZhang, Caixi0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Feb., v. 159 p.277-284dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.12.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01763naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245002500174300001800199520081300217592002801030650001001058650004401068650002301112650001301135700001901148700002501167700001801192700002201210773012601232856008201358852000901440655001201449IND60567853320221117082706.0170428e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056785332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b117132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, Christopher L.,10a11B NMR Study of WB2  ap. 1315-1320.  aThe structure of tungsten diboride, WB₂, differs from those of metal diborides with AlB₂- or ReB₂-type structures that have been previously studied by ¹¹B NMR spectroscopy. As opposed to the single ¹¹B resonance reported for the metal diborides having those AlB₂- or ReB₂-type structures, four groups of ¹¹B resonances are found for WB₂. There is also ¹¹B NMR spectral evidence to support the proposal by Kiesling in 1947 of an additional boron atom at the center of some of the six-membered boron rings. The ¹¹B quadrupolar frequencies of all four groups of resonances in WB₂ are all quite small (<20 kHz), in keeping with the trend observed for ¹¹B in metal diborides having the AlB₂-structure as the metal is taken from further down the groups (families) in the periodic table.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboron 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3atungsten1 aZujovic, Zoran1 aKoumoulis, Dimitrios1 aTaylor, R.

Asia, including India, is the largest global source of aerosol particles due to regional natural advection (e.g. desert and soil dust) and anthropogenic activities (e.g. emissions from traffic, industry and burning of coal, biomass and agricultural waste) that generate vast amounts of particulate matter (PM) significantly contributing to climate change. This article reports on the distributions, concentrations, and sources of organic compounds (i.e., alkanes, carboxylic acids, carbonyl compounds, alcohols, plasticizers, PAHs, biomarkers) of PM in the ambient atmosphere of an extensively industrialized area of central India (Raipur, Chhattisgarh, a coal mega-burning region). The dominant components are emissions from fossil fuel utilization, burning of biomass and plastics, and fugitive sources. Speciation and variations of potential new tracer compounds identified are also described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aagricultural wastes 3aair quality 3aalcohols 3aalkanes 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomarkers 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbonyl compounds 3acarboxylic acids 3aclimate change 3acoal 3aemissions 3aindustrialization 3aindustry 3aparticulates 3aplasticizers 3aplastics 3apoint source pollution 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3atracer techniques 3atraffic 3aIndia 0aPM10 0aLipids 0aPAH 0aHydrocarbons 0aTerpenoids 0aFugitive emissions 0aGC–MS 0aRaipur1 aPatel, Khageshwar S.1 aJaiswal, Nitin K.1 aSharma, Saroj1 aAmbade, Balram1 aWang, Wentao1 aSimonich, Staci L.

Recently, investigators hypothesized that decreased vagus nerve activity may be the underlying mechanism of metabolic syndrome including obesity, elevated glucose levels, and high blood pressure. METHODS: In this pilot randomized clinical trial, we compared the efficacy of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) and sham taVNS on patients with IGT. 72 participants with IGT were single-blinded and were randomly allocated by computer-generated envelope to either taVNS or sham taVNS treatment groups. In addition, 30 IGT adults were recruited as a control population and not assigned treatment so as to monitor the natural fluctuation of glucose tolerance in IGT patients. All treatments were self-administered by the patients at home after training at the hospital. Patients were instructed to fill in a patient diary booklet each day to describe any side effects after each treatment. The treatment period was 12 weeks in duration. Baseline comparison between treatment and control group showed no difference in weight, BMI, or measures of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG), or glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc). RESULTS: 100 participants completed the study and were included in data analysis. Two female patients (one in the taVNS group, one in the sham taVNS group) dropped out of the study due to stimulation-evoked dizziness. The symptoms were relieved after stopping treatment. Compared with sham taVNS, taVNS significantly reduced the two-hour glucose tolerance (F(2) = 5.79, p = 0.004). In addition, we found that taVNS significantly decreased (F(1) = 4.21, p = 0.044) systolic blood pressure over time compared with sham taVNS. Compared with the no-treatment control group, patients receiving taVNS significantly differed in measures of FPG (F(2) = 10.62, p < 0.001), 2hPG F(2) = 25.18, p < 0.001) and HbAlc (F(1) = 12.79, p = 0.001) over the course of the 12 week treatment period. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that taVNS is a promising, simple, and cost-effective treatment for IGT/ pre-diabetes with only slight risk of mild side-effects.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aalternative medicine 3ablood glucose 3abody mass index 3aclinical trials 3acost effectiveness 3adiastolic blood pressure 3afemales 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3ahospitals 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypertension 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolic syndrome 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apatients 3arisk 3asystolic blood pressure 3avagus nerve1 aDong, Jianxun1 aKong, Jian1 aWang, Hongcai1 aMeng, Hong1 aSpaeth, Rosa B1 aCamhi, Stephanie1 aLiao, Xing1 aLi, Xia1 aZhai, Xu1 aLi, Shaoyuan1 aZhu, Bing1 aRong, Peijing0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.203-203dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-2033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015800166300001600324520140300340592002801743650002401771650002201795650002201817650002101839650001301860650002601873650001801899650004101917650001401958650001301972700001401985700001601999700001602015700001902031700001502050773009502065856008402160852000902244655001202253IND60113125620221120154326.0141111e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011312562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.09.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoubart, V.10aInfluence of sample and mobile phase composition on peptide retention behaviour and sensitivity in reversed-phase liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry  ap. 199-207.  aBecause the chromatographic behaviour of peptides is totally different from that of small molecules, a good understanding of the mechanisms that occur from injection to detection in reversed-phase LC–MS is strongly recommended to successfully develop not only qualitative but also quantitative methods. In this study, design of experiments was used in order to investigate the influence of the experimental parameters, i.e. sample and mobile phase composition, on a peptide mixture covering a wide range of molecular weights, isoelectric points and hydropathies. First, a screening design was developed to identify the significant factors concerning mobile phase (ion-pairing reagent nature and concentration) and sample composition (organic modifier proportion and ion-pairing reagent nature) on retention and response intensity (sensitivity). Then, after having selected the experimental domain and the significant factors, a full factorial design was used to further investigate the role of the considered factors and their interactions. Interestingly, ion-pairing reagent nature present in the sample had a tremendous effect on retention and response intensity. Optimal conditions leading to good sensitivity and adequate peptide retention without band splitting were selected and could be used as starting point for rapid method development using classical solvents and ion-pairing reagents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperimental design 3aisoelectric point 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3apeptides 3aquantitative analysis 3arapid methods 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3ascreening 3asolvents1 aRozet, E.1 aMatagne, A.1 aCrommen, J.1 aServais, A.-C.1 aFillet, M.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 1314 p.199-207dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.09.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245007300168300001600241520209300257592002802350650003102378650001502409650001302424650002302437650002002460651001802480651001402498653000902512653003802521653000802559653000702567700001502574700001802589700001802607773009102625856008602716852000902802655001202811IND60089269620221120053347.0160903e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008926962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.08.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhili10aEffect of non-spherical dust aerosol on its direct radiative forcing  ap. 112-126.  aThe optical properties of spherical and non-spherical dust aerosols are calculated using the Lorenz–Mie theory and the combination of T-matrix method and an improved geometric optics method. The resulting optical properties are then applied in an interactive system that coupled a general circulation model with an aerosol model to quantitatively analyze the effect of non-spherical dust aerosol on its direct radiative forcing (DRF). Our results show that the maximum difference in dust instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) between spherical and non-spherical particles is 0.27Wm−2 at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and appears over the Sahara Desert due to enhanced absorption of solar radiation by non-spherical dust. The global annual means of shortwave (longwave) IRFs due to spherical and non-spherical dust aerosols at the TOA for all sky are −0.62 (0.074) Wm−2 and −0.61 (0.073) Wm−2, respectively, and the corresponding values for clear sky are −1.16 (0.092) Wm−2 and −1.14 (0.093) Wm−2, which indicates that the non-spherical effect of dust has almost no effect on their global annual mean IRFs.However, non-spherical dust displays more evident influences than above on its atmospheric- and land-temperature adjusted radiative forcing (AF) at the TOA over the Saharan Desert, West Asia, and northern China, with an approximate maximum increase of 3.0 and decrease of 0.5Wm−2. The global annual means of shortwave (longwave) AFs due to spherical and non-spherical dust aerosols are −0.55 (0.052) Wm−2 and −0.48 (0.049) Wm−2 at the TOA for all sky, respectively, and the corresponding values for clear sky are −1.07 (0.066) Wm−2 and −0.95 (0.062) Wm−2. All AFs of dust become much weaker than their corresponding IRFs. The absolute values of annual mean AF for non-spherical dust are approximately 13% (11.2%) and 6% (6%) less than those of spherical dust for the shortwave and longwave for all sky (clear sky), respectively. The results indicate that the non-spherical effect of dust can reduce their AFs more obviously than do their IRFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeneral Circulation Models 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3aoptical properties 3asolar radiation 3aSahara Desert 3aWest Asia 0aDust 0aSpherical/non-spherical particles 0aIRF 0aAF1 aZhang, Hua1 aJing, Xianwen1 aWei, Xiaodong0 tAtmospheric research.g2013 Feb., v. 120-121 p.112-126dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00938naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245005200168520012800220592002800348650001500376650001700391650001700408650001900425700002100444773012000465856007800585852000900663655001200672IND60757685620221120022659.0211125e20211021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075768562DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101125252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiannakourou, Maria 10aChanges during Food Freezing and Frozen Storage  aMultiple factors can directly influence frozen food quality, during processing and post-processing, in the cold chain [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3acold chain 3afood quality 3afrozen foods 3afrozen storage1 aTaoukis, Petros 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 21, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101125253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03558naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245014600172300001600318520203300334592002802367650002002395650001802415650001002433650001902443650001302462650002002475650002502495650001802520650001302538650001202551650001002563650001202573650002402585650001202609650002902621650001102650650000902661650001302670650001102683650001402694651001102708700001802719700002202737700002302759700002002782700002302802700001902825773010802844856005502952852000903007655001203016IND50064756820221119143456.0130409e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006475682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-048X.2012.05622.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaino, Nicola12aA ptilochronological study of carry‐over effects of conditions during wintering on breeding performance in the barn swallow Hirundo rustica  ap. 513-524.  aThe ecological conditions that a bird experiences during any stage of its life cycle may have consequences that become manifested at later life stages, and these ‘carry‐over effects’ may be major components of variance in individual performance. Condition‐dependent feather growth rate, as assessed by growth bars width (GBW), provides a unique, though largely under‐exploited tool to investigate carry‐over effects of ecological conditions and individual physiological state during molt. In this study of breeding barn swallows Hirundo rustica, which undergo a single complete annual molt of tail and wing feathers during wintering in sub‐Saharan Africa, we first show that old (≥ 2 yr) females have larger GBW than old males and yearlings. GBW was smaller with larger infestations by common ectoparasites of barn swallows, independent of the swallows’ age or sex, and larger GBW was associated with a higher index of body condition during the breeding season in males. Larger GBW predicted higher seasonal reproductive output of older males, but not reproductive output of younger males or females of any age class, with this higher reproductive output of older males mediated by higher offspring fledging success. However, no relationship with GBW was observed for seasonal reproductive output of males in the spring preceding the winter when the feathers were grown. Hence, this study suggests that the analysis of the rate of feathers growth (‘ptilochronology’) has a larger potential to serve as a powerful tool in the study of carry‐over effects than has been appreciated to date. Specifically, the present results support the idea that conditions experienced during wintering in Africa and proximately reflected by GBW have carry‐over effects on body condition and breeding success. These effects are sex and age specific, being more pronounced in older males, possibly as a consequence of differences in annual time routines and susceptibility to extrinsic factors among sex and age classes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHirundo rustica 3aage structure 3abirds 3abody condition 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3adevelopmental stages 3aectoparasites 3afeathers 3afemales 3amales 3amolting 3aphysiological state 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3aspring 3atail 3avariance 3awinter 3ayearlings 3aAfrica1 aRomano, Maria1 aCaprioli, Manuela1 aAmbrosini, Roberto1 aRubolini, Diego1 aScandolara, Chiara1 aRomano, Andrea0 tJournal of avian biology.g2012 Nov., v. 43, no. 6 p.513-524dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2012.05622.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005500152245012100207500002200328520141700350592002801767650001401795650001101809650001501820650001001835650003201845650001101877650001901888653003301907653003101940653003201971653002502003700001802028700005702046773008202103856008702185852000902272655001202281IND60656130820221119070510.0190809e20190803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065613082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yujie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5722-267310aEnergy management strategy for battery/supercapacitor/fuel cell hybrid source vehicles based on finite state machine  aPre-press version  aIn recent years, fuel cell vehicles have attracted attention for their zero emission and environmental friendship. The sole fuel cell system cannot satisfy the dramatical change of motor power demands. In addition, the power fluctuations will damage the fuel cell stacks and shorten the cycle life of fuel cells. Therefore fuel cell systems are always combined with other energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors to increase the power density of the power system and fulfill the load power demands. The management strategy of the hybrid propulsion system is a significant technique for the vehicular power system. In this work, a finite state machine based management strategy is first proposed for both the battery/fuel cell and battery/supercapacitor/fuel cell system. The power capabilities of the battery and supercapacitor have been considered as important parameters in the management strategy. Moreover, an optimal oxygen excess ratio control is presented to maximize the fuel cell output net power. To evaluate the performance of the fuel economy and dynamic property, both the simulations and experimental verifications with the real physical system are given, and the real driving cycle of urban dynamometer driving schedule is utilized. The experimental and simulated results indicate that the proposed method is able to guarantee the required power during most of the driving cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aenergy 3afuel cells 3afuels 3ainterpersonal relationships 3aoxygen 3azero emissions 0aHybrid energy storage system 0aEnergy management strategy 0aOxygen excess ratio control 0aFinite state machine1 aSun, Zhendong1 aChen, Zonghai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9312-90890 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 03, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006400155245007800219300001600297520164600313592002801959650001801987650001002005650001302015650002602028650001002054650002302064650001502087650003502102650003002137650001002167650001302177650001402190650000902204650002702213650001502240651002102255651001502276653001902291653001902310653000902329653003202338653003402370700005802404700002202462700001802484700002702502773009202529856009002621852000902711655001202720IND60644883320221118065713.0200804e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064488332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorsolini, Simonetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9772-236210aPBDEs and PCBs in terrestrial ecosystems of the Victoria Land, Antarctica  ap. 233-239.  aThe Victoria Land (East Antarctica) is characterized by the presence of lakes and ponds where rare water is found during the Summer months. These freshwater ecosystems are an important resource for migrating seabirds that use them and leave there their droppings and feathers, contributing to enrich the water with organic matter.Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are long-range transported to polar regions and their detection in the Antarctic ecosystems date back to the 1960s. Most studies have been related to POP concentrations in marine environment, and terrestrial ecosystems have been poorly investigated. This study reports the concentration of PBDEs (23 congeners) and PCBs (21 among non-, mono-, di-, and ortho congeners) in lake sediment, soil and vegetation mat (community of algae, cyanobacteria, bryophites) collected close to six lakes in the Victoria Land (74°31′S-74°97′S, 165°07′E-162°51′E): Edmonson Point 14 and 15A, Carezza, Enigma, Tarn Flat 20, Inexpressible Island 10B.The ∑PBDEs averaged 0.09–0.28 ng/g and BDEs 28, 47 and 154 were higher in mat and soils, while BDEs 183 and 47 in sediment samples. PCBs ranged <0.003–0.807 ng/g and congeners nos. 114, 138, and 187 were the most abundant. In addition, TEQs were derived for the non-and mono-ortho PCBs detected and values were very low in each matrix (0.010 pg/g in the soil, 0.012 pg/g in sediment and mat). The long-range atmospheric transport can be confirmed as the most important POP source in Antarctica, although the scientific stations and seabird colonies may be potential local sources and contribute to contaminant release.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aalgae 3afeathers 3afreshwater ecosystems 3alakes 3amarine environment 3apollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aponds 3aseabirds 3asediments 3asoil 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3avegetation 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aLake sediments 0aVegetation mat 0aSoil 0aBrominated flame retardants 0aPersistent organic pollutants1 aBaroni, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8852-927X1 aMartellini, Tania1 aPala, Nicolas1 aCincinelli, Alessandra0 tChemosphere.g2019 Sept., v. 231 p.233-239dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013700170300001600307500001900323520138100342592002801723650002101751650001101772650001301783650001601796650001201812650001601824650001601840650001301856650001501869650001901884650002101903650001201924650002801936650001901964650001301983653002701996653001502023653002002038653002102058700001302079700001602092700001802108700001702126700001802143700001802161700001502179700001802194773012402212856008502336852000902421655001202430IND60720946920221116143142.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072094692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xiaodong10aExogenous Strigolactones alleviate KCl stress by regulating photosynthesis, ROS migration and ion transport in Malus hupehensis Rehd  ap. 113-122.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn recent years, the application of large amounts of potash fertilizer in apple orchards leads to worsening KCl stress. Strigolactone (SL), as a novel phytohormone, reportedly participates in plant tolerance to NaCl and drought stresses. However, the underlying mechanism and the effects of exogenous SL on the KCl stress of apple seedlings remain unclear.We sprayed different concentrations of exogenous SL on Malus hupehensis Rehd. under KCl stress and measured the physiological indexes like, photosynthetic parameter, content of ROS, osmolytes and mineral element. In addition, the expressions of KCl-responding genes and SL-signaling genes were also detected and analyzed.Application of exogenous SL protected the chlorophyll and maintained the photosynthetic rate of apple seedlings under KCl stress. Exogenous SL strengthened the enzyme activities of peroxidase and catalase, thereby eliminating reactive oxygen species production induced by KCl stress, promoting the accumulation of proline, and maintaining osmotic balance. Exogenous SL expelled K⁺ outside of the cytoplasm and compartmentalized K⁺ into the vacuole, increased the contents of Na⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, and Mn²⁺ in the cytoplasm to maintain the ion homeostasis under KCl stress.Exogenous SL can regulate photosynthesis, ROS migration and ion transport in apple seedlings to alleviate KCl stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus hupehensis 3aapples 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3adrought 3afertilizers 3ahomeostasis 3aminerals 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant physiology 3aproline 3areactive oxygen species 3astrigolactones 3avacuoles 0aMalus hupehensis Rehd. 0aKCl stress 0aIon homeostasis 0aOxidative stress1 aLi, Yuqi1 aXi, Xiangli1 aMa, Changqing1 aSun, Zhijuan1 aYang, Xueqing1 aLi, Xiangyang1 aTian, Yike1 aWang, Caihong0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Feb., v. 159 p.113-122dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015600165300001600321520113900337592002801476650003801504650002001542650001801562650002501580650001601605650001701621650001201638650001201650650001201662650001101674650001001685650001601695650001101711650002401722650001301746650001601759650001801775650001001793650002001803650002101823650002401844650001701868700001301885700001501898700001401913700001901927700001601946700001501962773010601977856008102083852000902164655001202173IND60438782020221120104707.0151023e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043878202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00344-015-9481-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Xiaowei10aCloning and Expression Analysis of 9-cis-Epoxycarotenoid Dioxygenase Gene 1 Involved in Fruit Maturation and Abiotic Stress Response in Lycium chinense  ap. 465-474.  aAbscisic acid (ABA) plays a crucial role in plant adaptations to environmental stress, growth, and development, such as seed dormancy and germination. 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) is a rate-limiting enzyme in regulation of ABA biosynthesis in plants. To understand the potential role of NCED in fruit ripening and stress tolerance, a NCED gene (LcNCED1) was cloned from the leaves of Lycium chinense. LcNCED1 has an ORF of 1824 bp, which encodes a peptide of 607 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of the LcNCED1 protein shares high identity with other NCEDs. Tissue distribution analysis reveals that LcNCED1 is abundantly expressed in leaves, stems, and flowers. In fruits, the expression level of LcNCED1 is in accordance with the accumulation of ABA. In addition, ABA accumulation in leaves was associated with enhanced expression of LcNCED1 induced strongly by abiotic stresses (drought, salt, and CdCl₂).

However, some exogenous substances are still able to pass through the blood-brain barrier, with distribution patterns yet to be clarified. Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), including perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs), perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSAs), a precursor (perfluorooctane sulfonamide that can be degraded to other substances), and emerging PFASs, were analyzed for the first time in living human brain glioma. The target compounds were detected and quantified in 25 out of 26 glioma samples. The concentration range of ∑PFAS was < RL−51 ng g⁻¹ wet weight (applied to all reported concentrations), with a median of 2.9 ng g⁻¹. The most abundant compound was PFCAs (40%), followed by PFSAs (28%), emerging PFASs (22%), and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (10%). Abundant alternatives PFASs, including short-chain PFCAs, short-chain PFSAs, and emerging PFASs (52% of ∑PFAS), were found in the glioma samples, supporting the notion that low molecular weight exogenous compounds have high permeability to cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in brain tissue. Gender difference was not significant (p > 0.05) in the concentrations of PFASs in the glioma samples. Concentrations of PFASs increased with increasing age, from 0.61 ng g⁻¹ (0–14 years old) to 1.6 ng g⁻¹ (>48 years old), with no significant linear correlation with age. The present study suggested that glioma is an effective indicator for monitoring exogenous contaminants in brain tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3agender differences 3aglioma 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3amolecular weight 3aperfluorocarbons 3apermeability 3aresearch 0aPerfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances 0aBrain tissue 0aTumor 0aBlood-brain barrier 0aTransport1 aLin, Zhi-Ying1 aLiu, Liang-Ying1 aWu, Chen-Chou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2555-56731 aLiu, Ya-Wei1 aHuang, Guang-Long1 aZeng, E.

Raman backscatter coefficients, extinction coefficients and lidar ratios were measured within the period 28/08/2010 and 24/04/2011. Typical atmospheric scenarios over Southern Ireland in terms of the aerosol load in the planetary boundary layer are outlined. The lidar ratios found are typical for marine atmospheric condition (lidar ratio ca. 20–25sr). The height of the planetary boundary layer is below 1000m and therefore low in comparison to heights found at other lidar sites in Europe. On the 21st of April a large aerosol load was detected, which was assigned to a Saharan dust event based on HYSPLIT trajectories and DREAM forecasts along with the lidar ratio (70sr) for the period concerned. The dust was found at two heights, pure dust at 2.5km and dust mixing with pollution from 0.7 to 1.8km with a lidar ratio of 40–50sr.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aaerosols 3alidar 3apollution 3atroposphere 3aIreland 0aVertical aerosol profiling 0aRaman lidar 0aExtinction and backscatter coefficient 0aEARLINET1 aRuth, Albert A.0 tAtmospheric research.g2013 Feb., v. 120-121 p.334-342dElsevier B.V.x0169-80957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2012.09.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009000173300001600263500001900279520161600298592002801914650001901942650001901961650001701980650001701997650001302014650002302027650001402050650002802064650001502092650001402107650002002121650003302141650002102174650002602195650001802221653003102239653001602270653002202286653001102308653001502319653002202334653000802356653000802364653000902372653000802381653000802389653000802397653000802405653000802413653001102421700006402432700002302496700002302519700002602542700001802568700001902586700006402605700001602669700003102685700002102716773012402737856008502861852000902946655001202955IND60720947020221116143215.0210212e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072094702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalliser, Benjamin10aDahlia variabilis cultivar ‘Seattle’ as a model plant for anthochlor biosynthesis  ap. 193-201.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe investigated the bi-colored dahlia cultivar ‘Seattle’, which exhibits bright yellow petals with white tips, for its potential use as a model system for studies of the anthochlor biosynthesis. The yellow base contained high amounts of the 6′-deoxychalcones and the structurally related 4-deoxyaurones, as well as flavones. In contrast, only traces of anthochlors and flavones were detected in the white tips. No anthocyanins, flavonols, flavanones or dihydroflavonols were found in the petals. Gene expression studies indicated that the absence of anthocyanins in the petals is caused by a lack of flavanone 3-hydroxylase (FHT) expression, which is accompanied by a lack of expression of the bHLH transcription factor IVS. Expression of other genes involved in anthocyanidin biosynthesis such as dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) was not affected. The yellow and white petal parts showed significant differences in the expression of chalcone synthase 2 (CHS2), which is sufficient to explain the absence of yellow pigments in the white tips. Transcriptomes of both petal parts were de novo assembled and three candidate genes for chalcone reductase (CHR) were identified. None of them showed a significantly higher expression in the yellow base compared to the white tips. In summary, it was shown that the bicolouration is most likely caused by a bottleneck in chalcone formation in the white tip. The relative prevalence of flavones compared to the anthochlors in the white tips could be an indication for the presence of a so far unknown differentially expressed CHR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDahlia pinnata 3aanthocyanidins 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3achalcone 3achalcone reductase 3acultivars 3aflavanone 3-dioxygenase 3aflavanones 3aflavonols 3agene expression 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 3aplant physiology 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 0aDahlia (Dahlia variabilis) 0aAnthochlors 0aIsoliquiritigenin 0aButein 0aSulfuretin 0aChalcone synthase 0aANS 0aAUS 0aCH3H 0aCHI 0aCHS 0aCHR 0aDFR 0aFHT 0aFNS II1 aLucaciu, Calin Rares1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4646-40491 aMolitor, Christian1 aMarinovic, Silvija1 aNitarska, Daria Agata1 aAktaş, Didem1 aRattei, Thomas1 aKampatsikas, Ioannis1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7660-31211 aStich, Karl1 aHaselmair-Gosch, Christian1 aHalbwirth, Heidi0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2021 Feb., v. 159 p.193-201dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2020.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245010200163300001800265520088000283592002801163650002301191650003901214650001701253650001101270650001201281650001301293650001701306700001401323700001801337700001701355700002401372700001901396700002001415700002301435700002201458773013401480856007401614852000901688655001201697IND60660899820221122053437.0190827e20150312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066089982DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc00882d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonreal, I.

Live cell confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that multivalency dramatically improved the permeation potency of TATp-D to HeLa and primary hippocampal neuronal cells. The observed enhanced ability of TATp-D to translocate through the membrane is highlighted by a non-linear dependence on concentration, exhibiting the greatest uptake at sub-micromolar concentrations as compared to TATp.

This method can serve as a ubiquitous autonomous energy source that converts a magnetic field into usable electrical energy in a wireless sensor network for an (Industrial) Internet of Things (IIoT). The key approach in the proposed model is to increase of the Lorentz force by vertically adjusting the magnetic flux direction of a power cable and the magnetic direction of a tip magnet. In the simulation, a 3,592 times higher y-axis Lorentz force was obtained in the vertical pole array, which resulted in about a 1.6 times higher output voltage. Then, we experimentally compared the electrical output performance of six different types of pole array according to the size and direction of the tip magnet. In a one-tip magnet (10×10×10 mm3), the output power values were 2.34 mW (Vertical) and 1.23 mW (Horizontal) at 8 kΩ matching impedance. For two-tip magnets (20×10×10 mm3), the output power values of the harvester were 39.2 mW (Planar-Vertical), 18.4 mW (Orthogonal-Vertical), 8.64 mW (Planar-Horizontal), and 0.05 mW (Orthogonal-Horizontal) at 5 kΩ matching impedance. It was found that the power generation differed by 2.13 to 784 times. With this method of power enhancement using multi-disciplinary research, we successfully constructed autonomous IoT and IIoT sensor systems for smart homes, smart buildings and smart factories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3abuildings 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectric power 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic materials 3apower generation 0apiezoelectric energy harvester 0amagnetic field 0aautonomous 0awireless sensor network 0apower cable 0aLorentz force1 aKim, Jihoon1 aKim, Kyung-Bum1 aHee Ryu, Chul1 aHwang, Wonseop1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4797-76581 aHee Lee, Tae1 aHyun Sung, Tae0 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 05, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1137103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001500187245011700202300001200319506007600331520127000407592002801677506003701705650000801742650002101750650002501771650001601796650002201812650001501834650001701849650003201866650002501898650001201923650000801935650001701943650002001960650000901980650001401989650001802003650001102021650001702032650001202049651001002061700001702071700001402088700002002102700001702122700001902139700001602158773013102174856008102305852000902386655001202395IND60574965020221207125247.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057496502DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-2502doi7 aPMC42235182pmcid7 a250340942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Siyun10aPossible mechanism underlying the effect of Heshouwuyin, a tonifying kidney herb, on sperm quality in aging rats  ap. 250.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Herb mixtures are used as alternatives to hormone therapy in China for the treatment of partial androgen deficiency in aging men. However, the compositions of these herb mixtures are complex and their mechanisms are often unknown. This study investigates the effect of Heshouwuyin, a Chinese herbal compound for invigorating the kidney, on the control of testosterone secretion and sperm function. METHODS: Aged Wistar rats were administered with Heshouwuyin. A Shouwu pill group and young group were used as controls. RESULTS: Morphology, chemiluminescence, fluorescence immunohistochemistry, and western blot showed that the epididymal sperm of naturally aged rats had intact plasma membranes. They also had abnormal mitochondrial function and DNA integrity, a significant decline in serum testosterone levels, and significant pathological changes in the structure of testicular tissues. Heshouwuyin significantly improved sperm function and serum testosterone levels, and improved testicular morphology. Moreover, the curative efficacy of Heshouwuyin after 60 days was better than that of Heshouwuyin after 30 days and the Shouwu pill group. CONCLUSION: Heshouwuyin exerts an important role in controlling testosterone secretion and sperm function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3ablood serum 3achemiluminescence 3aepididymis 3afluorescence 3ahormone replacement therapy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3akidneys 3amen 3amitochondria 3aplasma membrane 3arats 3asecretion 3asperm quality 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atissues 3aChina1 aChen, Jingbo1 aDuan, Fei1 aSong, Qingliang1 aQin, Mingyue1 aWang, Zhenshan1 aLiu, Jingze0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.250-250dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-2503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245015600161300001800317500002000335520146300355592002801818596009201846596005501938650001601993650001602009650001402025650002402039650001602063650002102079650002102100650001102121650001802132650003002150650002102180650001002201650000902211650001202220650001502232650002202247700001202269700001202281700001802293700001302311700005602324773012502380856008002505852000902585655001202594IND60769150020221120232027.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076915002DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.160762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Kunli10aBentong ginger oleoresin mitigates liver injury and modulates gut microbiota in mouse with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease induced by high‐fat diet  ap. 1268-1281.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe present study aimed to examine the protective effect of Bentong ginger oleoresin (BGO) on the occurrence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its underlying mechanism. In the present study, 14‐week BGO treatment reduced the high‐fat diet (HFD)‐induced obesity. The serum total cholesterol (TC) was reduced from 4.76 ± 0.30 to 3.542 ± 0.49 mmol/L and fatty liver score decreased to the normal level (1.6 ± 0.55). BGO had antihypercholesterolemia activity, alleviated abnormal lipid metabolism, and improved liver fat accumulation. In addition, liver inflammatory cytokine tests and Western blotting analysis indicated that BGO might play an anti‐inflammatory role by mediating the NF‐κB signaling pathway. Moreover, BGO regulated the gut microbiota in NAFLD mice and finally mediated their benefits for the host, which might be associated with reduced abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Fournierella. BGO showed effective liver protection and regulation of gut microbiota for the HFD‐induced NAFLD in obese mice. As a result, BGO may serve as an effective dietary supplement for the improvement of NAFLD‐related metabolic diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This study provides a new way to improve the added value of Bentong ginger. It also provides certain experimental data on BGO as a kind of the functional food ingredient. The current work also provides new ideas for the improvement and treatment of NAFLD.  aPublisher supplied data  a201503142cThe China Special Fund for Agro‐scientific Research in the Public Interest  cChina Agricultural University Education Foundation 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acytokines 3adietary supplements 3afatty liver 3afood composition 3afunctional foods 3aginger 3ahigh fat diet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amice 3aobesity 3aoleoresins 3aprotective effect1 aLi, Bei1 aFu, Rao1 aJiang, Zefang1 aWen, Xin1 aNi, Yuanying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7998-31550 tJournal of food science.g2022 Mar., v. 87, no. 3 p.1268-1281dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.160763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245009200167300001800259520165500277592002801932650003601960650004901996650001302045650001102058650001302069650001802082650002202100650003702122700001802159700002202177700001702199700002102216700001102237700001802248700001702266700002002283700001802303773012602321856008202447852000902529655001202538IND60567853720221117082830.0170428e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056785372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b119632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeupane, Sunanda10aProbing the Aggregation Mechanism of Gold Nanoparticles Triggered by a Globular Protein  ap. 1377-1386.  aGold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are advancing a number of areas. Meanwhile, the inevitable contact of AuNPs with surrounding biomolecules has been realized to “negatively” impact the nanoparticle (NP) function, biological environment, and even public health. Understanding the mechanisms of the NP–biomolecule interaction often leads to revealing the pathways toward the negative, deleterious effects. It is therefore essential to know the undesirable pathways so that these unwanted effects can be reduced by blocking or rerouting these pathways. A fundamental step to understand the interaction mechanism is to elucidate the changes in protein structure and dynamics and in NP properties upon the contact of AuNPs and protein, at the molecular level. However, it is challenging to probe these areas experimentally due to the large size and the complexity of the protein–nano interface. Here we report the use of a unique approach, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, to probe the structure and dynamics of a model protein, T4 lysozyme (T4L), upon interaction with AuNPs. In combination with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, UV–vis spectroscopy, and a protein activity assay, we found that T4L triggered the AuNPs to aggregate but remained in its native structure. Remarkably, our results also revealed the pathways of how T4L triggers AuNP aggregation, the potential applications of which were discussed. Lastly, this work demonstrated the usefulness of the EPR spectroscopy in probing the complexes formed by nanomaterials and macrobiomolecules, opening a new window to probe the nano–bio interface in the native state.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3alysozyme 3amodels 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aprotein structure 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aPan, Yanxiong1 aTakalkar, Sunitha1 aBentz, Kylie1 aFarmakes, Jasmin1 aXu, Yi1 aChen, Bingcan1 aLiu, Guodong1 aQian, Steven Y.1 aYang, Zhongyu0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 121, no. 2 p.1377-1386dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b119633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01308naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009500158300001800253520033000271592002800601650001500629650002300644650002300667650002200690650001600712700001800728700001700746700001400763773013400777856007400911852000900985655001200994IND60660899920221120214023.0190827e20150331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066089992DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc00885a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yanyan12aA continuous-flow mass biosensor for the real-time dynamic analysis of protease inhibition  ap. 6601-6604.  aA flow injection analysis–quartz crystal microbalance (FIA–QCM) biosensor was developed for probing the dynamic interactions during protease inhibition.

Several analytical methods were used to determine the structural characteristics, crystalline behavior, morphological properties, thermal properties, and water/oil binding capacity of PP-C and PP-MCC. Fourier-transform infrared spectra and morphological analysis showed that the alkaline hydrogen peroxide treatment and acid hydrolysis successfully removed hemicellulose and lignin from pomelo peel fibers. Both PP-C and PP-MCC had only a cellulose I polymorph structure, and the crystallinity index of PP-MCC increased compared with that of PP-C. The degradation temperatures of PP-C and PP-MCC were approximately 257 °C and 280 °C, respectively. The water/oil binding capacity of PP-MCC was significantly higher than that of the commercial MCC. Our results thus suggested that PP-MCC might be suitable for use as a food stabilizer and pharmaceutical additive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3aanalytical methods 3abinding capacity 3acellulose 3acitrus peels 3acrystal structure 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alignin 3aoils 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3athermal properties 0aPomelo peel 0aCellulose 0aMicrocrystalline cellulose 0aProperties1 aLiu, Ailu1 aIbrahim, Salam A.1 aYang, Hong1 aHuang, Wen0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.717-721dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245013900186300001600325500001500341520126300356592002801619650001401647650001301661650001301674650001901687650001701706650000901723650001401732650001301746650002201759650001001781650001301791650001901804650000901823650001001832650001201842650002601854650001701880650001101897650001101908650001201919650001301931650001301944650000901957650001101966653002701977700001902004700001702023700001802040700002002058700002002078700001602098700001902114773011002133856008102243852000902324655001202333IND60080818920221120203708.0140811e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008081892DNAL7 a250089902pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-014-0057-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Guanchao10aLevels of Heavy Metals and Trace Elements in Umbilical Cord Blood and the Risk of Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: a Population-Based Study  ap. 437-444.  a2019-12-06  aTo better understand the relationship between prenatal exposure to heavy metals and trace elements and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, we investigated the status of heavy metals and trace elements level in a Chinese population by collecting umbilical cord blood. Umbilical cord blood heavy metals and trace elements concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry. No differences with statistical significance in the median arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), strontium (Sr), thallium (Tl), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn) concentrations were observed between the adverse pregnancy outcome group and the reference group. Titanium (Ti) and antimony (Sb) were found at higher levels with statistical significance in the cord blood samples with adverse pregnancy group when compared to the ones in the reference group. The association between Ti levels and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors, including newborn weight. These results indicated that environmental exposure to Ti may increase the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in Chinese women without occupational exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3aantimony 3atitanium 3aChinese people 3aheavy metals 3alead 3astrontium 3aneonates 3apregnancy outcome 3ablood 3athallium 3aumbilical cord 3arisk 3awomen 3acadmium 3aoccupational exposure 3aspectroscopy 3acobalt 3acopper 3aarsenic 3avanadium 3achromium 3azinc 3anickel 0aenvironmental exposure1 aZhong, Hongxiu1 aGuo, Zhizhun1 aWu, Zhuangchu1 aZhang, Huaiqing1 aWang, Chonggang1 aZhou, Yulin1 aZuo, Zhenghong0 tBiological trace element research.g2014 Sept., v. 160, no. 3 p.437-444dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-014-0057-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03907naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245019200206300001200398506007600410520200000486592002802486506003702514650001302551650002202564650002502586650001802611650001302629650002002642650002302662650002402685650002002709650002002729650003302749650001802782650002402800650001502824650002402839650001802863650000902881650002102890650004302911650003002954700001802984700001903002700002003021700002103041700002703062700001903089773013103108856008103239852000903320655001203329IND60574961920221207124600.0181002e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057496192DNAL7 a10.1186/1472-6882-14-2722doi7 aPMC41241642pmcid7 a250744852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jong-Gwan10aEffect of long-term supplementation of low molecular weight chitosan oligosaccharide (GO2KA1) on fasting blood glucose and HbA1c in db/db mice model and elucidation of mechanism of action  ap. 272.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a serious problem for developed countries. Prevention of prediabetes progression to type 2 diabetes with the use of natural products appears to a cost-effective solution. Previously we showed that enzymatically digested low molecular weight chitosan-oligosaccharide with molecular weight (MW) below 1,000 Da (GO2KA1) has potential for hyperglycemia management. METHODS: In this study we evaluated the effect of long-term supplementation of GO2KA1 on hyperglycemia using a db/db mice model. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of GO2KA1 on sucrase and glucoamylase activities and expression, using the same db/db mice model. RESULTS: After 42 days we observed that GO2KA1 supplementation reduced both the blood glucose level and HbA1c in a similar manner with a known anti-diabetic drug, acarbose. When the sucrase and glucoamylase activities of GO2KA1 and control mice were evaluated using enzymatic assay, we observed that GO2KA1 significantly inhibited sucrase in all 3 parts of the intestine, while glucoamylase activity was significantly reduced only in the middle and lower part. When the sucrase-isomaltase (SI) complex expression on mRNA level was evaluated, we observed that GO2KA1 had minimal inhibitory effect on the upper part, more pronounced inhibitory effect on the middle part, while the highest inhibition was observed on the lower part. Our findings suggest that long-term GO2KA1 supplementation in db/db mice results to significant blood glucose and HbA1c reduction, to levels similar with those of acarbose. Furthermore, our findings confirm previous in vitro observations that GO2KA1 has inhibitory effect on carbohydrate hydrolysis enzymes, namely sucrase, maltase and SI complex. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study provide a strong rationale for the use of GO2KA1 for type 2 diabetes prevention, via inhibition of carbohydrate hydrolysis enzymes. Based on the findings of this animal trial, clinical trials will be designed and pursued.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacarbose 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aalternative medicine 3ablood glucose 3achitosan 3aclinical trials 3acost effectiveness 3adeveloped countries 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3ahyperglycemia 3ahypoglycemic agents 3aintestines 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amolecular weight 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3asucrose alpha-glucosidase1 aJo, Sung-Hoon1 aHa, Kyoung-Soo1 aKim, Sung Chul,1 aKim, Young-Cheul1 aApostolidis, Emmanouil1 aKwon, Young-In0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2014 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.272-272dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-14-2723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04003naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245015100205300001400356500002000370520222800390592002802618596004102646596005502687596005902742596000602801650002302807650002802830650003902858650002302897650001402920650002402934650001402958650001502972650001302987650001603000650002103016650001003037650001403047650002703061650001003088651002203098651001503120651001003135700006103145700005803206773013803264856007403402852000903476655001203485IND60759486720221119213537.0211212e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075948672DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.131182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aComerford, Mattheau S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1444-365X12aA test of adaptive divergence in a newly discovered host association of the soapberry bug Jadera haematoloma on Mexican buckeye, Ungnadia speciosa  ap. 64-78.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHost races represent an important step in the speciation process of phytophagous insects as they reflect the maintenance of genetically divergent host‐associated populations in the face of appreciable gene flow. The red‐shouldered soapberry bug, Jadera haematoloma (Herrich‐Schäffer) (Hemiptera: Rhopalidae), is an oligophagous seed predator with a history of host race evolution on plant associations in the (soapberry) family Sapindaceae. Soapberry bugs are a model group for understanding rapid ecological adaptation to their hosts, and hence good candidates for investigating evolutionary divergence in host associations over short timescales. Here, we describe the recent discovery of Mexican buckeye, Ungnadia speciosa Endl., as a host of J. haematoloma in a region of the Chihuahuan desert including west Texas and southeastern New Mexico, USA. This host differs from J. haematoloma’s previously recorded hosts in the Sapindaceae in seed chemistry, ecology, and phylogeny. The tendency toward rapid, host‐associated adaptations by populations of J. haematoloma and the unique biology of the newly discovered Ungnadia host create the opportunity for potential host race formation, as it overlaps geographically with two previously recorded host plants in this region – the native western soapberry tree, Sapindus saponaria var. drummondii (Hook & Arn.), and the non‐native goldenrain tree, Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm. We explore the possibility of host race formation on Ungnadia‐associated insects by testing for host‐associated differentiation in morphology and feeding behaviors. We find evidence of differentiation in the length of the mouth parts, which is an ecologically relevant feeding trait between host plant species with larger or smaller seed capsules. This divergence is maintained in the face of potential gene flow by reproductive isolation in the form of habitat isolation, which we detect in host preference trials. Together, our results demonstrate that soapberry bugs associated with this newly discovered host exhibit morphological and behavioral traits consistent with host race formation, but additional work is required to confirm its state along the speciation continuum.  aPublisher supplied data  a1802715cNational Science Foundation  cAmerican Museum of Natural History Teddy Roosevelt  cAmerican Philosophical Society Lewis and Clark Explore  cr 3aJadera haematoloma 3aKoelreuteria paniculata 3aSapindus saponaria var. drummondii 3aadaptive radiation 3achemistry 3adivergent evolution 3agene flow 3agranivores 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3amouth 3aphylogeny 3areproductive isolation 3atrees 3aChihuahuan Desert 3aNew Mexico 3aTexas1 aCarroll, Scott P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2094-93981 aEgan, Scott P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5208-18750 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2022 Jan., v. 170, no. 1 p.64-78dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.131183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245014100210300001600351520093600367592002801303650001701331650000901348650001001357650001501367650001601382650001301398653001601411653002401427653003401451653002301485653003501508653002201543700002201565700002101587773011201608856008201720852000901802655001201811IND60584170520221122231344.0190401e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058417052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2017.09.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Voet, Hilko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0802-738210aEquivalence testing using existing reference data: An example with genetically modified and conventional crops in animal feeding studies  ap. 472-485.  aAn equivalence testing method is described to assess the safety of regulated products using relevant data obtained in historical studies with assumedly safe reference products. The method is illustrated using data from a series of animal feeding studies with genetically modified and reference maize varieties. Several criteria for quantifying equivalence are discussed, and study-corrected distribution-wise equivalence is selected as being appropriate for the example case study. An equivalence test is proposed based on a high probability of declaring equivalence in a simplified situation, where there is no between-group variation, where the historical and current studies have the same residual variance, and where the current study is assumed to have a sample size as set by a regulator. The method makes use of generalized fiducial inference methods to integrate uncertainties from both the historical and the current data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acorn 3acrops 3atoxicology 3auncertainty 3avariance 0aFood safety 0aAverage equivalence 0aDistribution-wise equivalence 0aLinear mixed model 0aGeneralized fiducial inference 0aStatistical power1 aGoedhart, Paul W.1 aSchmidt, Kerstin0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 Nov., v. 109 p.472-485dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.09.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245017400160520141500334592002801749650002401777650002401801650001701825650002901842650002501871650003001896650001501926650001901941650001701960650002001977650001501997650001002012650001202022650001702034650003002051650002302081650001302104700002002117700002002137773012002157856007802277852000902355655001202364IND60757682520221120032316.0211125e20211029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075768252DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101126312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yu-Min 12aA Multiplex PCR Assay Combined with Capillary Electrophoresis for the Simultaneous Identification of Atlantic Cod, Pacific Cod, Blue Whiting, Haddock, and Alaska Pollock  aWith an increased consumption of seafood products, food fraud with fish resources has been continuously reported. In particular, codfish has been exploited worldwide as a processed product in fresh, frozen, smoked, canned, or ready-to-eat dish forms. However, it is challenging to identify processed fish products after processing because of their similar morphological characteristics. Substitution and mislabeling of codfish among different species are also happening deliberately or unintentionally. Thus, it is necessary to distinguish cod species to prevent fish adulteration and food fraud. In this study, we developed a multiplex PCR for simultaneously identifying five cod species within Gadidae using capillary electrophoresis. Then, their species-specific primer sets were designed by targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Subsequently, the amplicon sizes obtained were 237 bp, 204 bp, 164 bp, 138 bp, and 98 bp for Atlantic cod, Pacific cod, blue whiting, haddock, and Alaska pollock, respectively. The specificity of each primer was further tested using 19 fish species, and no cross-reactivity was observed. The limit of detection of this multiplex PCR assay was 1 pg. The developed multiplex PCR assay can be applied to 40 commercial food products successfully. This detection method will be efficient for managing seafood authentication by simultaneously analyzing multiple cod species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGadus chalcogrammus 3aGadus macrocephalus 3aGadus morhua 3aMicromesistius poutassou 3aadulterated products 3acapillary electrophoresis 3acod (fish) 3across reaction 3acytochrome b 3adetection limit 3afood fraud 3agenes 3ahaddock 3amitochondria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aready-to-eat foods 3aseafoods1 aLee, Shinyoung 1 aKim, Hae-Yeong 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 29, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101126313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007200139245013400211300001400345500002000359520197200379592002802351596007302379596008502452596007702537596007702614596007702691650001502768650001602783650001202799650001402811650001202825650001102837650002202848650003002870650001602900650001402916650001502930650001402945650002402959650001302983651001102996700006703007700007403074700006203148773013803210856007403348852000903422655001203431IND60759486820221119214747.0211212e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075948682DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.131192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeal, Camila Rabelo Oliveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8313-391110aHost specialization, genetic variability, and differentiation in three species of Tomoplagia from Brazilian rupestrian grasslands  ap. 32-47.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, the geographic and host plant‐associated genetic structure of Tomoplagia spp. (Diptera: Tephritidae) was investigated. The study was developed in the rupestrian montane grasslands of the Espinhaço Mountain Range, Brazil, where these flies’ larvae develop within flower heads of Asteraceae. The three species of Tomoplagia investigated have different host spans within the subtribe Vernoniinae: one is strictly monophagous (Tomoplagia grandis Prado, Norrbom & Lewinsohn) and two are oligophagous [Tomoplagia incompleta (Williston) and Tomoplagia bicolor Prado, Norrbom & Lewinsohn]. The genetic variability and differentiation throughout their geographic distribution were investigated at the local scale (sympatric, between different host species in the same locality) and the regional scale (allopatric, on the same or different host species in different localities). Allele richness was greater for populations of the two oligophagous species. Moreover, population genetic structure was low in all species both on the local and regional scales, and the attribution of individuals of the three species to different genetic groups was not strongly associated with either locality or host plant. These results indicate the absence of simple geographic and host‐associated genetic structure in these specialized herbivores, suggesting that females of T. bicolor and T. incompleta have low host philopatry, using various host species indiscriminately within their distribution range. Therefore, the use of host plants by fruit flies of the genus Tomoplagia is a plastic character that can shift temporally and spatially among phylogenetically related and chemically similar plants. Contrary to expectations, given the specialized and intimate nature of their host association, the studied Tomoplagia species showed no clear host‐associated genetic differentiation; instead, genetic variation presents a mosaic pattern across hosts and localities.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a311800/2015‐7cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a2012/16266‐7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2015/10236‐7cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2016/24821‐1cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aAsteraceae 3aTephritidae 3aalleles 3aallopatry 3aflowers 3afruits 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahost plants 3amountains 3aphilopatry 3aphylogeny 3apopulation genetics 3asympatry 3aBrazil1 aSouza, Anete Pereira de1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3831-98291 aSilva‐Brandão, Karina Lucas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6423-424X1 aLewinsohn, Thomas,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5950-53430 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2022 Jan., v. 170, no. 1 p.32-47dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.131193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245010400183300001600287520076300303592002801066650001801094650001901112650001501131650001801146650001901164650001201183650003301195650002601228650004601254650003301300650005301333650003701386700001601423700001601439700001901455700001901474700001801493700002001511700001601531773012601547856008101673852000901754655001201763IND60080815420221120163151.0151123e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008081542DNAL7 a250633702pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-014-1337-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Jaehwan10aEffects of Physiochemical Properties of Test Media on Nanoparticle Toxicity to Daphnia magna Straus  ap. 257-262.  aThe physicochemical property of standard test media significantly influenced the aggregation and dissolution of Ag, CuO and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) and the toxicity of the NPs to Daphnia magna. For all the NPs, the highest amount of metal ions was released from the ISO medium, whereas acute toxicity to D. magna was highest in the moderately hard water medium (EC₅₀ = 4.94, 980, and 1,950 μg L⁻¹ for Ag, CuO, and ZnO, respectively). By comparing EC₅₀ values based on the total and dissolved concentrations of NPs with those of metal salt solutions, we found that both particulate and dissolved fractions were likely responsible for the toxicity of Ag NPs, whereas the dissolved fraction mostly contributed to the toxicity of CuO and ZnO NPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aacute toxicity 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3awater hardness 2aAnimals 2aCopperxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aDaphniaxdrug effects 2aMetal Nanoparticlesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aSilverxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aZinc Oxidexchemistryxtoxicity.1 aKim, Soyoun1 aChoi, Seona1 aKwon, Dongwook1 aYoon, Tae-Hyun1 aKim, Woo-Keun1 aPark, June Woo,1 aJung, Jinho0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2014 Sept., v. 93, no. 3 p.257-262dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1337-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245009500211300002000306506007600326520120100402592002801603506003701631650002201668650001101690650001601701650001101717650001201728650001101740650002301751650001701774650001501791653001301806653002501819700001601844700002601860700001701886700001701903700002601920700002101946700002201967700002201989773017602011856007902187852000902266655001202275IND60172256920221207102010.0150602e20120904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017225692DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12099451092doi7 aPMC34378792pmcid7 a229082422pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButterfoss, Glenn L.13aDe novo structure prediction and experimental characterization of folded peptoid oligomers  ap. 14320-14325.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPeptoid molecules are biomimetic oligomers that can fold into unique three-dimensional structures. As part of an effort to advance computational design of folded oligomers, we present blind-structure predictions for three peptoid sequences using a combination of Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (REMD) simulation and Quantum Mechanical refinement. We correctly predicted the structure of a N -aryl peptoid trimer to within 0.2 Å rmsd-backbone and a cyclic peptoid nonamer to an accuracy of 1.0 Å rmsd-backbone. X-ray crystallographic structures are presented for a linear N -alkyl peptoid trimer and for the cyclic peptoid nonamer. The peptoid macrocycle structure features a combination of cis and trans backbone amides, significant nonplanarity of the amide bonds, and a unique “basket” arrangement of (S)- N (1-phenylethyl) side chains encompassing a bound ethanol molecule. REMD simulations of the peptoid trimers reveal that well folded peptoids can exhibit funnel-like conformational free energy landscapes similar to those for ordered polypeptides. These results indicate that physical modeling can successfully perform de novo structure prediction for small peptoid molecules.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamides 3abiomimetics 3aenergy 3aethanol 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apolypeptides 3aprediction 0afoldamer 0amolecular simulation1 aYoo, Barney1 aJaworski, Jonathan N.1 aChorny, Ilya1 aDill, Ken A.1 aZuckermann, Ronald N.1 aBonneau, Richard1 aKirshenbaum, Kent1 aVoelz, Vincent A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Sept. 4, v. 109, no. 36 p.14320-14325dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12099451093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008900162520192500251592002802176650001702204650001502221650002302236650002302259650001502282650001702297650003202314650001702346650001902363650001902382650001302401650001502414650001702429650001302446700002602459700001902485700002002504700002102524700002102545700002102566700002302587773012002610856007802730852000902808655001202817IND60757682720221120042611.0211125e20211029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075768272DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101126332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamri, Melisa 10aNanotechnology as a Processing and Packaging Tool to Improve Meat Quality and Safety  aNanoparticles are gaining momentum as a smart tool towards a safer, more cost-effective and sustainable food chain. This study aimed to provide an overview of the potential uses, preparation, properties, and applications of nanoparticles to process and preserve fresh meat and processed meat products. Nanoparticles can be used to reinforce the packaging material resulting in the improvement of sensory, functional, and nutritional aspects of meat and processed meat products. Further, these particles can be used in smart packaging as biosensors to extend the shelf-life of fresh and processed meat products and also to monitor the final quality of these products during the storage period. Nanoparticles are included in product formulation as carriers of health-beneficial and/or functional ingredients. They showed great efficiency in encapsulating bioactive ingredients and preserving their properties to ensure their functionality (e.g., antioxidant and antimicrobial) in meat products. As a result, nanoparticles can efficiently contribute to ensuring product safety and quality whilst reducing wastage and costs. Nevertheless, a wider implementation of nanotechnology in meat industry is highly related to its economic value, consumers’ acceptance, and the regulatory framework. Being a novel technology, concerns over the toxicity of nanoparticles are still controversial and therefore efficient analytical tools are deemed crucial for the identification and quantification of nanocomponents in meat products. Thus, migration studies about nanoparticles from the packaging into meat and meat products are still a concern as it has implications for human health associated with their toxicity. Moreover, focused economic evaluations for implementing nanoparticles in meat packaging are crucial since the current literature is still scarce and targeted studies are needed before further industrial applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abiosensors 3acost effectiveness 3aeconomic valuation 3afood chain 3ahuman health 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat quality 3aprocessed meat 3aproduct safety 3araw meat 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3atoxicity1 aBhattacharya, Tanima 1 aBoukid, Fatma 1 aChentir, Imene 1 aDib, Amira Leila1 aDas, Debashrita 1 aDjenane, Djamel 1 aGagaoua, Mohammed 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 29, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101126333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04176naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002300133024001700156024003600173024001200209040001800221100002000239245013200259300001600391506017300407506007600580506003100656520173000687596006902417596004502486506003702531650001102568650002002579650001602599650001402615650001302629650002402642650001702666650000902683650002202692650001102714650001902725650001802744650001402762700001802776700002302794700001802817700001902835700001402854700001802868700001902886700001702905773012902922856011403051856008303165956014603248956013803394961000903532852000903541655001203550IND60647120620221214224101.0190516e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064712062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2018.07.0302chorus7 a10113/64712062hdl7 a3545762aris7 a10.1016/j.jpba.2018.07.0302doi8 ans16475  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvula, Bharathi10aTargeted and non-targeted analysis of annonaceous alkaloids and acetogenins from Asimina and Annona species using UHPLC-QToF-MS  ap. 548-566.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aIn current work, targeted and non-targeted analysis of alkaloids and acetogenins from methanolic extracts of Asimina, Annona species and dietary supplements have been performed using UHPLC-QToF in positive ion mode. Thirty-five standard compounds (twelve alkaloids and twenty-three acetogenins) were used for the analysis. The fragment ions produced by collision induced dissociation (CID) revealed the characteristic cleavage and provided structural information. Aporphine alkaloids and acetogenins are the major groups found in Asimina and Annona species. An untargeted analysis based on high-resolution mass spectrometry was carried out to profile the alkaloids and acetogenins from Asimina species (As. triloba, As. parviflora). Magnoflorine, being a major alkaloid from twigs of As. triloba samples, was used as an example to discuss the fragmentation patterns. In (+)-ESI-MS, magnoflorine gave [M]+ ions at m/z 342.1705. The fragment ions at m/z 297.1127 [M-(CH3)2NH]+, 282.0886 [M-(CH3)3NH]+, 265.0865 [M-(CH3)2NH-CH3OH]+, 237.0916 [M-(CH3)2NH-CH3OH-CO]+, and 222.0681 [M-(CH3)2NH-CH3OH-CO-CH3]+ resulted from the [M]+ molecular ion. One dietary supplement claiming to contain paw paw (As. triloba) was also analyzed and showed a similar profile to twigs of As. triloba. A total of 131 compounds including standard compounds were identified from the different parts of As. triloba and As. parviflora samples. These compounds can be used to distinguish Asimina species. However, for definite identification of these unknown components, further investigation is required. This may provide a model for the rapid screening and structural characterization of bioactive constituents from plant extracts in a single analysis.  cFood and Drug Administrationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009210  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnnona 3aAsimina triloba 3aacetogenins 3aalkaloids 3abranches 3adietary supplements 3adissociation 3aions 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3aplant extracts 3arapid methods 3ascreening1 aBae, Ji-Yeong1 aMajrashi, Taghreed1 aWu, Tung-Ying1 aWang, Yan-Hong1 aWang, Mei1 aAli, Zulfiqar1 aWu, Yang-Chang1 aKhan, Ikhlas0 tJournal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis.g2018 Sept., v. 159 p.548-566dElsevier BVwJournal:6253x0731-70857nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64712063Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2018.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/354576%20-%20Avula%20-%20Targeted%20and%20non%20targeted%20analysis.pdf  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Targeted%20and%20non-targeted%20Analysis%20of%20annonaceous.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245010100170520098600271592002801257650002301285650002401308650002501332650001501357650001801372650001301390650002001403650001801423650002501441700001601466700002501482773012001507856007801627852000901705655001201714IND60757682820221120042548.0211125e20211030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075768282DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101126342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJędrejko, Karol Jerzy10aCordyceps militaris: An Overview of Its Chemical Constituents in Relation to Biological Activity  aCordyceps spp. mushrooms have a long tradition of use as a natural raw material in Asian ethnomedicine because of their adaptogenic, tonic effects and their ability to reduce fatigue and stimulate the immune system in humans.

Depending on length of the inserted carbon chains, the acylation resulted in possible formation of mono-grafted (isolated chains) and bi-grafted (chemical gels) structures. The structural features of obtained derivatives were investigated using FTIR spectroscopy, confirming the successful synthesis. The concentrated aqueous solutions of modified pectin showed interesting rheological properties, having lower values of apparent viscosity compared to neat pectin. Since the GPC analysis indicated that no degradation occurred, the viscosity decrease was explained by more heterogeneous organization within modified pectin solutions (microparticles together with sticky polymer entanglement). A shift in particle size distribution proved that proposed modifications also affected pectin solution properties in diluted regime. The modified samples turned to be more sensible to thermal degradation than neat pectin, whereby the increasing size of flexible acyl chains attached to a polymer backbone reduced the glass transition temperature. The hydrophobicity of obtained derivatives was evaluated by sessile drop and du Nouy ring methods. It was found that acylation enhanced hydrophobicity of the pectin molecule, while hydrophobically associative character turned to be inconsistent in aqueous and non-aqueous environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacylation 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon 3achlorides 3agels 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrophobicity 3amicroparticles 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aparticle size distribution 3apectins 3apolymers 3athermal degradation 3aviscosity 0aPectin esterification 0aHydrophobicity 0aSurface tension1 aSpasojević, Pavle1 aPanić, Vesna1 aDobrzyńska-Mizera, Monika1 aImmirzi, Barbara1 aStevanovic, Jasmina,1 aPopović, Ivanka0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 July 01, v. 113 p.924-932dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01309naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012600162300001800288520034900306592002800655650001600683650002300699650001300722650000900735650001100744650001100755650002400766773013400790856007400924852000900998655001201007IND60660897420221122100923.0190827e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066089742DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc00813a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlberto, Marta E.12aA trispyrazolylborato iron cysteinato complex efficiently mimics the cysteine dioxygenation process: mechanistic insights  ap. 8369-8372.  aThe O₂ activation process by a CDO biomimetic system has been herein investigated to gain mechanistic details on the unknown reaction mechanism.

Although the abundance and population status of some subpopulations are improving, their recovery could be compromised if inadequate advice are given rooted in poor data on basic aspects of their ecology, such as the location of feeding grounds. In this study, we combine historical whaling data with key environmental features known to be important for Balaenids to predict the offshore distribution of SRWs throughout the Southern Hemisphere using monthly Ensemble Distribution Models. We found that the location of potential feeding grounds of SRWs changes from mid-latitude shelf and oceanic waters in September towards higher latitude waters in December, a situation that holds throughout the summer. In March and April, suitable feeding grounds reach their minimum geographic coverage, being mostly restricted to areas near calving grounds. We also provide evidence that highly suitable areas of SRWs overlap with the Subtropical Frontal Zone and the Polar Front, so these frontal systems stand as important potential feeding grounds for SRWs from late spring to early fall at circumpolar scale. Improved identification of offshore feeding areas of SRWs will require more efforts to directly observe vast areas of the open ocean and to track individuals from calving to feeding grounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEubalaena australis 3aautumn 3acalving 3aecology 3alatitude 3amodels 3aspring 3asummer 0aSouthern Hemisphere 0aEubalaena australis 0aSubtropical Front 0aPolar Front 0aSpecies distribution modelling 0aWhaling1 aPiola, Alberto1 aO'Brien, Todd D.1 aTormosov, Dmitriy D.1 aAcha, E.

Lead concentrations (mean 900 μg kg⁻¹) for M. cephalus were found to be higher than the maximum allowances concentration (MAC) of 300 μg kg⁻¹. Similarly, Cr (mean 410 μg kg⁻¹), Ni (mean 331 μg kg⁻¹) and Cu (mean 834 μg kg⁻¹) concentrations in M. cephalus were significantly higher than in M. barbatus (mean 341 μg Cr kg⁻¹, 256 μg Ni kg⁻¹ and 568 μg Cu kg⁻¹). Although concentrations of some metals exceed the limits set by the authorities, the estimated non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks by the Target Hazard Quotient and target carcinogenic risk indicate that there is no carcinogenic risk for humans, and the risk of developing cancer over a human lifetime is between 2 and 12 in 1,000,000.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMugil cephalus 3aMullus barbatus 3acarcinogenicity 3achildren 3achromium 3acities 3acopper 3afish 3ahumans 3anickel 3arisk 3arisk characterization 3aseasonal variation 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aChild 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aPerciformes 2aRegression Analysis 2aRisk Assessment 2aSeasons 2aSmegmamorpha 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxadverse effectsxanalysis. 0aTurkey1 aKaraaslan, Nagihan M.1 aYaman, Ibrahim H.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2014 Sept., v. 93, no. 3 p.344-349dSpringer USx0007-48617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-014-1342-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03995naa a2200889 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009700174300001600271520167500287592002801962650002301990650001802013650002202031650002402053650001102077650002002088650001402108650001602122650001702138650002902155650002502184650003002209650001902239650001502258650001902273650002902292650000902321650002602330650001402356650001202370650001302382650001702395650001602412650002502428653001102453653002502464653002302489653000802512653002402520653001702544653000702561653000702568653000802575653000902583653001402592653000902606653000802615653000702623653000802630653000902638653000902647653000802656653000802664653000902672653000902681653000702690653000802697653000802705653000802713653000702721653000802728653000802736700002202744700002202766700006302788700002202851700001802873773010602891856008702997852000903084655001203093IND60536214820221116141653.0190410e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053621482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFantin, Valentina10aEnvironmental assessment of electricity generation from an Italian anaerobic digestion plant  ap. 422-435.  aA standard ISO Life Cycle Assessment study was carried out to evaluate the environmental sustainability of electricity production from an anaerobic digestion (AD) plant using a mixture of dedicated energy crops, agricultural residues and livestock effluents as input materials. The functional unit was 1 MJ of electricity. System boundaries were from cradle to grave and covered all the phases from energy crops cultivation to the production of biogas and its use in a Combined Heat and Power plant to produce electricity. Liquid and solid digestate storage and spreading on agricultural land were included. Primary data were collected from the AD plant for all the above phases. Since heat produced is used only internally, no allocation was applied in the study. As regards digestate management, CH4 emissions were calculated from literature, whereas four literature methods were applied for calculation of nitrogen emissions with the goal to perform a sensitivity analysis on LCA results. ILCD Handbook impact assessment methodologies were used. Results show that the main hotspots are energy crops cultivation and the management of digestate, mainly because of both nitrogen and methane emissions, affecting Global Warming, Acidification, Marine and Freshwater Eutrophication. Finally, a detailed Monte Carlo analysis, was carried out to evaluate the results uncertainty. The study represents the state of the art about the environmental performance of the AD plant with the use of sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, which both improve the reliability of results, and allows drawing general conclusions on how to mitigate the environmental impacts of AD process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aacidification 3aagricultural land 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiogas 3adata collection 3aeffluents 3aelectricity 3aenergy crops 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3alife cycle assessment 3alivestock 3amethane 3anitrogen 3apower plants 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aBiogas 0aDigestate management 0aNitrogen emissions 0aLCA 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aEnergy crops 0aAC 0aAD 0aCHP 0aELCD 0aEMEP/ EEA 0aF-EU 0aGHG 0aGW 0aHRT 0aILCD 0aIPCC 0aISO 0aLCA 0aM-EU 0aMFRD 0aOD 0aOLR 0aPOF 0aTAN 0aTS 0aTVS 0aVOC1 aGiuliano, Antonio1 aManfredi, Michele1 aOttaviano, Giuseppe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1191-82581 aStefanova, Milena1 aMasoni, Paolo0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Dec., v. 83 p.422-435dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001600158245008600174300001600260520163600276592002801912650002601940650001501966650001601981650001801997650001802015650002102033650001202054650001802066650001302084650001402097650001602111650001702127650002702144653002602171653002702197653002602224653001402250700001302264700001702277700001902294700001502313773010202328856009302430852000902523655001202532IND60647120920221117093632.0190712e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064712092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.06.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, K.10aProgesterone signaling during pregnancy in the lab opossum, Monodelphis domestica  ap. 101-110.  aTo investigate subtle pregnancy-associated changes in the lab opossum, Monodelphis domestica, an induced ovulator, we compared pregnant with non-pregnant and pseudopregnant animals with regard to serum P4 levels and progesterone receptor (PR) expression. Using video-verified, time-mated lab opossums as sources of biological material, we compared ovaries, uteri and sera obtained on odd-numbered days of the 14.5-day pregnancy in this animal. Females that mated successfully but did not produce embryos were classified as pseudopregnant. P4 levels differed significantly between pregnant (N = 21) and either non-pregnant (N = 3) or pseudopregnant (N = 3) opossums, but not between the non-pregnant and pseudopregnant groups. A significant decline in serum P4 occurred between pregnancy days 3 and 5, coinciding with an elevated probability of pregnancy failure between days 5 and 9. PR was detected in the nuclei of uterine-gland epithelial cells on pregnancy days 5 and 7 as well as variably in the corpora lutea (CL) of animals on pregnancy days 3–11. PR expression in the CL suggests that P4 may be autostimulatory in lab opossums and that certain levels of this steroid are required during normal pregnancy. The significant day-3 drop in P4 may explain why pregnancy failure in this polyovular metatherian is likeliest to occur between days 5 and 9, an interval during which the extended period of blastocyst morphogenesis and expansion occurs. Taken together, these results suggest that P4 may have unrecognized signaling roles not only in pregnancy but perhaps embryonic development as well in the lab opossum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonodelphis domestica 3ablastocyst 3ablood serum 3acorpus luteum 3aembryogenesis 3aepithelial cells 3afemales 3amorphogenesis 3aopossums 3apregnancy 3aprobability 3aprogesterone 3aprogesterone receptors 0aMonodelphis domestica 0aProgesterone signaling 0aProgesterone receptor 0aPregnancy1 aLine, J.1 aGriffith, K.1 aWooldredge, A.1 aCruz, Y.P.0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 136 p.101-110dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.06.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245011400204300002000318506007600338520085300414592002801267506003701295650002301332650001201355650001801367650000901385650001701394653004401411653002501455653003201480653003601512653003801548700001901586700001901605700001801624700002301642773017601665856007901841852000901920655001201929IND60172257520221207103603.0150602e20120904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017225752DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12126931092doi7 aPMC34378912pmcid7 a229082382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrnec, Martin10aπ-Frontier molecular orbitals in S = 2 ferryl species and elucidation of their contributions to reactivity  ap. 14326-14331.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aS = 2 Fe ᴵⱽ═O species are key intermediates in the catalysis of most nonheme iron enzymes.

The two most important isotopes of plutonium, 239Pu and 240Pu, in the surface soil from the coastal area of China were determined using radiochemical separation combined with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) measurement. The average of the measured 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratios in all these samples is 0.186 ± 0.021, which is in good agreement with the ratio of global fallout of the nuclear weapons tests. This indicates that the major source of plutonium in this region is global fallout, and there is no measurable release of plutonium from any nuclear power plant along the coast of China. The 239,240Pu concentrations in all 71 soil samples range from 0.002 mBq/g to 0.670 mBq/g, which fall in the range of the reported values in the background area not directly influenced by nuclear activities. The anthropogenic disturbance of sampling sites, vegetation coverage of land, precipitation rate and organic substance content and erosion of soil have significant influence on the level of plutonium in the surface soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acoasts 3aenvironmental impact 3aisotopes 3anuclear power 3aorganic matter 3aplutonium 3apower plants 3aradionuclides 3asoil 3asoil erosion 3asoil sampling 3atoxicity 3avegetation 3aChina 0aPlutonium isotopes 0aSource term of plutonium 0aSpatial distribution 0aEnvironmental impact 0aCoastal areas of China1 aHou, Xiaolin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4851-48580 tChemosphere.g2019 Sept., v. 230 p.587-595dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245007500162300001800237520107400255592002801329650002401357650001101381650001901392650002001411650001801431650002301449650001101472650001101483650001501494650000901509650001101518651002001529700001401549773011901563856008101682852000901763655001201772IND60438779720221120134336.0151023e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043877972DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-015-4354-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Qiong10aAutomatic detection of oceanic mesoscale eddies in the South China Sea  ap. 1334-1348.  aThis study focuses on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of mesoscale eddies in the South China Sea (SCS). An automatic eddy detection method, based on the geometry of velocity vectors, was adopted to obtain an eddy dataset from 21 years of satellite altimeter data. Analysis revealed that the number of anticyclonic eddies was nearly equal to cyclonic eddies; in the SCS, cyclonic eddies are generally stronger than anticyclonic eddies and anticyclonic eddies are larger and longer-lived than cyclonic eddies. Anticyclonic eddies tend to survive longer in the spring and summer, while cyclonic eddies have longer lifetimes in the autumn and winter. The characteristics and seasonal variations of eddies in the SCS are strongly related to variations in general ocean circulation, in the homogeneity of surface wind stress, and in the unevenness of bottom topography in the SCS. The spatial and temporal variation of mesoscale eddies in the SCS could, therefore, be an important index for understanding local hydrodynamics and regional climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomatic detection 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ahydrodynamics 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3atopography 3awind 3awinter 3aSouth China Sea1 aShen, Hui0 tChinese journal of oceanology and limnology.g2015 Sept., v. 33, no. 5 p.1334-1348dScience Pressx0254-40597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-015-4354-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016500170300001600335520134000351592002801691650002201719650002301741650002501764650002001789650002401809650001301833650002001846650001601866650002001882650001601902650002201918653001301940653001501953653001401968653001401982653002901996700005702025700002302082773013102105856008702236852000902323655001202332IND60591716320221120113803.0190131e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSattar, Hafsa10aAgar-agar immobilization: An alternative approach for the entrapment of protease to improve the catalytic efficiency, thermal stability and recycling efficiency  ap. 917-922.  aThe catalytic performance of an immobilized enzyme could be enhanced by using entrapment technique. In this contemporary study agar-agar, a natural polysaccharide, is subjected to entrap serine-protease produced by Aspergillus niger KIBGE-IB36. The results revealed that maximum enzymatic activity was attained when 3.0% agar-agar was used. It was observed that in case of both free and entrapped forms the enzyme was stable at pH-5.0. While, an increment in reaction temperature and time was noticed from 50 to 55 °C and 15.0 to 20.0 min, respectively. Km value increased from 1.883 mM to 2.399 mM and Vmax value decreased from 1753 U mg−1 to 1372 U mg−1 after agar-agar entrapment of protease as compared to soluble enzyme. Additionally, entrapped protease within the polymer exhibited significant increase in the thermal stability at various temperatures and retained approximately 68.0% of its residual activity at 60 °C. However, at this extreme temperature the soluble protease lost its catalytic performance. Storage stability considerably improved as entrapped protease revealed enzymatic activity up to 30 days as compared to soluble enzyme. Recycling efficiency was calculated up to eight cycles which is an exceptional characteristic for economic feasibility and continuous reusability of protease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3acatalytic activity 3aeconomic feasibility 3aenzyme activity 3aimmobilized enzymes 3apolymers 3apolysaccharides 3aproteinases 3astorage quality 3atemperature 3athermal stability 0aProtease 0aEntrapment 0aAgar-agar 0aStability 0aReutilization efficiency1 aAman, Afsheen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3557-02441 aQader, Shah Ali Ul0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.917-922dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011800167300001600285520139500301592002801696650002501724650001201749650001101761650001701772650001601789650002201805650001301827650001101840700002201851700003401873700002001907700002201927700002201949773009401971856008102065852000902146655001202155IND60080815920221120153728.0140811e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008081592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-014-0245-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafavian, Darya10aHigh humidity partially rescues the Arabidopsis thaliana exo70A1 stigmatic defect for accepting compatible pollen  ap. 121-127.  aWe have previously proposed that Exo70A1 is required in the Brassicaceae stigma to control the early stages of pollen hydration and pollen tube penetration through the stigmatic surface, following compatible pollination. However, recent work has raised questions regarding Arabidopsis thaliana Exo70A1’s expression in the stigma and its role in stigma receptivity to compatible pollen. Here, we verified the expression of Exo70A1 in stigmas from three Brassicaceae species and carefully re-examined Exo70A1’s function in the stigmatic papillae. With previous studies showing that high relative humidity can rescue some pollination defects, essentially bypassing the control of pollen hydration by the Brassicaceae dry stigma, the effect of high humidity was investigated on pollinations with the Arabidopsis exo70A1-1 mutant. Pollinations under low relative humidity resulted in a complete failure of wild-type compatible pollen acceptance by the exo70A1-1 mutant stigma as we had previously seen. However, high relative humidity resulted in a partial rescue of the exo70A1-1 stigmatic papillar defect resulting is some wild-type compatible pollen acceptance and seed set. Thus, these results reaffirmed Exo70A1’s proposed role in the stigma regulating compatible pollen hydration and pollen tube entry and demonstrate that high relative humidity can partially bypass these functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apollination 3arelative humidity 3aseed set 3astigma1 aJamshed, Muhammad1 aSankaranarayanan, Subramanian1 aIndriolo, Emily1 aSamuel, Marcus A.1 aGoring, Daphne R.0 tPlant reproduction.g2014 Sept., v. 27, no. 3 p.121-127dSpringer-Verlagx2194-79537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-014-0245-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245016000153300001600313500001900329520148700348592002801835650002501863650001401888650001401902650001601916650001801932650003301950650001201983650001901995650001002014650002202024650000902046650001402055650001202069650001602081650001902097650003002116650001102146653001102157653001402168653001002182700001902192700001802211700001502229700001702244700001102261700001702272773012902289856007102418852000902489655001202498IND60736226420221119132818.0210506s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073622642DNAL7 a10.1071/RD202872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Haiming10aFlutamide induces uterus and ovary damage in the mouse via apoptosis and excessive autophagy of cells following triggering of the unfolded protein response  ap. 466-475.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntrauterine exposure to flutamide not only causes abnormal development of the reproductive organs in male offspring, but also damages ovaries and uteri. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is believed to play an important role in embryo development and teratogenic processes. In the present study, pregnant mice were administered either flutamide (300mg kg−1 day−1, p.o.) on an equivalent volume of soybean oil (control) on Days 12–18 of gestation. Eight weeks after birth, female offspring in the flutamide-treated group had a lower bodyweight and lower ovarian and uterine weights, but there was no significant difference in uterine and ovarian weights normalised by bodyweight between the flutamide-treated and control groups. Furthermore, histopathological changes were observed in all uteri and ovaries in the flutamide-treated group, with fewer and less-developed follicles in the ovaries. In both the uteri and ovaries, flutamide increased the expression of UPR members, although the expression of cell cycle-related genes remained unchanged compared with the control group. Flutamide increased the expression of all autophagy- and apoptosis-related genes evaluated in the uterus, as well as some in the ovary. The results suggest that the in utero exposure of mice to flutamide may contribute to uterine and ovarian damage in the offspring, with endoplasmic reticulum stress possibly triggered by the UPR leading to the induction of excessive autophagy and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3abody weight 3aembryogenesis 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3afemales 3ahistopathology 3amales 3amaternal exposure 3amice 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3asoybean oil 3ateratogenicity 3aunfolded protein response 3auterus 0adamage 0aflutamide 0aovary1 aZhou, Xiaoqing1 aZhang, Yujing1 aWen, Kexin1 aYan, Zhengli1 aFu, Hu1 aZhu, Yongfei0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2021, v. 33, no. 7 p.466-475dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl47095x1031-36137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD202873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012000168500002200288520149900310592002801809650001401837650001101851650002001862650001501882650001601897650001301913653002901926653003101955653002901986653002302015653002802038653002502066700005802091700001402149773008202163856008702245852000902332655001202341IND60656128720221119073437.0190809e20190802xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065612872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1136832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hangxin10aRobust optimal design of zero/low energy buildings considering uncertainties and the impacts of objective functions  aPre-press version  aRobust design optimization has received great attentions in aerospace/structural engineering fields for few decades. Recently, a few studies have been conducted on robust design optimization in building energy field mostly by directly adopting the objective functions used in these fields. However, the applicability of these objective functions have not been analyzed when applied for buildings while some researcher even questioned this fundamental issue. Furthermore, very few study is concerned with robust design optimization of building envelopes for zero/low energy buildings. In this study, the applicability of commonly-used objective functions for robust design optimization of buildings is analyzed and compared. The robust optimal design for envelopes of zero/low energy buildings in subtropical regions is studied. Major uncertain design inputs, which have significant effects on building performance in subtropical regions, are identified. An artificial neural network model is used for building performance evaluation to reduce computational time. Results show that it is necessary to consider uncertainties for zero/low energy building design as they have significant impacts. The commonly-used objective functions in pioneer fields are not suitable if applied in building energy field directly without proper revision. Revisions to objective functions, particularly the involvement of variance of performance indicator, are proposed for robust design optimization of buildings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3aenergy 3aneural networks 3asubtropics 3auncertainty 3avariance 0azero/low energy building 0arobust design optimization 0auncertainty-based design 0aobjective function 0avariance of performance 0auncertainty analysis1 aWang, Shengwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9684-590X1 aTang, Rui0 tApplied energy.g2019 Aug. 02, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.1136833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245010800168520128700276592002801563650001901591650001801610650002001628650001201648650001401660650001701674651001101691700002901702700002401731700002301755773012001778856007801898852000901976655001201985IND60757683520221120024254.0211125e20211031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075768352DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101126402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiatrowski, Michał 13aAn Evaluation of the Hygiene Practices of Polish Street Food Vendors in Selected Food Trucks and Stands  aToday, street food vending is becoming a dynamically developing food industry in Europe, including Poland. Lifestyle changes and socioeconomic factors, especially among young consumers, make it a convenient food alternative, even in countries without this tradition. The aim of the study was to evaluate hygiene conditions and practices in selected street food facilities in Poland. The study was carried out in accordance with an observation checklist developed on the basis of the hygienic requirements of the European Union. The study covered 550 randomly selected street food vendors in Poland in 10 cities. The hygiene of street food outlets was assessed in three aspects: ensuring proper production conditions, hygiene of production and distribution, and hygiene of personnel. The evaluation of street food outlets showed that the level of hygiene was not fully acceptable. A small percentage of the examined objects satisfactorily fulfilled the requirements of the production conditions, production and distribution hygiene, and staff hygiene. The proposed hygienic checklist for quick daily monitoring of street food outlets can be used to perform internal and external inspections. It seems that specific codes of conduct for European street foods facilities are necessary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3afood industry 3ahuman resources 3ahygiene 3alifestyle 3astreet foods 3aPoland1 aCzarniecka-Skubina, Ewa 1 aTrafiałek, Joanna 1 aRosiak, Elżbieta 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 31, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101126403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245017500199300001600374500002000390520163000410592002802040650002802068650000802096650001702104650001702121650001302138650002502151650001402176650001102190773010702201856007402308852000902382655001202391IND60759487720221119213056.0211212e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075948772DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.130052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPäckert, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5045-013910aFree access of published DNA sequences facilitates regular control of (meta‐) data quality – an example from shorebird mitogenomes (Aves, Charadriiformes: Charadrius)  ap. 336-342.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOnline repositories of DNA sequences are a rich and indispensable source of comparative data for biodiversity research and taxonomic studies. Despite increasingly high data quality of published sequences and associated metadata, particular attention should be paid to taxonomic assignment of DNA sequences, in particular if voucher specimens are not available or cannot be examined. In this study, two nearly identical mitogenomes of two distinctive plover species (Charadrius alexandrinus and Charadrius placidus) were re‐analysed and compared with a comprehensive dataset of DNA‐barcode sequences (cytochrome‐oxidase subunit 1, COI) for 55 shorebird species. Phylogenetic analysis separated the two plover species into two reciprocally monophyletic clades that differed by mean p‐distances of 11.5–14.7%; however, the COI sequence from the C. placidus mitogenome was nested in the Kentish Plover clade (C. alexandrinus). A similar mismatch was found for another DNA‐barcode sequence from a Charadrius mongolus mitogenome that clustered with one of two clades of Charadrius leschenaultii in the COI tree. These results strongly suggest that, to date, two of seven mitogenomes published for Charadriidae are not representative of the taxon names to which the respective GenBank entries were assigned. Only a few DNA‐barcode sequences were associated with outdated taxonomy, while others were suspected to be chimeric sequences. Thus, free access to digital sequence information is a key factor for steady improvement of data quality in online repositories via swarm intelligence of the scientific community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharadrius alexandrinus 3aDNA 3abiodiversity 3adata quality 3ametadata 3amitochondrial genome 3amonophyly 3aswarms0 tIbis.g2022 Jan., v. 164, no. 1 p.336-342dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.130053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010600171300001800277520121700295592002801512650002101540650004401561650002601605650001601631650001501647650001501662650002901677650002201706650001301728650002701741650001301768650000901781650000901790650002101799650002101820650001901841650001801860650003301878650002101911650001901932653001301951653001801964653002301982653002202005773013302027856008702160852000902247655001202256IND60591716520221120113842.0190131e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnwar, Yāsir,10aAntibacterial and lead ions adsorption characteristics of chitosan-manganese dioxide bionanocomposite  ap. 1140-1145.  aIn the current study, a facile and an eco-friendly manganese oxide nanoparticles dispersed in chitosan (CS-MnO2) nanocomposite was synthesized. A chemical precipitation method was used for the product synthesis. The product characterization was performed using various spectroscopic techniques such as X-ray scattering, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and zeta potential which confirmed its successful formation. The CS-MnO2 nanocomposite was evaluated in the Pb2+ ions adsorption from it aqueous solution. The CS-MnO2 showed an approvable accomplishment for the removal of Pb2+ ions and evidence was provided from the adsorption experiments. The efficiency of adsorbent did not change much even after 5 cycles of reuse. Therefore, CS-MnO2 would serve as promising adsorbent. Additionally, the CS-MnO2 nanocomposite showed low to moderate antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus by inhibiting nearly 50% of the bacterial growth. Colony forming units method was used in the antibacterial studies which showed that the bio-nanocomposite had moderate antibacterial activity against the stated strains of bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-radiation 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aaqueous solutions 3abacteria 3achemical precipitation 3achitosan 3aions 3alead 3amanganese oxides 3amicrobial growth 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3azeta potential 0aChitosan 0aAntibacterial 0aMnO2 nanoparticles 0aBio-nanocomposite0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 May, v. 111 p.1140-1145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.01.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03305naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245013900208300002000347506007600367520165100443592002802094506003702122650002102159650001002180650002102190650002102211650000902232650001002241650002902251650001102280650001202291650001302303650001402316650001402330650002402344700002302368700002302391700001802414700001702432700001702449700001702466700002102483700001902504773017602523856007902699852000902778655001202787IND60172258020221207103516.0150602e20120904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017225802DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11164811092doi7 aPMC34378292pmcid7 a229124012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrario, Juan E.10aAxon guidance in the developing ocular motor system and Duane retraction syndrome depends on Semaphorin signaling via alpha2-chimaerin  ap. 14669-14674.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEye movements depend on correct patterns of connectivity between cranial motor axons and the extraocular muscles. Despite the clinical importance of the ocular motor system, little is known of the molecular mechanisms underlying its development. We have recently shown that mutations in the Chimaerin-1 gene encoding the signaling protein α2-chimaerin (α2-chn) perturb axon guidance in the ocular motor system and lead to the human eye movement disorder, Duane retraction syndrome (DRS). The axon guidance cues that lie upstream of α2-chn are unknown; here we identify candidates to be the Semaphorins (Sema) 3A and 3C, acting via the PlexinA receptors. Sema3A/C are expressed in and around the developing extraocular muscles and cause growth cone collapse of oculomotor neurons in vitro. Furthermore, RNAi knockdown of α2-chn or PlexinAs in oculomotor neurons abrogates Sema3A/C-dependent growth cone collapse. In vivo knockdown of endogenous PlexinAs or α2-chn function results in stereotypical oculomotor axon guidance defects, which are reminiscent of DRS, whereas expression of α2-chn gain-of-function constructs can rescue PlexinA loss of function. These data suggest that α2-chn mediates Sema3–PlexinA repellent signaling. We further show that α2-chn is required for oculomotor neurons to respond to CXCL12 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which are growth promoting and chemoattractant during oculomotor axon guidance. α2-chn is therefore a potential integrator of different types of guidance information to orchestrate ocular motor pathfinding. DRS phenotypes can result from incorrect regulation of this signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3aaxons 3achemoattractants 3achemokine CXCL12 3aeyes 3agenes 3ahepatocyte growth factor 3ahumans 3amuscles 3amutation 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3asignal transduction1 aBaskaran, Pranetha1 aClark, Christopher1 aHendry, Aenea1 aLerner, Oleg1 aHintze, Mark1 aAllen, James1 aChilton, John K.1 aGuthrie, Sarah0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Sept. 4, v. 109, no. 36 p.14669-14674dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11164811093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012100169300001400290520191800304592002802222650001402250650001502264650001602279650001002295650001802305650004302323650001502366650001802381650001302399650001702412650001502429650001902444650001702463650001302480650001102493773009402504856008402598852000902682655001202691IND60113124120221120144502.0141111e20131025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011312412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJandera, Pavel10aAdvances in the development of organic polymer monolithic columns and their applications in food analysis—A review  ap. 37-53.  aMonolithic continuous separation media are gradually finding their way to sample pre-treatment, isolation, enrichment and final analytical separations of a plethora of compounds, occurring as food components, additives or contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, pesticides and toxins, which have traditionally been the domain of particulate chromatographic materials. In the present review, recent advances in the technology of monolithic columns and the applications in food analysis are addressed. Silica-based monoliths are excellent substitutes to conventional particle-packed columns, improving the speed of analysis for low-molecular weight compounds, due to their excellent efficiency and high permeability. These properties have been recently appreciated in two-dimensional HPLC, where the performance in the second dimension is of crucial importance. Organic-polymer monoliths in various formats provide excellent separations of biopolymers. Thin monolithic disks or rod columns are widely employed in isolation, purification and pre-treatment of sample containing proteins, peptides or nucleic acid fragments. Monolithic capillaries were originally intended for use in electrochromatography, but are becoming more frequently used for capillary and micro-HPLC. Monoliths are ideal highly porous support media for immobilization or imprinting template molecules, to provide sorbents for shape-selective isolation of target molecules from various matrices occurring in food analysis. The separation efficiency of organic polymer monoliths for small molecules can be significantly improved by optimization of polymerization approach, or by post-polymerization modification. This will enable full utilization of a large variety of available monomers to prepare monoliths with chemistry matching the needs of selectivity of separations of various food samples containing even very polar or ionized compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aadsorbents 3abiopolymers 3adrugs 3afood analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionization 3anucleic acids 3apeptides 3apermeability 3apesticides 3apolymerization 3apretreatment 3aproteins 3atoxins0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Oct. 25, v. 1313 p.37-53dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2013.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245019000163520135200353592002801705650002401733650000801757650002201765650000901787650002501796650004301821650001301864650002301877650001201900651001201912651001201924651001601936700002001952700002001972700002001992700002102012700002602033700002302059773012002082856007802202852000902280655001202289IND60757684020221120024307.0211125e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075768402DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101126452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDruml, Barbara 10aReal-Time PCR Assay for the Detection and Quantification of Roe Deer to Detect Food Adulteration—Interlaboratory Validation Involving Laboratories in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland  aGame meat products are particularly prone to be adulterated by replacing game meat with cheaper meat species. Recently, we have presented a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the identification and quantification of roe deer in food. Quantification of the roe deer content in % (w/w) was achieved relatively by subjecting the DNA isolates to a reference real-time PCR assay in addition to the real-time PCR assay for roe deer. Aiming at harmonizing analytical methods for food authentication across EU Member States, the real-time PCR assay for roe deer has been tested in an interlaboratory ring trial including 14 laboratories from Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Participating laboratories obtained aliquots of DNA isolates from a meat mixture containing 24.8% (w/w) roe deer in pork, roe deer meat, and 12 meat samples whose roe deer content was not disclosed. Performance characteristics included amplification efficiency, level of detection (LOD₉₅%), repeatability, reproducibility, and accuracy of quantitative results. With a relative reproducibility standard deviation ranging from 13.35 to 25.08% (after outlier removal) and recoveries ranging from 84.4 to 114.3%, the real-time PCR assay was found to be applicable for the detection and quantification of roe deer in raw meat samples to detect food adulteration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapreolus capreolus 3aDNA 3aadulterated foods 3apork 3aproduct authenticity 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3araw meat 3astandard deviation 3avenison 3aAustria 3aGermany 3aSwitzerland1 aUhlig, Steffen 1 aSimon, Kirsten 1 aFrost, Kirstin 1 aHettwer, Karina 1 aCichna-Markl, Margit 1 aHochegger, Rupert 0 tFoods.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101126453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100001500172245009900187300001600286520095600302592002801258650001201286650001401298650001901312650002901331650003101360650003401391650004001425650003501465650002401500650004101524650005901565651001001624651001501634651001001649700002001659700001801679700001701697700001801714700002001732700001801752700001501770773008201785856008901867852000901956655001201965IND4466423720221122155425.0141110e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446642372DNAL7 a213763632pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zhen10aLevels and distribution of Dechlorane Plus in coastal sediments of the Yellow Sea, North China  ap. 984-990.  aDechlorane Plus (DP) has been determined in surface sediments from three Chinese coastal bays, e.g. Jiaozhou, Sishili and Taozi Bay in North China. DP concentrations ranged from <1.2 to 187pgg⁻¹ dry weight (dw) (mean: 24.7pgg⁻¹dw) in Jiaozhou Bay, <1.2 to 135pgg⁻¹dw (mean 69.9pgg⁻¹dw) in Sishili Bay and <1.2 to 66.7pgg⁻¹dw (mean: 40.4pgg⁻¹dw) in Taozi Bay, respectively. Additionally, two dechlorinated species were quantified, which accounted for 0.6–5.1% of the ∑DP concentration. The fₛyₙ values (syn-isomer/(syn-+anti-isomer)) in sediments from Jiaozhou Bay (mean 0.29) were close to the technical DP mixture (0.2–0.4), probably indicating local inputs of DP. In contrast, sediments in Sishili and Taozi Bay showed much lower fₛyₙ values (mean 0.16). During transportation the DP isomers are subject to stereo selective degradation which partly resulted in the relative enrichment of anti-DP in coastal sediments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aisomers 3asediments 3atransportation 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFlame Retardantsxanalysis 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aHydrocarbons, Chlorinatedxanalysis 2aPolycyclic Compoundsxanalysis 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aChina 3aYellow Sea 0aChina1 aZhong, Guangcai1 aMöller, Axel1 aXie, Zhiyong1 aSturm, Renate1 aEbinghaus, Ralf1 aTang, Jianhui1 aZhang, Gan0 tChemosphere.g2011 May, v. 83, no. 7 p.984-990dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2011.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245022200182300001600404520142100420592002801841650000901869650001701878650001501895650001701910650002801927650002101955650001501976650001301991650004302004650001802047650000702065650001002072650001402082650001102096650001302107653002102120653001502141653001502156653003102171653004002202700002402242700001602266700002902282700003102311773013502342856008702477852000902564655001202573IND60591717020221118054719.0190725e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059171702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimi-Mohseni, Mohadeseh10aDevelopment of a new paper based nano-biosensor using the co-catalytic effect of tyrosinase from banana peel tissue (Musa Cavendish) and functionalized silica nanoparticles for voltammetric determination of l-tyrosine  ap. 648-654.  aIn this paper, a new and facile method for the electrochemical determination of l-tyrosine was designed. First, 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane-functionalized silica nanoparticles were added to a paper disc. Then, the banana peel tissue and the mediator potassium hexacyanoferrate were dropped onto the paper, respectively. The modified paper disc was placed on the top of the graphite screen printed electrode and electrochemical characterization of this biosensor was studied by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy methods. The effective parameters like pH, banana peel tissue percentage, and the amount of mediator loading were optimized. l-tyrosine measurements were done by differential pulse voltammetry with a little sample (3 μL) for analysis. The biosensor showed a linear response for l-tyrosine in the wide concentration range of 0.05–600 μM and a low detection limit about 0.02 μM because of the co-catalytic effect of enzyme and nanoparticles. The stability of the biosensor and its selectivity were evaluated. This biosensor was applied for the voltammetric determination of l-tyrosine in the blood plasma sample. The results of the practical application study were comparable with the standard method (HPLC). In conclusion, a simple, inexpensive, rapid, sensitive and selective technique was successfully applied to the l-tyrosine analysis of the little samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusa 3abanana peels 3abiosensors 3ablood plasma 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apaper 3apotassium 3asilica 3atyrosine 0aTissue biosensor 0aTyrosinase 0al-tyrosine 0aPaper based nano-biosensor 0aFunctionalized silica nanoparticles1 aRaoof, Jahan Bakhsh1 aOjani, Reza1 aAghajanzadeh, Tahereh A.1 aBagheri Hashkavayi, Ayemeh0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 July 01, v. 113 p.648-654dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.02.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100007500145245014500220300001600365500002000381520221700401592002802618650001902646650001202665650002502677650001002702650001802712650001302730650001402743650002102757650002602778651001102804700007102815700007102886700006902957700006903026700007103095700006903166773012303235856008003358852000903438655001203447IND60769148520221117173819.0220303e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076914852DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.160722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranados‐Balbuena, Sulem Yali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6273-732910aIdentification of anthocyanic profile and determination of antioxidant activity of Dahlia pinnata petals: A potential source of anthocyanins  ap. 957-967.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn recent decades, the food industry has focused on the search for potential sources of anthocyanins that are able to provide color to replace synthetic dyes and at the same time provide health benefits through food products. Thus, in the present work, we propose the Dahlia pinnata flower as a potential source of anthocyanins. The dahlia is a native, annual flower from Mexico with a wide diversity of shapes and colors. The ancestral use of the flower in several dishes, its abundance, and the intense color of the flowers known as black make the D. pinnata flower a suitable candidate to be considered as a potential source of anthocyanins. Thus, the aim of this research is the determination of its nutritional composition, anthocyanin profile, and antioxidant activity. For this purpose, proximate composition of petals was determined by the AOAC standard methods. Anthocyanins were extracted from the dried petals of the flower with 0.1% HCl in methanol and 70% aqueous acetone solution and purified through Amberlite‐XAD7‐HP resin. Then, the purified extracts were analyzed for antioxidant activity by the DPPH method and the anthocyanin profile was characterized by HPLC and UPLC‐MS/MS. Results showed that D. pinnata flowers have a proximate composition similar to other important edible flowers with a high level of moisture (87%–92%) and fiber (6%–7%). The antioxidant activity of both purified extracts was considerable (2.6–12 g/ml) compared to other sources of anthocyanins. The anthocyanin profile of the purified extracts contains four main anthocyanins: delphinidin‐3‐glucoside, delphinidin‐3‐rutinoside, pelargonidin‐3‐sambubioside‐5‐glucoside, and peonidin‐3‐sambubioside‐5‐glucoside, the last two being uncommon as major anthocyanin components in other plant sources. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: We present a potential and novel source of anthocyanins based on anthocyanin content and antioxidant activity of Dahlia pinnata petals. On the basis of UPLC‐MS/MS studies, we identified four main anthocyanins, so this information provides the opportunity to study the source in many areas such as natural pigment stabilization, food additives, and antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDahlia pinnata 3aacetone 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3afood industry 3amethanol 3amyrtillin 3anutrient content 3aproximate composition 3aMexico1 aSantacruz‐Juárez, Ericka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1090-18791 aCanseco‐González, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8285-252X1 aAztatzi‐Rugerio, Lucía1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8066-99641 aSánchez‐Minutti, Lilia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4739-51961 aRamírez‐López, Carolina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9757-112X1 aOcaranza‐Sánchez, Erik1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6778-72480 tJournal of food science.g2022 Mar., v. 87, no. 3 p.957-967dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.160723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010000174300001600274520139000290592002801680650002301708650002401731650000901755650001301764650001001777650001101787651001101798700002801809700001901837700001701856700001801873773009101891856008101982852000902063655001202072IND60080816820221121083156.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008081682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-014-9485-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiikavuopio, Sten Ivar10aTemperature preference of juvenile Arctic charr originating from different thermal environments  ap. 313-320.  aTemperature preference of juvenile (age 1+) Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus L.) originating from four arctic and sub-arctic populations (Svalbard and mainland northern Norway), representing a range of habitats with different temperature conditions, was studied by use of a shuttle-box system which allowed individual fish to control their environmental temperature. Based on the assumption that adaptations to long-lasting differences in thermal environments would affect temperature preference, we expected that Arctic charr from the high arctic Svalbard would prefer a lower temperature than the charr from two well-studied sub-arctic mainland lakes (i.e. one anadromous charr population from Storvatn, Hammerfest and two sympatric resident charr morphs from Fjellfrøsvatn, Målselv). There were, however, no significant differences in temperature preference among the four populations after 24 h exposure to the shuttle-box system, although the charr from the omnivore upper-water sympatric morph of Fjellfrøsvatn used significantly longer time to reach a stable thermal preferendum than the fish of the other populations. The average temperature preference at the end of the trials ranged between 10.9 and 11.6 °C among the populations. The lack of population differences suggests that temperature preference is not a polymorphic trait under strong selection in Arctic charr.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalvelinus alpinus 3aambient temperature 3afish 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amorphs 3aNorway1 aSæther, Bjørn-Steinar1 aJohnsen, Helge1 aEvensen, Tor1 aKnudsen, Rune0 tAquatic ecology.g2014 Sept., v. 48, no. 3 p.313-320dSpringer-Verlagx1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-014-9485-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03326naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003000166245012600196300001800322520169300340592002802033650000902061650001902070650003002089650001902119650001802138650001502156650001202171650002102183650002402204650001602228650001602244650001602260650002902276650003902305650002402344650003702368650002502405650002902430650004102459650001602500650001702516700002402533700002802557700002702585700002802612773009902640856004802739852000902787655001202796IND50063416120221118024208.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006341612DNAL7 a232422692pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-012-3231-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFederica, Sagüés María10aOptimization of production of chlamydospores of the nematode-trapping fungus Duddingtonia flagrans in solid culture media  ap. 1047-1051.  aThe large-scale production of nematophagous fungi as agents of biological control is one of the main challenges to be commercially used. In order to improve growth of microorganism in a culture medium, the addition of growth inducer is common. At the moment, the action of their addition in the mycelia growth and sporulation rate of nematophagous fungi is not known. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate the sporulation rate of Duddingtonia flagrans by adding two growth inducers, meso-inositol and Tween 80, both at 0.5 % in a traditional culture medium Sabouraud glucose agar (SGA) and also in a traditional culture medium enriched with wheat flour and milk powder. From a traditional sterile culture of D. flagrans, four groups were made: SGA; Sabouraud glucose agar–meso-inositol 0.5 %; Sabouraud glucose agar–Tween 80 0.5 %; and Sabouraud glucose agar-enriched (SGA-E). These media were placed at a constant temperature of 27 °C for 4 weeks. Following this, chlamydospores were gently rinsed off with sterile water and counted using a Neubauer haematocytometer to estimate the number of chlamydospores per millilitre of water. The addition of meso-inositol 0.5 % to SGA promoted a significant increase (p < 0.05) in chlamydospore production obtaining an average of 51,715,000 chlamydospores per Petri dish. The highest chlamydospore concentration was observed in the SGA-E in comparison with SGA (p < 0.01) obtaining an average of 208,760,000 chlamydospores. The aim of this study was to obtain basic knowledge regarding the effect of enriched culture medium and growth-inducing meso-inositol and Tween 80 on mycelial growth and production of chlamydospores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagar 3aaxenic culture 3abiological control agents 3achlamydospores 3aculture media 3adried milk 3aglucose 3amicrobial growth 3anematophagous fungi 3asporulation 3atemperature 3awheat flour 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aDuddingtoniaxgrowth & development 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aIndustrial Microbiologyxmethods 2aInositolxmetabolism 2aPolysorbatesxmetabolism 2aSpores, Fungalxgrowth & development 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors1 aAlberto, Fusé Luis1 aEmilia, Iglesias Lucía1 aCarina, Moreno Fabiana1 aAlfredo, Saumell Carlos0 tParasitology research.g2013 Mar., v. 112, no. 3 p.1047-1051dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-012-3231-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245012100173300001600294520163100310592002801941650001001969650001401979650000901993650001902002650002702021650002202048650001502070650001702085650002202102650001902124650002502143650000902168650001202177651001102189651001102200653001702211653002202228653001402250653001902264700001702283700002002300700002102320773010402341856008702445852000902532655001202541IND60552601420221120043157.0161021e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055260142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpadaro, Amanda10aLocal mitochondrial DNA haplotype databases needed for domestic dog populations that have experienced founder effect  ap. 113-118.  aBiological material from pets is often collected as evidence from crime scenes. Due to sample type and quality, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is frequently evaluated to identify the potential contributor. MtDNA has a lower discriminatory power than nuclear DNA with multiple individuals in a population potentially carrying the same mtDNA sequence, or haplotype. The frequency distribution of mtDNA haplotypes in a population must be known in order to determine the evidentiary value of a match between crime scene evidence and the potential contributor of the biological material. This is especially important in geographic areas that include remote and/or isolated populations where founder effect may have lead to a decrease in genetic diversity and a non-random distribution of haplotypes relative to the population at large. Here we compared the haplotype diversity in dogs from the noncontiguous states of Alaska and Hawaii relative to the contiguous United States (US). We report a greater proportion of dogs carrying an A haplotype in Alaska relative to any other US population. Significant variation in the distribution of haplotype frequencies was discovered when comparing the haplotype diversity of dogs in Hawaii to that of the continental US. Each of these regions exhibits reduced genetic diversity relative to the contiguous US, likely due to founder effect. We recommend that specific databases be created to accurately represent the mitochondrial haplotype diversity in these remote areas. Furthermore, our work demonstrates the importance of local surveys for populations that may have experienced found effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrime 3adatabases 3adogs 3afounder effect 3afrequency distribution 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3anuclear genome 3anucleotide sequences 3apets 3asurveys 3aAlaska 3aHawaii 0aDomestic dog 0aMitochondrial DNA 0aForensics 0aFounder effect1 aReam, Kelsey1 aBraham, Caitlyn1 aWebb, Kristen M.0 tForensic science international.g2015 Mar., v. 248 p.113-118dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245016200166520126600328592002801594650001201622650001201634650001401646650001701660650001101677650001401688650001601702650001101718651001001729700001901739700001601758700001801774700001901792773012001811856008001931852000902011655001202020IND60784087720221120103415.0220726e20220628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408772DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130705932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Xuhongyi 10aDescriptions and Barcoding of Five New Chinese Deuterophlebia Species Revealing This Genus in Both Holarctic and Oriental Realms (Diptera: Deuterophlebiidae)  aThe monotypic family Deuterophlebiidae of China was recorded twice previously from far northwest upon adults, the most parts of this country have not been investigated, leaving a huge blank of knowledge on their morphology, diversity, biology, or distribution. After deliberated collecting and rearing in recent years, we obtained more than one thousand specimens of Deuterophlebiidae, they are classified into five new species herein: Deuterophlebia sinensis sp. nov., D. yunnanensis sp. nov., D. wuyiensis sp. nov., D. acutirhina sp. nov. and D. alata sp. nov. Detailed descriptions and photographs of gathered life stages are given for these new species. Adults of them can be identified by chaetotaxy and length ratio of flagellomeres and legs, microtrichia on postgena and shape of their clypeus, pupae can be recognized by thoracic spines and abdominal chitin bands, and larvae can be separated by setae on thorax and abdomen. Genetic distances between species are 0.086–0.175 based on their COI genes. This contribution represents the first database of the enigmatic Deuterophlebiidae from China and shows a new distribution pattern of Deuterophlebia. In addition, the discovery throws some light on the origin and biogeography of the genus and family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aabdomen 3abarcoding 3abiogeography 3achitin 3adatabases 3anew species 3athorax 3aChina1 aChen, Zhiteng 1 aMu, Pengxu 1 aMa, Zhenxing 1 aZhou, Changfa 0 tInsects.g2022 June 28, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130705933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245008600158300001400244520084200258592002801100650002401128650001701152650001401169650001301183650001001196650001301206650001801219650001301237650001201250650001201262650001701274650001101291650001201302700001801314700001601332700001801348700001501366700001601381700001401397773013201411856007801543852000901621655001201630IND60765508120221123003137.0220904e20090211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076550812DNAL7 a10.17221/95/2008-cjfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopjar, M.10aStrawberry jams: influence of different pectins on colour and textural properties  ap. 20-28.  aColour and texture are very important quality properties of all foods.

The highest anthocyanin content and total phenol content were detected in strawberry jam samples prepared with low methoxy amidated pectin. During storage, after 4 and 6 weeks at both storage temperatures, room temperature and 4°C, anthocyanin content and total phenol content decreased. Also, free radical scavenging activity decreased during storage. As far as the texture parameters are concerned, namely firmness, consistency and cohesiveness, the highest values were found in strawberry jam samples prepared with high methoxyl pectin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanthocyanins 3aaspartame 3acohesion 3acolor 3afirmness 3afree radicals 3afructose 3apectins 3aphenols 3astrawberries 3asyrups 3atexture1 aPiližota, V.1 aTiban, N.N.1 aŠubarić, D.1 aBabić, J.1 aAčkar, Đ.1 aSajdl, M.0 tCzech Journal of Food Sciences.g, v. 27, no. 1 p.20-28dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21225x1805-93177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/95/2008-cjfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013700170300001400307506002800321520137500349592002801724506003701752650002001789650002701809650001101836650001601847650001501863650001401878650001101892653000901903653001501912653001201927653001201939653000901951653001201960700001801972700002101990773012702011856008402138852000902222655001202231IND60784748020221207112905.0170314e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474802DNAL7 a10.23869/bphjbr.17.1.2011172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhusniati, Tatik14aThe Organoleptic and Physic Characteristics and Lactic Acid Contents of Yoghurt with Commercial Starter Added Bifidobacteria bifidum  ap. 87-90.  aResource is Open Access  aBifidobacteria bifidum is probiotic bacteria which inhibit negative bacteria in human ulcer. Adding B. bifidum in commercial yoghurt starter, may increase yoghurt quality. To know yoghurt quality, organoleptic and physic characteristics and lactic acidcontents of yoghurt with commercial starter added B. bifidum was observed. B. bifidum concentrations added were 1:4, 2:4, 3:4 (v/v). Organoleptic characteristics were conducted by 18 panelists, physics were visually detected and lactic acid contents were by titration method. The results show that accepted yoghurt characteristics were yoghurt with commercial starter added B. bifidum 1:4 (v/v), and fat yoghurt were more acceptable than that skim. The higher B. bifidum concentrations used, the stronger flavours (after expiry date) and colours (at and after expiry date) of yoghurt, while yoghurt homogenity decreased (at and after expiry date). Fat yoghurt flavours were stronger than that of skim. The higher B. bifidum concentrations and storage times, the higher yoghurt lactic acid contents. Lactic acid contents of fat yoghurt with various starters, were higher than that skim at storage 0-15 days. The fat yoghurt lactic acid contents were 0.99%-1.44%, while that skim were 0.95-1.20%. Based on organoleptic and physic characteristics and lactic acid contents, fat yoghurt were more acceptable that that skim.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBifidobacterium 3acultured milk starters 3ahumans 3alactic acid 3aprobiotics 3atitration 3ayogurt 0askim 0aB. bifidum 0astarter 0aYoghurt 0aSkim 0aStarter1 aCholiq, Abdul1 aRahayu, Rita Dwi0 tBerkala Penelitian Hayati.g2012 Oct., v. 17, no. 1 p.87-90dIndonesian Biological SocietywJournal:27738x2337-389X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.23869/bphjbr.17.1.2011173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002500176245012500201300001500326520146200341592002801803650001701831650002101848650002401869650003301893650002201926650001401948650002201962650001901984650001802003650000902021650001902030650001302049650002502062650001702087650002702104650002102131700001402152773015202166856006902318856009602387990002302483852000902506655001202515IND60643851620221118024757.0190514e20160321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064385162DNAL7 a10.3791/534102doi7 aPMC48290532pmcid7 a270234842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBednarczyk, Dominika10aWater in oil emulsions: a new system for assembling water-soluble chlorophyll-binding proteins with hydrophobic pigments  ap. e53410.  aChlorophylls (Chls) and bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) are the primary cofactors that carry out photosynthetic light harvesting and electron transport. Their functionality critically depends on their specific organization within large and elaborate multisubunit transmembrane protein complexes. In order to understand at the molecular level how these complexes facilitate solar energy conversion, it is essential to understand protein-pigment, and pigment-pigment interactions, and their effect on excited dynamics. One way of gaining such understanding is by constructing and studying complexes of Chls with simple water-soluble recombinant proteins. However, incorporating the lipophilic Chls and BChls into water-soluble proteins is difficult. Moreover, there is no general method, which could be used for assembly of water-soluble proteins with hydrophobic pigments. Here, we demonstrate a simple and high throughput system based on water-in-oil emulsions, which enables assembly of water-soluble proteins with hydrophobic Chls. The new method was validated by assembling recombinant versions of the water-soluble chlorophyll binding protein of Brassicaceae plants (WSCP) with Chl a. We demonstrate the successful assembly of Chl a using crude lysates of WSCP expressing E. coli cell, which may be used for developing a genetic screen system for novel water-soluble Chl-binding proteins, and for studies of Chl-protein interactions and assembly processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassicaceae 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteriochlorophyll 3achlorophyll binding proteins 3aelectron transfer 3aemulsions 3aenergy conversion 3ahydrophobicity 3alipophilicity 3aoils 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3arecombinant proteins 3asolar energy 3atransmembrane proteins 3awater solubility1 aNoy, Dror0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2016 Mar. 21, , no. 109 p.e53410-e53410dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/534103Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53410/water-oil-emulsions-new-system-for-assembling-water-soluble  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002300188245008700211300001100298506007600309520065800385592002801043596006901071596006901140596006901209596008801278596005301366596005901419596005901478596006401537506003701601650000801638650002201646650001101668650001101679650001401690650002201704650002801726700002101754700002301775700002101798700001901819700002001838700001401858700002001872700002401892700002401916773010101940856008202041852000902123655001202132IND60633786620221207110044.0220929e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063378662DNAL7 a308901632pmid7 aPMC64256442pmcid7 a10.1186/s13059-019-1667-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitsuhashi, Satomi10aTandem-genotypes: robust detection of tandem repeat expansions from long DNA reads  ap. 58.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTandemly repeated DNA is highly mutable and causes at least 31 diseases, but it is hard to detect pathogenic repeat expansions genome-wide. Here, we report robust detection of human repeat expansions from careful alignments of long but error-prone (PacBio and nanopore) reads to a reference genome. Our method is robust to systematic sequencing errors, inexact repeats with fuzzy boundaries, and low sequencing coverage. By comparing to healthy controls, we prioritize pathogenic expansions within the top 10 out of 700,000 tandem repeats in whole genome sequencing data. This may help to elucidate the many genetic diseases whose causes remain unknown.  aPublisher supplied data  aJP18ek0109280cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  aJP18dm0107090cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  aJP18ek0109301cJapan Agency for Medical Research and Development  aNonecMasato Kawano Memorial Public Interest Foundation for Promotion of Pediatrics  aS1511016cMinistry of Human Resource Development  aJP17H01539cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP17K16132cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aJP16K09683cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JP)0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3agenetic disorders 3agenome 3ahumans 3ananopores 3asequence analysis 3atandem repeat sequences1 aFrith, Martin C.1 aMizuguchi, Takeshi1 aMiyatake, Satoko1 aToyota, Tomoko1 aAdachi, Hiroaki1 aOma, Yoko1 aKino, Yoshihiro1 aMitsuhashi, Hiroaki1 aMatsumoto, Naomichi0 tGenome biology.g2019 Dec., v. 20, no. 1 p.58-58dBioMed CentralwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-019-1667-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245013200164520166300296592002801959650002201987650002602009650000902035650000902044650001902053650001202072650001202084650001102096650001102107650001402118700001502132700002002147700001402167700001502181700002002196700001702216700001702233700001702250773012002267856008002387852000902467655001202476IND60784087820221120103412.0220726e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408782DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130705942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Hailong 10aDeformed Mediated Larval Incisor Lobe Development Causes Differing Feeding Behavior between Oriental Armyworm and Fall Armyworm  aMandibular incisor lobes are important for insect feeding behavior, living habits and niche. However, the molecular regulation of insect incisor lobe development remains unknown. In this study, we found that two maize pests, oriental armyworm Mythimna separata and fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda, have different feeding patterns in maize, which are closely associated with the different development patterns of their incisor lobes. Different from first to sixth instar S. frugiperda, which feed on leaf tissues and whorls with sharp incisor lobes, older instars of M. separata feed from leaf margins with no incisor lobes. Hox gene Deformed (Dfd) is important for head appendages, but its function in incisor lobe development is not clear. Here, Dfds were identified from two armyworm species, and both were expressed highly in heads and eggs. Interestingly, the expression levels of MsDfd were relatively high in larval mandibles and decreased dramatically from fourth-instar mandibles in M. separata. Knockdown of MsDfd resulted in malformed mandibles with no incisor lobe in M. separata, making the larvae unable to perform window-feeding. However, RNAi of SfDfd did not affect the mandibles and window-feeding pattern of S. frugiperda, indicating the different roles of Dfd in these two species. Moreover, the mortality of new first instar M. separata increased after feeding dsMsDfd but did not for S. frugiperda feeding dsSfDfd. These findings revealed that Dfd mediated the larval mandibular incisor lobe morphology, affecting its feeding pattern in M. separata, broadening the knowledge of Dfd functions in insect mandibles and feeding behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMythimna separata 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3acorn 3ahead 3ahomeotic genes 3ainsects 3ainstars 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amortality1 aZhu, Zeng 1 aXing, Gaoliang 1 aLi, Yiyu 1 aZhou, Xue 1 aWang, Jingjing 1 aLi, Guiting 1 aCao, Haiqun 1 aHuang, Yong 0 tInsects.g2022 June 29, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130705943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010400167300001800271520157500289592002801864650002201892650002001914650002301934650002101957650001001978650001101988650001801999650002402017650001302041650001202054653000802066653000902074653001002083653000902093653001602102653001202118653001402130653001602144653001902160700001602179700001802195700002202213773010002235856008602335852000902421655001202430IND60582836620221118053454.0190401e20170905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058283662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sixun10aRegulatory considerations in development of vaccines to prevent disease caused by Chikungunya virus  ap. 4851-4858.  aChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus. Chikungunya disease (CHIK) in humans is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, cutaneous rash, myalgia and debilitating polyarthralgia. Until recently the virus was considered endemic to only Africa and Asia, but since 2004 CHIK has spread to previously non-endemic regions, including Europe and the Americas, thereby emerging as a global health threat. Although a variety of CHIKV vaccine candidates have been tested in animals, and a few have advanced to human clinical trials, no licensed vaccine is currently available for prevention of disease. In this article, we review recent efforts in CHIKV vaccine development and discuss regulatory considerations for CHIKV vaccine licensure under U.S. FDA regulations. Several licensure pathways are available, and the most appropriate licensure pathway for a CHIK vaccine will depend on the type of evidence that can be generated to demonstrate the vaccine’s effectiveness. If “traditional approval” following demonstration of direct benefit in adequate and well-controlled clinical disease endpoint studies is not possible, the Accelerated Approval and Animal Rule pathways are potential alternatives. In terms of vaccine safety, the potential for vaccine associated arthralgia and antibody-dependent enhancement of infectivity and disease severity are important issues that should be addressed in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. CHIK vaccine developers are encouraged to communicate with the FDA during all stages of vaccine development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChikungunya virus 3aclinical trials 3adisease prevention 3adisease severity 3afever 3ahumans 3apathogenicity 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aCFR 0aCHIK 0aCHIKV 0aPRNT 0aChikungunya 0aVaccine 0aLicensure 0aRegulations 0aClinical trial1 aFink, Doran1 aHulse, Andrea1 aPratt, R.

Rice has a complex root system architecture consisting of several root types, including primary roots, lateral roots, and crown roots. Crown roots constitute the major part of the rice root system and play important roles during the growing period. Recently, we have refined a mechanism that involves ERF3/WOX11 interaction is required to regulate the expression of genes in the cytokinin signaling pathway during the different stages of crown roots development in rice. In this study, we further analyzed the root phenotypes of WOX11 transgenic plants and revealed that WOX11 also acts in controlling root hair development and enhancing rice drought resistance, in addition to its roles in regulating crown root and lateral root development. Based on this new finding, we proposed the mechanism of that WOX11 is involved in drought resistance by modulating rice root system development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3acytokinins 3adrought tolerance 3agene expression 3ahomeotic genes 3alateral roots 3aphenotype 3arice 3aroot hairs 3aroot systems 3asignal transduction 3asoil resources 3atransgenic plants 3avascular plants 0aDrought resistance 0aroot development 0aWOX111 aZhou, Dao-Xiu1 aZhao, Yu0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 11, no. 2 p.e1130198-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2015.11301983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03354naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245012800200300001400328506007600342520168600418592002802104506003702132650001202169650002302181650002002204650002702224650000802251650001802259650001702277650002702294650001302321650001002334650002702344650002002371650003002391650001202421700002302433700002302456700002102479700002002500700002002520700001902540700001402559700001402573700002002587773011702607856007902724852000902803655001202812IND4501631320221207131129.0150427e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450163132DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.06248-112doi7 aPMC32565982pmcid7 a220374022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Shuang-yong10aCharacterization of Type II and III Restriction-Modification Systems from Bacillus cereus Strains ATCC 10987 and ATCC 14579  ap. 49-60.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe genomes of two Bacillus cereus strains (ATCC 10987 and ATCC 14579) have been sequenced. Here, we report the specificities of type II/III restriction (R) and modification (M) enzymes. Found in the ATCC 10987 strain, BceSI is a restriction endonuclease (REase) with the recognition and cut site CGAAG 24-25/27-28. BceSII is an isoschizomer of AvaII (G/GWCC). BceSIII cleaves at ACGGC 12/14. The BceSIII C terminus resembles the catalytic domains of AlwI, MlyI, and Nt.BstNBI. BceSIV is composed of two subunits and cleaves on both sides of GCWGC. BceSIV activity is strongly stimulated by the addition of cofactor ATP or GTP. The large subunit (R1) of BceSIV contains conserved motifs of NTPases and DNA helicases. The R1 subunit has no endonuclease activity by itself; it strongly stimulates REase activity when in complex with the R2 subunit. BceSIV was demonstrated to hydrolyze GTP and ATP in vitro. BceSIV is similar to CglI (GCSGC), and homologs of R1 are found in 11 sequenced bacterial genomes, where they are paired with specificity subunits. In addition, homologs of the BceSIV R1-R2 fusion are found in many sequenced microbial genomes. An orphan methylase, M.BceSV, was found to modify GCNGC, GGCC, CCGG, GGNNCC, and GCGC sites. A ParB-methylase fusion protein appears to nick DNA nonspecifically. The ATCC 14579 genome encodes an active enzyme Bce14579I (GCWGC). BceSIV and Bce14579I belong to the phospholipase D (PLD) family of endonucleases that are widely distributed among Bacteria and ARCHAEA: A survey of type II and III restriction-modification (R-M) system genes is presented from sequenced B. cereus, Bacillus anthracis, and Bacillus thuringiensis strains.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aBacillus anthracis 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aDNA 3aDNA helicases 3aactive sites 3aadenosine triphosphate 3abacteria 3agenes 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aphospholipase D 3arestriction endonucleases 3asurveys1 aNugent, Rebecca L.1 aKasamkattil, Julie1 aFomenkov, Alexey1 aGupta, Yogeśa,1 aAggarwal, Aneel1 aWang, Xiaolong1 aLi, Zhiru1 aZheng, Yu1 aMorgan, Richard0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 194, no. 1 p.49-60dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.06248-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03254naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245011500209300001800324506007600342520163600418592002802054506003702082650001602119650002702135650002202162650001802184650001702202650001102219650001402230650002602244650001502270650001602285653002802301653002302329700001802352700001802370700002202388700002402410700002202434700001902456700002402475773017302499856007902672852000902751655001202760IND60173622620221207125418.0150603e20130409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017362262DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12175491102doi7 aPMC36252592pmcid7 a235301862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchauder, David M.10aGlutamate receptor desensitization is mediated by changes in quaternary structure of the ligand binding domain  ap. 5921-5926.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlutamate receptor ion channels are membrane proteins that mediate excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system of vertebrates. Insight into molecular mechanisms underlying glutamate receptor gating is limited by lack of structural information for receptors trapped in different conformational states. Here, we report the use of single-particle cryoelectron tomography to determine the structures, at ∼21 Å resolution, of full-length GluK2 kainate receptors trapped in antagonist-bound resting and agonist-bound desensitized states. The resting state, stabilized by the competitive antagonist LY466195, closely resembles the crystal structure of the AMPA receptor GluA2, with well-resolved proximal and distal subunits exhibiting cross-over between the twofold symmetric amino terminal domain and a twofold symmetric ligand binding domain (LBD) dimer of dimers assembly. In the desensitized state, the LBD undergoes a major rearrangement, resulting in a separation of the four subunits by ∼25 Å. However, the amino terminal domain, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions of the receptor have similar conformations in the resting and desensitized states. The LBD rearrangement was not anticipated in prior models based on crystal structures for soluble LBD dimer assemblies, and we speculate that subunit separation allows a better match to the fourfold symmetric ion channel domain. From fits of the amino terminal domain and LBD domains into the density map of the desensitized state we have derived a structural model for differences in quaternary conformation between the resting and desensitized states.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantagonists 3acentral nervous system 3acrystal structure 3aglutamic acid 3aion channels 3amodels 3areceptors 3asynaptic transmission 3atomography 3avertebrates 0acryoelectron microscopy 0aion channel gating1 aKuybeda, Oleg1 aZhang, Jinjin1 aKlymko, Katherine1 aBartesaghi, Alberto1 aBorgnia, Mario J.1 aMayer, Mark L.1 aSubramaniam, Sriram0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.5921-5926dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12175491103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245021500181300001600396520150200412592002801914650002701942650001401969650002501983650001402008650001202022650001502034650001202049650001202061650001302073650001402086650001302100653001702113653001402130653001402144653002002158653001902178653002902197700001902226700002502245700003202270700002802302700005902330700006502389773013902454856008202593852000902675655001202684IND60755466520221117222612.0211102e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075546652DNAL7 a10.1017/S000748532100047X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMena-Mociño, Laura Verónica10aEffects of sex ratio on different biological parameters of Engytatus varians (Distant) (Hemiptera: Miridae) adults and their offspring: prey preference for Bactericera cockerelli (Sulcer) (Hemiptera: Triozidae)  ap. 733-740.  aIn the present study, the influence of three sex ratios (1:1, 1:2, and 1:3; female:male) of the mirid Engytatus varians (Distant) (Hemiptera) on different biological parameters and on its offspring was evaluated. The prey preference of different developmental stages of this predator for different nymphal instars (N) of Bactericera cockerelli (Sulcer) (Hemiptera: Triozidae) was also evaluated. The fertility was significantly higher (24 nymphs/female) in the 1:3 sex ratio than in the 1:1 and 1:2 sex ratios (14 and 16 nymphs/female, respectively). The females in the 1:1 and 1:2 sex ratios lived 1.14 and 1.43 days more (27 and 28 days, respectively) than those in the 1:3 sex ratio (26 days). The nymphs derived from the females of the three sex ratios (first filial generation, F₁) had five instars and a duration of 17 or 18 days. The ratio of the F₁ generation females was not affected by the sex ratio of their parents. In choice tests, independent of whether the preys were placed on a single or multiple tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) leaflets, the consumption of females and males and N₃, N₄, and N₅ nymphs of E. varians on B. cockerelli, generally showed the order of N₂>N₃>N₄>N₅. In conclusion, the findings revealed in this study can help to improve the rearing methodology for increasing populations of E. varians. In addition, they can serve as a guideline for releasing this predator in times when there is an abundance of early instar nymphs of B. cockerelli.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactericera cockerelli 3aEngytatus 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aTriozidae 3afemales 3aguidelines 3ainstars 3aprogeny 3aresearch 3asex ratio 3atomatoes 0aChoice tests 0afertility 0alongevity 0anymphal instars 0atomato psyllid 0azoophytophagous predator1 aPineda, Samuel1 aMartínez, Ana Mabel1 aPalma-Castillo, Luis Jesús1 aGómez-Ramos, Benjamín1 aViñuela, Elisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6283-52361 aFigueroa, José Isaac1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6278-17680 tBulletin of entomological research.g2021 Dec., v. 111, no. 6 p.733-740dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S000748532100047X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02305naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245014600169300002000315520112800335592002801463650002201491650001701513650001601530650004301546650002201589650002201611650001501633650001801648650001301666700002001679700001901699700001801718773012401736856007401860852000901934655001201943IND60637004320221119164127.0190413e20190411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700432DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra01291e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStenzel, Yannick Philipp12aA new HILIC-ICP-SF-MS method for the quantification of organo(fluoro)phosphates as decomposition products of lithium ion battery electrolytes  ap. 11413-11419.  aThe lithium ion battery (LIB) is the most popular choice for powering consumer electronics, grid storage and electric vehicles. Decomposition reactions in LIBs, leading to so-called aging, are the main reason for loss of capacity and power and will affect LIB safety. Organo(fluoro)phosphates (O(F)Ps) as decomposition products of LIB electrolytes have been identified in several studies in the literature but quantitative data of O(F)Ps in LIBs are only scarcely available. In terms of toxicity, this substance class is highly relevant as it shows structural similarities to chemical warfare agents. Thus, approaches that can deliver quantitative data are in need. In this study, acidic O(F)Ps were quantified with an inductively coupled plasma-sector field-mass spectrometer (ICP-SF-MS) after separation of species with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC). The formation of OFPs exceeds the amount of non-fluorine containing OPs by a factor of up to 15. A total of 16 different O(F)P compounds could successfully be quantified. Organic mass spectrometry was used for the assignment of quantitative data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectrolytes 3aelectronics 3ahydrophilic interaction chromatography 3alithium batteries 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphates 3aspectrometers 3atoxicity1 aHenschel, Jonas1 aWinter, Martin1 aNowak, Sascha0 tRSC advances.g2019 Apr. 11, v. 9, no. 20 p.11413-11419dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra01291e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02852naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010300167300001600270520121200286592002801498596008101526596015101607596002901758650002401787650001901811650002201830650001401852650000901866650001101875650001301886650001601899650001101915650001201926650001101938651001201949653001901961653002901980653002702009653002502036653001902061653002702080700001502107700001502122773012602137856008602263852000902349655001202358IND60654672520221122145501.0190808e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065467252DNAL7 a10.2989/1814232X.2019.15816592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilhelm, MR10aNew age-determination method based on fast growth rate of Cape hake Merluccius capensis in Namibia  ap. 119-124.  aNamibia’s most important commercial fisheries resource, the shallow-water Cape hake Merluccius capensis, is currently assessed using statistical catch-at-age analysis. Age data obtained from otoliths constitute an important data component of this model. Recent age-validation studies of M. capensis showed that growth was previously underestimated. We investigated this new fast-growth hypothesis (FGH) by using measurements and counts of translucent zones (T1 to T14, from otolith core to edge) on two survey otolith samples covering the entire range of fish lengths. We compared three hypotheses of periodicity of otolith zone formation and show that, if all zones are counted, T2 (at 9.0 mm otolith length), T5, T8, T11 and T14 are most likely to be annuli. A conversion from the slow-growth-hypothesis (SGH, currently used) age data was calculated as: FGH age group = round (0.41[SGH age group] + 0.25), and this formula should be applied to compute and test updated catch-at-age data in a future hake stock assessment. Additional adjustment for the hake stock assessment following the FGH, such as the timing of recruitment in winter and catches in summer, should be considered in future assessments.  aPublisher supplied data  aOCE-1434732cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  aNRF 65238cSouth African Research Chairs Initiative of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Foundation, South Africa  a2010/222387cBCC Ecofish 3aMerluccius capensis 3aMorus capensis 3aage determination 3afisheries 3ahake 3amodels 3aotoliths 3aperiodicity 3asummer 3asurveys 3awinter 3aNamibia 0aage validation 0aannual age determination 0afast-growth hypothesis 0aMerluccius paradoxus 0aotolith length 0aslow-growth hypothesis1 aPaulus, SC1 aKashava, S0 tAfrican journal of marine science.g2019 Apr. 3, v. 41, no. 2 p.119-124dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12126x1814-23387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2989/1814232X.2019.15816593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245014400162520149400306592002801800650001801828650003001846650001901876650001601895650001301911650002201924650001401946650004301960650002302003650001002026650002802036650001802064650001302082700001702095700001502112700001602127700001702143700001902160700002002179700001502199773012002214856008002334852000902414655001202423IND60784088120221120103316.0220726e20220629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408812DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130705972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Jian 10aIdentification and Expression Analysis of Chemosensory Genes in the Antennal Transcriptome of Chrysanthemum Aphid Macrosiphoniella sanborni  aAs one of the most destructive oligophagous pests, the chrysanthemum aphid (Macrosiphoniella sanborni) has seriously restricted the sustainable development of the chrysanthemum industry. Olfaction plays a critical role in the environmental perception of aphids, but very little is currently known about the chemosensory mechanism of M. sanborni. In this study, four MsanOBPs, four MsanCSPs, eight MsanORs, two MsanIRs and one MsanSNMP were identified among the 28,323 unigenes derived from the antennal transcriptome bioinformatic analysis of M. sanborni adults. Then, comprehensive phylogenetic analyses of these olfactory-related proteins in different aphid species were performed using multiple sequence alignment. Subsequently, the odor-specific and wing-specific expression profiles of these candidate chemosensory genes were investigated using quantitative real-time PCR. The data showed that most of these chemosensory genes exhibited higher expression levels in alate aphids. Among them, MsanOBP9, MsanOR2, MsanOR4, MsanOR43b-1, MsanCSP1, MsanCSP2, MsanCSP4, MsanIR25a and MsanIR40a in alate aphids showed remarkably higher expression levels than in apterous aphids under the effect of the host plant volatiles, indicating that these genes may take part in the specific behaviors of alate adults, such as host recognition, oviposition site selection and so on. This study lays the groundwork for future research into the molecular mechanism of olfactory recognition in M. sanborni.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum 3aMacrosiphoniella sanborni 3abioinformatics 3ahost plants 3aindustry 3aoviposition sites 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence alignment 3asmell 3asustainable development 3atranscriptome 3aunigenes1 aWang, Yuxin 1 aLu, Yufan 1 aMa, Xiaoou 1 aZhang, Qian 1 aWang, Xiaoyue 1 aZhang, Qixiang 1 aSun, Ming 0 tInsects.g2022 June 29, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130705973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245009200204300001800296506007600314520116900390592002801559506003701587650002201624650001401646650001601660650001001676650001101686653001901697653002201716653002401738700002101762773017301783856007901956852000902035655001202044IND60173622820221207125415.0150603e20130409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017362282DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12177951102doi7 aPMC36252862pmcid7 a235301952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPang, Tin Yau10aUniversal distribution of component frequencies in biological and technological systems  ap. 6235-6239.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBacterial genomes and large-scale computer software projects both consist of a large number of components (genes or software packages) connected via a network of mutual dependencies. Components can be easily added or removed from individual systems, and their use frequencies vary over many orders of magnitude. We study this frequency distribution in genomes of ∼500 bacterial species and in over 2 million Linux computers and find that in both cases it is described by the same scale-free power-law distribution with an additional peak near the tail of the distribution corresponding to nearly universal components. We argue that the existence of a power law distribution of frequencies of components is a general property of any modular system with a multilayered dependency network. We demonstrate that the frequency of a component is positively correlated with its dependency degree given by the total number of upstream components whose operation directly or indirectly depends on the selected component. The observed frequency/dependency degree distributions are reproduced in a simple mathematically tractable model introduced and analyzed in this study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3acorrelation 3agenes 3amodels 0agene frequency 0ametabolic network 0asoftware dependency1 aMaslov, Sergeĭ,0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 110, no. 15 p.6235-6239dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12177951103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04322naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245016900158300001600327500002000343520141600363592002801779596006301807596020301870596008302073596008502156596004502241596012502286596008202411650002702493650001802520650002602538650001102564650001402575650000902589650002302598650002502621650001002646650002602656650001402682650001002696650002102706650001402727650002402741650001502765700001802780700001602798700001602814700001702830700001702847700001602864700001902880700001702899700001702916700001502933700001602948700001502964700002002979700001502999700001903014700002003033700001503053700001703068700001603085700002003101700001903121700001203140700001903152700001403171700002503185700001403210700005503224773012403279856008003403852000903483655001203492IND60761975820221120091220.0220105e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076197582DNAL7 a10.1111/1755-0998.135042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Lei10aChromosome‐scale assembly and whole‐genome sequencing of 266 giant panda roundworms provide insights into their evolution, adaptation and potential drug targets  ap. 768-785.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHelminth diseases have long been a threat to the health of humans and animals. Roundworms are important organisms for studying parasitic mechanisms, disease transmission and prevention. The study of parasites in the giant panda is of importance for understanding how roundworms adapt to the host. Here, we report a high‐quality chromosome‐scale genome of Baylisascaris schroederi with a genome size of 253.60 Mb and 19,262 predicted protein‐coding genes. We found that gene families related to epidermal chitin synthesis and environmental information processes in the roundworm genome have expanded significantly. Furthermore, we demonstrated unique genes involved in essential amino acid metabolism in the B. schroederi genome, inferred to be essential for the adaptation to the giant panda‐specific diet. In addition, under different deworming pressures, we found that four resistance‐related genes (glc‐1, nrf‐6, bre‐4 and ced‐7) were under strong positive selection in a captive population. Finally, 23 known drug targets and 47 potential drug target proteins were identified. The genome provides a unique reference for inferring the early evolution of roundworms and their adaptation to the host. Population genetic analysis and drug sensitivity prediction provide insights revealing the impact of deworming history on population genetic structure of importance for disease prevention.  aPublisher supplied data  a20180302cForestry science and technology research project  aKLSFGAGP2020.002cThe Foundation of Key Laboratory of State Forestry and Grassland Administration (State Park Administration) on Conservation Biology of Rare Animals in the Giant Panda National Park  a2019CX01N111cThe Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program in Guangdong Province  a2017B030301011cThe Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Genome Read and Write  a2017YFD0501702cNational Key R&D Program  a2020004cOpen Project of Key Laboratory of SFGA on Conservation Biology of Rare Animals in The Giant Panda National Park  a2572020AA30cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China 3aAiluropoda melanoleuca 3aBaylisascaris 3aamino acid metabolism 3achitin 3adeworming 3adiet 3adisease prevention 3adisease transmission 3adrugs 3aessential amino acids 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3ahelminths 3apopulation genetics 3aprediction1 aLan, Tianming1 aLi, Desheng1 aLi, Haimeng1 aDeng, Linhua1 aPeng, Zhiwei1 aHe, Shaowen1 aZhou, Yanqiang1 aHan, Ruobing1 aLi, Lingling1 aLu, Yaxian1 aLu, Haorong1 aWang, Qing1 aYang, Shangchen1 aZhu, Yixin1 aHuang, Yunting1 aCheng, Xiaofang1 aYu, Jieyao1 aWang, Yulong1 aSun, Heting1 aChai, Hongliang1 aYang, Huanming1 aXu, Xun1 aLisby, Michael1 aLiu, Quan1 aKristiansen, Karsten1 aLiu, Huan1 aHou, Zhijun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8704-16510 tMolecular ecology resources.g2022 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.768-785dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12383x1755-098X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.135043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245009800167300001800265520088500283592002801168650002201196650002301218650001301241650001501254650001601269650002701285650001601312650001401328650002101342650001601363700002701379700002501406700002201431700002001453700002601473700002301499700002601522700002101548700002001569773012901589856007401718852000901792655001201801IND60617353720221122012937.0181025e20180614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061735372DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay00495a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalsagova, Kristina A.10aUltrasensitive nanowire-based detection of HCVcoreAg in the serum using a microwave generator  ap. 2740-2749.  aThe possibility of the application of a nanowire field-effect transistor biosensor, coupled with a microwave generator, for the detection of a hepatitis C protein marker – core antigen of hepatitis C virus (HCVcoreAg) – has been studied. The surface of nanowire sensor elements was sensitized with oligonucleotide molecular probes. This enabled biospecific capturing of HCVcoreAg target molecules onto the sensor surface. Herein, we have demonstrated that the nanowire biosensor coupled with a microwave generator allows one to detect target protein molecules in buffer solution at a 10-times lower concentration than that without the use of a microwave generator. The lowest detectable HCVcoreAg concentration was determined to be ∼10⁻¹⁷ M. The nanowire biosensor has also allowed us to detect HCVcoreAg in serum both with and without the use of a microwave generator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHepatitis C virus 3aanalytical methods 3aantigens 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3agenerators (equipment) 3ahepatitis C 3ananowires 3aoligonucleotides 3atransistors1 aPleshakova, Tatyana O.1 aGaliullin, Rafael A.1 aKaysheva, Anna L.1 aShumov, Ivan D.1 aIlnitskii, Mikhail A.1 aPopov, Vladimir P.1 aGlukhov, Alexander V.1 aArchakov, A.

AV7909 consists of the Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA, BioThrax®) bulk drug substance adjuvanted with the immunostimulatory oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) compound, CPG 7909. The addition of CPG 7909 to AVA enhances both the magnitude and the kinetics of antibody responses in animals and human subjects, making AV7909 a suitable next-generation vaccine for use in a PEP setting. The studies described here provide initial information on AV7909-induced toxin-neutralizing antibody (TNA) levels associated with the protection of animals from lethal Bacillus anthracis challenge. Guinea pigs or nonhuman primates (NHPs) were immunized on Days 0 and 28 with various dilutions of AV7909, AVA or a saline or Alhydrogel+CPG 7909 control. Animals were challenged via the inhalational route with a lethal dose of aerosolized B. anthracis (Ames strain) spores and observed for clinical signs of disease and mortality. The relationship between pre-challenge serum TNA levels and survival following challenge was determined in order to calculate a threshold TNA level associated with protection. Immunisation with AV7909 induced a rapid, highly protective TNA response in guinea pigs and NHPs. Surprisingly, the TNA threshold associated with a 70% probability of survival for AV7909 immunized animals was substantially lower than the threshold which has been established for the licensed AVA vaccine. The results of this study suggest that the TNA threshold of protection against anthrax could be modified by the addition of an immune stimulant such as CPG 7909 and that the TNA levels associated with protection may be vaccine-specific.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3aPrimates 3aanthrax 3ablood serum 3adisease control 3aguinea pigs 3ahumans 3aimmunization 3aimmunostimulants 3alethal dose 3amortality 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3aprobability 3aspores 3avaccines 0aAnimal rule 0aCorrelate of protection 0aTNA threshold 0aAnthrax vaccine 0aCPG 7909 adjuvant 0aGuinea pig 0aCynomolgus macaque1 aShearer, Jeffry D.1 aGainey, Melicia R.1 aSanford, Daniel C.1 aSivko, Gloria S.1 aStark, Gregory V.1 aLi, Na1 aIonin, Boris1 aLacy, Michael J.1 aSkiadopoulos, Mario H.0 tVaccine.g2017 Sept. 05, v. 35, no. 37 p.4952-4959dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.07.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245013100165300002000296520193300316592002802249650001102277650001502288650002102303650001402324650001302338650000902351650001202360650002202372650004402394650002302438650001102461650001302472700003002485700001602515700005802531700005502589773013802644856008002782852000902862655001202871IND60614632920221118154436.0181002e20180820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b060892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeifer, Nicole10aNMR-Detected Dynamics of Sodium Co-Intercalation with Diglyme Solvent Molecules in Graphite Anodes Linked to Prolonged Cycling  ap. 21172-21184.  aFollowing the success of Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries are becoming an important economical alternative, particularly where weight and density considerations are not of primary importance. Graphite, the anode of choice for nearly all commercial Li-ion battery applications, has only recently been successfully used as such in Na systems. This unprecedented success was due to the proper choice of solvent, e.g., diglyme. Interestingly, lithium performs poorly under such conditions, which is the converse of their respective behavior in standard carbonate solvents. These phenomena have been attributed to co-intercalation of the alkali ions upon their complexation with the smaller solvent molecules. In the case of Li, the use of such solvents leads to deterioration, while in the case of Na, it improves its electrochemical performance so substantially as to make the previously irrelevant Na–graphite system viable. Several studies have since followed, mainly focusing on the Na–diglyme intercalation; however, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms of ternary intercalation into graphite for both Na and Li is still lacking. In particular, the characteristic differences in location and dynamics of the guest complexes in the host material upon electrochemical cycling are not yet fully understood. In this study, the co-intercalation mechanisms of Na and Li in diglyme into graphite were explored via solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Direct evidence for the atomic proximity of both Na–(diglyme)₂ and Li–(diglyme)₂ complexes to the graphite planes in discharged electrodes was observed. Reduced mobility and stronger coupling of the Li–(diglyme)₂ complex to the graphene electrons are seen, whereas higher mobility and weaker coupling to the host are detected for the Na–(diglyme)₂ complexes in the galleries, providing molecular cues for the difference in cycling performance of the two systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbonates 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrons 3agraphene 3aions 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3asodium 3asolvents1 aGreenstein, Miryam Fayena1 aMor, Albert1 aOrbakh, Doron,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8047-90201 aGoobes, Gil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5735-67000 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 20, v. 122, no. 37 p.21172-21184dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b060893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010400175300001800279500001500297520127700312592002801589650001101617650002801628650001601656650001801672650001101690650001901701650001601720650001201736650002501748650001301773650002801786653002301814653001301837653002401850653002201874653002001896653002701916653002401943653001201967653001301979700001901992700002702011700006102038773014302099856008502242852000902327655001202336IND60598909220221120135333.0180702e20180306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059890922DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b001072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarayanan, Remya P.10aCost Analysis as a Tool for the Development of Sc Recovery Processes from Bauxite Residue (Red Mud)  ap. 5333-5341.  a2019-12-06  aProcess development for the recovery of rare earth elements (REEs) from production wastes is generally seen as one strategy to address potential supply shortages for these critical materials. However, very few reported process systems are both technologically feasible and economically viable. Herein, we propose a strategy which considers comprehensive cost analysis in the presence of irreducible uncertainty as a core strategy introduced early on at the process design stage for the recovery of scandium (Sc) from bauxite residue (red mud). The latter represents an important process example of REE recovery from what is typically considered a waste material. In particular, using both a classical and a probabilistic framework for cost model development and assessment, cost is considered as a key design parameter in addition to selectivity and yield to design processes primed for industrial applications. We further show that such an approach affords significantly enhanced prospects of economic viability to the proposed process system when comparatively evaluated against reported ones, thus promising to drive environmental remediation of red mud through recovery of a valuable material (Sc₂O₃) under enhanced environmental and economic performance profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3awastes 3aeconomic sustainability 3auncertainty 3acost analysis 3amodels 3aprocess design 3aremediation 3abauxite 3aeconomic performance 3ascandium 3aindustrial applications 0aSolvent extraction 0aScandium 0aRare earth recovery 0aEconomic analysis 0aBauxite residue 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0arare earth elements 0aRed mud 0aLeaching1 aMa, Liang-Chih1 aKazantzis, Nikolaos K.1 aEmmert, Marion H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4375-82950 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Mar. 06, v. 6, no. 4 p.5333-5341dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b001073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010000155300001600255520156000271592002801831650000901859650001601868650001201884650001701896650001301913650001401926650000901940650001401949650001801963650001201981650001001993650000902003650002402012650000902036650002202045650001202067700001902079700002202098773013502120856007402255852000902329655001202338IND60765062920221119031050.0220615e20080717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076506292DNAL7 a10.17221/356-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZelenka, J.10aInfluence of n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on sensory characteristics of chicken meat  ap. 299-305.  aThe relationship between different levels of n-6 and n-3 PUFA in chicken breast and thigh meat and sensory characteristics of meat was studied. Chickens were fed diets containing 1, 3, 5 or 7 percent of oil made of seeds either of the linseed cultivar Atalante (A) with a high content of &alpha;-linolenic acid or of the cultivar Lola (L) with a predominating content of linoleic acid. The meat of chickens fed L showed better sensory characteristics than the meat of birds fed A. If the tissue contained more than 180 mg/100 g of n-3 PUFA, i.e. the thigh meat when chickens were fed 3% or more A and the breast meat when chickens were fed 7% A, significant fishy odour and taste as well as slight oily aftertaste were recorded. Texture, tenderness and juiciness of breast meat did not differ significantly (<I>P</I> > 0.05) in groups fed different diets. Thigh meat in the group with 1% A was significantly (<I>P</I> < 0.05) more fibrous than in the group with 7% L; however, there were no differences in texture between the other groups. The thigh meat of chickens fed L was tenderer, juicier and tastier than the meat of those fed A. Tenderness and juiciness were the highest in the group fed 7% of L. There is only a limited possibility to increase the intake of n-3 PUFA without any risk of changes in sensory characteristics of meat. If the levels of &alpha;-linolenic acid in the diet were 6.5 and 31 g/kg and the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratios in the meat were 3.3:1 and 0.9:1, respectively, the sensory value of TM and BM was not significantly deteriorated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLola 3abreast meat 3abreasts 3achicken meat 3achickens 3acultivars 3adiet 3ajuiciness 3alinoleic acid 3alinseed 3aodors 3aoils 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3arisk 3ataste sensitivity 3atexture1 aJarošová, A.1 aSchneiderová, D.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 53, no. 7 p.299-305dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/356-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245008600210300001600296520176300312592002802075653001502103653002302118653003202141653002002173700002302193700002802216700002602244700002502270700002202295700002002317700001702337700002702354700001602381700002502397700001602422700002202438700002102460700002302481773013902504856008202643852000902725655001202734IND60558334320221120112914.0161115e20160804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055833432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.04.0232doi7 aPMC49740852pmcid7 a274867762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindstrand, Anna10aCopy-Number Variation Contributes to the Mutational Load of Bardet-Biedl Syndrome  ap. 318-336.  aBardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a defining ciliopathy, notable for extensive allelic and genetic heterogeneity, almost all of which has been identified through sequencing. Recent data have suggested that copy-number variants (CNVs) also contribute to BBS. We used a custom oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) covering 20 genes that encode intraflagellar transport (IFT) components and 74 ciliopathy loci to screen 92 unrelated individuals with BBS, irrespective of their known mutational burden. We identified 17 individuals with exon-disruptive CNVs (18.5%), including 13 different deletions in eight BBS genes (BBS1, BBS2, ARL6/BBS3, BBS4, BBS5, BBS7, BBS9, and NPHP1) and a deletion and a duplication in other ciliopathy-associated genes (ALMS1 and NPHP4, respectively). By contrast, we found a single heterozygous exon-disruptive event in a BBS-associated gene (BBS9) in 229 control subjects. Superimposing these data with resequencing revealed CNVs to (1) be sufficient to cause disease, (2) Mendelize heterozygous deleterious alleles, and (3) contribute oligogenic alleles by combining point mutations and exonic CNVs in multiple genes. Finally, we report a deletion and a splice site mutation in IFT74, inherited under a recessive paradigm, defining a candidate BBS locus. Our data suggest that CNVs contribute pathogenic alleles to a substantial fraction of BBS-affected individuals and highlight how either deletions or point mutations in discrete splice isoforms can induce hypomorphic mutations in genes otherwise intolerant to deleterious variation. Our data also suggest that CNV analyses and resequencing studies unbiased for previous mutational burden is necessary to delineate the complexity of disease architecture.  aPublisher supplied data 0aciliopathy 0aoligogenic disease 0amechanism of rearrangements 0azebrafish model1 aFrangakis, Stephan1 aCarvalho, Claudia M.B.1 aRichardson, Ellen B.1 aMcFadden, Kelsey A.1 aWiller, Jason R.1 aPehlivan, Davut1 aLiu, Pengfei1 aPediaditakis, Igor L.1 aSabo, Aniko1 aLewis, Richard Alan1 aBanin, Eyal1 aLupski, James R.1 aDavis, Erica E.1 aKatsanis, Nicholas0 tAmerican journal of human genetics.g2016 Aug. 04, v. 99 p.318-336dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Society of Human Geneticsx0002-92977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2015.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03494naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015500175520175200330592002802082650004402110650002202154650003602176650001902212650002202231650001102253650001102264650002502275650002702300650001702327650001302344650002402357650003102381650002502412650003402437650003302471650001402504650002202518650003702540653001302577653001602590653002902606653002602635653004002661700001502701700002102716700001902737773011302756856008602869852000902955655001202964IND60676750520221121123833.0200210e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067675052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Ankur Laxman13aAn overview of the influences of mechanical and chemical processing on sugarcane bagasse ash characterisation as a supplementary cementitious material  aRecent researchers are giving more importance to cut the practice of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) by replacing the cementitious properties with industrial by-products in construction materials as supplementary cementitious materials (SCM). Many researchers are using Sugarcane Bagasse Ash (SCBA) as SCM which is an industrial by-product. Generally, SCM are pozzolanic materials which are rich in alumina and silicate. Naturally these pozzolanic materials may not be cementitious, but had tendency to react with calcium hydroxide and water in order to form cementitious compounds. The present paper reviews the processing adopted on sugarcane bagasse ash in order to transform it into supplementary cementitious material. The procedure to develop the sugarcane bagasse ash as a pozzolanic material is planned through a structure. The chemical compositions and physical properties of SCBA from the various sources are has been discussed. Furthermore, the influence of grinding and calcination on the characterisation of sugarcane bagasse ash has been discussed. Basically, the characterisation of sugarcane bagasse ash were studied on the basis of physical properties, chemical properties and microstructural studies. This review paper focuses on micro analytical studies of SCBA samples with respect to X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Scanning electron microscope (SEM). The micro analytical investigation reveals that grinding made SCBA finer and calcination process had reduced the carbon the content in SCBA along with there is an increase in the amorphous reactivity as due to the increment in pozzolanic oxides, observed in X-ray fluorescence (XRF).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3acalcium hydroxide 3acarbon 3acement 3achemical composition 3aconstruction materials 3afluorescence 3agrinding 3aphysical properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3aprocessing chemistry 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilicates 3asugarcane bagasse 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aOverview 0aCalcination 0aMicro analytical studies 0aSugarcane bagasse ash 0aSupplementary cementitious material1 aSairam, V.1 aMuruganandam, L.1 aSrinivasan, K.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 245 p.118854-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1188543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245011100167300001800278520146900296592002801765650001901793650001401812650002601826650001901852650001601871650001501887650001801902650001801920650003701938700002201975700002201997700001702019700002302036700001902059700002002078700002602098773013202124856007802256852000902334655001202343IND60541270320221120065204.0160821e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054127032DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b008172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatterson, Joseph
P.10aObserving the Growth of Metal–Organic Frameworks by in Situ Liquid Cell Transmission Electron Microscopy  ap. 7322-7328.  aLiquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) can provide direct observations of solution-phase nanoscale materials, and holds great promise as a tool for monitoring dynamic self-assembled nanomaterials. Control over particle behavior within the liquid cell, and under electron beam irradiation, is of paramount importance for this technique to contribute to our understanding of chemistry and materials science at the nanoscale. However, this type of control has not been demonstrated for complex, organic macromolecular materials, which form the basis for all biological systems and all of polymer science, and encompass important classes of advanced porous materials. Here we show that by controlling the liquid cell membrane surface chemistry and electron beam conditions, the dynamics and growth of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) can be observed. Our results demonstrate that hybrid organic/inorganic beam-sensitive materials can be analyzed with LCTEM and, at least in the case of ZIF-8 dynamics, the results correlate with observations from bulk growth or other standard synthetic conditions. Furthermore, we show that LCTEM can be used to better understand how changes to synthetic conditions result in changes to particle size. We anticipate that direct, nanoscale imaging by LCTEM of MOF nucleation and growth mechanisms may provide insight into controlled MOF crystal morphology, domain composition, and processes influencing defect formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3achemistry 3acoordination polymers 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3amonitoring 3ananomaterials 3aparticle size 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aAbellan, Patricia1 aDenny, Michael S.1 aPark, Chiwoo1 aBrowning, Nigel D.1 aCohen, Seth M.1 aEvans, James E.1 aGianneschi, Nathan C.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 June 17, v. 137, no. 23 p.7322-7328dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b008173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01120naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009100160300002200251520018500273592002800458650002300486650001600509650001300525650001400538700001900552700001900571700001800590773012700608856007400735852000900809655001200818IND60641256920221120103341.0190505e20161114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064125692DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra20933e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSequeira, M.

However, there is an open question on the rationality and accuracy of the ammonia production amount in the presence of the sacrificial agent and Nessler’s reagent detection method. In this report, P25 TiO₂ is employed as a model photocatalyst and alcohol as sacrificial agent, and both Nessler’s reagent and cation exchange chromatography are employed as ammonia detection methods. The different ammonia production amount was found by the different detection method. HPLC and ¹H NMR results indicate that carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acetone) are produced in the reaction. When the carbonyl compound was added to the ammonia standard solution, the interference effect on the detection of ammonia was found in the Nessler’s reagent method. No interference effect was found in the cation exchange chromatography. Thus, the Nessler’s reagent is not suitable for ammonia detection in the presence of alcohol as the sacrificial agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3aalcohols 3aammonia 3acarbonyl compounds 3acation exchange chromatography 3aformaldehyde 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amodels 3anitrogen fixation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3atitanium dioxide 0aN2 fixation 0aSacrificial agent 0aNessler’s reagent 0aInterference effect 0aPhotocatalyst1 aWen, Yuanjing1 aQu, Dan1 aAn, Li1 aLuan, Shiliang1 aJiang, Wenshuai1 aZong, Xupeng1 aLiu, Xingyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9681-16461 aSun, Zaicheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7059-31770 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Mar. 04, v. 6, no. 4 p.5342-5348dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b001103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01688naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024001700099024003600116024003600152040001800188100001700206245007300223300001600296520038700312592002800699650001300727650000900740650001100749650002300760650002500783650000900808650001000817650001200827650001600839650002500855650000900880650002200889650001100911650000900922650002100931650002200952700001700974700003100991773011601022852000901138856008301147655001201230991594317390742620221116233019.0190604e19760701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7690842722DNAL7 a9666982pmid7 a10.1258/0023677767810351252doi4 a0023-6772(19760701)10:3L.291;1-  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolls, B.

More particularly, their function in inner ear specification has been widely described. However, little is known about the direct downstream targets and, so far, no global approaches have been performed to identify these target genes in this particular tissue. RESULTS: Here we present an original bioinformatics pipeline composed of comparative genomics, database querying and text mining tools, which is designed to rapidly and specifically discover PAX2/5/8 direct downstream targets involved in inner ear development. We provide evidence supported by experimental validation in medaka fish that brain 2 (POU domain, class 3, transcription factor 2), claudin-7, secretory pathway component sec31-like and meteorin-like precursor are novel direct downstream targets of PAX2/5/8. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the power of extensive mining of public data repositories using bioinformatics methods to provide answers for a specific biological question. It furthermore demonstrates how the usage of such a combinatorial approach is advantageous for the biologist in terms of experimentation time and costs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abioinformatics 3abrain 3adatabases 3aears 3afish 3agenes 3agenomics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aBajoghli, Baubak1 aAghaallaei, Narges1 aEttwiller, Laurence1 aGaudan, Sylvain1 aWittbrodt, Beate1 aCzerny, Thomas1 aWittbrodt, Joachim0 tGenome biology.g2008 Oct., v. 9, no. 10 p.2007-2007dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-10-r1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05653naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006500155245023900220500001900459520378000478592002804258650001104286650002704297650001504324650002304339650001504362650001804377650003104395650001504426650001704441650001704458651001304475653001404488653001304502653002204515653001204537653001704549653001904566653001304585653001104598700001704609700002604626700002404652700002104676700006504697700002004762700001704782700001804799700002104817700002604838700001504864773009704879856009004976852000905066655001205075IND60733283520221123015823.0210527e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073328352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1059102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalik, Muhammad Wasif1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7370-894810aUse of public health emergency operations center (PH-EOC) and adaptation of incident management system (IMS) for efficient inter-sectoral coordination and collaboration for effective control of Dengue fever outbreak in Pakistan - 2019  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPublic Health Emergency Operations Center (PH-EOC) and Incident Management System (IMS) provides a platform for inter-sectoral coordination, and collaboration to enhance efficiency of response activities and help in effective control of disease outbreaks. Dengue fever (DF) is an emerging serious public health threat with a potential to transform into a public health emergency. Pakistan faced a heavy outbreak of Dengue fever (DF) from August to December 2019. National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad activated its Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PH-EOC) with an objective to implement principles and practices of IMS for control of the outbreak. The challenges during inter-sectoral collaboration for response activities were also identified. PH-EOC was activated on 16th September 2019, and remained operational for next 81 days till 05th December 2019. Incident management structure, incident action plan (IAP), and risk communication plan was developed and executed during this phase. Daily morning and evening meetings were held during all operational days. Federal and provincial health departments, district health offices (DHO), and government/private hospitals were coordinated for collection of the data pertaining to Dengue confirmed cases and deaths. As of 05th December 2019, a total of 52,877 confirmed Dengue cases were reported from all across Pakistan with maximum cases reported from Rawalpindi and Islamabad collectively i.e. 20,988 (40%), followed by Karachi 14,768 (28%), and Peshawar 2,699 (5%), while AJK reported 1,690 (3%). A total of 92 deaths happened all across Pakistan, out of which 43 (47%) happened in Karachi, 23 (25%) in Rawalpindi, and 22 (24%) in Islamabad. The response was coordinated through NIH based PH-EOC, but was carried out by relevant federal and provincial district health offices, vector surveillance programs, dengue control programs and sanitation departments respectively. As a part of response plan, vector surveillance, larva source management, and insecticidal spraying i.e. both fogging and indoor residual spraying activities were carried out in hotspots or the areas where confirmed cases were reported. Sanitation departments daily reported the removal of additional 80–100 ton of solid waste from hotspot areas. Hospitals were coordinated for reporting of isolation of DF patients and provision of quality clinical management for admitted patients. The International Federation for Red Cross/Crescent conducted community awareness, and covered 28,800 households in affected areas of Islamabad. Conversely, the DF outbreak was controlled 02-03 weeks ahead of previous years trends. All the coordinated activities were incorporated in a daily situation report (SitRep) and this was widely distributed among all the stakeholders through emails. Additionally, the data was displayed on the dashboard in PH-EOC. The data dashboard at PH-EOC served as an information management hub that visually mapped, tracked, analyzed, and displayed clusters of DF cases and hotspots. Accordingly, SitRep substantiated as the main reporting tool to monitor response activities initiated by rapid response teams at the national and subnational level. The inter-sectoral coordinating efforts made among concerned line departments resulted in a timely response leading to effective handling of a national public health threat. The information distilled from this experience was that the early and judicious activation of PH-EOC with adaptation of IMS under decision making leadership resulted in a well-managed and prompt response executed by different departments/stakeholders, and effective control of the outbreak before its transformation into a public health event/emergency of national or international concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3adengue 3ainformation management 3aleadership 3amanagement systems 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3arisk communication process 3asanitation 3asolid wastes 3astakeholders 3aPakistan 0aEmergency 0aResponse 0aManagement system 0aControl 0aDengue fever 0aInter-sectoral 0aIncident 0aPH-EOC1 aIkram, Aamer1 aSafdar, Rana Muhammad1 aAnsari, Jamil Ahmed1 aKhan, Mumtaz Ali1 aRathore, Tayyab Razzi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6581-12161 aAshraf, Nosheen1 aBasry, Rabia1 aWaqar, Wajiha1 aTahir, Majid Ali1 aQamar, Muhammad Akram1 aAhmed, H.,0 tActa tropica.g2021 July, v. 219 p.105910-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2021.1059103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009200171520143600263592002801699650002501727650001901752650001601771650001501787650001101802650001301813650002601826650001101852650001701863650002501880650001701905653002301922653002501945653003501970653002702005653002202032700002402054700001802078700002102096700002402117773011302141856008602254852000902340655001202349IND60676750920221123022654.0200405e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067675092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1190722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilani, Rodrigo10aPromoting social development in developing countries through solar thermal power plants  aRenewable Energy development can generate co-benefits, such as jobs, income, and economic output. Concentrated Solar Power technology is a key technology for the electric power sector decarbonization as it generates dispatchable electricity, while also creates direct, indirect and induced jobs. Using an innovative methodology, this study estimates the socioeconomic co-benefits of Concentrated Solar Power deployment in a developing country, where most of its potential is located in sites with low-income population. First, local content scenarios were defined based on the assessment of the installed and idle capacities of the country’s industry (at the national and local levels) throughout the Concentrated Solar Power value chain. Then, these scenarios are applied to an interregional Input-Output model to estimate direct, indirect and induced jobs, income and economic output generated by the deployment of a 300 MW solar thermal programme. Findings refer to the regional and national levels, emphasizing that the analysis of Concentrated Solar Power impacts should focus on the mesoscale (regional level instead of national levels only). Depending on the local content scenario, findings show that the proposed Concentrated Solar Power development could generate between 45.40 and 61.21 jobs (direct, indirect and induced) per MW installed, and 0.94 to 1.29 million of United States Dollar (income) per MW installed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aelectric power 3aelectricity 3aemployment 3aincome 3aindustry 3alow-income population 3amodels 3apower plants 3asolar thermal energy 3asupply chain 0aBrazilian industry 0aLocal content policy 0aConcentrated solar power (CSP) 0aSocio-economic impacts 0aIndustrial policy1 aCaiado Couto, Lilia1 aSoria, Rafael1 aSzklo, Alexandre1 aLucena, André F.P.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 246 p.119072-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1190723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245012800164300001800292520209400310592002802404650000802432650001902440650001702459650002502476650001802501650001702519650001002536650001602546650001702562650000902579650001102588650001302599650001502612650001302627650001602640650001402656650001502670650001702685700001602702700001902718700001602737700001902753700001702772700002202789700002402811700001702835773013202852856007802984852000903062655001203071IND60541270620221120065049.0160821e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054127062DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b014572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Chun Kit
K.12aA Gold@Polydopamine Core–Shell Nanoprobe for Long-Term Intracellular Detection of MicroRNAs in Differentiating Stem Cells  ap. 7337-7346.  aThe capability of monitoring the differentiation process in living stem cells is crucial to the understanding of stem cell biology and the practical application of stem-cell-based therapies, yet conventional methods for the analysis of biomarkers related to differentiation require a large number of cells as well as cell lysis. Such requirements lead to the unavoidable loss of cell sources and preclude real-time monitoring of cellular events. In this work, we report the detection of microRNAs (miRNAs) in living human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by using polydopamine-coated gold nanoparticles (Au@PDA NPs). The PDA shell facilitates the immobilization of fluorescently labeled hairpin DNA strands (hpDNAs) that can recognize specific miRNA targets. The gold core and PDA shell quench the fluorescence of the immobilized hpDNAs, and subsequent binding of the hpDNAs to the target miRNAs leads to their dissociation from Au@PDA NPs and the recovery of fluorescence signals. Remarkably, these Au@PDA–hpDNA nanoprobes can naturally enter stem cells, which are known for their poor transfection efficiency, without the aid of transfection agents. Upon cellular uptake of these nanoprobes, we observe intense and time-dependent fluorescence responses from two important osteogenic marker miRNAs, namely, miR-29b and miR-31, only in hMSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation and living primary osteoblasts but not in undifferentiated hMSCs and 3T3 fibroblasts. Strikingly, our nanoprobes can afford long-term tracking of miRNAs (5 days) in the differentiating hMSCs without the need of continuously replenishing cell culture medium with fresh nanoprobes. Our results demonstrate the capability of our Au@PDA–hpDNA nanoprobes for monitoring the differentiation status of hMSCs (i.e., differentiating versus undifferentiated) via the detection of specific miRNAs in living stem cells. Our nanoprobes show great promise in the investigation of the long-term dynamics of stem cell differentiation, identification and isolation of specific cell types, and high-throughput drug screening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abone formation 3acell culture 3acell differentiation 3aculture media 3adissociation 3adrugs 3afibroblasts 3afluorescence 3agold 3ahumans 3amicroRNA 3amonitoring 3ananogold 3aosteoblasts 3ascreening 3astem cells 3atransfection1 aLi, Jinming1 aWei, Kongchang1 aXu, Yang J.1 aHo, Lok Wai C.1 aZhu, Meiling1 aTo, Kenneth

V-shaped squaraines containing carboxy group on the indolenine moiety and 4-phenyl-2-cyanoacrylic acid groups on the carbazole cores as anchoring groups for chemical adsorption onto TiO₂ were synthesized by the utilization of Stille cross-coupling as a key reaction. Although conventional squaraine dyes show typically narrow absorption bands, V-shaped squaraine dyes exhibited split absorption bands due to the intramolecular exciton coupling and thereby enabled the absorption of a broad range of light. The exciton coupling between squaraine chromophores obliquely installed in the molecule was theoretically supported by the Kasha exciton coupling model, in which the coupling energy was well-fitted with the experimental absorption spectra. As the result of intramolecular exciton coupling, the DSSCs based on exciton-coupled squaraine dyes exhibited a spectral response in a much wider range compared to that of a conventional linear counterpart, giving the higher energy conversion efficiency in comparison to that of the single chromophoric counterpart.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3across-coupling reactions 3adyes 3aenergy conversion 3amodels 3amoieties 3asolar cells 3aspectral analysis 3atitanium dioxide1 aNguyen, Tay V.1 aKuwano, Yuki1 aChen, Xixi1 aMiyanaga, Kyohei1 aNakazumi, Hiroyuki1 aYagi, Shigeyuki1 aSoman, Suraj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3535-81791 aAjayaghosh, Ayyappanpillai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8574-53910 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Sept. 05, v. 122, no. 38 p.21745-21754dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b061313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02196naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010200153300002200255520114600277592002801423650003401451650001601485650001201501650001601513700001201529700001301541700001701554700001701571700001901588700001301607700001501620773012701635856007501762852000901837655001201846IND60641257320221120103224.0210813e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064125732DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra20945a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Ping10aEffective optimization of emitters and surface passivation for nanostructured silicon solar cells  ap. 104073-104081.  aUsing a black silicon surface is a promising way to minimize the optical loss of solar cells; however, the strength of low optical loss is partially diminished due to an increase in surface recombination of nanostructured silicon surfaces. In this paper, we study the recombination mechanism of nanostructured silicon surfaces. Experimental results show that the loss in efficiency of nanostructured silicon solar cells is greatly dominated by the increased surface recombination and Auger recombination. In order to suppress the carrier recombination through the nanostructured surfaces, we developed a technique to modify the surface morphology and the doping concentration of the emitter. By adopting an optimized SiO₂/SiNX passivation scheme, we obtained a compromise between low emitter recombination velocities and low reflectance. Remarkable gains of 3.7% on average efficiency, 34 mV on open circuit voltage, 3.65 mA cm⁻² on short circuit current density, and 4.65% on FF were obtained, comparing with the black silicon solar cells fabricated by a standard industrial process. A best solar cell of 18.5% efficiency was achieved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3areflectance 3asilicon 3asolar cells1 aWei, Yi1 aTan, Xin1 aLi, Xiaoxuan1 aWang, Yuxuan1 aZhao, Zengchao1 aYuan, Ze1 aLiu, Aimin0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 6, no. 106 p.104073-104081dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra20945a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245012700171300002000298520145200318592002801770650001301798650001301811650001301824650001001837650000901847650001101856650004401867650002301911650001101934650002001945700005501965700002402020700005902044700005802103700001602161773013802177856008002315852000902395655001202404IND60614633320181121000000.0181002e20180821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061463332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b061622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradtmüller, Henrik10aStructural Studies of NaPO₃–AlF₃ Glasses by High-Resolution Double-Resonance Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy  ap. 21579-21588.  aThe local structure of the model glasses (NaPO₃)₁–ₓ-(AlF₃)ₓ (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.4), prepared by standard melt-cooling, was extensively investigated by high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) including advanced double-resonance techniques. This glass system offers the opportunity of studying five different heteronuclear distance correlations (Na–F, Na–P, P–F, Al–F, and P–Al) by 10 distinct double-resonance experiments, involving all of the constituent elements present. ²⁷Al MAS-NMR data indicate that aluminum is predominantly six-coordinated. According to ²⁷Al{³¹P} and ²⁷Al{¹⁹F} rotational-echo double-resonance (REDOR) spectroscopic results, two to three Al–F and three to four Al–O–P linkages occur in these glasses, independent of composition x. ¹⁹F MAS-NMR spectra show the presence of terminal P-bound and Al-bound fluorine species. A small amount of fluorine bridging to two aluminum octahedra, which could be assigned based on ¹⁹F{²⁷Al} and ¹⁹F{³¹P} REDOR experiments, was also detected. ¹⁹F{²³Na} REDOR experiments indicate that the Al-bound terminal F atoms interact significantly more strongly with sodium ions than the P-bonded terminal F atoms, which is consistent with local charge considerations. On the basis of the detailed quantitative dipole–dipole coupling information obtained, a comprehensive structural model for these glasses is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3afluorine 3ageometry 3aglass 3aions 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysical chemistry 3asodium 3astable isotopes1 aZhang, Long1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7978-87741 ade Araujo, Carla C.1 aEckert, Hellmut1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6536-01171 aMoncke, Doris,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4197-55201 aEhrt, Doris0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Aug. 21, v. 122, no. 37 p.21579-21588dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b061623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245013100167300001600298520134400314592002801658650002301686650002601709650001701735650001601752650001801768650002801786650001101814650001601825650002601841650001901867650001401886650000901900700001701909700001401926773013101940856007402071852000902145655001202154IND60765063320221119030754.0220419e20111119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076506332DNAL7 a10.17221/3565-pse2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOpitz von Boberfeld, W.10aForage characteristics of Vicia sativa L. and Trifolium resupinatum L. in catch crop systems under Central European conditions  ap. 131-136.  aIn a field experiment the development of dry matter yield and forage quality of the catch crop Vicia sativa L. compared with Trifolium resupinatum L. was investigated and the suitability for cultivation in a mixture with Lolium multiflorum ssp. gaudinii (Parl.) Schinz et Keller was tested. The legumes and mixtures sowed in early July or August, respectively, were harvested at different dates from early September until late October/early November. The sowing date had the greatest impact on dry matter yield, crude protein content and net energy for lactation (= NEL). Vicia sativa yielded more dry matter than Trifolium resupinatum, especially at low temperatures and under short-day conditions. At late sowing Vicia sativa should be preferred to Trifolium resupinatum due to a better stability of yield. Vicia sativa had a&nbsp;higher crude protein content but a lower NEL than Trifolium resupinatum. In a mixture with Lolium multiflorum the differences in energy concentration between late sowed legumes were less distinct. In view of NEL, Trifolium resupinatum is superior at early sowing, whereas late sowed mixtures of Vicia sativa and Lolium multiflorum might enable it to feed fresh forage of acceptable quality until early November and in that way to save it for winter feeding and eliminate expensive sources of crude protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium multiflorum 3aTrifolium resupinatum 3aVicia sativa 3acatch crops 3acrude protein 3adry matter accumulation 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3afield experimentation 3aforage quality 3alactation 3asoil1 aBeckmann, E.1 aLaser, H.0 tPlant, Soil and Environment.g, v. 51, no. 3 p.131-136dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:17122x1214-11787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/3565-pse3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04297naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014500168520259800313592002802911650001102939650001902950650001702969650002302986650003203009650001603041650001403057650001103071650001403082650002403096650001103120650001603131650002103147650001703168650001103185650000903196650001703205650001303222650001603235650001303251650001503264653001703279653001603296653002003312653003203332653001503364700001303379700001603392700001703408700001403425700001703439700001403456700001703470773011303487856008603600852000903686655001203695IND60676751120221117173151.0210603e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067675112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Zhongfu10aDispatching optimization model of gas-electricity virtual power plant considering uncertainty based on robust stochastic optimization theory  aWith the rapid development of renewable energy, virtual power plant technology has gradually become a key technology to solve the large-scale development of renewable energy. This paper focuses on the stochastic dispatching optimization of gas-electric virtual power plant (GVPP). Based on this, wind power plant, photovoltaic power generation and convention gas turbines are used as the power generation side of GVPP. Power-to-gas (P2G) equipment and gas storage tank can realize the conversion and storage of electricity-gas energy. Price based demand response and incentive based demand response are introduced into the terminal load side to regulate the user’s electricity consumption behavior. GVPP bilaterally connects power network and natural gas network, which realizes the bidirectional flow of electricity-gas energy. Firstly, taking the maximization of economic benefits as the objective function, combined with the constraints of power balance, system reserve and so on, a dispatching optimization model of GVPP participating in multi-energy markets is constructed to determine the operation strategy. Secondly, wind, solar and other clean energy have the characteristics of random and fluctuation, which threaten the stable operation of the system. Therefore, a stochastic dispatching optimization model of GVPP considering wind and solar uncertainty is established based on robust stochastic optimization theory. Thirdly, the evaluation indicators of GVPP operation is determined, which can comprehensively evaluate the economic benefits, environmental benefits and system operation of virtual power plant. Finally, in order to verify the validity and feasibility of the model, a virtual power plant is selected for example analysis. The results show that: (1) After the implementation of price based demand response and incentive based demand response, the system load variance changes from 0.03 to 0.013. Through the comparison of load curves, it is found that demand response can play a role of peak-shaving and valley-filling and smooth the power load curve; (2) Stochastic optimization theory can overcome the uncertainty of wind and solar by setting different robust coefficients Γ which reflects the ability of the system to withstand risks; (3) The optimization effect after introducing the P2G subsystem makes the amount of abandoned clean energy close to zero. The operation risk of system is reduced, and the carbon emissions are reduced by 370 m³ too. The market space is expanded from electricity market mainly to natural gas market and carbon trading market.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon markets 3aclean energy 3aecosystem services 3aelectric energy consumption 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aequipment 3afinancial economics 3amodels 3anatural gas 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aprices 3arisk 3asolar energy 3aturbines 3auncertainty 3avariance 3awind power 0aPower-to-gas 0aUncertainty 0aMulti-objective 0aDistributed energy resource 0aEfficiency1 aFan, Wei1 aLi, Hanfang1 aDe, Gejirifu1 aMa, Jiale1 aYang, Shenbo1 aJu, Liwei1 aTan, Qingkun0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 247 p.119106-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245006700157300001800224520128600242592002801528650002201556650000801578650002201586650001701608650001501625650001201640650004401652650003101696650001101727650001401738700002201752700002001774700002201794773013201816856007801948852000902026655001202035IND60541270820221120065127.0160821e20150617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054127082DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b019062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuang, Jie10aLithium Pinacolone Enolate Solvated by Hexamethylphosphoramide  ap. 7347-7356.  aWe report the crystal structure of a substoichiometric, HMPA-trisolvated lithium pinacolone enolate tetramer (LiOPin)₄·HMPA₃ abbreviated as T₃. In this tetramer one HMPA binds to lithium more strongly than the other two causing a reduction in spatial symmetry with corresponding loss of C₃ symmetry. A variety of NMR experiments, including HMPA titration, diffusion coefficient-formula weight (D-FW) analysis, and other multinuclear one- and two-dimensional NMR techniques reveal that T₃ is the major species in hydrocarbon solution when more than 0.6 equiv of HMPA is present. Due to a small amount of moisture from HMPA or air leaking into the solution, a minor complex was identified and confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis as a mixed aggregate containing enolate, lithium hydroxide, and HMPA in a 4:2:4 ratio, [(LiOPin)₄·(LiOH)₂·HMPA₄], that we refer to as pseudo-T₄. A tetra-HMPA-solvated lithium cyclopentanone enolate tetramer was also prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction, leading to the conclusion that steric effects dominate the formation and solvation of the pinacolone aggregates. An unusual mixed aggregate consisting of pinacolone enolate, lithium diisopropyl amide, lithium oxide, and HMPA in the ratio 5:1:1:2 is also described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3acrystal structure 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydroxides 3alithium 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aoxides 3atitration1 aLiu, Qiyong Peter1 aHopson, Russell1 aWilliard, Paul G.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 June 17, v. 137, no. 23 p.7347-7356dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b019063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245008900176300001400265520085100279592002801130650004301158650001801201650001101219653000901230653000801239653000801247653000701255653000901262653001001271653000901281653000901290653000701299653000801306653000701314653001001321653000901331653000801340653000801348653000801356653001001364653001101374653003801385653003601423653002401459653001801483653004301501653002901544653002601573653002301599653001501622653003401637700001901671700002401690773010901714856008201823852000901905655001201914IND60602644920221119220743.0180711e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060264492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Ruiz, Víctor10aCore-shell particles lead the way to renewing high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 17-28.  aIn this review, we present the latest highlights and trends in the use of core-shell particles as stationary phases in columns for liquid chromatography (LC). These highly homogeneous particles have a diameter of 1.3–5 µm with a solid silica core and a porous surface that make their performance excellent compared to fully-porous particles. Use of these columns has been growing exponentially since their first large-scale manufacture in 2006, and they are an emerging trend in the analysis of biological, toxicological and pharmaceutically interesting compounds. We review the main theoretical aspects responsible for their surprisingly good chromatographic behavior and analytical features. We also summarize state-of-the-art analytical applications taking advantage of this column technology that is leading the current revolution in LC.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amanufacturing 3asilica 0aAOAC 0aDAD 0aDNA 0aFD 0aHETP 0aHILIC 0aHPLC 0aI.D. 0aLC 0aLLE 0aMS 0aNSAID 0aO.D. 0aPFP 0aSLE 0aSPE 0aUHPLC 0aUV-Vis 0aBiologically interesting compound 0aBiologically interesting matrix 0aCore-shell particle 0aFast analysis 0aHigh-performance liquid chromatography 0aHigh-throughput analysis 0aLiquid chromatography 0aMethod development 0aSeparation 0aSuperficially porous particle1 aOlives, Ana I.1 aMartín, M.

MuSK expression switches on during skeletal muscle differentiation. MuSK then becomes restricted to the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ, where it functions to cluster acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). The expression, activation and turnover of MuSK are each regulated by signals from the motor nerve terminal. MuSK forms the core of an emerging signalling complex that can be acutely activated by neural agrin (N-agrin), a heparin sulfate proteoglycan secreted from the nerve terminal. MuSK activation initiates complex intracellular signalling events that coordinate the local synthesis and assembly of synaptic proteins. The importance of MuSK as a synapse organiser is highlighted by cases of autoimmune myasthenia gravis in which MuSK autoantibodies can deplete MuSK from the postsynaptic membrane, leading to complete disassembly of the adult NMJ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aautoantibodies 3acholinergic receptors 3aheparin 3amammals 3amuscles 3anerve tissue 3aproteoglycans 3askeletal muscle 3asulfates 3asynapse 3atyrosine1 aFernandez, Kristine J.1 aMurata, Yui1 aMorsch, Marco1 aNgo, Shyuan T.1 aReddel, Stephen W.1 aNoakes, Peter G.1 aPhillips, William D.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2011 Mar., v. 43, no. 3 p.295-298dElsevier Ltdx1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2010.10.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02067naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245006100175300001600236500001900252520103600271592002801307650001201335650001401347650001101361650001501372650001101387653001201398653002201410653002201432653001101454700001601465773014101481856008601622852000901708655001201717IND60721207520221116174104.0201224e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072120752DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00008.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Lal Chandra10aMortality pattern of broilers in organized poultry farms  ap. 131-132.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present study was carried out on broiler chickens maintained at farmer's field under supervision of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Kotwa, Azamgarh, in 2013. Causative agents were listed and percent mortality was calculated during different seasons, viz. winter, summer and rainy seasons. Broiler chickens (0–8 weeks) were reared in deep litter system of management. The overall mortality pattern during 0–8 weeks revealed the highest mortality (63.53%) in rainy season, followed by summer (28.88%) and the lowest (7.58%) in winter. The highest (33.26%) mortality was observed due to omphalitis and significantly (P<0.05) influenced by season. Colibacillosis and Gumboro incidences were also significantly (P<0.05) influenced by season and the overall per cent mortality incidences were 25.45 and 8.87 respectively. Lichi and non specific causes for mortality were 16.88 and 15.51 per cent, respectively. From the present findings, it can be concluded that the Lichi and nonspecific causes of mortality remain higher in rainy season.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarmers 3amortality 3asummer 3awet season 3awinter 0aBroiler 0adisease incidence 0amortality pattern 0aseason1 aYadav, S.K.0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2017 Apr., v. 52, no. 1 p.131-132dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00008.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03777naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012700170300001600297520213200313592002802445650001602473650001402489650001002503650001302513650001102526650001502537650005202552650001902604650002202623650001302645651001202658653001702670653002802687653001302715653001402728700002802742700002002770700002302790700001702813700001802830700002102848700002002869700001902889700001802908700002102926700002102947700002202968700002402990773011503014856008503129852000903214655001203223IND60543908520221118071429.0190412e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054390852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDóró, Renáta10aLarge-scale whole genome sequencing identifies country-wide spread of an emerging G9P[8] rotavirus strain in Hungary, 2012  ap. 495-512.  aWith the availability of rotavirus vaccines routine strain surveillance has been launched or continued in many countries worldwide. In this study relevant information is provided from Hungary in order to extend knowledge about circulating rotavirus strains. Direct sequencing of the RT-PCR products obtained by VP7 and VP4 genes specific primer sets was utilized as routine laboratory method. In addition we explored the advantage of random primed RT-PCR and semiconductor sequencing of the whole genome of selected strains. During the study year, 2012, we identified an increase in the prevalence of G9P[8] strains across the country. This genotype combination predominated in seven out of nine study sites (detection rates, 45–83%). In addition to G9P[8]s, epidemiologically major strains included genotypes G1P[8] (34.2%), G2P[4] (13.5%), and G4P[8] (7.4%), whereas unusual and rare strains were G3P[8] (1%), G2P[8] (0.5%), G1P[4] (0.2%), G3P[4] (0.2%), and G3P[9] (0.2%). Whole genome analysis of 125 Hungarian human rotaviruses identified nine major genotype constellations and uncovered both intra- and intergenogroup reassortment events in circulating strains. Intergenogroup reassortment resulted in several unusual genotype constellations, including mono-reassortant G1P[8] and G9P[8] strains whose genotype 1 (Wa-like) backbone gene constellations contained DS1-like NSP2 and VP3 genes, respectively, as well as, a putative bovine–feline G3P[9] reassortant strain. The conserved genomic constellations of epidemiologically major genotypes suggested the clonal spread of the re-emerging G9P[8] genotype and several co-circulating strains (e.g., G1P[8] and G2P[4]) in many study sites during 2012. Of interest, medically important G2P[4] strains carried bovine-like VP1 and VP6 genes in their genotype constellation. No evidence for vaccine associated selection, or, interaction between wild-type and vaccine strains was obtained. In conclusion, this study reports the reemergence of G9P[8] strains across the country and indicates the robustness of whole genome sequencing in routine rotavirus strain surveillance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA primers 3aRotavirus 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asemiconductors 3asequence analysis 3avaccines 3aHungary 0aSurveillance 0aWhole genome sequencing 0aGenotype 0aRotavirus1 aMihalov-Kovács, Eszter1 aMarton, Szilvia1 aLászló, Brigitta1 aDeák, Judit1 aJakab, Ferenc1 aJuhász, Ágnes,1 aKisfali, Péter1 aMartella, Vito1 aMelegh, Béla1 aMolnár, Péter,1 aSántha, Ildikó1 aSchneider, Ferenc1 aBányai, Krisztián0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Dec., v. 28 p.495-512dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245010300164300002000267520101900287592002801306650001501334650002201349650001201371650001501383650001601398700002001414700002201434700002301456700002201479773012501501856007401626852000901700655001201709IND60641257820221120103207.0190505e20161014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064125782DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra20956d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAriyarit, Atthaporn10aBoosting the optimization process of perovskite solar cells by partial sampling and kriging method  ap. 98052-98058.  aLead halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have been exhibiting high efficiency by using abundant materials and availability on flexible substrates with easy fabrication process. However, achieving the high-efficiency PVSCs is not easy due to multi-layered structure, difficulty to control the surface uniformity and crossover effects of controlling parameters, so the fast optimization process is very important for improving them. Here, we report the way for improving the optimum condition of perovskite layer by using a combination of the design of experiment (DoE), the interpolation prediction method and genetic algorithm (GA) optimization, which can reduce the cost and time consumed for experiments. To understand the effect of parameters we also characterized the property of materials such as crystalline structure. After the optimization and the characterization, we found the important factor to increase the efficiency of PVSCs and obtained efficiency at 8.87% through only 12 experimental samplings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acrystal structure 3akriging 3aprediction 3asolar cells1 aTakenaka, Issei1 aYoshikawa, Ryohei1 aGillot, Frédéric1 aShiratori, Seimei0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 14, v. 6, no. 100 p.98052-98058dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra20956d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02391naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007900167300001400246520097400260592002801234650000801262650002301270650003401293650001001327650002201337650002201359650004401381650001101425650001001436650001001446650001001456653001501466653001001481653001401491653001301505653003101518653001001549653001001559653001701569653002401586653002301610700003901633700002501672773010901697856008201806852000901888655001201897IND60602645220221119220849.0180711e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060264522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2014.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZapata, Félix10aEmerging spectrometric techniques for the forensic analysis of body fluids  ap. 53-63.  aBody fluids are evidence of great interest in forensics because they allow identification of individuals through the study of DNA. After reviewing the tests and the methods that are currently being used by forensic practitioners for the detection of body fluids (e.g., blood, semen, saliva, vaginal fluid, urine and sweat), and after showing their main drawbacks and limitations, this work focuses on the review of emerging spectrometric techniques applied for the forensic analysis of body fluids. These techniques include the use of ultraviolet-visible, infrared (IR), Raman, X-ray fluorescence and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry for investigating blood, semen, saliva, urine, vaginal fluid or sweat. Although all these spectrometric techniques seem to have a high potential to differentiate body fluids prior to DNA extraction, IR and Raman spectroscopy have shown the most promising results for discriminating stains from body fluids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3ablood 3aforensic sciences 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asaliva 3asemen 3asweat 3aurine 0aBody fluid 0aBlood 0aForensics 0aInfrared 0aNuclear magnetic resonance 0aRaman 0aSemen 0aSpectrometry 0aUltraviolet-visible 0aX-ray fluorescence1 aFernández de la Ossa, Ma Ángeles1 aGarcía-Ruiz, Carmen0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2015 Jan., v. 64 p.53-63dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2014.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245014800176520152400324592002801848650002601876650002301902650003201925650002601957650001201983650001001995650002602005650001602031650001602047650002202063650001602085650002402101650002602125650001902151651000902170653002602179653001502205653003002220653002502250653000902275700001602284700003002300773011302330856008602443852000902529655001202538IND60676751820221120034057.0210603e20200220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067675182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Mezeini, Nawal K.10aInvestigating the efficiency of greenhouse production in Oman: A two-stage approach based on Data Envelopment Analysis and double bootstrapping  aThis paper investigates the performance of greenhouse production in the Sultanate of Oman in two-stages. In the first stage, Data Envelopment Analysis is used to estimate the efficiency of greenhouse farmers and pinpoint the wasted resources. The efficiency results show that 79% of greenhouse farmers are technically inefficient, with an average efficiency score of 73%. Moreover, slack analysis indicates that water and electricity consumption both exceed the efficiency norm by up to 54% and 46%, respectively. The second stage aims to identify the contextual (socioeconomic and environmental) factors that influence the efficiency of greenhouse farms. This is accomplished using a truncated regression model along with a double bootstrapping mechanism found in the greenhouse production literature. Results reveal that ground water salinity is the environmental factor that has the most negative impact on greenhouse efficiency. The socioeconomic factor that has the most positive effect on greenhouse efficiency is the secondary occupation of the farmer; especially when that occupation pertains to the government agricultural sector. To enhance efficiency of greenhouse farms two main courses of action are recommended. On the greenhouse farmer’s side, training programs are needed to educate the farmers on methods that promote more rational resource consumption. For policies and regulations, a regulated water framework is essential, as well as an appropriate revision of the government’s subsidy policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aeducation programs 3aelectric energy consumption 3aenvironmental factors 3afarmers 3afarms 3agreenhouse production 3agreenhouses 3agroundwater 3aissues and policy 3aoccupations 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic factors 3awater salinity 3aOman 0aGreenhouse production 0aEfficiency 0aData envelopment analysis 0aDouble bootstrapping 0aOman1 aOukil, Amar1 aAl-Ismaili, Abdulrahim M.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Feb. 20, v. 247 p.119160-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.1191603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245012400174300001600298520158300314592002801897650001401925650001401939650001101953650002501964650001201989650001402001650001002015650002202025650001502047650001402062650001002076650002202086650001502108651001402123653002402137653001302161653001502174653001402189653001002203653000902213700002002222700002302242700001902265700001802284700001802302773011502320856008502435852000902520655001202529IND60543908920221118071447.0190412e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054390892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaynes, Benjamin T.10aUnexpected absence of genetic separation of a highly diverse population of hookworms from geographically isolated hosts  ap. 192-200.  aThe high natal site fidelity of endangered Australian sea lions (Neophoca cinerea) along the southern Australian coast suggests that their maternally transmitted parasitic species, such as hookworms, will have restricted potential for dispersal. If this is the case, we would expect to find a hookworm haplotype structure corresponding to that of the host mtDNA haplotype structure; that is, restricted among geographically separated colonies. In this study, we used a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase I mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) gene to investigate the diversity of hookworms (Uncinaria sanguinis) in N. cinerea to assess the importance of host distribution and ecology on the evolutionary history of the parasite. High haplotype (h=0.986) and nucleotide diversity (π=0.013) were seen, with 45 unique hookworm mtDNA haplotypes across N. cinerea colonies; with most of the variation (78%) arising from variability within hookworms from individual colonies. This is supported by the low genetic differentiation co-efficient (GST=0.007) and a high gene flow (Nm=35.25) indicating a high migration rate between the populations of hookworms. The haplotype network demonstrated no clear distribution and delineation of haplotypes according to geographical location. Our data rejects the vicariance hypothesis; that female host natal site fidelity and the transmammary route of infection restrict hookworm gene flow between N. cinerea populations and highlights the value of studies of parasite diversity and dispersal to challenge our understanding of parasite and host ecology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOtariidae 3aUncinaria 3acoasts 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3afemales 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3ahookworms 3ahosts 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphilopatry 3aAustralia 0aAustralian sea lion 0aParasite 0aVicariance 0aDispersal 0amtDNA 0acox11 aMarcus, Alan D.1 aHiggins, Damien P.1 aGongora, Jaime1 aGray, Rachael1 aŠlapeta, Jan0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2014 Dec., v. 28 p.192-200dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2014.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245011400206300001300320506007600333520149300409592002801902506003701930650001401967650001401981650002801995650003802023650002002061650001002081650001102091650002102102650004302123650002602166650002602192700001702218700001602235700002602251700001802277700002402295700002002319700002402339700002002363700001702383773010602400856008102506852000902587655001202596IND60119599720221207142724.0141214e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011959972DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2008-9-11-r1662doi7 aPMC26144982pmcid7 a190327752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArora, Shilpi10aEgr1 regulates the coordinated expression of numerous EGF receptor target genes as identified by ChIP-on-chip  ap. 2028.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: UV irradiation activates the epidermal growth factor receptor, induces Egr1 expression and promotes apoptosis in a variety of cell types. We examined the hypothesis that Egr1 regulates genes that mediate this process by use of a chip-on-chip protocol in human tumorigenic prostate M12 cells. RESULTS: UV irradiation led to significant binding of 288 gene promoters by Egr1. A major functional subgroup consisted of apoptosis related genes. The largest subgroup of 24 genes belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor-signal transduction pathway. Egr1 promoter binding had a significant impact on gene expression of target genes. Conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative real time PCR were used to validate promoter binding and expression changes. Small interfering RNA experiments were used to demonstrate the specific role of Egr1 in gene regulation. UV stimulation promotes growth arrest and apoptosis of M12 cells and our data clearly show that a downstream target of the epidermal growth factor receptor, namely Egr1, mediates this apoptotic response. Our study also identified numerous previously unknown targets of Egr1. These include FasL, MAX and RRAS2, which may play a role in the apoptotic response/growth arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that M12 cells undergo Egr1-dependent apoptotic response upon UV stimulation and led to the identification of downstream targets of Egr1, which mediate epidermal growth factor receptor function.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3achromatin 3aepidermal growth factor 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aprecipitin tests 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asmall interfering RNA 3aultraviolet radiation1 aWang, Yipeng1 aJia, Zhenyu1 aVardar-Sengul, Saynur1 aMunawar, Ayla1 aDoctor, Kutbuddin S1 aBirrer, Michael1 aMcClelland, Michael1 aAdamson, Eileen1 aMercola, Dan0 tGenome biology.g2008 Nov., v. 9, no. 11 p.2028-2028dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2008-9-11-r1663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245015200173300001600325500001900341520108400360592002801444650002201472650001801494650001801512650001601530650002401546650002401570650002001594650001601614650001601630650001601646650002101662650001201683650001301695650001101708650001401719653002701733653001601760653001401776653001901790700001501809700001701824700001301841700001401854700002001868773014101888856008602029852000902115655001202124IND60721208220221116173922.0201224e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072120822DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00035.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivas, Gurram10aSupplementation of herbal immunomodulators on the performance and cost economics of Japanese quails (Coutrinix coturnix japanica) under heat stress  ap. 161-164.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of different herbal immune modulators on the performance and cost economics of broilers.

However, identification of metal-protein complexes remains challenging since it addresses non-covalently bound species that may dissociate during analysis, due to their separation from their medium or to the interactions implicit in the separation. Many strategies, usually involving separation techniques coupled with elemental detection, have been investigated to overcome technical issues that hamper the identification and the characterization of metal-protein complexes. This review focuses on the separation techniques used in this field and their impact on dissociation of metal-protein complexes. We discuss metal losses induced by both the separation system and disequilibrium effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissociation 3ametals 3aproteins 0aAN-PAGE 0aBN-PAGE 0aBSA 0aCA 0aCE 0aDCT1 0aESI/MS 0aHILIC 0aHSA 0aHSAB 0aICP-AES 0aICP-MS 0aIEC 0aIEF 0aIPG 0aLA 0aPAGE 0aPIXE 0aRPLC 0aSDS 0aSEC 0aSOD 0aTf 0aUHPLC 0aChromatography 0aDissociation 0aElectrophoresis 0aIdentification 0aMetal-binding protein 0aMetallic complex 0aMetalloproteomics 0aMetal-protein complex 0aPerturbation 0aSeparation1 aHuynh, Thi Ngoc Suong1 aHébrant, Marc0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2015 Jan., v. 64 p.64-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2014.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245009400212300001600306520130800322592002801630653001601658653001701674653002501691653001801716653002401734653001801758653002201776700001901798700002201817700002001839700002101859700002001880700001901900700002101919700002501940700001901965700002601984700002302010700002402033700002602057773013902083856008202222852000902304655001202313IND60558335520221120152240.0161115e20160804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055833552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.07.0032doi7 aPMC49741062pmcid7 a274535792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarding, Brian N.10aMutations in Citron Kinase Cause Recessive Microlissencephaly with Multinucleated Neurons  ap. 511-520.  aPrimary microcephaly is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by a reduction in brain size as a result of defects in the proliferation of neural progenitor cells during development. Mutations in genes encoding proteins that localize to the mitotic spindle and centrosomes have been implicated in the pathogenicity of primary microcephaly. In contrast, the contractile ring and midbody required for cytokinesis, the final stage of mitosis, have not previously been implicated by human genetics in the molecular mechanisms of this phenotype. Citron kinase (CIT) is a multi-domain protein that localizes to the cleavage furrow and midbody of mitotic cells, where it is required for the completion of cytokinesis. Rodent models of Cit deficiency highlighted the role of this gene in neurogenesis and microcephaly over a decade ago. Here, we identify recessively inherited pathogenic variants in CIT as the genetic basis of severe microcephaly and neonatal death. We present postmortem data showing that CIT is critical to building a normally sized human brain. Consistent with cytokinesis defects attributed to CIT, multinucleated neurons were observed throughout the cerebral cortex and cerebellum of an affected proband, expanding our understanding of mechanisms attributed to primary microcephaly.  aPublisher supplied data 0acytokinesis 0aneurogenesis 0aprimary microcephaly 0alissencephaly 0aautosomal recessive 0acitron kinase 0asplicing mutation1 aMoccia, Amanda1 aDrunat, Séverine1 aSoukarieh, Omar1 aTubeuf, Hélène1 aChitty, Lyn S.1 aVerloes, Alain1 aGressens, Pierre1 aEl Ghouzzi, Vincent1 aJoriot, Sylvie1 aDi Cunto, Ferdinando1 aMartins, Alexandra1 aPassemard, Sandrine1 aBielas, Stephanie L.0 tAmerican journal of human genetics.g2016 Aug. 04, v. 99 p.511-520dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Society of Human Geneticsx0002-92977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010700168300001600275500001900291520146300310592002801773650001801801650001601819650001901835650001501854650000901869650001101878650001201889650001601901650001601917653001601933653001601949653001401965700002001979700001901999700001702018700001602035700001702051773014102068856008602209852000902295655001202304IND60721208520221117191707.0201224e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072120852DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00048.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, A.B.10aEffect of enzyme supplementation on egg production performance of two strains of White Leghorn chicken  ap. 178-183.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExperiment was conducted on 360 pedigreed females each of IWN and IWP strains of White Leghorn hens. Economic traits measured include body weight (BW), total egg number (TEN), average egg weights (EW), total feed consumption per bird (TFC), feed consumption per egg produced (FCE), feed cost per egg produced as ECOST, egg weight (EW). As dietary energy level was increased, BW was increased significantly (P < 0.05) at 40, 64 and 72 weeks of age. Energy levels (2400, 2550 and 2700 kcal ME) did not affect TEN. As dietary energy level was increased, TFC and FCE was decreased (P< 0.05) at 40, 64 and 72 weeks of age. EW₇₂ at 2400 kcal ME level differed significantly (P< 0.05) from EW₇₂ at other ME levels. Enzyme supplementation reduced (P< 0.05) the TFC₆₄, TFC₇₂, FCE64 and ECOST64. Effects of energy levels and enzyme supplementation were found significant (P< 0.05) for TFC₄₀ at 2400 and 2550 kcal ME levels but non significant for TFC₆₄ and TFC₇₂. At 2400, 2550 and 2700 kcal ME levels, TFC₆₄ and TFC₇₂ were lower in enzyme group than control group. Effects of energy levels and enzyme supplementation were found significant (P< 0.05) for FCE₆₄, ECOST₆₄ and ECOST₇₂ at 2550 kcal ME level but not for egg weight. It can be concluded that enzyme supplementation in layer diets can result in better production in White Leghorn and the layer birds can be economical reared low energy (2400 kcal ME/kg) diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWhite Leghorn 3abody weight 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3afeed intake 3afeed prices 0aFeed enzyme 0aFeed energy 0aEconomics1 aKhanna, Kuldeep1 aSavaliya, F.P.1 aPaleja, H.I.1 aJoshi, R.S.1 aHirani, N.D.0 tIndian journal of poultry science.g2017 Aug., v. 52, no. 2 p.178-183dIndian Poultry Science AssociationwJournal:1944x0974-81807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-8180.2017.00048.43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03456naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245017200172500001900344520181200363592002802175650001102203650001702214650001102231650001202242650002002254650001302274650001402287650002502301650003102326650003302357650001502390650001002405650002502415650001502440650001502455651001302470651001302483653001102496653000902507653001902516653001702535653001602552700001902568700002102587700002502608700002002633700002602653700003102679773009802710856008502808852000902893655001202902IND60723870820221120042453.0210311e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072387082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.1023792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartins, Pedro R.10aTerrain units, land use and land cover, and gross primary productivity of the largest fluvial basin in the Brazilian Amazonia/Cerrado ecotone: The Araguaia River basin  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIntegrity of most of tropical wetlands is threatened because they are often considered freely available resources of land and water. The Bananal, in the Araguaia River Basin, and the Pantanal in the Paraguai River Basin, are the two largest Brazilian wetlands influenced by the tropical seasonal floods. The purpose of this study is to integrate landscape structural and functional factors with the GPP dynamics over different terrain units present in the Araguaia River Basin. The study was conducted through the integration of different databases, including the topographic domains, protected areas and indigenous lands; land use and land cover map (year 2016); time series of GPP derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor (period of 2000–2015); Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation models (DEM); and precipitation data produced by the WorldClim version 2 dataset. GPP time series were processed using statistical methods of time series decomposition. The results show that, in the alluvial domains, we find grasslands (mostly), alluvial forests with the highest levels of GPP, and the largest legally protected areas. Spatial distribution of pasturelands across the entire basin is broad while croplands are concentrated mainly in geologically old and high plateaus. The time series analysis revealed the presence of intra- and inter-annual vegetation patterns and a continuous increase of GPP over time. The results contribute to the understanding of the linkages between land use changes and global carbon cycles by considering land use as a response of how the landscape is organized. The results may provide subsidies for public policies for the carbon budget equilibrium, conservation of biodiversity, and rational use of natural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3acarbon 3acerrado 3adata collection 3aecotones 3ageography 3aglobal carbon budget 3agross primary productivity 3aland use and land cover maps 3alandscapes 3aradar 3atime series analysis 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aAmazonia 3aPantanal 0aRelief 0aLULC 0aRemote sensing 0aCarbon sinks 0aTime series1 aSano, Edson E.1 aMartins, Eder S.1 aVieira, Ludgero C.G.1 aSalemi, Luiz F.1 aVasconcelos, Vinicius1 aCouto Júnior, Antônio F.0 tApplied geography.g2021 Feb., v. 127 p.102379-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11785x0143-62287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.1023793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245014800168520169200316592002802008650001802036650003402054651001002088653001002098653001502108653004302123653002602166700001802192700005502210700001502265700001302280700001502293700001702308773012002325856008802445852000902533655001202542IND60753052820221122130405.0211219e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075305282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1059182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qing14aThe spatiotemporal trends of PM2.5- and O3-related disease burden coincident with the reduction in air pollution in China between 2005 and 2017  aSignificant progress has been made in reducing air pollution across China after years of efforts. However, it remains uncertain as to how these changes in pollution have influenced disease burden. Furthermore, only limited data are available with regard to the spatiotemporal patterns of air pollution related disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) across China. Using multi-parameter and random-forest derived PM₂.₅ and O₃ concentrations from 2005 to 2017 and based on the updated non-linear integrated exposure-response functions (IERs), we estimated the county-level PM₂.₅- and O₃-related DALYs across China and explored the spatiotemporal trends. In 2017, the ambient PM₂.₅ and O₃ were estimated to cause 0.894 million premature deaths and 22.77 million DALYs in China. From 2005 to 2017, the DALYs related to PM₂.₅ declined across China, especially after 2013, although levels remained high. The DALYs related to O₃ are generally increasing, although at a lower rate when compared with PM₂.₅. Approximately 96.7% of the PM₂.₅-related DALYs, and 94.8% of the O₃-related DALYs, are from the southeast side of the Huhuanyong Line, of the country. The reduction of air pollution in China has led to a significant improvement in health. Higher related DALYs were observed in regions with dense populations and higher concentrations of PM₂.₅ and O₃. Different pollutants and related outcomes are associated with different spatial patterns and change trends. Strict regulatory policies, and coordinated and regional-specific measurements are needed to continually reduce air pollution and mitigate the health burden caused by air pollution in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3adisability-adjusted life year 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aOzone (O3) 0aDisability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) 0aSpatiotemporal trends1 aZhu, Huanhuan1 aXu, Huaiyue1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2170-33571 aLu, Kailai1 aBan, Jie1 aMa, Runmei1 aLi, Tiantian0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 Jan., v. 176 p.105918-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1059183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010200160300001800262520135700280592002801637650001901665650000801684650001401692650002401706650001701730650002101747653002301768653001401791653002801805700001401833700001401847700005801861773011201919856008302031852000902114655001202123IND60582834120221118054030.0220420e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058283412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2016.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Sen10aAssessing the relationship between a body shape index and mortality in a group of middle-aged men  ap. 1355-1359.  aRecently, a new anthropometric parameter emerged, namely A Body Shape Index (ABSI), which appears to be a major risk factor for mortality in the American and British populations. To the best of our knowledge, the relationship between ABSI and mortality was not studied previously in the middle-aged Chinese men. Therefore, we assessed the relationship based on a 15-year prospective study. In an urban community of Chengdu, 780 middle-aged Chinese men were included in 1992 and followed up for 15 years. During the follow-up, 29 subjects died (mortality rate: 3.7%), and ABSI tended to be linearly associated with mortality. The subjects could be categorized into five groups by the quintiles of baseline ABSI, as follows: the first quintile (Q1), the second quintile (Q2), the third quintile (Q3), the fourth quintile (Q4) and the fifth quintile (Q5). Across the quintiles, the mortality rates were 3.8%, 5.3%, 3.0%, 4.7% and 1.9% in Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 and Q5, respectively (pₜᵣₑₙd = 0.386). With the highest quintile (Q5) as reference, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses presented that ABSI was not associated with mortality. ABSI, a new anthropometric parameter, might not be associated with mortality in the middle-aged Chinese men. Further studies are needed to explore the specificities of ABSI in different populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChinese people 3amen 3amortality 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aurban population 0aA body shape index 0aMortality 0aAnthropometric measures1 aZheng, Yi1 aWang, Hua1 aChen, Xiaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4281-51820 tClinical nutrition.g2017 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.1355-1359dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164300001800295520135400313592002801667650001901695650002101714650002801735650002201763650002101785650001801806650001401824650002201838650001701860650001701877650001101894651001001905653002601915653003501941653001901976653004301995700002102038700002002059700001902079700002302098773015502121856008202276852000902358655001202367IND60746120020221120043935.0220207e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074612002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2021.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanping10aBarriers to sustainable food consumption and production in China: A fuzzy DEMATEL analysis from a circular economy perspective  ap. 1114-1129.  aThe global agri-food sector is in a dire need of transitioning into sustainable consumption and production patterns. The circular economy concept offers a viable pathway to improve resource efficiency and recover value from food loss and waste. Although China has made circular economy a strategic component of its national development strategy, it has faced multiple barriers which persisted in the full-scale implementation of sustainable food consumption and production. We aimed to empirically investigate these barriers, based on data from three key stakeholder groups in the food supply chains: the food processors, sales and distribution firms, and consumers. We quantified the cause-and-effect relationships among barriers by the fuzzy decision making-trial and evaluation laboratory analysis (Fuzzy DEMATEL) technique. All groups identify weak enforcement of environmental regulations and lack of environmental education and accountability as key cause barriers in China. Our results suggest that policy level changes include enhanced regulatory attention, and new educational initiatives will be required in China. Managers should focus on waste separation and gaining economies of scale. Together, these initiatives will help promote sustainable consumption and production for a paradigm shift to a circular agri-food supply chain system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccountability 3acircular economy 3aenvironmental education 3afood availability 3afood consumption 3afood industry 3afood loss 3aissues and policy 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3awastes 3aChina 0aCircular supply chain 0aFood loss and waste management 0aSustainability 0aSustainable consumption and production1 aWood, Lincoln C.1 aVenkatesh, V.G.1 aZhang, Abraham1 aFarooque, Muhammad0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 Oct., v. 28 p.1114-1129dElsevier LtdaInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2021.07.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02252naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005300094040001800147100001900165245009100184300001400275506002800289520086800317592002801185506003701213650001101250650002201261650002201283650001201305650002401317650002601341650001401367650001901381650001201400651001401412653001501426653001401441653001301455653000901468653001801477700002401495700002001519773015801539856010001697852000901797655001201806IND60784744720221207113037.0170518e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474472DNAL7 ahttp://dx.doi.org/10.15608/stjssa.v13i1.4852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuswati, Denah10aRole of coastal sediment on soil nutrient availability and oil palm yield at peatlands  ap. 31-40.  aResource is Open Access  aPeatlands which is limited in chemical, physical and ecology require appropriate management for oil palm plantation. Coastal sediment as an ameliorant in peatlands increased productivity some crops. This study aims determining the effect of the doses of coastal sediment as ameliorant on peatlands to the availability of N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Na oil palm plantations. This research was performed in the area of oil palm plantation in Kubu Raya district, Borneo, Indonesia. Experimental design employed randomized block design with 4 levels of coastal sediment doses (L), i.e. L0 = 0 t ha-1; L1 = 20 t ha-1; L2 = 40 t ha-1; L3 = 60 t ha-1 with three replication. The results showed that the application of coastal sediment at 40 t ha-1 in oil palm plantations significantly increased soil pH, availability of N, K, Ca and Mg, while P was not significantly different.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorneo 3aElaeis guineensis 3acoastal sediments 3aecology 3aexperimental design 3anutrient availability 3apeatlands 3asoil nutrients 3asoil pH 3aIndonesia 0aameliorant 0aKubu Raya 0aoil palm 0apeat 0asoil nutrient1 aCandra, Tino Orciny1 aYacoub, Yarlina0 tSains Tanah: Jurnal Penelitian Ilmu Tanah dan Agroklimatologi.g2016 June, v. 13, no. 1 p.31-40dSebelas Maret UniversitywJournal:27757x2356-14247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.15608/stjssa.v13i1.4853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245011200189300001600301520176200317592002802079650001502107650001802122650001002140650001102150650000902161650001602170650001302186650002702199650002802226650003502254650001002289650002902299650002602328650002602354650001202380650001102392650003102403650002002434650003802454650000902492650003602501650007402537650002802611650003602639650002802675650001902703650004202722650001502764700001802779700002002797700002302817700002502840700002102865700001702886700002402903700001802927700002302945700002702968700002902995773009403024856004803118852000903166655001203175IND4494160220221120023551.0150225e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449416022DNAL7 a216261742pmid7 a10.1007/s00335-011-9334-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourneuf, Emmanuelle10aGenetic and functional evaluation of MITF as a candidate gene for cutaneous melanoma predisposition in pigs  ap. 602-612.  aCutaneous melanoma arises from transformed melanocytes and is caused mainly by environmental effects such as ultraviolet radiation and to a lesser extent by predisposing genetic variants. Only a few susceptibility genes for cutaneous melanoma have been identified so far in human; therefore, animal models represent a valuable alternative for genetic studies of this disease. In a previous quantitative trait locus (QTL) study, several susceptibility regions were identified in a swine biomedical model, the MeLiM (Melanoblastoma-bearing Libechov minipig) pigs. This article details the fine-mapping of a QTL located on SSC13 (Sus scrofa chromosome 13) through an increase in marker density. New microsatellites were used to confirm the results of the first analysis, and MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) was selected as a candidate gene for melanoma development. A single-marker association analysis was performed with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spread over the locus, but it did not reveal a significant association with diverse melanoma-related traits. In parallel, MITF alternative transcripts were characterized and their expression was investigated in different porcine tissues. The obtained results showed a complex transcriptional regulation concordant with the one present in other mammals. Notably, the ratio between MITF+ and MITF− isoforms in melanoma samples followed the same pattern as in human tumors, which highlights the adequacy of the MeLiM pig as a model for human melanoma. In conclusion, although MITF does not seem to be the causal gene of the QTL initially observed, we do not exclude a prominent role of its transcription and function in the outbreak and evolution of the tumors observed in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus scrofa 3aanimal models 3agenes 3ahumans 3aloci 3amelanocytes 3amelanoma 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aswine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aultraviolet radiation 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aMale 2aMelanomaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicrophthalmia-Associated Transcription Factorxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aRNA, Messenger 2aSkin Neoplasmsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSus scrofa1 aDu, Zhi-Qiang1 aEstellé, Jordi1 aGilbert, Hélène,1 aCréchet, Françoise1 aPiton, Guillaume1 aMilan, Denis1 aGeffrotin, Claudine1 aLathrop, Mark1 aDemenais, Florence1 aRogel-Gaillard, Claire1 aVincent-Naulleau, Silvia0 tMammalian genome.g2011 Oct., v. 22, no. 9-10 p.602-612dSpringer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-011-9334-6  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012400166300001800290520181600308592002802124650002002152650002102172650002402193650001802217650002102235650002302256650001802279650001302297650001202310650001402322650002302336650001502359650000902374650001602383651002102399653002802420653002302448653005802471653001302529700002002542700001902562700001802581700001802599773011202617856008302729852000902812655001202821IND60582834320221118053856.0220420e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058283432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2016.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Boyoung10aMetabolic syndrome in breast cancer survivors with high carbohydrate consumption: The first report in community setting  ap. 1372-1377.  aThis study was conducted to examine the prevalence of and lifestyle factors associated with the metabolic syndrome in breast cancer survivors and to compare those factors with controls without cancer in a community setting. This study included 584 female breast cancer survivors ≥3 years after the initial diagnosis and 2336 age-matched cancer-free female controls from 39 community health examination centers located in 14 urban areas in Korea. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is shown. Factors associated with the metabolic syndrome were analyzed as odds ratios (ORs) in cancer survivors and controls; differences between the two groups in the ORs of associated factors were evaluated by calculating p-heterogeneity values. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in breast cancer survivors and age-matched controls were 26.8% and 26.9%, respectively. Higher percentage of caloric intake from carbohydrates was associated with increased metabolic syndrome only in the breast cancer survivors (OR for the highest vs. lowest quartile for survivors = 2.48 [95% CI = 1.20–5.14]; OR for controls = 1.11 [95% CI = 0.81–1.51]; P-heterogeneity = 0.046). Sweat-inducing exercise for ≥150 min/week was associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome only in controls (controls: OR = 0.72 [95% CI = 0.58–0.89]; survivors: OR = 0.88 [95% CI = 0.57–1.36]). Older age, higher body mass index, and a lower education level (≤12 years) was associated with an increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in both groups. Our results suggest that, in regions with excess carbohydrate intake, the association of the metabolic syndrome with percentage of caloric intake from carbohydrate might be more prominent than exercise in breast cancer survivors, compared with general population.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3abreast neoplasms 3acarbohydrate intake 3acarbohydrates 3acommunity health 3aeducational status 3aenergy intake 3aexercise 3afemales 3alifestyle 3ametabolic syndrome 3aodds ratio 3arisk 3aurban areas 3aKorean Peninsula 0aBreast cancer survivors 0aMetabolic syndrome 0aPercentage of total caloric intake from carbohydrates 0aExercise1 aKong, Sun-Young1 aLee, Eun Kyung1 aLee, Moo Hyun1 aLee, Eun Sook0 tClinical nutrition.g2017 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.1372-1377dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2016.09.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02582naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010600165300001600271520132900287592002801616596004401644596010101688650001901789650002401808650001401832650001801846650002301864650002601887650001201913650001801925653002001943700002201963773014101985856008502126852000902211655001202220IND60654669720221117160022.0190726e20190818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065466972DNAL7 a10.1080/07315724.2018.15613412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi10aRelationship Between Nut Consumption and Metabolic Syndrome: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies  ap. 499-505.  aObjective: Our aim was to examine the relationship between nut consumption and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: The electronic databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched up to November 2018 for observational studies on the relationship between nut consumption and MetS. The pooled relative risk (RR) of MetS for the highest versus lowest category of nut consumption, as well as their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: A total of 11 observational studies (6 cross-sectional and 5 prospective cohort studies), which involved a total of 89,224 participants, were identified for this meta-analysis. The overall multivariable adjusted RR showed that nut consumption was negatively associated with MetS (RR = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.76–0.92; p < 0.001). Of interest, subgroup analysis confirmed that such findings existed in tree nuts (RR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94–1.00; p = 0.04), but not in peanuts (RR = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.96–1.06; p = 0.68). Conclusions: The existing evidence suggested that nut consumption was negatively associated with MetS. However, such an inverse relationship only existed in tree nuts, not in peanuts. More well-designed studies with detailed specifications of nut varieties are needed to further elaborate the issues examined in this study.  aPublisher supplied data  a201706370196cChina Scholarship Council  a2017zzts233cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Central South University 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobservational studies 3apeanuts 3arelative risk 0aNut consumption1 aZhang, Dian-Zhong0 tJournal of the American College of Nutrition.g2019 Aug. 18, v. 38, no. 6 p.499-505dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl33742x1541-10877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2018.15613413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007600167300001600243520072200259536043000981592002801411596002701439596001401466596001501480596001601495596001501511650001701526650002001543650001201563650001301575653001601588653001101604653002401615653001401639653001601653700002001669700001301689700001401702700001901716700001701735700001801752700002101770773014101791856008601932852000902018655001202027IND60755463720221117222742.0220730e20211003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075546372DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2020.18394322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Zi-Min10a1,8-Cineole: a review of source, biological activities, and application  ap. 938-954.  a1,8-Cineole (also known as eucalyptol) is mostly extracted from the essential oils of plants, which showed extensively pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mainly via the regulation on NF-κB and Nrf2, and was used for the treatment of respiratory diseases and cardiovascular, etc. Although various administration routes have been used in the application of 1.8-cineole, few formulations have been developed to improve its stability and bioavailability.

Umifenovir (Arbidol) is an indole-derivative molecule, licensed in Russia and China for prophylaxis and treatment of influenza and other respiratory viral infections. It has been shown that umifenovir has broad spectrum activity against different viruses. We evaluated the sensitivity of different coronaviruses, including the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, to umifenovir using in vitro assays. Using a plaque assay, we revealed an antiviral effect of umifenovir against seasonal HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses in Vero E6 cells, with estimated 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of 10.0 ± 0.5 µM and 9.0 ± 0.4 µM, respectively. Umifenovir at 90 µM significantly suppressed plaque formation in CMK-AH-1 cells infected with SARS-CoV. Umifenovir also inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus, with EC50 values ranging from 15.37 ± 3.6 to 28.0 ± 1.0 µM. In addition, 21–36 µM of umifenovir significantly suppressed SARS-CoV-2 virus titers (≥2 log TCID50/mL) in the first 24 h after infection. Repurposing of antiviral drugs is very helpful in fighting COVID-19. A safe, pan-antiviral drug such as umifenovir could be extremely beneficial in combating the early stages of a viral pandemic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetacoronavirus 1 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aRussia 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantiviral agents 3aantiviral properties 3adisease prevention 3ainfluenza 3amedian effective concentration 3apandemic 3aviruses 3aChina1 aKartashova, Nadezhda 1 aPoromov, Artem 1 aGracheva, Anastasiia 1 aKorchevaya, Ekaterina 1 aGlubokova, Ekaterina 1 aBorisova, Olga 1 aShtro, Anna 1 aLoginova, Svetlana 1 aShchukina, Veronika 1 aKhamitov, Ravil 1 aFaizuloev, Evgeny 0 tViruses.g2021 Aug. 23, v. 13, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130816653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010000159300001400259500001100273520112100284592002801405596004501433596005101478596006001529596002901589650001401618650001001632650002001642650001001662650001301672650001301685650001401698650002901712700006101741773011301802856007501915852000901990655001201999IND60761972520221120234754.0220105e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076197252DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.157672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedel, Laura14aThe guardian's choice: how p53 enables context‐specific decision‐making in individual cells  ap. 40-52.  aREVIEW  ap53 plays a central role in defending the genomic integrity of our cells. In response to genotoxic stress, this tumour suppressor orchestrates the expression of hundreds of target genes, which induce a variety of cellular outcomes ranging from damage repair to induction of apoptosis. In this review, we examine how the p53 response is regulated on several levels in individual cells to allow precise and context‐specific fate decisions. We discuss that the p53 response is not only controlled by its canonical regulators but also controlled by interconnected signalling pathways that influence the dynamics of p53 accumulation upon damage and modulate its transcriptional activity at target gene promoters. Additionally, we consider how the p53 response is diversified through a variety of mechanisms at the promoter level and beyond to induce context‐specific outcomes in individual cells. These layers of regulation allow p53 to react in a stimulus‐specific manner and fine‐tune its signalling according to the individual needs of a given cell, enabling it to take the right decision on survival or death.  aPublisher supplied data  aGRK1657cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aLO 1634/4‐1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  a393547839 – SFB 1361cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  cEinstein Stiftung Berlin 3aapoptosis 3adeath 3adecision making 3agenes 3agenomics 3amutagens 3aneoplasms 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLoewer, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8819-30400 tFEBS journal.g2022 Jan., v. 289, no. 1 p.40-52dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.157673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245010600165500001900271520102800290592002801318650001301346650001301359650001601372650002901388650001401417650001501431650001601446700002501462700002401487700002801511773011901539856007301658852000901731655001201740IND60711906120221118014507.0200928e20200820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071190612DNAL7 a10.3390/w120923372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aʻAẓīmī, Riz̤ā,10aEvaluation of LNAPL Behavior in Water Table Inter-Fluctuate Zone under Groundwater Drawdown Condition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe investigate the movement of LNAPL (light non-aqueous phase liquid) into and out of monitoring wells in an immediate-scale experimental cell. Aquifer material grain size and LNAPL viscosity are two factors that are varied in three experiments involving lowering and rising water levels. There are six monitoring wells at varying distances from a LNAPL injection point and a water pumping well. We established steady water flow through the aquifer materials prior to LNAPL injection. Water pumping lowered the water levels in the aquifer materials. Terminating water pumping raised the water levels in the aquifer materials. Our focus was to record the LNAPL thickness in the monitoring wells under transient conditions. Throughout the experiments, we measured the elevations of the air-LNAPL and LNAPL-water interfaces in the monitoring wells to obtain the LNAPL thicknesses in the wells. We analyze the results and give plausible explanations. The data presented can be employed to test multiphase flow numerical models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adrawdown 3agroundwater 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3aviscosity 3awater flow 3awater table1 aVaezihir, Abdorreza 1 aLenhard, Robert  J.1 aHassanizadeh, S.

K.10aEnhancement in the Neuroprotective Power of Riluzole Against Cerebral Ischemia Using a Brain Targeted Drug Delivery Vehicle  ap. 19716-19723.  aRiluzole is the only available drug for motor neuron diseases quite well-known for its neuroprotective activity. But its poor aqueous solubility, short half-life with some side-effects at higher concentration poses a limitation to its use as a therapeutic agent. The present study was performed to investigate the therapeutic potential of nanoriluzole (NR), i.e., riluzole encapsulated in nanoparticles against cerebral ischemia (stroke) at three different concentrations [10 (NRL), 20 (NRM), and 40 (NRH) μg/kg body weight intraperitoneally (i.p.)]. Chitosan conjugated NIPAAM (N-isopropylacrylamide) nanoparticles coated with tween80 were synthesized through free radical polymerization. The particles were characterized with Transmission Electron Microscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering, and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy and were found to have size of ∼50 nm. Cerebral ischemia was induced by Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) model for 1 h and NR was given intraperitoneally after 1 h of MCAO. Animals were dissected after a reperfusion period of 24 h for evaluation of various parameters. Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining shows substantial reduction in infarct size in all three treated groups. It was also supported by histopathological results, biochemical parameters, and behavioral studies. Immunological parameters like NOS-2, NF-kB, and COX-2 also show profound reduction in expression in NR treated groups. Thus, the present work clearly demonstrated that the nanoparticle was good enough to carry large amount of drug across the Blood Brain Barrier which results in significant neuroprotection even at a very low concentration. It also substantially lowered the required concentration by overcoming the poor aqueous solubility; hence hardly leaving any scope for side-effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadverse effects 3aanimals 3ablood-brain barrier 3abody weight 3abrain 3achitosan 3achlorides 3adrugs 3ahalf life 3ahistopathology 3ainfarction 3aischemia 3alight scattering 3amodels 3amotor neurons 3ananoparticles 3aneuroprotective effect 3apolymerization 3asolubility 3astaining 3astroke 3atetrazolium 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransmission electron microscopy 0astroke 0aBBB 0ariluzole 0ananoparticle 0aneuroprotection1 aArora, Indu1 aJaved, Kalim1 aAkhtar, Mohd1 aSamim, Mohammed0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Aug. 03, v. 8, no. 30 p.19716-19723dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b017763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01140naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245007800166506002800244520028300272592002800555506003700583650001400620650001300634650001200647773012700659856007900786852000900865655001200874IND60784744920221207095426.0190722s2001    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474492DNAL7 a10.5281/zenodo.33346782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBondartsova, I.P.10aLife-time of hybrid gladiolus clone in the arid conditions of Kirghizstan  aResource is Open Access  aLong-term investigations of the life-time of hybrid gladiolus have been carried out with results presented.

This model considers the solution to be in a non-porous container that has vertical walls like a glass beaker and assumes the solution is an ideal solution so that Raoult's law is obeyed. A particular novel finding was that under a certain condition, the evaporation or aging curve of the solution has a point of maximum acceleration. Prior to this point, the solution is in its fast drying mode and after this point, it is in its slow drying mode. This phenomenon is observed in the drying of many writing inks. In this work this model is modified to consider the evaporation of (a) a non-ideal solution, (b) a solution that become saturated, (c) a solution on a glass slide, and (d) a solution on a porous substrate. In each of these cases, the existence and location of the point of maximum acceleration of the drying process are examined. These modifications lead to a description of the dying process of a solution that is remarkably similar to that of writing inks but obtained via an entirely different physical model.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrying 3aevaporation 3aforensic sciences 3aglass 3amodels 3asolutes 3asolvents 0aRaoult's law 0aNon-ideal solution 0aSolvent evaporation 0aInk drying 0aInk aging0 tForensic science international.g2015 Feb., v. 247 p.69-78dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245011500164520118800279592002801467650001501495650002501510650001501535650001301550650001301563650001401576650001401590651001201604700002101616700002401637700001801661700002201679773012001701856008001821852000901901655001201910IND60784085420221121080659.0220726e20220624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408542DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130705722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRebrina, Fran 10aVegetation Height as the Primary Driver of Functional Changes in Orthopteran Assemblages in a Roadside Habitat  aExhibiting manifold ecological impacts on terrestrial biota, roads have become a major driver of environmental change nowadays. However, many insect groups with high indication potential, such as grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera), have been largely neglected in road ecology research from a functional perspective. Using two complementary sampling methods, we have investigated the spatial dynamics of functional diversity and six functional traits in orthopteran assemblages, with respect to motorway proximity and the associated environmental factors, in a grassland habitat in the Lika region, Croatia. This research shows, for the first time, that road proximity can facilitate an increase in the functional diversity of orthopteran assemblages, with shifts in functional traits related to mobility, feeding habits and lifestyle being primarily driven by changes in vegetation height. Our findings also suggest that our ability to detect road-related patterns depends on the choice of a diversity measure and sampling method, since different components of orthopteran assemblages (plant-dwelling vs. ground-dwelling) exhibit different functional responses to road proximity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthoptera 3afunctional diversity 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3ahighways 3alifestyle 3aroadsides 3aCroatia1 aReinhold, Klaus 1 aTvrtković, Nikola 1 aGulin, Vesna 1 aBrigić, Andreja 0 tInsects.g2022 June 24, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130705723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04719naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002200092024001900114024003300133040001800166100002100184245008800205300001200293506007600305520217900381592002802560506003702588650003302625650001702658650001602675650001102691650001102702650001502713650001302728650002002741650002002761650001402781650001202795650000902807650001302816650001702829650002002846650001302866650003302879650001202912650003502924650001102959650007102970650003003041650006303071650001903134650003103153650002703184650002903211650005603240650003003296650009203326650003103418651001703449651000903466651003203475700001703507700002703524700002203551700002003573700002003593700002003613700001903633700002203652700002303674700002703697773011203724856008003836852000903916655001203925IND4492742220221207045217.0190823e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449274222DNAL7 aPMC34312812pmcid7 a228740032pmid7 a10.1186/1756-3305-5-1642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMungube, Erick O10aBest-bet integrated strategies for containing drug-resistant trypanosomes in cattle  ap. 164.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: African animal trypanosomosis is a major constraint to the rearing of productive livestock in the sub-humid Sudan-Sahel zone of West Africa where cotton is grown. Trypanosomosis is mainly controlled using trypanocidal drugs, but the effective use of drugs is threatened by the development of widespread resistance. This study tested integrated best-bet strategies for containment and/ or reversal of trypanocide resistance in villages in south-east Mali where resistance has been reported. METHODS: Four sentinel villages each from an intervention area (along the road from Mali to Burkina Faso) and a control area (along the road from Mali to Côte d’Ivoire) were selected for the study. Tsetse control was based on deltamethrin-treated stationary attractive devices and targeted cattle spraying between March 2008 and November 2009. Trypanosome-positive cattle were selectively treated with 3.5 mg/kg diminazene aceturate. Strategic helminth control using 10 mg/kg albendazole was also undertaken. During the intervention, tsetse densities along drainage lines, trypanosome infections and faecal egg counts in risk cattle (3 to 12 months of age) were monitored. RESULTS: Catch reductions of 66.5 % in Glossina palpalis gambiensis and 90 % in G. tachinoides were observed in the intervention area. Trypanosome prevalence was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the intervention area (2.3 %; 1.3-3.6 %) compared to the control area (17.3 %; 14.8-20.1 %). Albendazole treatment resulted in a faecal egg count reduction of 55.6 % and reduced trypanosome infection risk (2.9 times lower than in the placebo group) although not significantly (p > 0.05). Further studies are required before confirming the existence of albendazole resistant strongyles in the study area. CONCLUSION: Integration of best-bet strategies in areas of multiple drug-resistance is expected to reduce trypanosome infection risk thus contributing to containment of trypanocidal drug resistance. Integrated best-bet strategies could therefore be considered a viable trypanosomosis control option especially in areas where multiple drug-resistance has been reported.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlossina palpalis gambiensis 3aStrongylidae 3aalbendazole 3acattle 3acotton 3adiminazene 3adrainage 3adrug resistance 3afecal egg count 3ahelminths 3arearing 3arisk 3aspraying 3atrypanocides 3atrypanosomiasis 3avillages 2aAlbendazolextherapeutic use 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxtherapeutic use 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdrug therapyxparasitologyxprevention & control. 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple 2aHelminthiasis, Animalxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aInsect Control 2aInsecticidesxpharmacology 2aNitrilesxpharmacology 2aPyrethrinsxpharmacology 2aTrypanocidal Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aTrypanosomaxdrug effects 2aTrypanosomiasis, Africanxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aTsetse Fliesxdrug effects 3aBurkina Faso 3aMali 0aAfrica, Westxepidemiology.1 aDiall, Oumar1 aBaumann, Maximilian PO1 aHoppenheit, Antje1 aHinney, Barbara1 aBauer, Burkhard1 aSanogo, Yousouf1 aMaiga, Brehima1 aZessin, Karl-Hans1 aRandolph, Thomas F1 aClausen, Peter-Henning0 tParasites & vectors.g2012 Dec., v. 5, no. 1 p.164-164dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1756-3305-5-1643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02922naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245008300163300001800246500001500264520141300279592002801692650001601720650002001736650001501756650002001771650001301791650003701804650001301841650001101854650001901865650001901884650003301903650003201936650002301968650001501991650002302006650001902029650001802048650001502066653002302081700002402104700003302128700002602161700001802187773012802205856007402333852000902407655001202416IND60617351220221122053155.0181025e20180510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061735122DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay00404h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhteshami, Shokooh13aAn electrospun polyamide/graphene oxide nanocomposite as a novel fiber coating  ap. 2123-2128.  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, a novel solid phase microextraction fiber coating based on a polyamide–graphene oxide nanocomposite was prepared using an electrospinning technique on stainless steel wire as a robust substrate. Scanning electron microscopy images showed the high porosity of the synthesized polyamide–graphene oxide nanocomposite and the diameter of nanofibers to be in the range of 100–250 nm. The method feasibility was studied by the extraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as model compounds from water samples. The important factors of the electrospinning procedure and extraction processes such as the polymer concentration, amount of graphene oxide nanoparticles, power voltage, electrospinning time, extraction temperature and time, ionic strength and desorption conditions were studied and optimized. The developed method is fast and sensitive, providing sub and low ppt detection limits, a limit of detection of 0.7–1 ng L⁻¹ and a limit of quantification of 2–5 ng L⁻¹ at an equilibrium time of 15 minutes. A wide linearity in the range of 5–2000 ng L⁻¹ with R > 0.9995 was also obtained. The repeatability of the method was assessed at 100 ng L⁻¹ and a relative standard deviation of 5–10% was achieved. Finally, the developed method was applied to real water samples and the relative recoveries were found to be in the range of 89–101%, showing no matrix effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3astainless steel 3ananofibers 3adetection limit 3acoatings 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aporosity 3amodels 3agraphene oxide 3ananocomposites 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolid phase microextraction 3astandard deviation 3apolyamides 3aanalytical methods 3aionic strength 3ananoparticles 3adesorption 0aelectric potential1 aFeizbakhsh, Alireza1 aMohsen Sarrafi, Amir Hossein1 aAhmad Panahi, Homayon1 aRoostaie, Ali0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 May 10, v. 10, no. 18 p.2123-2128dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay00404h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01663naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009400167300001600261520074300277592002801020650001501048650002801063650002901091650001301120700002201133773013501155856008601290852000901376655001201385IND60755464020221117222659.0211102e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075546402DNAL7 a10.1080/1533015X.2020.17401152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurd, Emily10aSupporting K-12 teachers in the context of whole-school sustainability: four case studies  ap. 303-318.  aWe examined practices from whole-school sustainability programs in four U.S. K-12 institutions in the areas of educator values, skills, and support.

To complicate matters even further, the odors detected by the insect nervous system usually are not single compounds but mixtures whose composition and concentration ratios vary. This leads to an almost infinite amount of different olfactory stimuli which have to be evaluated by the nervous system. To understand which aspects of an odor stimulus determine its evaluation by the fly, it is therefore desirable to efficiently examine odor-guided behavior towards many odorants and odor mixtures. To directly correlate behavior to neuronal activity, behavior should be quantified in a comparable time frame and under identical stimulus conditions as in neurophysiological experiments. However, many currently used olfactory bioassays in Drosophila neuroethology are rather specialized either towards efficiency or towards resolution. Flywalk, an automated odor delivery and tracking system, bridges the gap between efficiency and resolution. It allows the determination of exactly when an odor packet stimulated a freely walking fly, and to determine the animal´s dynamic behavioral reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aanimals 3aautomation 3abioassays 3ainsects 3aneurons 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aolfactory perception 3awalking1 aHansson, Bill S.1 aKnaden, Markus0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 Dec. 11, , no. 106 p.e53394-e53394dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/533943Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53394/high-resolution-quantification-odor-guided-behavior-drosophila  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245006500175300001600240520113400256592002801390650002001418650002201438650001201460653002201472653002101494653001201515700006001527700002301587700002901610700002001639773010401659856008701763852000901850655001201859IND60552599220221117061058.0161021e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055259922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Anselmo10aLaser printer attribution: Exploring new features and beyond  ap. 105-125.  aWith a huge amount of printed documents nowadays, identifying their source is useful for criminal investigations and also to authenticate digital copies of a document. In this paper, we propose novel techniques for laser printer attribution. Our solutions do not need very high resolution scanning of the investigated document and explore the multidirectional, multiscale and low-level gradient texture patterns yielded by printing devices. The main contributions of this work are: (1) the description of printed areas using multidirectional and multiscale co-occurring texture patterns; (2) description of texture on low-level gradient areas by a convolution texture gradient filter that emphasizes textures in specific transition areas and (3) the analysis of printer patterns in segments of interest, which we call frames, instead of whole documents or only printed letters. We show by experiments in a well documented dataset that the proposed methods outperform techniques described in the literature and present near-perfect classification accuracy being very promising for deployment in real-world forensic investigations.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aforensic sciences 3atexture 0aPrinter forensics 0aTexture patterns 0aBanding1 aNavarro, Luiz C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8041-87431 aPinheiro, Giuliano1 aSantos, Jefersson A. dos1 aRocha, Anderson0 tForensic science international.g2015 Feb., v. 247 p.105-125dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.11.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245009000165520154000255592002801795650001901823650001901842650001901861650002001880650001101900650001501911650001501926650001001941650001001951650001301961650001601974650002101990650001102011650001102022700002302033700002102056700002702077700001802104700002402122700002502146773012002171856008002291852000902371655001202380IND60784085620221121080704.0220726e20220624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408562DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130705742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlavinic, Uros 10aUse of Thymol in Nosema ceranae Control and Health Improvement of Infected Honey Bees  aNosema ceranae is the most widespread microsporidian species which infects the honey bees of Apis mellifera by causing the weakening of their colonies and a decline in their productive and reproductive capacities. The only registered product for its control is the antibiotic fumagillin; however, in the European Union, there is no formulation registered for use in beekeeping. Thymol (3-hydroxy-p-cymene) is a natural essential-oil ingredient derived from Thymus vulgaris, which has been used in Varroa control for decades. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of thymol supplementation on the expression of immune-related genes and the parameters of oxidative stress and bee survival, as well as spore loads in bees infected with the microsporidian parasite N. ceranae. The results reveal mostly positive effects of thymol on health (increasing levels of immune-related genes and values of oxidative stress parameters, and decreasing Nosema spore loads) when applied to Nosema-infected bees. Moreover, supplementation with thymol did not induce negative effects in Nosema-infected bees. However, our results indicate that in Nosema-free bees, thymol itself could cause certain disorders (affecting bee survival, decreasing oxidative capacity, and downregulation of some immune-related gene expressions), showing that one should be careful with preventive, uncontrolled, and excessive use of thymol. Thus, further research is needed to reveal the effect of this phytogenic supplement on the immunity of uninfected bees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aEuropean Union 3aNosema ceranae 3aThymus vulgaris 3aVarroa 3aapiculture 3afumagillin 3agenes 3ahoney 3aimmunity 3aingredients 3aoxidative stress 3aspores 3athymol1 aBlagojevic, Jovan 1 aRistanic, Marko 1 aStevanovic, Jevrosima 1 aLakić, Nada,1 aMirilovic, Milorad 1 aStanimirovic, Zoran 0 tInsects.g2022 June 24, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130705743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245016600171300001400337520105400351592002801405650001501433650001001448650001001458650002201468650001001490650001601500650001401516650000901530650002301539653001601562653001501578653001701593653001901610653001001629653001001639700002601649700006101675773010201736856008701838852000901925655001201934IND60552599320221117061914.0161021e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055259932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.11.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaitman, Alec10aEvaluation and comparison of postmortem hydrocodone concentrations in peripheral blood, central blood and liver specimens: A minimal potential for redistribution  ap. 36-40.  aPostmortem changes can alter the concentration of drugs in the vascular compartment as compared with concentrations originally present at the time of death. Numerous drugs have been reported to increase due to postmortem redistribution (PMR). The potential for PMR of hydrocodone, a therapeutic opioid analgesic used to manage pain, is of particular interest due to its wide use. Hydrocodone concentrations in 39 peripheral blood, central blood, and liver specimens were compared. Dihydrocodeine (DHC), a commonly encountered hydrocodone metabolite, was present in 61% of the cases with an average concentration that was 29% of the hydrocodone value. Central blood to peripheral blood hydrocodone ratios were well correlated (R2=0.965) with an average (±S.D.) of 1.3 (±0.35) and a median of 1.2. The liver to peripheral blood (L/P) hydrocodone ratio was also well correlated (R2=0.915) with an average (±S.D.) of 3.4 (±1.7)L/kg and a median of 3.0L/kg. This low L/P ratio suggests that hydrocodone is unlikely to undergo substantial PMR changes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesics 3ablood 3adeath 3aforensic sciences 3aliver 3ametabolites 3anarcotics 3apain 3apostmortem changes 0aHydrocodone 0aPostmortem 0aDistribution 0aRedistribution 0aBlood 0aLiver1 aFitzgerald, Robert L.1 aMcIntyre, Iain M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0284-61520 tForensic science international.g2015 Feb., v. 247 p.36-40dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.11.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01959naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013000161300001800291520078700309592002801096650002201124650001001146650001501156650002601171650002201197650001501219650002601234700002301260700001701283700002001300700003701320700002901357773012801386856007401514852000901588655001201597IND60617351420221122053300.0181025e20180517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061735142DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ay00413g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlos, Graciela10aPhotodegradation kinetics of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and structure elucidation of its degradation products by LC-ESI-QTOF  ap. 2287-2292.  aHerein, we investigate the photodegradation of lisdexamfetamine (LDX) in an aqueous solution. The experiment is carried out by exposing the drug in solution to UV radiation for different periods of time during 48 h. The fragmentation pattern of LDX is established, and its two degradation products are identified (DP-01 and DP-02) and structurally characterized via liquid chromatography coupled with hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight electrospray ionization (LC-ESI-QTOF) mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the photodegradation kinetics of LDX is determined via LC-ESI-QTOF (r = 0.9905; k = 0.0204 h⁻¹; and t₁/₂ = 33.91 h) and RP-LC-CAD (r = 0.9960; k = 0.0234 h⁻¹; and t₁/₂ = 29.67 h). LDX is found to be unstable in the presence of light under the evaluated conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3adrugs 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aphotolysis 3aultraviolet radiation1 aSegalin, Jéferson1 aJank, Louise1 aComiran, Eloisa1 aHerbstrith de Oliveira, Marcella1 aFroehlich, Pedro Eduardo0 tAnalytical methods.g2018 May 17, v. 10, no. 19 p.2287-2292dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay00413g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03182naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002600149245016100175300001500336520186900351592002802220650002602248650001302274650001802287650002902305650001202334650001102346650001302357650002202370650002102392650001702413650001602430700002002446700002102466700001702487700002102504700001602525700002502541773010002566856008502666852000902751655001202760IND4502858120221119024840.0141111e20110820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND450285812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzczepanowski, Rafael10aSequencing and comparative analysis of IncP-1Î± antibiotic resistance plasmids reveal a highly conserved backbone and differences within accessory regions  ap. 95-103.  aAlthough IncP-1 plasmids are important for horizontal gene transfer among bacteria, in particular antibiotic resistance spread, so far only three plasmids from the subgroup IncP-1Î± have been completely sequenced. In this study we doubled this number. The three IncP-1Î± plasmids pB5, pB11 and pSP21 were isolated from bacteria of two different sewage treatment plants and sequenced by a combination of next-generation and capillary sequencing technologies. A comparative analysis including the previously analysed IncP-1Î± plasmids RK2, pTB11 and pBS228 revealed a highly conserved plasmid backbone (at least 99.9% DNA sequence identity) comprising 54 core genes. The accessory elements of the plasmid pB5 constitute a class 1 integron interrupting the parC gene and an IS6100 copy inserted into the integron. In addition, the tetracycline resistance genes tetAR and the ISTB11-like element are located between the klc operon and the trfAâssb operon. Plasmid pB11 is loaded with a Tn5053-like mercury resistance transposon between the parCBA and parDE operons and contains tetAR that are identical to those identified in plasmid pB5 and the insertion sequence ISSP21. Plasmid pSP21 harbours an ISPa7 element in a Tn402 transposon including a class 1 integron between the partitioning genes parCBA and parDE. The IS-element ISSP21 (99.89% DNA sequence identity to ISSP21 from pB11), inserted downstream of the tetR gene and a copy of ISTB11 (identical to ISTB11 on pTB11) inserted between the genes pncA and pinR. On all three plasmids the accessory genes are almost always located between the backbone modules confirming the importance of the backbone functions for plasmid maintenance. The striking backbone conservation among the six completely sequenced IncP-1Î± plasmids is in contrast to the much higher diversity within the IncP-1Î² subgroup.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abiotechnology 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3amercury 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3asequence analysis 3asewage treatment 3atetracycline 3atransposons1 aEikmeyer, Felix1 aHarfmann, Jannis1 aBlom, Jochen1 aRogers, Linda M.1 aTop, Eva M.1 aSchlÃ¼ter, Andreas0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2011 Aug. 20, v. 155, no. 1 p.95-103dElsevier B.V.x0168-16567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009900171300001600270520121100286592002801497650002101525650001101546650001401557650001201571651001301583700002301596700002601619700001801645773012801663856008301791852000901874655001201883IND60765506320220422000000.0220422e20191218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076550632DNAL7 a10.17221/94/2019-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubicová, Ľubica10aConsumption of food in relation to income and saturation limit of Slovak households<br />  ap. 560-568.  aFood represents everyday need and from this point of view is stable and computable demand on the consumer market. Based on the current development of households’ net money income and consumption expenditures, the aim of the paper is to point at the development of food consumption and changes in the cost of living of the population in Slovakia. Previous food consumption analyses proved that eating habits of the Slovak population comply neither with healthy lifestyle nor recommended doses, due to the low level of disposable net money income. In the analysis, linear and nonlinear functions were used in order to evaluate the development and saturation of demand for basic foods in Slovakia in the period 2008–2017. During these years, the share of expenditures on food and non-alcoholic beverages did not significantly change the consumption expenditures; they moved in intervals from 19.2% (2017) to 23.1% (2013), which is still a high share in comparison with EU countries (12.2%). The analysis provided in the paper is a suitable base for food businesses to create a product portfolio based on different net money income and saturation demand for basic foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood consumption 3aincome 3alifestyle 3amarkets 3aSlovakia1 aKádeková, Zdenka1 aTurčeková, Natália1 aBielik, Peter0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 65, no. 12 p.560-568dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/94/2019-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04282naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245012400169500001900293520251000312592002802822650001202850650002202862650001502884650001502899650001102914650001202925650001702937650002502954650002802979650002603007650002103033650001503054650001303069650002603082650004303108650000703151650003303158650000903191650001703200650001303217650000903230650001103239650001103250650002803261650001803289650001903307650002003326650001103346651001003357700002903367700002203396700002103418700002703439773012003466856007303586852000903659655001203668IND60711906720221118014505.0200928e20200911xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071190672DNAL7 a10.3390/w120925372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Fattah, Mohamed  K.10aMultivariate Analysis for Assessing Irrigation Water Quality: A Case Study of the Bahr Mouise Canal, Eastern Nile Delta  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater scarcity and suitable irrigation water management in arid regions represent tangible challenges for sustainable agriculture. The current study aimed to apply multivariate analysis and to develop a simplified water quality assessment using principal component analysis (PCA) and the agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) technique to assess the water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal in El-Sharkia Governorate, Egypt. The proposed methods depended on the monitored water chemical composition (e.g., pH, water electrical conductivity (ECiw), Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, HCO₃⁻, Cl⁻, and SO₄²⁻) during 2019. Based on the supervised classification of satellite images (Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)), the distinguished land use/land cover types around the Bahr Mouise canal were agriculture, urban, and water bodies, while the dominating land use was agriculture. The water quality of the Bahr Mouise canal was classified into two classes based on the application of the irrigation water quality index (IWQI), while the water quality was classified into three classes using the PCA and AHC methods. Temporal variations in water quality were investigated, where the water qualities in winter, autumn, and spring (January, February, March, April, November, and December) were classified as class I (no restrictions) based on IWQI application, and the water salinity, sodicity, and/or alkalinity did not represent limiting factors for irrigation water quality. On the other hand, in the summer season (May, June, July, August, and October), the irrigation water was classified as class II (low restrictions); therefore, irrigation processes during summer may lead to an increase in the alkalinity hazard. The PCA classifications were compared with the IWQI results; the PCA classifications had similar assessment results during the year, except in September, while the water quality was assigned to class II using the PCA method and class I by applying the IWQI. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) around the Bahr Mouise canal over eight months and climatic data assisted in explaining the fluctuations in water quality during 2019 as a result of changing the crop season and agriculture management. Assessments of water quality help to conserve soil, reduce degradation risk, and support decision makers in order to obtain sustainable agriculture, especially under water irrigation scarcity and the limited agricultural land in such an arid region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aagricultural land 3aalkalinity 3aarid zones 3aautumn 3acalcium 3acase studies 3achemical composition 3aelectrical conductivity 3airrigation management 3airrigation water 3aland cover 3aland use 3amultivariate analysis 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk 3ariver deltas 3asodicity 3asoil 3aspring 3asummer 3asustainable agriculture 3awater quality 3awater salinity 3awater shortages 3awinter 3aEgypt1 aAbd-Elmabod, Sameh  Kotb1 aAldosari, Ali  A.1 aElrys, Ahmed  S.1 aMohamed, Elsayed  Said0 tWater.g2020 Sept. 11, v. 12, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120925373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245006900157300002000226520136400246592002801610650002201638650001101660650001901671650001901690650001201709650002801721650002601749700001601775700002001791700001701811773012401828856007401952852000902026655001202035IND60637002020221119163610.0190413e20190411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700202DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra00610a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yajun10aLaser-induced selective wax reflow for paper-based microfluidics  ap. 11460-11464.  aThis study proposes a novel method for the fabrication of paper-based microfluidic devices using laser-induced selective thermal reflow for wax penetration. A layer of wax was evenly deposited on the front side of a filter paper; then a low-cost diode laser was used to scan the designed area from the back side of the filter paper. At the laser irradiated spot, the wax was heated, melted down and penetrated through the whole thickness of the filter paper, and formed hydrophobic barriers on the hydrophilic cellulose fibers. The patterned hydrophobic wax barriers on the filter paper defined the flow path of the fluid for the paper-based microfluidic device. Compared with conventional two-step (deposit and reflow) approaches for paper-based microfluidics using wax barriers, e.g. wax printing, stamping or photolithography, the proposed fabrication protocol achieved wax patterning and reflow simultaneously, conducted during the laser scan process, and without the requirement for any sophisticated instruments or a cleanroom environment. A series of tests were also conducted for the characterization of the proposed paper-based microfluidic device fabrication technique. The fabrication technique used in this approach could have broad application potential in point-of-care diagnosis and testing, especially for applications in the developing world.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulosic fibers 3adiodes 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amelting 3amicrofluidic technology 3apoint-of-care testing1 aLiu, Jingji1 aWang, Hongliang1 aFan, Yiqiang0 tRSC advances.g2019 Apr. 11, v. 9, no. 20 p.11460-11464dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra00610a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100003200156245009300188506002800281520167000309592002801979506003702007650002402044650002102068650002002089650001502109650001302124650001602137650001302153650002002166650001202186650001402198650001802212650001802230653004502248700003802293700002802331700002502359700002802384773011602412856009102528852000902619655001202628IND60784745620221207095408.0211229e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474562DNAL7 a10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v14i0.63882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJean Carlo Baudraz de Paula10aCryopreservation in liquid nitrogen of Brazilian orchid seeds Miltonia flavescens Lindl.  aResource is Open Access  aMiltonia flavescens is a species vulnerable to extinction, which justifies research on preservation methods. Cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen (LN) consists of maintaining biological material at a low-temperature (-196 °C). Thus, the aim of the experiment is to evaluate the influence of different cryoprotective solutions on cryopreservation in LN of the Brazilian orchid Miltonia flavescens seeds. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design (CRD), with eight treatments and six replications. The treatments were composed as follows: control; immersion in LN, no cryoprotectant adding; and immersion in LN, with the addition of cryoprotectants: sucrose 0,4 mol L-1; glycerol 2 mol L-1; protection by vitrification in solution (PVS)1; PVS2; PVS2 + 1% phloroglucinol, and PVS3. Except for the control treatment, which was kept in a freezer (10±2 °C), the others remained frozen for 15 days. After this period, the viability of the seeds was evaluated. These seeds were sown and, 30 days after germination, then the frequency of protocorm formation was verified. Before the cryopreservation, the seeds showed 75% viability and 9.5% water content. After cryopreservation, the seeds varied between 67 to 75% viability. However, treatment with glycerol 2 mol L-1 exhibited lower performance than the others (58%). The control treatment showed a higher percentage of protocorm formation (71%) followed by treatments PVS1 (63%), PVS2 (64%), and PVS2PHLO (66%). For the purpose of preserving Miltonia flavescens seeds in liquid nitrogen for a prolonged period, the treatments PVS1, PVS2, and PVS2PHLO proved to be viable and promising alternatives.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMiltonia flavescens 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3aextinction 3afreezers 3agermination 3aglycerol 3aliquid nitrogen 3asucrose 3aviability 3avitrification 3awater content 0aseed storage. conservation. orchidaceae.1 aJúnior, Walter Aparecido Ribeiro1 aShimizu, Gabriel Danilo1 aMen, Gabriel Barraca1 aFaria, Ricardo Tadeu de0 tAgro@mbiente on-line.g2020 Nov., v. 14, no. 0dUniversidade Federal de RoraimawJournal:27788x1982-84707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v14i0.63883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02783naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245014900171520139900320592002801719650001401747650001601761650001801777650002501795650001001820650001501830650001201845650001301857650002601870650002301896650002101919651001601940700002201956700001901978700002201997700001902019700002002038700002302058700002502081700002202106773012002128856008002248852000902328655001202337IND60784086020221121062251.0220726e20220624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408602DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130705782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadyarova, Ekaterina 10aMetabolic Tolerance to Atmospheric Pressure of Two Freshwater Endemic Amphipods Mostly Inhabiting the Deep-Water Zone of the Ancient Lake Baikal  aLake Baikal is the only freshwater reservoir inhabited by deep-water fauna, which originated mostly from shallow-water ancestors. Ommatogammarus flavus and O. albinus are endemic scavenger amphipods (Amphipoda, Crustacea) dwelling in wide depth ranges of the lake covering over 1300 m. O. flavus had been previously collected close to the surface, while O. albinus has never been found above the depth of 47 m. Since O. albinus is a promising model species for various research, here we tested whether O. albinus is less metabolically adapted to atmospheric pressure than O. flavus. We analyzed a number of energy-related traits (contents of glucose, glycogen and adenylates, as well as lactate dehydrogenase activity) and oxidative stress markers (activities of antioxidant enzymes and levels of lipid peroxidation products) after sampling from different depths and after both species’ acclimation to atmospheric pressure. The analyses were repeated in two independent sampling campaigns. We found no consistent signs of metabolic disturbances or oxidative stress in both species right after lifting. Despite O. flavus surviving slightly better in laboratory conditions, during long-term acclimation, both species showed comparable reactions without critical changes. Thus, the obtained data favor using O. albinus along with O. flavus for physiological research under laboratory conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aacclimation 3aancient lakes 3aatmospheric pressure 3afauna 3afreshwater 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aLake Baikal1 aShirokova, Yulia 1 aGurkov, Anton 1 aDrozdova, Polina 1 aBaduev, Boris 1 aLubyaga, Yulia 1 aShatilina, Zhanna 1 aVishnevskaya, Maria 1 aTimofeyev, Maxim 0 tInsects.g2022 June 24, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130705783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001800282500001900300520092800319592002801247650001501275650001601290650001001306650001501316650001301331650001901344650000901363650000701372650002101379650001501400650002201415653002401437653003001461653002501491653001901516653001201535653001401547653002701561700001901588700001901607700002201626773013901648856008501787852000901872655001201881IND60722638120221117162604.0210106e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072263812DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2020.18254842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaderi, Behnaz10aComplex coacervation between oak protein isolate and gum Arabic: optimization & functional characterization  ap. 1854-1873.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this research, complex coacervation between oak protein isolate (OPI) and gum arabic (GA) at different pH values (7.0–1.6) and mixing ratios (8:1 to 1:8 protein: polysaccharide), and a constant biopolymer concentration (0.125% w/w) was studied by turbidimetric analysis. The findings revealed that the pH = 3.2 and 4:1 mixing ratio were the optimum conditions for electrostatic complex formation. The functional properties (e.g., solubility, surface hydrophobicity, capacity of water and oil absorption, foam formation, and emulsifying properties) of the OPI-GA complexes were better than OPI. The FTIR spectra revealed that the complex coacervation between the amine groups of OPI and the carboxyl groups of GA caused the formation of the coacervate, with hydrogen bonding also being involved. The results of DSC and TGA showed that the complex coacervate had better thermal stability in comparison with OPI and GA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiopolymers 3afoams 3agum arabic 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apH 3aprotein isolates 3asolubility 3athermal stability 0aoak protein isolate 0aelectrostatic interaction 0acomplex coacervation 0azeta potential 0afoaming 0aemulsions 0asurface hydrophobicity1 aKeramat, Javad1 aNasirpour, Ali1 aAminifar, Mehrnaz0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 23, no. 1 p.1854-1873dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2020.18254843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245009800173300001500271520189900286592002802185650001002213650001602223650002202239650001302261650002602274650003302300650001602333653002202349653001702371653002002388653001902408653001402427700002102441700002202462700001802484700002102502700002302523773010302546856008702649852000902736655001202745IND60552599820221117061352.0161021e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055259982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCominato, Laura10aFlattening mountains: Micro-fabrication of planar replicas for bullet lateral striae analysis  ap. 97-104.  aThe application of replica molding has proven to be a valuable tool in the analysis of different forensic evidences in particular for its ability to extract the toolmarks from complex sample surfaces. A well known problem in the analysis of ballistic evidences is the accurate characterization of the lateral striae of real bullets seized on crime scenes after shots, due primarily to impact deformations and to unpredictable issues related to laboratory illumination setup. To overcome these problems a possible way is to confine over a flat surface all the features still preserving their three dimensionality. This can be achieved by a novel application of replica molding performed onto the relevant lateral portion of the bullet surface.A quasi-two-dimensional negative copy of the original tridimensional indented surface has been thus fabricated. It combines the real tridimensional topography of class characteristics (land and groove impressions) and of individual caracteristics (striae) impressed by rifled barrels on projectiles, moreover with the possibility of quantitative characterization of these features in a planar configuration, that will allow one-shot comparison of the “whole striae landscape” without the typical artifacts arising from the bullet shape and the illumination issue.A detailed analysis has been carried on at the morphological level by standard optical and scanning electron microscopy, while the 3D topography has been characterized by white light optical profilometry.A quantitative characterization of toolmarks of bullets derived from ammunitions shot by guns of large diffusion, as the Beretta 98 FS cal. 9×21mm, has been performed and will be presented ranging between the whole landscape and the sub-μm resolution. To investigate the real potentiality of this technique, the experiment has been extended to highly impact-deformed projectiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrime 3adeformation 3aforensic sciences 3alighting 3aquantitative analysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awhite light 0aMicro-fabrication 0aProfilometry 0aReplica molding 0aNanotechnology 0aBallistic1 aValle, Francesco1 aPierini, Giovanni1 aBonini, Paolo1 aBiscarini, Fabio1 aD’Elia, Marcello0 tForensic science international.g2015 Feb., v. 247 p.97-104dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0379-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2014.12.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009200168520193900260592002802199650001102227650001102238650001902249650001502268650002902283650002302312651001002335653001502345653000802360653000802368653002202376653001802398700002702416700002002443700002202463700002002485700001802505773010802523856008402631852000902715655001202724IND60746120820221123043919.0210904e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074612082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1005922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajput, Preeti10aInvestigating shallow water bottom feature using SAR data along Gulf of Khambhat, India  aThe coastal bathymetry often forms complex and transient morphology, especially along the tide-dominated regions like the Gulf of Khambhat (GoK), west coast of India. The high tidal currents within the gulf relentlessly modify the morphology of the bathymetric features that prompts for a frequently updated bathymetric information. The SAR estimated bathymetry represent updated depth values based on the transient bathymetric features observed from the SAR images. The present study has used ALOS PALSAR-1/2 data to update the depth of shallow water bottom features of GoK. The method involves modeling the gradient in the backscatter coefficient (σ°) modulated by the slope of the bathymetric features with the satellite images. The slope corresponding to the bathymetric feature from hydrographic charts (initial guess bathymetry) and the simulated current velocity forms the input to the model. The bathymetry is updated by varying the slopes of the bathymetric features through iteration until the σ° converges. The method is applied to update the depth of various bathymetric features observed from the SAR images of 2008, 2010, 2014 and 2018. We validated the updated depth from 2018 satellite data using available in situ measurements. The comparison of in situ observation with the hydrographic chart has resulted in RMSE of 3.2 m, while the RMSE have improved to 1.5 m when compared with the SAR updated bathymetry. The temporal dynamics of the bathymetric features are studied using the pair of 2008–10 and 2010-14 SAR images. Analysis has comprehended the morphodynamics of bathymetric features like lateral migration of tidal bars, erosion along the tidal channel periphery, and deposition at the tidal spits. We updated the depth of rapidly changing bathymetric features using the 2018 SAR images. The study shows its potential in operational usage to update the complex nearshore bathymetry from the SAR image.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atemporal variation 3aIndia 0aBathymetry 0aSAR 0aGoK 0aBackscatter model 0aTidal channel1 aRamakrishnan, Ratheesh1 aFrancis, Shincy1 aThomaskutty, A.V.1 aAgrawal, Ritesh1 aRajawat, A.S.0 tRemote sensing applications.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.100592-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1005923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01502naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245006500131300001600196506002800212520062700240592002800867506003700895653001900932653003100951653001700982700002000999700002101019700002401040773013901064852000901203655001201212IND60784745720221207083655.0101103e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHidayat, Yayat10aReformulation of Crop and Management Factor in ANSWERS Model  ap. 155-160.  aResource is Open Access  aCrop and management factor value is significantly corelated with outputs of ANSWERS model especially on soil erosion.

For its management use of chemical fungicides is not very successful as their spores are able to survive for many years in the soil. As an alternative eco-friendly approach to control the disease antagonistic microbes are being characterized.Among them plant growth promoting rhizobacteria Paenibacillus lentimorbus B-30488 (B-30488) with antagonistic properties, multiple PGP attributes stress tolerance and ACC deaminase enzyme activity is characterized to decipher its mode of action against S. rolfsii under in vitro and in vivo conditions. In vitro results obtained from this study clearly demonstrate that B-30488 has ability to show antagonistic properties under different abiotic stresses against S. rolfsii. Similar results were also obtained from in vivo experiments where B-30488 inoculation has efficiently controlled the disease caused by S. rolfsii and improve the plant growth. Deleterious enhanced ethylene level in S. rolfsii infected plants was also ameliorated by inoculation of ACC deaminase producing B-30488. The ACC accumulation, ACO and ACS activities were also modulated in S. rolfsii infected plants. Results from defense enzymes and other biochemical attributes were also support the role of B-30488 inoculation in ameliorating the biotic stress caused by S. rolfsii in tomato plants. These results were further validated by pathogen related gene expression analysis by real time PCR. Overall results from the present study may be concluded that ACC deaminase producing B-30488 has ability to control the southern blight disease caused by S. rolfsii and commercial bioinoculant package may be developed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase 3aPaenibacillus lentimorbus 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabiotic stress 3abiotic stress 3ablight 3acrop production 3adisease control 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene 3afungal diseases of plants 3afungicides 3agene expression 3ain vivo studies 3amechanism of action 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3aspores 3astress tolerance 3atomatoes 0aACC deaminase 0abiocontrol 0aScelerotium rolfsii1 aAgrawal, Lalit1 aGupta, Swati1 aKumar, Manoj1 aYadav, Sumit1 aChauhan, Puneet Singh1 aNautiyal, Chandra Shekhar0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2016 Feb. 1, v. 11, no. 2 p.e1113363-dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2015.11133633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03551naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245016700176300001800343500001900361520198600380536012602366592002802492596002502520650002202545650001702567650002502584650002402609650001802633650001802651650001702669650000702686650002302693653001802716653001002734653001602744653003102760653002302791700002402814700003402838773013902872856008503011852000903096655001203105IND60722638220221117162552.0210106e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072263822DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2020.18254852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutshinyani, Muvhuso10aBioactive compounds, antioxidant activity and consumer acceptability of porridges of finger millet (Eleusine coracana) flours: effects of spontaneous fermentation  ap. 1692-1710.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe flours of finger millet (Eleusine coracana) from light brown and dark brown varieties fermented spontaneously for 96 h were evaluated for their bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity and physicochemical properties. The consumer acceptability of the fermented porridges was also determined. Bioactive compounds of finger millet (FM) flours significantly (p < .05) increased with fermentation time, total polyphenolic content increased from 166 to 488 mg/100 g (light brown) and 420 to 606 mg/100 g (dark brown) and total flavonoid content increased from 160 to 330 mg/100 g (light brown) and 249 to 465 mg/g (dark brown). However, the total anthocyanin content of FM flours decreased with fermentation time. The DPPH activity of FM flours significantly (p < .05) increased with fermentation time from 52 to 58% (light brown), 53 to 59% (dark brown) and inhibitory effect on lipid peroxides significantly (p < .05) increased from 0.9 to 1.3% (dark brown) and 1.7 to 4.5% (dark brown). Fermentation significantly increased the crude protein of FM flours (light brown, 7.12 to 9.43%) and (7.80 to 9.53%, dark brown). Dietary fiber, fats, moisture and carbohydrates significantly (p < .05) decreased. Total titratable acid significantly (p < .05) increased from 0.49 to 1.77 g/100 g (light brown) and 0.47 to 1.58 g/100 g (dark brown). Fermentation resulted in the decrease of FM flours pH values. However, the total soluble solids were significantly (p < .05) different in both flours. Fermentation caused the lightness (L*) and redness (a*) to decrease and the yellowness (b*) of both flours to increase with time. The textural properties of the FM porridges decreased with fermentation time. The FM flours of both varieties which were fermented for 24 h resulted in porridges with the best sensory attributes. The results suggest that spontaneous fermentation could be an effective way of improving the bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of FM flours.  aThis work was supported by the University of Venda and National Research Foundation, South Africa [SARDF/18/FST/02/1310].  aPublisher supplied data  aSARDF/18/FST/02/1310 3aEleusine coracana 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aconsumer acceptance 3acrude protein 3adietary fiber 3afermentation 3apH 3atitratable acidity 0aFinger millet 0aflour 0apolyphenols 0aphysicochemical properties 0asensory evaluation1 aMashau, Mpho Edward1 aJideani, Afam Israel Obiefuna0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 23, no. 1 p.1692-1710dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2020.18254853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015500167520166200322592002801984650001202012650001602024650001102040650001002051650003502061650001302096650001302109650003002122650002302152650001102175651001502186651001802201653001902219653003602238653001802274653003202292700001602324700001702340773010802357856008402465852000902549655001202558IND60746120920221123031759.0210904e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074612092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1005932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshikur, M.R.12aA remote sensing approach to ascertain spatial and temporal variations of seawater quality parameters in the coastal area of Bay of Bengal, Bangladesh  aSea surface temperature (SST), surface chlorophyll (SChl), Sea surface salinity (SSS), and total suspended solids (TSS) are some critical seawater quality parameters (SWQP) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) of Bangladesh. The research objectives were to investigate the distribution of SST, SChl, SSS, and TSS in the Summer and Winter seasons of 2014, 2018, and 2020 and denominate the spatial and temporal variation of these parameters in the BoB. The MODIS-Aqua, VIIRS-SNPP level-3 ocean color, and Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS multitemporal images were used and the Geographical Information System (GIS), and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques were applied for interpreting and mapping the output. The results asserted that temporally in the Summer season SChl and SSS increased by 11.02% and 7.96% respectively and TSS decreased by 14.25% from 2014 to 2020. On the other hand, in the Winter season, SST and SSS decreased by 3.37% and 3.38% respectively and SChl and TSS increased by 2.32% and 70.95% respectively from 2014 to 2020. Besides, in the Summer season, the maximum values of SST, SChl, and TSS were 30.16 °C, 2.61 mg/m³, 268.45 mg/l respectively and in the Winter season, the maximum values were 25.06 °C, 2.93 mg/m³, 192.31 mg/l respectively. Spatially, all the maximum values of SST, SChl, and TSS were concentrated in areas near the coastline. Contrary, the maximum values of SSS were 29.01 ppt and 31.21 ppt in the Summer and Winter seasons respectively and both values were coagulated in the open sea area. Seasonally, The SST and TSS were higher in the Summer season and SChl and SSS were higher in the Winter season for all the years in the BoB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3acolor 3ageographic information systems 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asurface water temperature 3atemporal variation 3awinter 3aBangladesh 3aBay of Bengal 0aRemote sensing 0aGeographical information system 0aWater quality 0aSpatial and temporal change1 aRupom, R.S.1 aSazzad, M.H.0 tRemote sensing applications.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.100593-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2021.1005933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245012000157300002000277520140700297592002801704650002101732650001701753650002501770650001701795650001001812650001001822650001601832650001801848650001001866650000901876650001201885650001701897650001201914650002101926650001701947650001301964700001901977700001801996700001602014700001502030700001602045773012402061856007402185852000902259655001202268IND60637002320221119163815.0190413e20190411xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700232DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra00669a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSorrenti, V.10aBlond and blood juice supplementation in high fat diet fed mice: effect on antioxidant status and DDAH/ADMA pathway  ap. 11406-11412.  aNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease spread throughout the world. The most frequent causes of death in NAFLD patients are due both to liver and cardiovascular damage. Several pathways, including the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH)/asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) pathway, are involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. It has been reported that ADMA plasmatic levels are increased in patients with hepatic dysfunction such as NAFLD. Although many studies demonstrated that some foods are effective in the treatment of NAFLD, few studies have evaluated their effects with respect to the prevention of the disease. It has been reported that sweet orange juice (OJ) consumption may be associated with potential health benefits. However, some varieties of sweet orange are more effective than others. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the effect of blond and blood sweet orange juice in prevention of NAFLD by evaluating its ability to improve liver steatosis in mice with diet-induced obesity, reducing oxidative stress and affecting the DDAH/ADMA pathway. Results obtained in our experimental conditions evidenced that blood orange juice rather than blond orange juice was more effective. Blood orange juice or blond orange juice enriched in anthocyanins may represent a promising dietary option for the prevention of fatty liver disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamide hydrolases 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood 3adeath 3afatty liver 3ahigh fat diet 3aliver 3amice 3aobesity 3aorange juice 3aoranges 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3apatients1 aDi Giacomo, C.1 aAcquaviva, R.1 aCosenza, J.1 aCarota, G.1 aGalvano, F.0 tRSC advances.g2019 Apr. 11, v. 9, no. 20 p.11406-11412dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra00669a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016500171300001600336520126500352592002801617650002701645650001201672650001101684650001301695650001801708650001201726650002401738650001401762650001301776650002301789650001001812650003801822650003701860650002101897653002501918653001901943653001701962700002301979700002002002700002302022773013202045856008502177852000902262655001202271IND60654670620221122225333.0190726e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065467062DNAL7 a10.1080/07924259.2019.16116692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKunluang, Sirin10aMorphological study of the reproductive system and ovarian growth of the univoltine bamboo borer, Omphisa fuscidentalis (Hampson, 1896) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae)  ap. 156-164.  aThe female reproductive system and protein deposition in the ovaries during development have never been examined in the bamboo borer Omphisa fuscidentalis Hampson. The aim of this study was thus to study the morphology of the female reproductive system of each stage of development. The female reproductive system of the borer consists of a pair of ovary, oviduct and accessory glands. Each ovary is composed of four polytrophic ovarioles that connect to lateral oviducts, fused with a common oviduct. The size of the ovary in diapausing larvae for 9 months was determined. The length and width of the ovaries were the smallest in September larvae (0.343 ± 0.03 and 0.071 ± 0.01 mm, respectively). The ovaries were the largest during ovarian development in May (0.752 ± 0.08 mm long and 0.084 ± 0.01 wide). Additionally, ovarian size was significantly larger in adults than in pupae. The ovarian protein concentration of larvae in May was 0.59 ± 0.06 mg/ml and increased to 16.61 ± 7.5 and 37.42 ± 5.5 mg/ml in pupae (June) and adults (July), respectively. The results showed ovarian development in all life stages of this holometabolous insect, which has a longer life cycle than other lepidopterans.

Although sarcopenic elderly are the target group for many of these nutritional interventions, no studies have assessed basal or post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates in this population. To assess the basal and post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates between healthy and sarcopenic older men. A total of 15 healthy (69 ± 1 y) and 15 sarcopenic (81 ± 1 y) older men ingested a leucine-enriched whey protein nutritional supplement containing 21 g of protein, 9 g of carbohydrate, and 3 g of fat. Stable isotope methodology combined with frequent collection of blood and muscle samples was applied to assess basal and post-prandial muscle protein fractional synthetic rates. Handgrip strength, muscle mass, and gait speed were assessed to identify sarcopenia, according to international criteria. Basal mixed muscle protein fractional synthetic rates (FSR) averaged 0.040 ± 0.005 and 0.032 ± 0.003%/h (mean ± SEM) in the sarcopenic and healthy group, respectively (P = 0.14). Following protein ingestion, FSR increased significantly to 0.055 ± 0.004 and 0.053 ± 0.004%/h in the post-prandial period in the sarcopenic (P = 0.003) and healthy groups (P < 0.001), respectively, with no differences between groups (P = 0.45). Furthermore, no differences were observed between groups in muscle protein synthesis rates during the early (0.058 ± 0.007 vs 0.060 ± 0.008%/h, sarcopenic vs healthy, respectively) and late (0.052 ± 0.004 vs 0.048 ± 0.003%/h) stages of the post-prandial period (P = 0.93 and P = 0.34, respectively). Basal muscle protein synthesis rates are not lower in sarcopenic older men compared to healthy older men. The ingestion of 21 g of a leucine-enriched whey protein effectively increases muscle protein synthesis rates in both sarcopenic and healthy older men. Public trial registry number: NTR3047.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3aelderly 3afood intake 3agait 3amales 3amen 3amuscle protein 3amuscles 3anutritional intervention 3aprotein supplements 3aprotein synthesis 3asarcopenia 3astable isotopes 3awhey protein 0aMuscle 0aProtein metabolism 0aSarcopenia 0aElderly 0aStable isotope methodology1 aVerdijk, Lex B.1 aHamer, Henrike M.1 aVerlaan, Sjors1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0377-73981 aLuiking, Yvette C.1 aKouw, Imre W.K.1 aSenden, Joan M.1 avan Kranenburg, Janneau1 aGijsen, Annemarie P.1 aBierau, Jörgen1 aPoeze, Martijn1 avan Loon, Luc J.C.0 tClinical nutrition.g2017 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.1440-1449dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2016.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245015000162300002000312520147800332592002801810650004401838650002201882650003601904650000901940650001301949650002201962650001401984650001701998650001302015650000902028650002002037650001602057650001902073650001902092650001502111650001902126650000702145650003302152650002302185650001302208650001302221650002302234650001302257650003702270700001702307700001702324700002702341773012402368856007402492852000902566655001202575IND60637002520221119163736.0190413e20190409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063700252DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra00742c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhandelwal, Nitin10aNovel synthesis of a clay supported amorphous aluminum nanocomposite and its application in removal of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solutions  ap. 11160-11169.  aA bentonite supported amorphous aluminum (B–Al) nanocomposite was synthesized by the NaBH₄ reduction method in an ethanol–water interfacial solution and characterized with SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR and XRF. Surface morphology and line scans obtained from TEM imaging suggest the successful synthesis of the nanocomposite while XRF data shows a drastic change in Al concentration in the synthesized nanocomposite with respect to raw bentonite. This synthesized nanocomposite was further utilized for the removal of hexavalent chromium (Cr(vi)) from aqueous solutions. The very high removal efficiency of the composite for Cr(vi) (i.e. 49.5 mg g⁻¹) was revealed by the Langmuir sorption isotherm. More than 90% removal of Cr(vi) in just 5 minutes of interaction suggests very fast removal kinetics. Inner sphere complexation and coprecipitation of Cr(vi) can be concluded as major removal mechanisms. No influence of ionic strength suggests inner sphere complexation dominated in Cr(vi) uptake. pH of the solution didn't influence the sorption much but comparatively the removal was higher under alkaline conditions (99.4%) than under acidic conditions (93.7%). The presence of humic acid and bicarbonate ions reduced the sorption significantly. The final product, Cr–Al(OH)₃ results in precipitation by forming alum which indicates that clay supported amorphous aluminum nanocomposites can be considered as potential sorbents for toxic metal ions in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aalum 3aaluminum 3aaqueous solutions 3abentonite 3abicarbonates 3achromium 3aclay 3acoprecipitation 3ahumic acids 3aimage analysis 3aionic strength 3ametal ions 3ananocomposites 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium borohydride 3asorbents 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3atoxicity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aSingh, Nisha1 aTiwari, Ekta1 aDarbha, Gopala Krishna0 tRSC advances.g2019 Apr. 09, v. 9, no. 20 p.11160-11169dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra00742c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008800164520136000252592002801612650002601640650001601666650001401682650001101696650001101707650002301718650001601741650002401757650001001781700001801791700001901809700001901828700001601847773012001863856008001983852000902063655001202072IND60784086420221122192522.0220726e20220626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078408642DNAL7 a10.3390/insects130705812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Weixiang 10aLarval Crowding Did Not Enhance Adult Migration Propensity in Spodoptera frugiperda  aReproduction and flight are two major adaptive strategies to cope with environmental stress in migratory insects. However, research on density-mediated flight and reproduction in the global migratory agricultural pest Spodoptera frugiperda is lacking. In this study, flight and reproductive performances in response to larval crowding were investigated in S. frugiperda. We found that larval crowding significantly reduced the pupal and body weights of S. frugiperda. Adults reared under the highest density of 30 larvae/jar had the minimum wing expansion, which was significantly smaller than that of larvae reared under solitary conditions. Larval crowding also significantly increased the pre-oviposition period (POP) and period of first oviposition (PFO) but decreased the lifetime fecundity, flight duration and flight distance. Our results showed that S. frugiperda reared under solitary conditions exhibited higher pupal and body weights and stronger reproductive and flight capacities than those reared under high-density conditions. Larval crowding did not enhance the migration propensity in S. frugiperda adults. In conclusion, larval crowding may not be a major factor affecting FAW migration due to high levels of cannibalism. These findings provide new insights into the population dynamics of S. frugiperda under larval crowding conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3acannibalism 3afecundity 3aflight 3alarvae 3amigratory behavior 3aoviposition 3apopulation dynamics 3apupae1 aMeng, Linghe 1 aJiang, Xingfu 1 aCheng, Yunxia 1 aZhang, Lei 0 tInsects.g2022 June 26, v. 13, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects130705813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245006800198300001500266520122300281592002801504650001301532650002301545650002701568650002501595650002501620650001701645650003201662650001401694650001701708650001401725650001201739700002001751700001501771700002401786700002201810773015201832856006901984856010002053990002302153852000902176655001202185IND60643850820221118024852.0190514e20151116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064385082DNAL7 a10.3791/534002doi7 aPMC46927342pmcid7 a266509642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStones, Daniel H.10aBiomimetic materials to characterize bacteria-host interactions  ap. e53400.  aBacterial attachment to host cells is one of the earliest events during bacterial colonization of host tissues and thus a key step during infection. The biochemical and functional characterization of adhesins mediating these initial bacteria-host interactions is often compromised by the presence of other bacterial factors, such as cell wall components or secreted molecules, which interfere with the analysis. This protocol describes the production and use of biomimetic materials, consisting of pure recombinant adhesins chemically coupled to commercially available, functionalized polystyrene beads, which have been used successfully to dissect the biochemical and functional interactions between individual bacterial adhesins and host cell receptors. Protocols for different coupling chemistries, allowing directional immobilization of recombinant adhesins on polymer scaffolds, and for assessment of the coupling efficiency of the resulting “bacteriomimetic” materials are also discussed. We further describe how these materials can be used as a tool to inhibit pathogen mediated cytotoxicity and discuss scope, limitations and further applications of this approach in studying bacterial - host interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesins 3abacterial adhesion 3abacterial colonization 3abiomimetic materials 3acell wall components 3acytotoxicity 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3apathogens 3apolystyrenes 3areceptors 3atissues1 aAl-Saedi, Fitua1 aVaz, Diana1 aPerez-Soto, Nicolas1 aKrachler, Anne M.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2015 Nov. 16, , no. 105 p.e53400-e53400dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/534003Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/53400/biomimetic-materials-to-characterize-bacteria-host-interactions  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100003400148245006200182300001400244520113000258592002801388650001501416650002501431650002301456650001701479650001201496650001101508650001301519651001101532700004101543700002401584700003201608700003401640773009101674856008401765852000901849655001201858IND4487789820221119025200.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448778982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2012.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinoti, Daniel Henrique Breda10aRegulation of even-aged forest with adjacency constraints  ap. 49-57.  aThe objective of this work is to present a model of forest regulation to include adjacency constraints and present an evaluation index that fits the characteristics of even-aged forest in Brazil. The models were constructed for a model farm with an area of effective planting of 3491ha, divided into 135 management units. The regulation models were formulated as model I, including integer constraints for the management units. We used meta-heuristic genetic algorithm for solving the models. For comparison we formulated a classical model of forest regulation. The purpose was maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV). The application of the technique of genetic algorithm is efficient for solving models, built with constraints and objectives of socioeconomic and environmental character. A comparison of volume variation is discussed to satisfy the demand of production imposed on all models. The inclusion of the adjacency constraint has reduced the overall NPV at 8% compared to the classical model. The IHA has shown to be feasible and efficient for evaluating the environmental influences of forest management even-aged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aeven-aged management 3aforest plantations 3aforestry law 3aforests 3amodels 3aplanting 3aBrazil1 aBinoti, Mayra Luiza Marques da Silva1 aLeite, Helio Garcia1 aGleriani, JosÃ© Marinaldo1 aCampos, JoÃ£o Carlos Chagas0 tForest policy and economics.g2012 July, v. 20 p.49-57dElsevier B.V.x1389-93417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2012.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03020naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012900168300001800297500001900315520133400334536024001668592002801908650001901936650001301955650002501968650001301993650002102006650001602027650001302043653002202056653002302078653001302101653002402114653001402138653002802152700002702180700001902207700002202226700003002248700001902278700002002297773013902317856008502456852000902541655001202550IND60722638520221123041642.0210106e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072263852DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2020.18265122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTejada, Luis10aNutritional and sensorial characteristics of zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.) as affected by freezing and the culinary treatment  ap. 1825-1833.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe objective of this study was to analyze the effect of freezing and different culinary treatments (stir-fried and steamed) on the nutritional composition, bioactive compounds, and sensorial characteristics of zucchini. The zucchini was stir-fried for 8 min at 250ºC and steamed for 13 min at 100ºC. The freezing of raw zucchini did not significantly affect its nutritional compounds. The stir-frying process provoked important moisture loss; this being higher when zucchini was previously frozen. The content of ash, proteins and fats significantly increased in stir-fried zucchini. There was an important decrease in antioxidant activity and phenolic compounds when the zucchini was frozen. The antioxidant activity was much greater in the stir-fried produce in comparison to steamed and raw. Freezing the raw zucchini provoked a significant loss in its adhesiveness qualities and hardness. A lower hardness and adhesiveness were also observed in frozen zucchini after steamed and stir-fried, these changes were not being observed in freezing. The sensorial characteristics of previously frozen zucchini were valued less by the consumer as well as those that were steamed and stir-fried. The culinary treatment affected the sensorial values less and only better were observed in fresh steamed zucchini than the stir-fried.  aThis research was financially supported by Instituto de Fomento de la Región de Murcia (INFO) through project: “Design and development of culinary treatments for frozen vegetables to obtain a high nutritional and sensory quality.”  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita pepo 3aadhesion 3aantioxidant activity 3ahardness 3anutrient content 3astir frying 3azucchini 0aCucurbita pepo L. 0aculinary treatment 0afreezing 0abioactive compounds 0asensorial 0anutritional composition1 aBuendía-Moreno, Laura1 aVillegas, Alba1 aCayuela, José M.1 aBueno-Gavilá, Estefanía1 aGómez, Pablo,1 aAbellán, Adela0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 23, no. 1 p.1825-1833dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2020.18265123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04185naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245010300164506002800267520283900295592002803134506003703162650001903199650001503218650001103233650002803244650001703272650001103289650001403300650001303314650001603327650000903343650001703352650002003369650001403389650001903403653001703422653001503439653001303454700002703467700002103494700002003515773009103535856008003626852000903706655001203715IND60784746220221207100035.0220617e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078474622DNAL7 a10.13057/biodiv/d2306132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPRABOWO, HERI 10aStable isotope analysis to assess the trophic level of arthropod in sugarcane ratoon agroecosystem  aResource is Open Access  aPrabowo H, Rahardjo BT, Mudjiono G, Rizali A. 2022. Stable isotope analysis to assess the trophic level of arthropod in sugarcane ratoon agroecosystem. Biodiversitas 23: 2871-2881. Arthropods represent one of the main components of soil inhabitants and play an important role in maintaining soil health, as well as providing ecosystem services. The description of the trophic level of the ratoon sugarcane agroecosystem is needed to describe the role of organisms in the ecosystem to maximize the role of detritivores, predators, and parasitoids in the ratoon sugarcane agroecosystem. The stable isotope approach is widely used in various studies to describe trophic levels in an agroecosystem. The stable isotope technique, especially the one that uses stable isotopes of carbon (?13C) and nitrogen (?15N), can measure the trophic position that integrates energy assimilation or mass flow through all the different trophic pathways leading to an organism. Stable isotopes ?13C and ?15N can be used to identify the roles of arthropods in the ratoon sugarcane agroecosystem by identifying the composition of both isotopes. The ratio of arthropod's carbon assimilation (?13C) to sugarcane ranges from-1.4 to-5.45‰. In contrast, the ratio of nitrogen assimilation (?15N) of arthropod to sugarcane ranges from 3.86 to 39.7‰. The values of stable isotope ?13C and ?15N on predator and parasitoids are varied. The stable isotope value of carbon (?13C) for predators varies from-10.14 to-11.62‰. In contrast, the predator's stable isotope value of nitrogen (?15N) varies from 9.17 to 18.1%. The parasitoids' carbon stable isotope value (?13C) varies from 10.5 to 11.05‰. In contrast, parasitoids' nitrogen stable isotope value (?15N) varies from 12.8 to 17.05‰. The value of carbon (?13C) stable isotope assimilation between herbivores and predators varies from 0.006 to 1.38‰. While the value of nitrogen (?15N) stable isotope assimilation varies in the range of 0.33 to 10.3‰. Furthermore, the value of carbon (?13C) stable isotope assimilation between herbivores and parasitoids varies in the range of 5.3 to 9.23‰. While the value of nitrogen (?15N) stable isotope assimilation varies in the range of 3.79 to 10.3‰. Isotope content (?13C) shows the food resources of arthropods in the agroecosystem, while isotope value (?15N) shows the roles of arthropods in the sugarcane ratoon agroecosystem. Carbon stable isotope values of predator and parasitoids are close to zero. While the stable nitrogen isotope (?15N) values on arthropods are averagely above 10‰, values are suspected of having roles as predators or parasitoids. Knowing the trophic level of predators and parasitoids through stable isotopes in agroecosystems can be used to conserve and optimize natural enemies to suppress the development of herbivores.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagroecosystems 3aarthropods 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide fixation 3adetritivores 3aenergy 3amass flow 3anitrogen 3aparasitoids 3asoil 3asoil quality 3astable isotopes 3asugarcane 3atrophic levels 0aassimilation 0aparasitoid 0apredator1 aRahardjo, Bambang Tri,1 aMudjiono, Gatot,1 aRIZALI, AKHMAD 0 tBiodiversitas.g2022 May, v. 23, no. 6dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.13057/biodiv/d2306133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245013000175300001800305520117200323592002801495650002101523650001301544650001601557650001301573650002501586650001801611650001301629650001001642650001801652650002001670650001301690650001801703650002301721650001401744650002401758700002201782700002201804700002301826773014201849856007401991852000902065655001202074IND60670712120221120202330.0191002e20140219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067071212DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb21821j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, S.-J.q(Sarah-Jane),10aDiscrimination between bacterial phenotypes using glyco-nanoparticles and the impact of polymer coating on detection readouts  ap. 1490-1498.  aThe identification and treatment of bacterial infections remains a major healthcare challenge, especially to ensure appropriate application of a limited spectrum of antibiotics. Here we describe a system capable of discriminating between different strains of Escherichia coli using multivalent, carbohydrate-functionalised, gold nanoparticles based on their different expression levels of the FimH adhesin. Upon binding of the glycosylated nanoparticles to FimH positive bacteria, the nanoparticles' optical properties change enabling the identification of bacteria strain. Comparison between direct conjugation, or via a linker, of the carbohydrate to the nanoparticle revealed significant effects on the performance of the detection system. Using a poly(ethylene glycol) spacer increased the stability, and specificity, of the glycosylated nanoparticles but also reduced aggregation upon bacterial binding. This prevented the well-known red-blue gold colour change, meaning spectrophometric, rather than optical, assessment methods were required. Using this method, FimH positive bacteria could be detected at approximately 1.5 × 10⁷ colony forming units per mL.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadhesins 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3acarbohydrates 3acoatings 3acolor 3aglycosylation 3ahealth services 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties 3aphenotype 3apolyethylene glycol1 aFullam, Elizabeth1 aBesra, Gurdyal S.1 aGibson, Matthew I.0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Feb. 19, v. 2, no. 11 p.1490-1498dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21821j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245005700178520169600235592002801931650000801959650001501967650002001982650001902002650001402021650001002035650001302045650001102058651001602069653001402085653001702099653002502116653003302141653000802174653000802182700002102190700002602211700002602237773010502263856008702368852000902455655001202464IND60724187720221122145742.0211030e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072418772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1054502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaṇḍāra, Sampat,10aGroups of narrow bipolar events within thunderstorms  aThis investigation is focused on groups of Narrow Bipolar Events (NBEs), defined as NBEs that occurred within 10 km horizontally and ±660 ms of a located, large-amplitude NBE from a dataset of positive NBEs that occurred in Mississippi thunderstorms. In two months only 15 groups were found, with a total of 31 positive and 4 negative NBEs. Each group had 2 to 5 NBEs; four groups had both positive and negative polarity NBEs. About half of the NBEs had typical values for range-normalized fast antenna (FA) electric field change magnitudes (4–15 V/m) and typical VHF powers (1000–45,000 W), but 17 NBEs had FA magnitudes 0.2–2.5 V/m, and 17 NBEs had VHF powers 30–900 W. Seven weak NBEs had FA magnitudes of 0.2–1.0 V/m and VHF powers of 30–100 W. These findings indicate that weak NBEs are more common than previously thought. None of the NBEs in groups initiated a lightning flash, and (with one possible exception) none of the later NBEs in a group were initiated by earlier NBEs in the group. The data of the NBE groups are consistent with the turbulence-extensive air shower (EAS)/relativistic runaway electron avalanche (RREA) mechanism, which states that each NBE occurs in a separate 1-km³ volume containing many small regions with electric field ≥3 MV/(m∙atm); an EAS/RREA passing through the 1-km³ volume initiates the positive streamers that comprise the NBE. Relative to thunderstorm radar reflectivity, 23 NBEs occurred in or above the reflectivity core, 10 NBEs occurred high in the storm anvil, and 2 NBEs occurred beside the storm core. We speculate that the occurrence of many of the NBE groups was associated with dynamically intense convection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aconvection 3adata collection 3aelectric field 3alightning 3aradar 3aresearch 3astorms 3aMississippi 0aLightning 0aThunderstorm 0aNarrow bipolar event 0aCompact intracloud discharge 0aNBE 0aCID1 aMarshall, Thomas1 aKarunarathne, Sumedhe1 aStolzenburg, Maribeth0 tAtmospheric research.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 252 p.105450-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1054503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010700154300001800261500002000279520180400299592002802103650002302131650001502154650001202169650002002181650001802201650001202219650002102231650001702252650001602269650001002285650001302295650001202308650001302320650001102333650003802344650001402382650002502396650003502421650001002456650000902466700001402475700001502489700001502504700001302519700001702532700001602549700001602565700001502581700001802596773010102614856007302715852000902788655001202797IND60572234520221119110227.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057223452DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.140532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoi, A.

Wine fermentation and biological ageing are performed by strains of S. cerevisiae with, respectively, pelagic fermentative growth on glucose and biofilm aerobic growth utilizing ethanol. Here, we use environmental samples of wine and flor yeasts to investigate the genomic basis of yeast adaptation to contrasted anthropogenic environments. Phylogenetic inference and population structure analysis based on single nucleotide polymorphisms revealed a group of flor yeasts separated from wine yeasts. A combination of methods revealed several highly differentiated regions between wine and flor yeasts, and analyses using codon‐substitution models for detecting molecular adaptation identified sites under positive selection in the high‐affinity transporter gene ZRT1. The cross‐population composite likelihood ratio revealed selective sweeps at three regions, including in the hexose transporter gene HXT7, the yapsin gene YPS6 and the membrane protein coding gene MTS27. Our analyses also revealed that the biological ageing environment has led to the accumulation of numerous mutations in proteins from several networks, including Flo11 regulation and divalent metal transport. Together, our findings suggest that the tuning of FLO11 expression and zinc transport networks are a distinctive feature of the genetic changes underlying the domestication of flor yeasts. Our study highlights the multiplicity of genomic changes underlying yeast adaptation to man‐made habitats and reveals that flor/wine yeast lineage can serve as a useful model for studying the genomics of adaptive divergence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadaptive radiation 3aaerobiosis 3abiofilm 3adivalent metals 3adomestication 3aethanol 3aeukaryotic cells 3afermentation 3aflor yeasts 3agenes 3agenomics 3aglucose 3ahabitats 3amodels 3amonosaccharide transport proteins 3aphylogeny 3apopulation structure 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3awines 3azinc1 aBigey, F.1 aMallet, S.1 aMarsit, S.1 aZara, G.1 aGladieux, P.1 aGaleote, V.1 aBudroni, M.1 aDequin, S.1 aLegras, J.

For the last years the southern Pyrenees has been the target of intense geological, palaeontological and geochronological research. Hundreds of fossil localities are now framed in high-resolution lithological sections. The succession of these sites, most of them located in the Tremp Syncline, is based on the physical correlation of rock bodies, as permitted by the general outcropping conditions. Outside this syncline, correlation is supported by geochronologic and biostratigraphic data (mainly magnetostratigraphy and planktic foraminifera biostratigraphy). The integration of the entire dataset sheds new light on the Maastrichtian dinosaur turnover, characterized by a shift from a sauropod-dominated to a hadrosauroid-dominated faunal assemblage. This turnover was progressive and involved immigrants from North America, Eurasia and Gondwana, which probably reached the study area after a sea level drop. This faunal change was mainly triggered by the arrival of lambeosaurine hadrosauroids, a group that rapidly displaced the rest of the herbivorous clades of the region. Some of the extinction events suffered by the “pre-turnover” faunas during the Maastrichtian coincide with marine isotopic and sea-level drop events, suggesting that faunal competition was not the only cause of the observed changes in dinosaur composition. Despite this faunal replacement, the resulting ecosystem after the turnover shows no major loss of biodiversity before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCretaceous period 3aRetaria 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3abiostratigraphy 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3aextinction 3afauna 3afossils 3aherbivores 3aimmigration 3asea level 3aEurasia 3aFrance 3aIberian Peninsula 3aNorth America 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aPyrenees 0aDinosaur succession 0aCampanian and Maastrichtian stratigraphy 0aFaunal changes1 aRiera, V.1 aVila, B.1 aSellés, A.G.1 aDinarès-Turell, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5546-22911 aVicens, E.1 aGaete, R.1 aOms, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8355-847X1 aGalobart, À.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2019 Apr., v. 191 p.168-189dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2019.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245015300188300001600341520061100357592002800968650000800996650001601004650001601020650001401036650001401050650001701064650001201081650001801093650002101111650002401132650004201156650001501198650002201213650001101235650001101246650003701257650004901294650001401343650002201357700001901379700002001398700002101418700002101439700001701460700002301477700001801500700002001518700002001538700002001558700001801578773009801596856008401694990002301778852000901801655001201810IND60092079620221121175317.0141103e20111028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009207962DNAL7 a217269372pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYagyu, Shigeki10aPreoperative analysis of 11q loss using circulating tumor-released DNA in serum: A novel diagnostic tool for therapy stratification of neuroblastoma  ap. 185-189.  aAllelic deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q loss) is closely associated with the prognosis of neuroblastoma (NB).

This paper proposes an alternative interpretation for Neolithic mountain sites found in the southern Pyrenean slopes. The archaeobotanical and archaeozoological record of highland and lowland sites from this region is compared in order to observe any differences in crop and animal husbandry. Available data indicate that mountain sites present a similar record to the one observed in the lowlands. Most sites show clear evidence of permanent activity, including agriculture, as well as other practices connected to medium- to long-term strategies like storage of plant products. We propose that more integrated analyses are needed in this and other regions to fully characterize mountain economy during the Neolithic, since no clear evidence of pastoralism or transhumance has been found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal husbandry 3aarchaeobotany 3afarmers 3alowlands 3amountains 3aplant products 3atranshumance 0aInterdisciplinary analysis 0aCrop husbandry 0aAnimal husbandry 0aNeolithic farming 0aIberian Peninsula1 aNavarrete, Vanessa1 aSaña, María,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8344-06391 aViñerta, Ángel1 aGassiot, Ermengol1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0457-48050 tQuaternary international.g2018 Aug. 10, v. 484 p.75-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.05.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03964naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245022300158520249400381592002802875650001502903650001702918650001902935650001102954650002102965650001402986650004303000650001303043650002303056650002603079650002203105650001503127650001603142650002203158650001503180651001003195700001803205700001703223700002103240700001803261700001403279773012903293856007503422852000903497655001203506IND60784209320221121133844.0220726e20220710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078420932DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengkun 10aQuantitative Analysis of Natural and Anthropogenic Factors Influencing Vegetation NDVI Changes in Temperate Drylands from a Spatial Stratified Heterogeneity Perspective: A Case Study of Inner Mongolia Grasslands, China  aThe detection and attribution of vegetation dynamics in drylands is an important step for the development of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies to combat the challenges posed by human activities and climate change. However, due to the spatial heterogeneity and interactive influences of various factors, quantifying the contributions of driving forces on vegetation change remains challenging. In this study, using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy of vegetation growth status and coverage, we analyzed the temporal and spatial characteristics of the NDVI in China’s Inner Mongolian grasslands using Theil–Sen slope statistics and Mann–Kendall trend test methods. In addition, using the GeoDetector method, a spatially-based statistical technique, we assessed the individual and interactive influences of natural factors and human activities on vegetation-NDVI change. The results show that the growing season average NDVI exhibited a fluctuating upward trend of 0.003 per year from 2000 to 2018. The areas with significant increases in NDVI (p < 0.05) accounted for 45.63% of the entire region, and they were mainly distributed in the eastern part of the Mu Us sandy land and the eastern areas of the Greater Khingan Range. The regions with a decline in the NDVI were mainly distributed in the central and western regions of the study area. The GeoDetector results revealed that both natural and human factors had significant impacts on changes in the NDVI (p < 0.001). Precipitation, livestock density, wind speed, and population density were the dominant factors affecting NDVI changes in the Inner Mongolian grasslands, explaining more than 15% of the variability, while the contributions of the two topography factors (terrain slope and slope aspect) were relatively low (less than 2%). Furthermore, NDVI changes responded to the changes in the level of specific influencing factors in a nonlinear way, and the interaction of two factors enhanced the effect of each singular factor. The interaction between precipitation and temperature was the highest among all factors, accounting for 39.3% of NDVI variations. Findings from our study may aid policymakers in better understanding the relative importance of various factors and the impacts of the interactions between factors on vegetation change, which has important implications for preventing and mitigating land degradation and achieving sustainable pasture use in dryland ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3ahumans 3aland degradation 3alivestock 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3apastures 3apopulation density 3aquantitative analysis 3aspatial variation 3astatistics 3atemperature 3atopographic slope 3awind speed 3aChina1 aLi, Xiaobing 1 aGong, Jirui 1 aDang, Dongliang 1 aDou, Huashun 1 aLyu, Xin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 10, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02745naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245010000197300001600297500002000313520156300333592002801896650002001924650002201944650002101966650001401987650001302001650002402014650001802038650000902056651001202065700006302077700002102140773013802161856007502299852000902374655001202383IND60777799220221119050338.0220521e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077779922DNAL7 a10.1002/saj2.203812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsiecka, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1846-734110aSlash pine growth and nitrogen leaching potential following fertilization and pinestraw removal  ap. 810-830.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCommercial pine plantations in the southern United States are commonly fertilized to enhance growth and to replenish nutrients following timber harvests or repetitive raking of pinestraw, an important secondary product. We examined the effects of pinestraw removal and fertilization on pine growth and N leaching potential in an 8‐yr‐old slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.) plantation in North Florida. Raking treatments (raked or nonraked) were applied annually in February 2014–2017. Fertilization treatments (controlled‐release polymer‐coated urea at 0, 28, 56, 140, or urea at 56 kg N ha–¹ yr–¹) were applied annually in June 2014–2016. Pinestraw removal had no effect on stand growth. Fertilization did not enhance pine growth and increased mortality at the highest application rate. All fertilized treatments raised ammonium N (NH₄–N) and nitrate–nitrite N (NOₓ–N) concentrations in soil solution at 30‐cm depth, indicating increased leaching potential. The period of elevated NH₄–N concentrations occurred from 1 to 4 wk after fertilization, and the period of elevated NOₓ–N concentrations occurred from 1 to 13 or 26 wk following fertilization, with NOₓ–N concentration peaks (up to 98 mg L–¹) at 4 or 8 wk. Soil solution NH₄–N and NOₓ–N concentrations increased with increasing N application rate and with consecutive fertilizations. Polymer‐coated urea had no advantage over urea in terms of pine growth but resulted in slightly lower soil solution NOₓ–N concentrations in raked plots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus elliottii 3aammonium nitrogen 3afertilizer rates 3amortality 3anitrogen 3apolymer-coated urea 3asoil solution 3aurea 3aFlorida1 aMinogue, Patrick J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2332-99361 aLauer, Dwight K.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2022 May, v. 86, no. 3 p.810-830dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.203813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245006900175300001400244520196100258592002802219650001602247650001402263650001302277650002602290650001302316650001302329650001402342650002402356650001402380650002602394650001402420650001602434650000902450651001702459653002902476653002602505700002502531773010602556856008602662852000902748655001202757IND60691490820221118024304.0200430e20090401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069149082DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2009.114074382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, Ashadee K.10aDo dwarf chameleons (Bradypodion) show developmental plasticity?  ap. 45-54.  aDevelopmental plasticity results from environmental influences on the phenotype of an organism during its development, and its effects are irreversible. The phenomenon of phenotype–genotype uncoupling (plasticity) causes problems in species delineations, and has been suggested as a cause underlying a mismatch between morphology and genetics between the Natal Midlands dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion thamnobates) and the KwaZulu dwarf chameleon (Bradypodion melanocephalum). The two species are morphologically distinct, but are very poorly distinguished genetically. It has been hypothesized that B. melanocephalum and B. thamnobates may be phenotypically plastic populations of the same species, since environmental conditions, the driving force behind developmental plasticity, varies between the distributions of these two allopatric taxa.We raised juveniles of both species under identical controlled laboratory conditions. Two treatments were used. These varied in both habitat structure and temperature, each approximating conditions that one of the species would encounter naturally. Although not specifically controlled or monitored, all other environmental factors (e.g. humidity, light and wind) were standardized since chameleons were raised in the artificial conditions created in environmental chambers. If taxa are developmentally plastic, phenotypes would reflect treatment conditions, irrespective of specific associations. Neither B. thamnobates nor B. melanocephalum were phenotypically plastic over the environmental differences tested; species developed into the expected phenotypes, irrespective of treatment conditions. The low genetic difference between B. thamnobates and B. melanocephalum may indicate their recent divergence from a common ancestor or the mitochondrial gene fragments (ND2 and 16S) used in previously published phylogenetic analyses of the genus may not be representative of divergence for the genome as a whole.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradypodion 3aallopatry 3aancestry 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3ahumidity 3ajuveniles 3amitochondrial genes 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aphylogeny 3atemperature 3awind 3aSouth Africa 0adevelopmental plasticity 0aphylogenetic mismatch1 aAlexander, Graham J.0 tAfrican zoology.g2009 Apr. 1, v. 44, no. 1 p.45-54dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2009.114074383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04062naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245016600171300001200337520245400349592002802803650002202831650001802853650001702871650001502888650001202903650003102915650001002946650001702956650002302973650001802996650001603014650001103030650001603041650001403057650001603071650001903087650002003106650001003126700002103136700001903157700002403176700001903200700001903219700002003238700002303258700002403281700001803305773010503323856008303428852000903511655001203520IND60779555320221119073157.0221005e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077955532DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-022-03667-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPtošková, Klára10aChanges in the concentrations and transcripts for gibberellins and other hormones in a growing leaf and roots of wheat seedlings in response to water restriction  ap. 284.  aBACKGROUND: Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a major source of nutrition globally, but yields can be seriously compromised by water limitation. Redistribution of growth between shoots and roots is a common response to drought, promoting plant survival, but reducing yield. Gibberellins (GAs) are necessary for shoot and root elongation, but roots maintain growth at lower GA concentrations compared with shoots, making GA a suitable hormone for mediating this growth redistribution. In this study, the effect of progressive drought on GA content was determined in the base of the 4th leaf and root tips of wheat seedlings, containing the growing regions, as well as in the remaining leaf and root tissues. In addition, the contents of other selected hormones known to be involved in stress responses were determined. Transcriptome analysis was performed on equivalent tissues and drought-associated differential expression was determined for hormone-related genes. RESULTS: After 5 days of applying progressive drought to 10-day old seedlings, the length of leaf 4 was reduced by 31% compared with watered seedlings and this was associated with significant decreases in the concentrations of bioactive GA₁ and GA₄ in the leaf base, as well as of their catabolites and precursors. Root length was unaffected by drought, while GA concentrations were slightly, but significantly higher in the tips of droughted roots compared with watered plants. Transcripts for the GA-inactivating gene TaGA2ox4 were elevated in the droughted leaf, while those for several GA-biosynthesis genes were reduced by drought, but mainly in the non-growing region. In response to drought the concentrations of abscisic acid, cis-zeatin and its riboside increased in all tissues, indole-acetic acid was unchanged, while trans-zeatin and riboside, jasmonate and salicylic acid concentrations were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced leaf elongation and maintained root growth in wheat seedlings subjected to progressive drought were associated with attenuated and increased GA content, respectively, in the growing regions. Despite increased TaGA2ox4 expression, lower GA levels in the leaf base of droughted plants were due to reduced biosynthesis rather than increased catabolism. In contrast to GA, the other hormones analysed responded to drought similarly in the leaf and roots, indicating organ-specific differential regulation of GA metabolism in response to drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acatabolism 3adrought 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agibberellins 3aindole acetic acid 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaf length 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3anutrition 3aroot growth 3asalicylic acid 3atranscriptomics 3awheat1 aSzecówka, Marek1 aJaworek, Pavel1 aTarkowská, Danuše1 aPetřík, Ivan1 aPavlović, Iva1 aNovák, Ondřej1 aThomas, Stephen G.1 aPhillips, Andrew L.1 aHedden, Peter0 tBMC plant biology.g2022 Dec., v. 22, no. 1 p.284-284dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03667-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245019500159300001800354500002000372520168100392592002802073650001502101650001302116650002502129650001302154650000902167650001602176650001702192650001102209650001402220650001502234650001602249700002902265700001902294700001802313773010102331856007302432852000902505655001202514IND60572234920221119110409.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057223492DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.140682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilleen, Joshua10aEvolutionary rescue and local adaptation under different rates of temperature increase: a combined analysis of changes in phenotype expression and genotype frequency in Paramecium microcosms  ap. 1734-1746.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEvolutionary rescue (ER) occurs when populations, which have declined due to rapid environmental change, recover through genetic adaptation. The success of this process and the evolutionary trajectory of the population strongly depend on the rate of environmental change. Here we investigated how different rates of temperature increase (from 23 to 32 °C) affect population persistence and evolutionary change in experimental microcosms of the protozoan Paramecium caudatum. Consistent with theory on ER, we found that those populations experiencing the slowest rate of temperature increase were the least likely to become extinct and tended to be the best adapted to the new temperature environment. All high‐temperature populations were more tolerant to severe heat stress (35, 37 °C), indicating a common mechanism of heat protection. High‐temperature populations also had superior growth rates at optimum temperatures, leading to the absence of a pattern of local adaptation to control (23 °C) and high‐temperature (32 °C) environments. However, high‐temperature populations had reduced growth at low temperatures (5–9 °C), causing a shift in the temperature niche. In part, the observed evolutionary change can be explained by selection from standing variation. Using mitochondrial markers, we found complete divergence between control and high‐temperature populations in the frequencies of six initial founder genotypes. Our results confirm basic predictions of ER and illustrate how adaptation to an extreme local environment can produce positive as well as negative correlated responses to selection over the entire range of the ecological niche.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParamecium 3aProtozoa 3acorrelated responses 3agenotype 3aheat 3aheat stress 3amitochondria 3aniches 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aGougat‐Barbera, Claire1 aKrenek, Sascha1 aKaltz, Oliver0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Apr., v. 26, no. 7 p.1734-1746dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.140683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010300168300001600271500001500287520140600302592002801708650001001736650001401746650001401760650002001774650001201794650001101806650001501817651002801832651001201860651001001872651001201882651001601894653001901910700002501929700002501954773011001979856004802089852000902137655001202146IND4467591120221118045940.0120416e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446759112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-011-0555-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpinelli, Raffaele10aAnnual usage and long-term productivity of a truck-mounted slash bundler under mountain conditions  ap. 821-827.  a2019-12-06  aThe paper presents the main results of a long-term follow-up study conducted on the first truck-mounted slash bundler deployed on the Alps. Data collection covers the 58-month period from the commissioning of the machine in January 2004 to the completion of this study in October 2008. During this period, the machine worked all across the Alps, covering Austria, Germany and Italy from its Swiss base. Frequent travelling can be considered a general condition for Alpine operations, where operators must deal with comparatively small and scattered landings: a highly mobile truck-base unit is most suited to these conditions, which require frequent relocation. The study also highlights a typical Alpine annual usage pattern, with activity peaks during the summer and lows in mid-winter, due to bad weather conditions. It also shows a growing usage trend, with usage levels almost doubling in 4 years, as the new technology receives widespread appreciation. Gross bundling productivity averages 10 bundles or about 4.5 green metric tons per worksite hour, while diesel consumption is below 1 l per bundle. The skill of individual operators can account for differences in productivity of up to 30%. The findings of this research provide further insight into the results obtained from a number of shorter studies conducted on the same machine by several scientific institutions across Central Europe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aslash 3aequipment 3amountains 3adata collection 3aweather 3asummer 3atechnology 3aCentral European region 3aGermany 3aItaly 3aAustria 3aAlps region 0anew technology1 aLombardini, Carolina1 aMagagnotti, Natascia0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2012 May, v. 131, no. 3 p.821-827dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-011-0555-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245019700167300001600364520201900380592002802399650002202427650002602449650001102475650000902486650000902495650001302504650001302517650000902530650001102539650001402550650001202564650002002576650001802596651001502614653003802629653003002667653002402697653003202721653002502753653001502778700001902793700002002812700005902832773010802891856008502999852000903084655001203093IND60571128420221122155535.0180904e20171130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057112842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2017.05.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sunghan10aRelationship between δ15N values of bulk sediments and total organic carbon concentration in response to orbital-scale biogenic opal production in the Bering slope area over the last 600 kyrs  ap. 144-152.  aBiogenic opal production in the surface water of the Bering Sea shows clear orbital-scale variations such as interglacial highs and glacial lows. In this study, we examined the variation patterns in δ¹⁵N of bulk sediment (δ¹⁵Nbulk) reflecting nitrate utilization, and total organic carbon (TOC) concentration in terms of organic carbon (OC) production, in response to the orbital-scale biogenic opal production during the last 600 kyrs at Site U1343 (IODP Exp. 323) in the Bering slope area. At Site U1343, δ¹⁵Nbulk value and TOC concentration do not show the distinct glacial-interglacial change. Moreover, contrary to the weak correlation between TOC and biogenic opal concentrations, TOC concentration is positively correlated with δ¹⁵Nbulk value, indicating the strong control of OC production on nitrate utilization. It should be noted that glacial terminations are characterized by high δ¹⁵Nbulk value, high TOC and low biogenic opal concentration whereas the following full interglacials are characterized by low δ¹⁵Nbulk value, low TOC and high biogenic opal concentration during the last 600 kyrs. In other words, glacial terminations are characterized by complete nitrate utilization associated with high OC production under low biogenic opal production, whereas the following full interglacial periods are characterized by decreased nitrate utilization associated with low OC production under high biogenic opal production. Such different glacial-interglacial variation patterns of OC production and nitrate utilization in response to biogenic opal production can best be explained by variable Si/C (or Si/N) uptake ratio by diatoms possibly owing to Fe availability. The glacial Fe input increase at Site U1343 is thought to be ascribed to more dust input or large discharge from the glacial Yukon River. These findings imply that Fe transport and contribution may play a significant role in governing the nutrient cycles in the Bering slope region of the Northern Hemisphere.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3adust 3airon 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aopal 3arivers 3asediments 3asilicon 3astable isotopes 3asurface water 3aBering Sea 0aNitrogen isotope of bulk sediment 0aOrganic carbon production 0aNitrate utilization 0aSi/C (or Si/N) uptake ratio 0aGlacial-interglacial 0aBering Sea1 aKhim, Boo-Keun1 aIkehara, Minoru1 aTakahashi, Kozo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8660-43710 tQuaternary international.g2017 Nov. 30, v. 459 p.144-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2017.05.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010200176300001400278520110400292592002801396650002101424650002401445650001301469650001501482650002301497650001201520650002001532650001301552650001001565650001901575650002701594650001301621650001401634650001201648650001201660653001801672653002601690653002001716700002101736773010601757856008601863852000901949655001201958IND60691491020221118024325.0200430e20090401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069149102DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2009.114074402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Tiawanna D.10aPreliminary evidence suggests extra-pair mating in the endangered echo parakeet, Psittacula eques  ap. 71-74.  aParrots are generally considered monogamous, forming strict pairs when breeding. Echo parakeets are unusual in that, although traditional breeding pairs occur, there are also multi-male breeding groups. This raises questions about the potential for extra-pair copulations. Genotype data were obtained from the dominant male and female in eight breeding groups (including three with profiles of attendant auxiliary males) and their 36 offspring. A further 34 offspring were available from eight breeding groups where profiles were available for a single parent. This study utilized four microsatellite genetic markers, originally developed for the African grey parrot. Parentage testing was undertaken using genotype comparisons with the dominant pair within the breeding group as well as auxiliary males where available. Although four markers were insufficient to provide conclusive evidence they do suggest that extra-pair copulation occurs in this species. The echo parakeet is classified as endangered (<500 birds) and understanding its mating system would be valuable in its future conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsittacula eques 3aPsittacus erithacus 3abreeding 3acopulation 3aendangered species 3afemales 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3amales 3amating systems 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonogamy 3aparentage 3aparrots 3aprogeny 0aEcho parakeet 0aextra-pair copulation 0amicrosatellites1 aParkin, David T.0 tAfrican zoology.g2009 Apr. 1, v. 44, no. 1 p.71-74dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2009.114074403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007900166300001600245520149800261592002801759650001301787650001601800650001301816650001601829650002301845650001901868650001301887650003701900700001601937700001601953700001601969700001401985700001601999700001902015773008602034856008402120852000902204655001202213IND60598972120221120112954.0180702e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059897212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHinks, J.A.10aDynamic microstructural evolution of graphite under displacing irradiation  ap. 273-284.  aGraphitic materials and graphite composites experience dimensional change when exposed to radiation-induced atomic displacements. This has major implications for current and future technological ranging from nuclear fission reactors to the processing of graphene–silicon hybrid devices. Dimensional change in nuclear graphites is a complex problem involving the filler, binder, porosity, cracks and atomic-level effects all interacting within the polygranular structure. An improved understanding of the atomistic mechanisms which drive dimensional change within individual graphitic crystals is required to feed into the multiscale modelling of this system.In this study, micromechanically exfoliated samples of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite have been ion irradiated and studied in situ using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to gain insights into the response of single graphitic crystals to displacing radiation. Under continuous ion bombardment, a complex dynamic sequence of deformation evolves featuring several distinct stages from the inducement of strain, the creation of dislocations leading to dislocation arrays, the formation of kink band networks and localised doming of the sample. Observing these ion irradiation-induced processes using in situ TEM reveals previously unknown details of the sequence of microstructural developments and physics driving these phenomena. A mechanistic model consistent with the microstructural changes observed is presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystals 3adeformation 3agraphene 3airradiation 3amechanistic models 3amicrostructure 3aporosity 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aHaigh, S.J.1 aGreaves, G.1 aSweeney, F.1 aPan, C.T.1 aYoung, R.J.1 aDonnelly, S.E.0 tCarbon.g2014 Mar., v. 68 p.273-284dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008300163300001800246520128900264592002801553650001901581650001601600650001201616650001801628650001301646650001401659650001101673650001601684650001401700700001701714700001501731700001501746700001801761700002001779773012601799856008101925852000902006655001202015IND50068118120221119111451.0150208e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006811812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-013-2259-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuliano, P.10aEffects of Pilot Plant-Scale Ultrasound on Palm Oil Separation and Oil Quality  ap. 1253-1260.  aThe effects of ultrasonic standing waves on palm oil separation of ex-screw press feed from the mesocarp of the palm oil fruit, oil recovery and oil quality were determined. The ex-screw press feed at 85 °C was pumped simultaneously into two identical vessels. One vessel was the control (non-ultrasound) and the other vessel (ultrasound) was fitted with two 400 kHz transducer plates operating at 13.4 kJ/kg, which were placed in direct contact with the feed. Oiling-off by gravity settling occurred at faster rates after sonication. The total recoverable oil after 30 min gravity settling and upon centrifuging the underflow sludge (remaining colloidal fraction) at 1000×g was higher after sonication. Total recoverable oil was 30.7 ± 2.9 % and 43.5 ± 8.6 % (w/w original feed basis) for the non-sonicated and sonicated samples respectively. Sonication reduced the oil content of the sludge ex-centrifuge, demonstrating that higher recovery of palm oil was obtained with ultrasound application. Sonication did not affect the DOBI (deterioration of bleachability index) value, and vitamin E and free fatty acid contents of the separated oil. High-frequency ultrasound enhances the separation rate of palm oil and increases oil recovery without compromising oil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3adirect contact 3afatty acids 3agravity 3alipid content 3amesocarp 3apalm oils 3asludge 3aultrasonics 3avitamin E1 aSwiergon, P.1 aLee, K.

Despite their importance as contributors to the global carbonate budget and as paleo-environmental indicators for water depth, pH, temperature and water energy, the mechanism of formation of these concentric, sub-spherical concretions of tangentially or radially arranged aragonite or calcite crystals is still the subject of intense debate. Unlike oncoids, whose microbial origins are well acknowledged, ooids are traditionally viewed as abiotic grains, mainly produced in suspension by agitated, warm waters that are supersaturated with respect to CaCO3. Yet, there is considerable evidence, including geochemical bio-signatures and detection of viable microbes capable of mineralization and biofilm production and degradation, to suggest otherwise. The emergence of new and sophisticated technologies reveals that the level of microbial diversity of these sedimentary grains exceeds that of some microbialite systems. These findings have refined our understanding of ooid genesis and ooid accretion processes and argue toward microbial mediation both as a direct result of metabolic activities inducing changes in the environment conducive to precipitation and by a passive mechanism, in which mucilaginous extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) act as a template for mineral nucleation. Furthermore, new developments in the field indicate that carbonate mineralization in marine ooids occurs through sequential precipitations that involve an amorphous calcium carbonate phase (ACC), which some argue are of biotic origins. Herein, we discuss the most relevant theories of ooid formation, including some of the early pioneering studies that laid the groundwork for new theories attempting to decode the origins of these controversial grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaragonite 3abiochemical pathways 3abiofilm 3acalcite 3acalcium carbonate 3acrystals 3aenergy 3amicroorganisms 3amineralization 3apH 3apaleoecology 3apolymers 3aseawater 3atemperature 0aOoids 0aCarbonate precipitation 0aAmorphous calcium carbonate 0aMicrobe-mineral interactions 0aMicrobial metabolism 0aOrganomineralization 0aEPS1 aEberli, Gregor P.0 tEarth-science reviews.g2019 Mar., v. 190 p.536-556dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2018.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02510naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002700169245010200196300001600298520148700314592002801801653002001829653002301849653001701872653000901889653001401898653002101912653002001933653001501953773010201968856011702070852000902187655001202196IND60125344720221120181919.0151103e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012534472DNAL7 a10.1646/0006-3606(2001)033[0282:BPRIPA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafford, Hugh DeForest10aBrazilian Pááramos. III. Patterns and Rates of Postfire Regeneration in the Campos de Altitude1  ap. 282-302.  aPostfire vegetation development was studied at two recent mountaintop burns in the Serra do Caparaóó, Espíírito Santo//Minas Gerais, and the Serra dos ÓÓrgãos, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Both fires occurred within the pááramo-like ““campos de altitude””, a system of orographic grass- and scrublands restricted to the highest peaks of southeast Brazil. Data collected included pre- and postfire heights and densities of shrubs and trees, and cover of all taxa. Slopes of different aspect and altitude were sampled at each site to evaluate the effects of varying physical environment on regeneration. Rapid vegetative regeneration was common among shrubs and bamboo, with most taxa surviving fire. Regeneration and postfire colonization rates varied among species, and appeared to depend both on physical variables associated with different slopes, aspects and altitudes, and biotic variables. Most plant species in the campos de altitude show some form of evolutionary adaptation to fire. The distribution of species and plant populations across the landscapes of the campos de altitude appears to be largely the result of fire and its interactions with the biota, local topography, and climate. Results suggest that fire is an integral part of the ecology in these humid, seasonally dry ecosystems. Successful management of these unique and highly threatened systems requires a detailed understanding of the fire regime and its role in structuring biotic communities.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAtlantic Forest 0acampos de altitude 0aChusquea spp 0afire 0apááramo 0asoutheast Brazil 0atropical alpine 0avegetation0 tBiotropica.g2001 June, v. 33, no. 2 p.282-302dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F0006-3606%282001%29033%5B0282%3ABPRIPA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02397naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245010100172520142800273592002801701650001201729650002001741650002001761650002001781650001301801700002101814700002501835700002201860773012901882856007502011852000902086655001202095IND60784209720221121165152.0220726e20220710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078420972DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141433242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadeghi Esfahlani, Shabnam 14aThe Deep Convolutional Neural Network Role in the Autonomous Navigation of Mobile Robots (SROBO)  aThe ability to navigate unstructured environments is an essential task for intelligent systems. Autonomous navigation by ground vehicles requires developing an internal representation of space, trained by recognizable landmarks, robust visual processing, computer vision and image processing. A mobile robot needs a platform enabling it to operate in an environment autonomously, recognize the objects, and avoid obstacles in its path. In this study, an open-source ground robot called SROBO was designed to accurately identify its position and navigate certain areas using a deep convolutional neural network and transfer learning. The framework uses an RGB-D MYNTEYE camera, a 2D laser scanner and inertial measurement units (IMU) operating through an embedded system capable of deep learning. The real-time decision-making process and experiments were conducted while the onboard signal processing and image capturing system enabled continuous information analysis. State-of-the-art Real-Time Graph-Based SLAM (RTAB-Map) was adopted to create a map of indoor environments while benefiting from deep convolutional neural network (Deep-CNN) capability. Enforcing Deep-CNN improved the performance quality of the RTAB-Map SLAM. The proposed setting equipped the robot with more insight into its surroundings. The robustness of the SROBO increased by 35% using the proposed system compared to the conventional RTAB-Map SLAM.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acomputer vision 3adecision making 3aneural networks 3ascanners1 aSanaei, Alireza 1 aGhorabian, Mohammad 1 aShirvani, Hassan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 July 10, v. 14, no. 14dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141433243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245012600158300001400284520146800298592002801766650001201794650001501806650001901821650001201840650001301852650001201865650001801877650001701895650002001912650001601932650001101948650001601959650001801975650001101993653001602004653001602020653001502036653002002051653001702071773010902088856007102197852000902268655001202277IND60679874620221121001058.0200102s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067987462DNAL7 a10.1071/AM190052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurner, James M.14aThe interrelationship between torpor expression and nest site use of western and eastern pygmy-possums (Cercartetus spp.)  ap. 85-95.  aPhysiology and behaviour are closely linked, making knowledge of the interaction between species’ energetics and activities important when attempting to understand how animals function in the wild. I examined torpor use by western pygmy-possums (Cercartetus concinnus) and eastern pygmy-possums (C. nanus) in relation to nest site characteristics and movement patterns. In coastal mallee heath in winter, C. concinnus nested beneath leaf litter at the base of dead Banksia ornata, where they employed torpor on 69% of observed days. In warm temperate sclerophyll forest, C. nanus nested in tree hollows of Eucalyptus spp. and used torpor on 64% of days in winter and 10% in summer. Torpor was used in nest sites that were buffered from outside temperature extremes. Both species frequently reused nest sites and while C. nanus was more likely to employ torpor in a previously used site, site familiarity did not influence torpor use for C. concinnus. Additionally, C. nanus was more likely to use torpor in hollows with a higher relative thickness in both seasons. No relationship was found between range size and the number of tracking days or capture body mass, though sample sizes were small. I suggest that the thermal attributes of nest sites influence torpor use for both species and this is likely vital for maintaining a positive energy balance, stressing the importance of preserving habitat with ample potential nest sites for conservation management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBanksia 3aEucalyptus 3aenergy balance 3aforests 3ahabitats 3anesting 3anesting sites 3aplant litter 3aresting periods 3asample size 3asummer 3atemperature 3atree cavities 3awinter 0aBurramyidae 0ahibernation 0ahome range 0aradio telemetry 0atree hollows0 tAustralian mammalogy.g2020, v. 42, no. 1 p.85-95dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:J000001169x0310-00497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AM190053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02710naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007400163300001800237520137100255592002801626650001601654650002501670650002201695650001001717650004301727650001401770650000901784650001401793651001001807700002001817700002401837700001701861700002301878700002001901700002101921700001701942700002101959700001801980700002001998700002102018773013002039856007402169852000902243655001202252IND60671303720221120104025.0191002e20190926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067130372DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ay01547g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyers, Nicholas M.10aLab on paper: assay of beta-lactam pharmaceuticals by redox titration  ap. 4741-4750.  aField tests to detect substandard antibiotics are sorely needed in many low and middle-income countries (LMICs). We created a field screening test for amoxicillin capsules and ampicillin tablets based on USP method <425>. To measure the amount of antibiotic, the user dissolves the contents of the capsule in water, carries out a simple chemical degradation, and adds drops of the sample to a paper test card. The test card performs a titration and displays a series of blue dots for visual comparison to standard images. Pharmaceutical samples were collected in western Kenya and analyzed using a blinded methodology to validate the test card's quantitative performance against HPLC assay. Within the quantification range of the test card, the absolute assay error for dosage forms was 4.4% for amoxicillin and 5.3% for ampicillin, and inter-operator precision was 2%. Users correctly categorized 94% of amoxicillin (n = 84) and 88% of ampicillin (n = 56) samples as either containing less than or greater than 90% of the expected amount of antibiotic, which is the lower regulatory limit. The test card detected several lot numbers of a substandard amoxicillin product, confirmed by HPLC analysis to contain only 40–60% of the stated amoxicillin content. IR, PXRD, and gravimetric analysis revealed that talc made up the remainder of the adulterated medications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamoxicillin 3achemical degradation 3adrug formulations 3adrugs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ascreening 3atalc 3atitration 3aKenya1 aMaina, Mercy W.1 aWere, Phelix Makoto1 aKarwa, Rakhi1 aPastakia, Sonak D.1 aSharp, Jalen C.1 aLuther, Jamie L.1 aCooper, Adam1 aBliese, Sarah L.1 aOberhof, Nils1 aAldulaimi, Doaa1 aLieberman, Marya0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Sept. 26, v. 11, no. 37 p.4741-4750dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay01547g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245021000162300001800372520086500390592002801255650002201283650001201305650002101317650001201338650001201350650001301362650002301375650001301398653002701411653001201438653001501450653002201465653001401487653003201501700002501533700001801558700001901576773014001595856007701735852000901812655001201821IND60521745820221119025959.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052174582DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-10032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, Herbert10aMetallkomplexe mit biologisch wichtigen Liganden, XL [1].

Tateyama, were investigated by means of a culture-amendment technique combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis using 16S rRNA genes. After the stratigraphy of the snow layer formed on the walls of a snow pit on Mt. Tateyama, samples were collected from 2 layers, which included KOSA particles and one which did not. The snow samples with KOSA particles indicated microbial growth in the 100 and 10â1 dilution media and in the medium with NaCl below 10%, while the snow sample without KOSA particles showed no microbial growth in the culture media. The PCRâDGGE analysis revealed that the bacterial compositions in the snow samples including KOSA mineral particles were mainly composed of the members of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutus, and Proteobacteria. In particular, the 2 phylotypes appeared in the microbial cultures were similar to the members of the B. subtilis group, which has been detected in bioaerosol samples collected from the atmosphere over KOSA arrival (Suzu City) and source (Dunhuang City) regions. Presumably, halotolerant and oligotrophic bacterial communities are associated with the KOSA particles that descend to the snow cover on Mt. Tateyama.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aProteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3abioaerosols 3aculture media 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aenvironmental impact 3agenes 3ahuman health 3amicrobial growth 3aribosomal RNA 3asalt tolerance 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asodium chloride 3astratigraphy 3aJapan1 aAoki, Kazuma1 aKobayashi, Fumihisa1 aKakikawa, Makiko1 aTobo, Yutaka1 aMatsuki, Atsushi1 aHasegawa, Hiroshi1 aIwasaka, Yasunobu0 tAerobiologia.g2011 Dec., v. 27, no. 4 p.277-290dSpringer-Verlagx0393-59657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10453-011-9196-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245018300167500001900350520132400369592002801693650001501721650001501736650001701751650001601768650001101784650001301795650002201808650001301830650001301843653001701856653003601873653002801909653002601937653002701963653003801990700005902028700001702087700002002104700002402124700001502148700001802163773009702181856008502278852000902363655001202372IND60704725620221120204649.0201216e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070472562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bingya10aInterpreting main features of the differential absorbance spectra of chlorinated natural organic matter: Comparison of the experimental and theoretical spectra of model compounds  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study compared chlorination-induced changes of the properties of natural organic matter (NOM) represented by standard humic substances and NOM present in pristine and anthropogenically-affect reservoirs, rivers, groundwater and seawater. The chlorination-induced changes of NOM properties were quantified using the differential absorbance spectra (DAS) which were processed via numeric deconvolution. Six Gaussian bands were found to comprise the DAS of all examined waters. These bands (denoted as A0, A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5, respectively) have maxima located at ca. 200, 240, 276, 316, 385 and 547 nm. The bands A1-A4 were observed in the DAS of representative model chlorinated compounds. Quantum chemical (QC) calculations were carried out to examine the intrinsic nature of these bands and electronic transitions associated with them. QC data demonstrate that bands A1 and A2 are present in almost all aromatic organic species, A3 is likely to be associated with acetophenone- and/or styrene-like groups. A4 can be attributed to the engagement of m-hydroxyaromatic and flavone-type groups typical for the polyphenolic moiety in NOM and known to be the key precursors of disinfection by-product (DBP) formation. Thus, the intensity of band A4 is predicted to be an especially strong predictor of DBP formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3abyproducts 3adisinfection 3agroundwater 3amodels 3amoieties 3aquantum mechanics 3aresearch 3aseawater 0aChlorination 0aDifferential absorbance spectra 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aElectronic transition 0aNatural organic matter 0aFrontier molecular orbital theory1 aZhang, Chenyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4383-68041 aZhao, Yanmei1 aWang, Dongsheng1 aKorshin, Gregory V.1 aNi, Jinren1 aYan, Mingquan0 tWater research.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 185 p.116206-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02961naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245008500207520158400292592002801876650002201904650001601926650001001942650001301952650001701965650001201982650001301994650001302007650001902020650001802039650001502057650002102072650003902093650001302132650001202145650001102157650001202168653001602180653001202196653001502208653001302223653002302236700002302259773010202282856008602384852000902470655001202479IND60770075020221122234432.0220509e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077007502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruican1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9384-158610aCitric acid and heating on gelatin hydrolysis and gelation in confectionery gels  aAcids hydrolyze gelatin and weaken its gelling capacity in water, which raises concerns about the use of food acids in gelatin-based confections (gummies). This study aimed to understand the effects of citric acid (CA) and heat treatment on the molecular weight (MW) of gelatin and, most importantly, the changes in gelling power in water versus sugar-rich confectionery solutions. The MW distributions of gelatin (6 wt%) in both plain (sweetener-free) and confectionery gels (with up to 80% sweetener solids) were analyzed using gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the gelling kinetics and gel properties were characterized using rheology, differential scanning calorimetry, and texture and color analyses. In both plain and confectionery gels, the extent of hydrolysis increased with the CA concentration (0–2%) and the extent of heat treatment (up to 110 °C), which caused the depression of gelling temperature. However, despite CA-catalyzed hydrolyses having detrimental effects on plain gels, some limited hydrolysis with up to 1.5% CA was found to increase gel strength, hardness, and renaturation rate (melting enthalpy) of the confectionery gels, potentially due to the enhanced molecular mobility of gelatin in high viscous gelling matrices. Nonetheless, excessive hydrolysis induced by heating the acidified (1% CA) gummi mixtures to over 100 °C caused a reduced renaturation rate and weakened gel strength. The thermal treatment also promoted sucrose inversion and the Maillard reaction, leading to the development of yellow to brown colors in the final products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaillard reaction 3acitric acid 3acolor 3aenthalpy 3agel strength 3agelatin 3agelation 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrolysis 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3arheology 3asucrose 3asweets 3atexture 0aCitric acid 0aGelatin 0aHydrolysis 0aGelation 0aConfectionery gels1 aHartel, Richard W.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Aug., v. 129 p.107642-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01896naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245006500173300001800238520084300256592002801099650001501127650001001142650001101152650001001163650002101173650002101194650001601215650002201231650002301253650001601276650000901292773015501301856008101456852000901537655001201546IND60630610420221120144103.0190213e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063061042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0489-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYousef, El Sayed Said10aThermal and optical properties of zinc halotellurite glasses  ap. 4502-4507.  aZinc halotellurite glasses were studied with respect to the glass transition, softening temperature, thermal expansion, optical energy gap, Urbach energy, density, molar volume, refractive index, polarizability, molar refraction and third order non-linear optical susceptibility.

Also, the microbiota is involved in reducing and preventing colonization by enteric pathogens through the process of competitive exclusion and the production of bacteriostatic and bactericidal substances. The taxonomic composition of the microbiota is affected by different factors, such as the organ, the age of the animal, diet and the use of antimicrobials.Different kinds of additives that regulate the microbial community in feed include probiotics (live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host), prebiotics (ingredients that stimulate increased beneficial microbial activity in the digestive system in order to improve the health of the host) and phytobiotics (primary or secondary components of plants that contain bioactive compounds that exert a positive effect on the growth and health of animals). Phages may potentially provide an integrated solution to modulate the intestinal microbiome of chicken intestines, as they reduce specific pathogenic microbial populations, permitting the proliferation of beneficial microbiota. Studies have shown that the use of cocktails of phages, especially in high concentrations and with short lapses of time between exposure to the bacteria and treatment with phages, optimize the reduction of Salmonella in chickens. Each of these technologies has demonstrable positive effects on the health of the host and the reduction of the pathogen load in controlled assays.This paper presents a comprehensive summary of the role of the microbiota in the broiler chicken gastrointestinal tract, and discusses the usefulness of different strategies for its modulation to control pathogens, with a particular emphasis on bacteriophages.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSalmonella 3aadditives 3aanimal health 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abacteriophages 3abioactive compounds 3abroiler chickens 3acompetitive exclusion 3aenteropathogens 3aimmune system 3aingredients 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial load 3amicrobiome 3aphysiology 3apoultry production 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3ataxonomy 0abroiler microbiota 0abacteriophage 0apathogen control 0aphage-therapy, Salmonella1 aFlórez, Martha Josefina Vives1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7795-14940 tPoultry science.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 97, no. 3 p.1006-1021dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex3593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01993naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009200162300001800254520063000272592002800902650002200930650001400952650002300966650002100989650001501010650003701025650001201062650001501074650001401089650001801103650001301121650003301134650000801167700001601175700001701191700001601208700001801224700001501242700001601257700001701273773015501290856008101445852000901526655001201535IND60630610520221120161408.0190213e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063061052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0559-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Yuxia10aMesocarbon microbeads supported PtSn catalysts for electrochemical oxidation of ethanol  ap. 4508-4512.  aMesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) supported PtSn catalysts were prepared by alcohol reduction method and characterized by XRD, FESEM and EDX.

Herein, a colorimetric sensor for hydrogen peroxide and glucose detection was developed based on an enzymatic-like reaction that induced the iodine-mediated etching of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs were fabricated using a MoO₃-nanosheet-assisted photochemical process without any surface modification or purification steps. Furthermore, the MoO₃ nanosheet residues and Mo(vi) ions leached during AuNP preparation acted directly as peroxidase-like catalysts to promote the reduction of iodate to iodine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (or the glucose–glucose oxidase enzymatic system). The generated iodine then etched the AuNPs, resulting in an obvious colour change of the reaction solution that allowed the selective and quantitative spectrophotometric determination of hydrogen peroxide and glucose. The linear ranges for the detection of hydrogen peroxide and glucose were 40–380 μM (R² = 0.99) and 100–1000 μM (R² = 0.98), respectively, with detection limits of 0.55 μM and 0.45 μM, respectively. The developed colorimetric method was applied to the determination of glucose in water chestnuts with good recoveries (100–108%), demonstrating its applicability to glucose detection in fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3achemical etching 3achestnuts 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3afruits 3aglucose 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aiodates 3aiodine 3amolybdenum 3ananogold 3ananosheets 3aoxidoreductases 3aphotochemistry 3avegetables1 aSu, Linjing1 aLuo, Yanghe1 aMa, Xionghui1 aDuan, Zhenhua1 aZhu, Dongjian1 aXiong, Yuhao0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Sept. 26, v. 11, no. 37 p.4829-4834dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ay01599j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007600169300001400245520149000259592002801749650001701777650001901794650001701813650001901830650002001849650001801869650002901887650001301916650002301929650002201952650001301974650001201987651001301999653001202012653001702024653001902041653001902060653001702079653002002096653002102116653002002137653002002157653001902177700001702196700002202213700002602235700002602261700002402287773012802311856008202439852000902521655001202530IND60516555620221117212646.0190730e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051655562DNAL7 a10.1017/S037689291100035X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGODOY, FABIANO L.10aDeforestation and CO₂ emissions in coastal Tanzania from 1990 to 2007  ap. 62-71.  aConversion of forest to other land uses is a major contributor to climate change. The coastal forests of Tanzania have increasingly been recognized as being of global biodiversity importance, due to high rates of species endemism. Rates of forest loss are similar to those of other tropical regions, resulting in increasing levels of threat for the biological values within the remaining forest and potentially significant source of CO₂ emissions. This study estimated the remaining cover and carbon stock of Tanzania's coastal forests and the CO₂ emissions due to forest loss between c. 1990 and c. 2007. Coastal Tanzania contained over 273 700 ha of forest in 2007. Deforestation rates in the area have slowed from 1.0% yr⁻¹, or > 3735 ha yr⁻¹ during the 1990s, to 0.4% yr⁻¹, or > 1233 ha yr⁻¹ during 2000–2007. Despite lower deforestation rates in 2000–2007, the percentage forest lost from within reserved areas has remained steady at 0.2% yr⁻¹ for both time periods. CO₂ emissions from deforestation slowed from at least 0.63 Mt CO₂ yr⁻¹ in 1990–2000 to at least 0.20 Mt CO₂ yr⁻¹ in 2000–2007. Regional forest clearance in Tanzania is highly dynamic; while rates have slowed since 2000, forest habitat conversion has continued and there is no guarantee that future rates will remain low. A rigorous policy on reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) should be implemented to avoid future increases in deforestation rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3acoastal forests 3adeforestation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aissues and policy 3aland use 3atropics 3aTanzania 0abiomass 0acarbon stock 0aclimate change 0aeastern Africa 0aforest cover 0aforest reserves 0agreenhouse gases 0alowland forests 0aprotected areas 0aremote sensing1 aTABOR, KARYN1 aBurgess, Neil D.,1 aMBILINYI, BONIFACE P.1 aKASHAIGILI, JAPHET J.1 aSTEININGER, MARC K.0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2012 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.62-71dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S037689291100035X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001800264520096800282592002801250650002201278650001501300650001901315650001701334650002301351650001901374650001201393650003301405650002301438650001201461700002001473700001501493700001601508700001501524700001301539700001401552773010601566856008101672852000901753655001201762IND60132680220221118153118.0150511e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013268022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-015-9020-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Maoqiao10aCO2 absorption properties of Ti- and Na-doped porous Li4SiO 4 prepared by a sol–gel process  ap. 4698-4706.  aTo improve the carbon dioxide (CO₂) absorption performance of lithium orthosilicate (Li₄SiO₄), tablet-like Li₄Si₁₋ₓ Ti ₓ O₄and Li₃.₉Na₀.₁Si₀.₉₆Ti₀.₀₄O₄sorbents with loose and porous texture were prepared by a sol–gel process.

The results indicate a ‘target-oriented’ approach, without much attention to social organization for promoting people's participation. Most of the beneficiaries of the project have medium level of participation in watershed-related activities. Socio-economic status, level of modernization and extension participation of the beneficiaries are the characteristics which can be used to discriminate between people with low, medium and high levels of participation. The five socio-psychological characteristics of beneficiaries in the study, together, explain 96.8 per cent of the variance observed in participation level between beneficiaries having less than one ha and those having more than 1 ha landholding. There exists potential for the implementing agencies of development projects for identifying and promoting such characteristics of the beneficiaries for improving their involvement under the project.  aPublisher supplied data 3adevelopment projects 3amodernization 3apeople 3arural areas 3asocial structure 3asocioeconomic status 3avariance 3awatersheds 3aIndia1 aJoseph, E.J.1 aChackacherry, George0 tInternational Journal of Rural Management.g2008 Jan., v. 4, no. 1-2 p.87-102dSAGE PublicationswJournal:27062x0973-00527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0973005209004002053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006900171300001400240520083500254592002801089650000901117650000901126650001901135650001301154650001101167650002001178650000901198650001401207650001401221650002501235650001601260650000901276650001001285650003701295653001301332653002001345653000901365653000901374653001701383653001801400700002501418700001801443700002901461700002001490700001301510700002301523700001901546700002301565700002201588773012401610856008501734852000901819655001201828IND60570607720221119194914.0190318e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057060772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2017.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibbons, Natalie10aPhenotypic heterogeneity of peripheral monocytes in healthy dogs  ap. 26-30.  aMonocytes are key cells of the innate immune system. Their phenotypic and functional roles have been investigated in humans, mice and other animals, such as the rat, pig and cow. To date, detailed phenotypic analysis of monocytes has not been undertaken in dogs. Two important surface markers in human monocytes are CD14 and MHC class II (MHC II). By flow cytometry, we demonstrated that canine monocytes can be subdivided into three separate populations: CD14posMHC IIneg, CD14posMHC IIpos and CD14negMHC IIpos. Both light and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the monocytic identity of all three populations. The CD14posMHC IIneg population could be distinguished on an ultrastructural level by their smaller size, the presence of more numerous, larger granules, and more pseudopodia than both of the other populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acows 3adogs 3aflow cytometry 3agranules 3ahumans 3ainnate immunity 3amice 3amonocytes 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apseudopodia 3arats 3aswine 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aMonocyte 0aInnate immunity 0aCD14 0aCD16 0aMHC class II 0aSubpopulation1 aGoulart, Michelle R.1 aChang, Yu-Mei1 aEfstathiou, Konstantinos1 aPurcell, Robert1 aWu, Ying1 aPeters, Laureen M.1 aTurmaine, Mark1 aSzladovits, Balazs1 aGarden, Oliver A.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2017 Aug., v. 190 p.26-30dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl31971x0165-24277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2017.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003300113040001800146100002100164245009200185300001800277520133300295592002801628650001201656650001101668650001601679650002501695650001601720650001201736650003701748650001401785650002301799650001601822700002301838700001601861700001901877700002001896773010301916856004602019852000902065655001202074IND50073303220221120213532.0140222e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007330322DNAL7 a244993792pmid7 a10.1111/1365-2656.121412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLele, Subhash R.10aSelection, use, choice and occupancy: clarifying concepts in resource selection studies  ap. 1183-1191.  aDuring the last decade, there has been a proliferation of statistical methods for studying resource selection by animals. While statistical techniques are advancing at a fast pace, there is confusion in the conceptual understanding of the meaning of various quantities that these statistical techniques provide. Terms such as selection, choice, use, occupancy and preference often are employed as if they are synonymous. Many practitioners are unclear about the distinctions between different concepts such as ‘probability of selection,’ ‘probability of use,’ ‘choice probabilities’ and ‘probability of occupancy’. Similarly, practitioners are not always clear about the differences between and relevance of ‘relative probability of selection’ vs. ‘probability of selection’ to effective management. Practitioners also are unaware that they are using only a single statistical model for modelling resource selection, namely the exponential probability of selection, when other models might be more appropriate. Currently, such multimodel inference is lacking in the resource selection literature. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the concepts and terminology used in animal resource studies by illustrating the relationships among these various concepts and providing their statistical underpinnings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3amodels 3aprobability 3astatistical analysis 3aterminology 2aAnimals 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aEcosystem 2aModels, Biological 2aProbability1 aMerrill, Evelyn H.1 aKeim, Jonah1 aBoyce, Mark S.1 aHuettmann, Falk0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2013 Nov., v. 82, no. 6 p.1183-1191dUniversity Pressx0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12141  aDNAL 7aarticle01370naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245011300162300001800275520027300293592002800566650001600594650002300610650002300633650002300656650004400679653004100723653001600764700002000780700001800800773014000818856007700958852000901035655001201044IND60521746120221119025911.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052174612DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-10062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSvara, Jürgen10a1.1.3.3-Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-1λ5,3λ5-diphosphet / 1.1.3.3-Tetrakis(dimethylamino)-1λ5,3λ5-diphosphete  ap. 1258-1263.  aThe title compound 1 was prepared by reacting methyl-bis(dimethylamino)difluorophosphorane with butyllithium at -95 °C.

Green microalga Dictyosphaerium chlorelloides was found to be a significant producer of the extracellular biopolymer. Dominant components of the biopolymer were found to be Gal (39 wt%) with its methyl derivatives (15 wt%), Rha (19 wt%) and Man (14 wt%). 2-OMe-Gal was found to be the major derivative while other sugars, namely 3-OMe-, 6-OMe- and 2,3-di-OMe-Gal, 3-OMe-Glc and 4-OMe-Xyl were in smaller amounts. NMR spectroscopy revealed complex structure with galactan backbone branched by sugars in furano and pyrano forms in alpha and beta configurations. NMR data of 2-OMe, 3-OMe, 2,3-OMe and 6-OMe galactoses afforded characteristic values for O-methyls in each position.

Landings of forage species are projected to increase in the future, and this harvest may affect marine ecosystems and predator-prey interactions by removal or redistribution of biomass central to pelagic food webs. In particular, fisheries targeting forage fish and euphausiids may be in competition with seabirds, likely the most sensitive of marine vertebrates given limitations in their foraging abilities (ambit and gape size) and high metabolic rate, for food resources. Lately, apparent competition between fisheries and seabirds has led to numerous high-profile conflicts over interpretations, as well as the approaches that could and should be used to assess the magnitude and consequences of fisheries-seabird resource competition. In this paper, we review the methods used to date to study fisheries competition with seabirds, and present “best practices” for future resource competition assessments. Documenting current fisheries competition with seabirds generally involves addressing two major issues: 1) are fisheries causing localized prey depletion that is sufficient to affect the birds? (i.e., are fisheries limiting food resources?), and 2) how are fisheries-induced changes to forage stocks affecting seabird populations given the associated functional or numerical response relationships? Previous studies have been hampered by mismatches in the scale of fisheries, fish, and seabird data, and a lack of causal understanding due to confounding by climatic and other ecosystem factors (e.g., removal of predatory fish). Best practices for fisheries-seabird competition research should include i) clear articulation of hypotheses, ii) data collection (or summation) of fisheries, fish, and seabirds on matched spatio-temporal scales, and iii) integration of observational and experimental (including numerical simulation) approaches to establish connections and causality between fisheries and seabirds. As no single technique can provide all the answers to this vexing issue, an integrated approach is most promising to obtain robust scientific results and in turn the sustainability of forage fish fisheries from an ecosystem perspective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphausiacea 3abiomass 3adata collection 3afisheries 3afood webs 3aforage fish 3aforaging 3amarine ecosystems 3amathematical models 3ametabolism 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredatory fish 3aseabirds 0aSeabirds 0aForage fish 0aFisheries 0aResource competition 0aMethodology1 aThompson, Sarah Ann1 aAnker-Nilssen, Tycho1 aArimitsu, Mayumi1 aBennison, Ashley1 aBertrand, Sophie1 aBoersch-Supan, Philipp1 aBoyd, Charlotte1 aBransome, Nicole C.1 aCrawford, Robert J.M.1 aDaunt, F.q(Francis),1 aFurness, Robert W.1 aGianuca, Dimas1 aGladics, Amanda1 aKoehn, Laura1 aLang, Jennifer W.1 aLogerwell, Elizabeth1 aMorris, Taryn L.1 aPhillips, Elizabeth Mary,1 aProvencher, Jennifer1 aPunt, A.

The case of streamlining waste utilisation in Finnish earthworks  ap. 532-540.  aSince entering the waste policy debate in the 1980s, the sustainability discourse has sought to find alternatives to end-of-pipe solutions. The latest development on this path is the emergence of the circular economy, which aims to close the loop of the current linear economy. This case study analyses a substantial Finnish waste policy reform that has been underway since the late 1990s. The objective of the reform has been to create a decree that streamlines waste utilisation in earthworks. The decree was prepared between 2000 and 2006, and then reformed between 2015 and 2018. We analysed the discursive spaces of both phases and compared them to interpret the changes in the discourse of waste policy. The discursive space in the preparation phase was structured by the tension between the discourses of resource efficiency and precaution, but in the reform, the emergence of the circular economy diversified the discursive space. The thinking regarding the circular economy has added complexity, competition, and struggle to waste policy, but also enhanced the role of upcycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acircular economy 3aissues and policy 3awaste utilization 3awastes 0aCircular economy 0aPolicy formulation 0aWaste utilisation 0aDiscursive space 0aUpcycling 0aDeregulation1 aSalminen, Jani Markus0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2019 Oct., v. 149 p.532-540dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011600167520147600283592002801759650003701787650001501824650001801839650001601857650002201873650001601895650001401911650001901925650001801944650001901962650001501981650002701996650001602023650002002039650002002059650001602079650001402095650001402109653002602123653002202149653001902171653003302190653002202223700001902245700001702264700001802281700001602299700001302315700001402328700001702342773010202359856008602461852000902547655001202556IND60770075520221122234453.0220509e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077007552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Bo-Ru10aImproving emulsification performance of waxy maize starch by esterification combined with pulsed electric field  aThe development of high-performance edible particles for stabilizing gel-like Pickering emulsions has attracted increasing attention due to their high storage stability and potential in prolonging the release of intestinal drugs. In this study, a pulsed electric field (PEF)-assisted octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA)-modified waxy maize starch (WMS) was established, which could be used as an excellent Pickering emulsion stabilizer. The PEF treatment improved the esterification efficiency of WMS by disrupting its granule surface and crystalline structure to offer more sites for esterification. The degree of substitution (DS) of starch dually modified at 2.5–5.5 kV/cm was 3.0–46.9% higher than that of starch modified by the conventional method. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results revealed that the OSA groups were distributed on the surface of starch granules, increasing the hydrophobicity of the surface. Among all the starch samples, the contact angle of the OSA-modified starch treated with PEF at an intensity of 4.5 kV/cm was close to 90°. The dual-modified starch enhanced the amphipathic property and surface activity, indicating its potential to stabilize the formation of gel-like Pickering emulsions and increase their apparent viscosity (η) and storage modulus (G′). Finally, increasing the starch particle concentration could facilitate the formation of gel-like emulsions by enhancing the entanglement and interaction between them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanhydrides 3acontact angle 3acorn starch 3acrystal structure 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aesterification 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3aintestines 3apulsed electric fields 3astabilizers 3astorage modulus 3astorage quality 3asurfactants 3aviscosity 3awaxy corn 0aPulsed electric field 0aWaxy maize starch 0aEsterification 0aGel-like Pickering emulsions 0aGelling mechanism1 aWang, Zhi-Ming1 aLin, Jia-Wei1 aWen, Qing-Hui1 aXu, Fei-Yue1 aLi, Jian1 aWang, Rui1 aZeng, Xin-An0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Aug., v. 129 p.107655-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1076553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01722naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245019700163300001800360520040800378592002800786650002300814650001600837650001300853650001700866650001200883650002200895650001200917650000900929653002600938653001800964653001600982653002200998700002501020700002001045700002001065773015301085856007701238852000901315655001201324IND60521746420221119030145.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052174642DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-10092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Achim,10aSchwefelreiche spirozyklische Komplexe: [Zn(S6)2]2–, [Cd(S6)2]2–, [Hg(S6)2]2– und [Hg(S4)2]2– / Sulfur-Rich Spirocyclic Complexes: [Zn(S6)2]2-, [Cd(S6)2]2-, [Hg(S6)2]2- and [Hg(S4)2]2-  ap. 1277-1288.  aBy reaction of Zn(CH₃COO)₂·2H₂O.

The composite was constituted of iron shavings as grains, a prepared non-woven from cellulosic fibers waste as support and a polyurethane resin as matrix. The studied composite was investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy and SEM analyses. FT-IR data confirmed that the non-woven composite was composed of cellulosic fibers and iron. SEM photos indicated that the resin was distributed on the surface of the composite and the iron grains were strongly fixed. The properties of the prepared composites were evaluated and compared with some commercial abrasives. The effect of some chemical modifications on the non-woven characteristics and on the lifetime of the prepared abrasives was studied. The concentration of the resin on the lifetime of abrasives was also discussed. The results showed that the composites made with polyurethane resin had longer life compared to some commercial abrasives. Chemically modified non-woven supports exhibited better results compared to untreated non-woven supports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3airon 3apolyurethanes 3awastes 0aComposites 0anon-woven 0aabrasive 0apolyurethane 0airon grains1 aAlibi, Hamza1 aJabli, Mahjoub1 aGhith, Adel0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2022 June 03, v. 19, no. 6 p.2189-2203dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2020.18074393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245009900207300001600306520125500322592002801577650001501605650002101620650001401641650002301655650001501678650002201693650001101715650001301726650001101739650002101750650001301771650001801784650002901802650001701831650001501848650001601863653001101879653000801890653002601898653002201924653002101946700002101967700005801988773012002046856008802166852000902254655001202263IND60649545720221122205558.0190913e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064954572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkcil, Ata1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9991-054310aValorization of waste LCD and recovery of critical raw material for circular economy: A review  ap. 622-637.  aWaste an E-waste is a global environmental issue but potential resources for Indium through urban mining and recycling, which a critical raw material for the industry has been reviewed.

To better understand the effect of foreign gene dosage on the cellular physiology of P. pastoris cells, comparative transcriptional analysis was performed among three P. pastoris strains carrying 0, 6, and 18 copies of porcine insulin precursor (PIP) expression cassettes, respectively. mRNA levels of 13 selected genes involved in methanol metabolic pathway, central metabolic pathway, protein folding, and oxidative stress were determined by real-time PCR. Results showed that enhanced PIP copy number resulted in an increase in PIP mRNA and also in folding stress on the yeast cells’ endoplasmic reticulum. The metabolism of 6-copy P. pastoris strain was not significantly changed as compared to 0-copy strain (control). In contrast, physiology of 18-copy strain was remarkably affected, characterized by the upregulation of antioxidative genes and readjusted expression level of methanol metabolic pathway genes. These data suggested that high copy P. pastoris strain might be suffering from protein folding-related oxidative stress and insufficient supply of carbon and energy sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aenergy 3aprotein folding 3aKomagataella pastoris 3amethanol 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ayeasts 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3acarbon 3aswine 3agenes 3ainsulin 3atranscription (genetics) 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aoxidative stress 3agene dosage 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aInsulinxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxgenetics 2aPichiaxphysiology 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 0aPichia pastoris1 aGuo, Meijin1 aZhuang, Yingping1 aChu, Ju1 aZhang, Siliang0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2011 Feb., v. 89, no. 4 p.1127-1135dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-010-2944-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011400174300001600288520110300304592002801407650001601435650002501451650002501476650001201501650002501513650001501538650001701553650001701570650001101587650001101598650000701609650003301616650001601649650001101665653002401676653001101700653002501711653001701736653003901753653002101792700005701813773010601870856008701976852000902063655001202072IND60536172720221118231856.0190410e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053617272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarchami, Tahereh10aOptimizing enzymatic hydrolysis of inulin from Jerusalem artichoke tubers for fermentative butanol production  ap. 175-182.  aIn this study, a central composite design and response surface methodology were used to study the effect of various enzymatic hydrolysis variables (temperature, pH, substrate concentration and enzyme loading) on the enzymatic hydrolysis of Jerusalem artichoke-derived inulin. It was found that a quadratic model was able to predict inulin conversion as a function of all four investigated factors. The model was confirmed through additional experiments and via analysis of variance (ANOVA). Subsequently, numerical optimization was used to maximize the inulin conversion (94.5%) of Jerusalem artichoke powder within the experimental range (temperature of 48 °C, pH of 4.8, substrate concentration of 60 g l−1, and enzyme loading of 10unitsgsubstrate−1 for 24 h). The enzymatic hydrolyzate of Jerusalem artichoke was fermented via solventogenic clostridia to acetone–butanol–ethanol (ABE). An ABE yield of 0.33gSolventgsugar−1 and an overall fermentation productivity of 0.25 g l−1 h−1 were obtained indicating the suitability of this feedstock for fermentative ABE production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aJerusalem artichokes 3aanalysis of variance 3abutanol 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afeedstocks 3afermentation 3ahydrolysates 3ainulin 3amodels 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3atubers 0aJerusalem artichoke 0aInulin 0aEnzymatic hydrolysis 0aOptimization 0aResponse surface methodology (RSM) 0aABE fermentation1 aRehmann, Lars1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3463-64050 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2014 Oct., v. 69 p.175-182dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245013800204300001200342520228200354592002802636650001802664650003302682650001002715650001702725650002002742650001102762650001302773700002002786700001802806700002202824700002902846773013302875856008303008852000903091655001203100IND60776400620221122172105.0220618e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077640062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-022-03173-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtoui, Ahlem1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4839-611510aOn the modelling of weights of kids to enhance growth in a local goat population under Tunisian arid conditions: the maternal effects  ap. 177.  aTo provide the local goat population with an adequate breeding scheme under an arid environment, this study aimed to evaluate the use of alternative models attempting to dissect the additive genetic (AG) and permanent environmental (PE) components of direct and maternal effects on weights of kids up to weaning. Records of 903 local kids over a period of 16 years were used in this study. Data were split into four groups corresponding to four periods along weight recording. Periods 1/2/3/4 contained weights in an interval with upper-lower limits of 1–20/25–60/65–120/125–150 days of age. Models including or ignoring maternal genetic or permanent environmental effects were fitted for all traits. For all periods, the best models were those including the AG component for both direct and maternal effects and the direct PE effect. Heritability estimates of both the direct and maternal effects ranged from low (0.02 for maternal heritability in P1) to moderate (0.17 for direct and maternal heritability in P2 and P3). Period 1 showed the lowest values for heritability of both direct and maternal effects, with also the largest estimate of the ratio of residual to total variance (around 0.2) compared with the other periods, with decreasing ratios as age increased (from 0.13 for P2 to 0.07 for P4). Both direct and maternal estimated breeding values (EBVs) showed high correlations for models fitting direct AG and PE (DGP) effects. For direct EBVs (DEBVs), correlations were above 0.99, indicating that the same animals are expected to be selected under any model that includes those components, regardless of the maternal effects included. For maternal EBVs, correlations were also high, but slightly lower than for the DEBVs between models including DGP effects and maternal genetic effects. Overall, our recommendation for genetic evaluations of direct and maternal effects in this population raised in extensive and harsh conditions is to use weight records preferably collected during the period of high milk production of dams, for which direct and maternal effects are expected to show full expression. Complete pedigrees and several generations of dam-progeny recording are needed to obtain a proper separation of environmental and genetic components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal health 3adry environmental conditions 3agoats 3aheritability 3amilk production 3amodels 3avariance1 aNajari, Sghaier1 aDíaz, Clara,1 aAbdennebi, Mouldi1 aCarabaño, María Jesús0 tTropical animal health and production.g2022 June, v. 54, no. 3 p.177-177dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-022-03173-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03088naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245008800174300001200262520185900274592002802133650001502161650002502176650002602201650001902227650001102246650001202257650001302269650002102282653002802303653002402331653003002355653001902385700002602404700001902430700002302449700001802472773009402490856008502584852000902669655001202678IND50066840620221123010805.0190318e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006684062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2013.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnezevic, Stevan Z.10aSoybean yield and yield components as influenced by the single and repeated flaming  ap. 1-5.  aField experiments were conducted to study the impact of single and multiple flaming on crop injury, yield components, and yield of soybean. The goal of this experiment was to determine the number of the maximum flaming treatments which soybean could tolerate without any yield loss. The treatments consisted of a non-flamed control, and broadcast flaming conducted one time (at VC-unfolded cotyledon, V2-second trifoliate, and V5-fifth trifoliate), two times (each at VC and V2, VC and V5, and V2 and V5 stages), and three times (at VC, V2, and V5 stages) resulting in a total of eight treatments. All plots were kept weed-free for the entire growing season by hand hoeing. A propane dose of 50 kg ha−1 was applied with torches parallel to the crop row and at an operating speed of 4.8 km h−1 for all treatments. The response of soybean was measured as visual injury ratings (at 7 and 28 days after treatment – DAT) as well as effects on yield components and yield. Broadcast flaming conducted once (at VC or V5 stage), as well as twice (at VC and V5 stages) exhibited the lowest injury of about 8% at 28 DAT. Any treatment that contained flaming at V2 stage resulted in more than 70% injury at 28 DAT. The highest crop yields were obtained from the non-flamed control (3.45 t ha−1) and the plots flamed once at VC (3.35 t ha−1), V5 (3.32 t ha−1), and two times at VC and V5 (3.24 t ha−1), which were all statistically similar. Soybean flamed at V2 stage had lower yields (1.03 t ha−1 at V2, 0.46 t ha−1 at VC and V2, and 0.38 t ha−1 at V2 and V5). The lowest yields were in soybean flamed three times (VC, V2, and V5 stages), which yielded only 0.36 t ha−1. These results indicate that soybean could tolerate a maximum of two flaming treatments at VC and V5 growth stages per season without any yield reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotyledons 3adevelopmental stages 3afield experimentation 3agrowing season 3ahoeing 3apropane 3asoybeans 3ayield components 0aOrganic crop production 0aOrganic agriculture 0aNon-chemical weed control 0aCrop tolerance1 aStepanovic, Strahinja1 aDatta, Avishek1 aNedeljkovic, Dejan1 aTursun, Nihat0 tCrop protection.g2013 Aug., v. 50 p.1-5dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02955naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001100139245010500150300001800255520142800273592002801701596007501729650002501804650001901829650001901848650001301867650001701880650001401897650001001911650002201921650001301943650001301956650002501969650001201994651001002006653002502016653002902041653001602070653002202086653001302108700001302121700001502134700001502149700001602164700001802180700001502198700001802213773011102231856007402342852000902416655001202425IND60673769220221121011233.0210209e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067376922DNAL7 a10.3382/ps/pex3672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Qi10aMolecular characteristics of avian leukosis viruses isolated from indigenous chicken breeds in China  ap. 2917-2925.  aTo assess the status of avian leukosis virus (ALV) infection in indigenous chicken breeds in China, 121 plasma samples collected from various indigenous chicken breeds were tested for the presence of ALV from 2015 to 2016. A total of 14 ALV strains were isolated and identified, including two ALV-A strains, one ALV-B strain, eight ALV-J strains, and three ALV-K strains. To study the genome structure, biological characteristics, and the evolutionary relationships of the ALV-K strains with other known subgroup strains from infected chickens, we determined the complete genome sequence of the three ALV-K strains and performed comparative analysis using the whole genome sequence or selected sequence elements. The replication rates of the three ALV-K strains were markedly lower than the rates of other ALVs, and they shared a common mutation in the pol gene, which had not been previously observed. In addition, nine putative recombinant events were detected in the genomes of the three newly isolated ALV-K strains, with high statistical support. This was the first report of an ALV-K reorganization event, which has contributed to its genetic evolution. In summary, we established a robust classification system for ALV, especially for ALV-K, and revealed additional genomic diversity for the ALV strains in indigenous chicken breeds. Therefore additional works are warranted to explore ALV genomics and epidemiology.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0501606cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aAvian leukosis virus 3aavian leukosis 3achicken breeds 3achickens 3aepidemiology 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3aviruses 3aChina 0aavian leukosis virus 0aindigenous chicken breed 0arecombinant 0agenetic evolution 0amutation1 aLi, Yang1 aLi, Weihua1 aCui, Shuai1 aTian, Sibao1 aCui, Zhizhong1 aZhao, Peng1 aChang, Shuang0 tPoultry science.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 97, no. 8 p.2917-2925dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex3673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011900169300001600288520100900304592002801313650002601341650002201367650001301389650002301402650002101425650003701446650001301483650001401496650001301510650001701523651001001540651001001550653002001560653001401580653001601594653002601610700002501636773012401661856004801785852000901833655001201842IND50075482720221116182547.0140410e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007548272DNAL7 a10.1080/032354009033452732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhāna, Hānipha,10aIdentification of resistance source in wheat germplasm against spot blotch disease caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana  ap. 840-844.  aFour hundred and twenty-two spring wheat germplasm (Triticum aestivum L.) lines belonging to Indian, CIMMYT and Chinese wheat programme were evaluated for their tolerance against natural epiphytotic conditions of spot blotch caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana at the hot spot location, Pusa, Bihar, India.

Despite the wide adoption, AD has been challenged by the unstable performances caused by imbalanced substrate and/or electron availability among different reaction steps. Bioelectrochemical anaerobic digestion (BEAD) is a promising concept that has demonstrated potential for balancing the electron transfer rates and enhancing the methane yield in AD during shocks. While great progress has been made, a wide range of, and sometimes inconsistent engineering and technical strategies were attempted to improve BEAD. To consolidate past efforts and guide future development, a comprehensive review of the fundamental bioprocesses in BEAD is provided herein, followed by a critical evaluation of the engineering and technical optimizations attempted thus far. Further, a few novel directions and strategies that can enhance the performance and practicality of BEAD are proposed for future research to consider. This review and outlook aim to provide a fundamental understanding of BEAD and inspire new research ideas in AD and BEAD in a mechanism-informed fashion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioenergy 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3amethane production 3aresearch 3awater 0aBioelectrochemical anaerobic digestion (BEAD) 0aPractical application 0aElectrode materials 0aReactor configurations 0aProcesses design1 aJiang, Daqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1661-41651 aLee, Beom1 aJun, Hang-Bae0 tWater research.g2020 Oct. 01, v. 184 p.116214-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001900160245006100179300001800240520114800258592002801406650001501434650001901449650001301468650001601481650001601497650001201513650002201525650001201547650002601559650004701585650002801632650004301660650000901703650001701712650001801729650002601747700002001773700001401793700001901807773010401826856004401930852000901974655001201983IND4477039220221120095301.0120516e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447703922DNAL7 a225823052pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2011-018692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeidner, W.

This study used a colorimetric microsphere method to determine the effects of hypoxia and hypercapnia on the relative distribution of pulmonary blood flow in anesthetized chickens (Gallus domesticus) during control (normoxic) and experimental (hypoxic or hypercapnic) conditions, where the relative regional distribution of blood flow in the lung is expressed as the ratio NEO/PALEO. Administration of a hypoxic gas mixture (16.0% O2) produced a 13.4% increase in NEO/PALEO, and, administration of a hypercapnic gas mixture (5.0% CO2) resulted in a 27.8% increase in NEO/PALEO.

In the present work, mechanical and wear behavior of three different NFCs were analyzed. Natural fibers like prosopis juliflora (PJ), abuliton indicum (AI), and tapsi (T) fibers in the form of straws were considered in the present study. Composites were fabricated for three different fibers with 20 wt.% by hand layup method. Mechanical tests like tensile, flexural, and impact were performed along with tribological tests. Tensile and flexural were performed on universal testing machine, impact on izod impact tester, and wear test on pin-on-disc test setup. Wear tests on the fabricated composite samples were performed with varying the process parameters like sliding speed and applied load with a maximum sliding distance of 3000 m. SEM analysis was also performed on the fractured and worn out samples to know the bonding behavior, failure, and material removal mechanism of three NFCs. Among all the NFCs, prosopis juliflora fiber attained an improved mechanical and wear behaviors when contrasted to the other two NFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis juliflora 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3aequipment 3aindustrial applications 3ajournals 3amechanical properties 3amechanical testing 3anatural fibers 3astraw 0aFibers 0aepoxy 0amechanical 0aNFC 0afriction 0awear 0atribological1 aReddy, R.

In response, numerous authors have modified the classic removal models to control for non-constant capture probability. A variety of fish behaviors can cause capture probability to vary across individuals or over time, such as dominance hierarchies, escaping capture or persistent individual differences in capture probability due to activity or aggression; yet knowing exactly which behaviors may affect capture probability is generally unknown. We assessed the robustness of five removal models (i.e., the Leslie model, three behavior-dependent models and a density dependent capture probability model) and their ability to provide consistently accurate and precise abundance estimates irrespective of the exhibited behavior. We fitted each model to catch data generated from five behavioral models that mimicked a range of animal behaviors in a closed population. Additionally, we evaluated the improvements that can be gained by including marked fish in the removal process and in that case, compared estimation models with a Peterson mark-recapture estimation. Results indicate that no single removal model is robust to non-constant capture probability, however, the density-dependent capture probability model performed moderately better than other models when only removal data were used. We found that the addition of marked fish results in a substantial improvement in accuracy and precision across all removal models when mark-recapture assumptions are met. However, these improvements diminished substantially when mark-recapture assumptions were violated. Due to the difficulties in assessing assumptions, our findings suggest that including marked fish in the removal process may unknowingly reduce accuracy and precision of initial abundance estimate and that this type of experimental design should be avoided in many instances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3aexperimental design 3afish 3afish behavior 3alakes 3amodels 3aprobability 3astreams 0aDepletion estimate 0aRemoval estimate 0aBias 0aMark recapture 0aAbundance 0aFish behavior1 aBarrett, Boyd1 aWalters, Carl J.,d1944-1 aAhrens, Robert N.M.0 tFisheries research.g2017 Dec., v. 196 p.160-169dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2017.06.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245013000176300001600306500001500322520131700337592002801654650001901682650002301701650001501724650001101739650001901750650001101769650001301780650000901793650001901802650001601821650001701837650002601854651001001880651002501890653001801915700002501933700001501958700002501973700002101998700002502019773009402044856008502138852000902223655001202232IND50059987820221120095211.0141110e20121112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005998782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.08.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardo-Igúzquiza, E.10aEstimation of spatio-temporal recharge of aquifers in mountainous karst terrains: Application to Sierra de las Nieves (Spain)  ap. 124-137.  a2019-12-06  aWe describe a method for estimating the daily, spatially distributed recharge of aquifers in mountainous karst terrains using a water balance. Water recharge into an aquifer is a highly variable process over both time and space. Many methods have been developed to assess aquifer recharge although most have been applied to detrital aquifers. Many karst aquifers, especially in Mediterranean areas, occur in mountainous environments where rainfall and evapotranspiration can vary considerably over space and time and where there are usually few rainfall and temperature monitoring stations. We have used an advanced geostatistical method to estimate daily rainfall and temperature. The method involves kriging with an external drift using a climatological semi-variogram model inferred by modified maximum-likelihood. The depth of the soil–epikarst layer is estimated from remote sensing and terrain analysis data together with field observations and electrical resistivity tomography. Because of the karst nature of the mountainous terrain, concentrated infiltration is allowed for in some places. The parameters are calibrated against the cumulative discharge of various springs. The method is illustrated by a case study of the Sierra de las Nieves aquifer in the mountainous karst region of southern Spain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aevapotranspiration 3atomography 3amodels 3aspace and time 3akarsts 3aaquifers 3arain 3aremote sensing 3atemperature 3acase studies 3aelectrical resistance 3aSpain 3aMediterranean region 0awater balance1 aDurán-Valsero, J.J.1 aDowd, P.A.1 aGuardiola-Albert, C.1 aLiñan-Baena, C.1 aRobledo-Ardila, P.A.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Nov. 12, v. 470-471 p.124-137dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.08.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04276naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245012900177300001600306520251200322592002802834650002802862650001002890650002902900650001102929650002402940650002002964650002102984650001503005650001603020650001203036650001503048650002203063650001103085650001203096650001703108650001203125650001903137650002503156650001103181650003203192650001003224650000903234651001303243651001103256653001103267653002103278653001703299653001103316653001003327653001903337653002503356700003703381700002303418773013003441856008203571852000903653655001203662IND60516556520221117213153.0190730e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051655652DNAL7 a10.1017/S03768929110006102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCABIN, ANDRESSA BÁRBARA14aThe spatial distribution of illegal logging in the Anavilhanas archipelago (Central Amazonia) and logging impacts on species  ap. 111-121.  aAmazonia is one of the world's leading suppliers of timber and the Amazonian timber industry is an important source of regional income, however the economic benefits of this market are associated with environmental damage, mainly when the wood is removed illegally. The Anavilhanas National Park, located in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, has been subjected to illegal logging and elaboration of control programmes requires knowledge of the distribution of timber species and the intensity of logging. This study examines the density and growth rate of the five most harvested tree species in the Park, the spatial distribution of illegal logging operations and their effects on population structure. In total, 2332 trees with diameter at breast height greater than 10 cm, as well as stumps of cut trees, were sampled, and dendrochronology was used to estimate growth rates. Some size classes of Virola surinamensis trees and species within the family Lauraceae decreased in abundance as harvesting intensity increased. Growth rates of the most abundant species of Lauraceae, Ocotea cymbarum, were high, indicating stands may recover quickly when harvesting stops. The population structure of Calophyllum brasiliense showed no negative effects due to logging, but its low growth rate and stand distribution suggest that continued exploitation may endanger these populations. Logging had no detectable negative effects on the size structure of populations of Macrolobium acaciifolium or Hevea spp., and their high growth rates suggest that they will not be threatened by current logging rates. Overall growth rates in the Anavilhanas archipelago are higher than those recorded in other black-water floodplain forest (igapó). Logging of most species (except Lauraceae spp., which have the highest market value) is concentrated in the southern region of the Park, which has more human settlements close by. There was no general relationship between harvesting intensity and geographic distance to human settlements, but there was a tendency for harvesting to be higher in sites with concentrations of trees of high market value. Potential strategies to control illegal logging activities in the Anavilhanas archipelago include encouragement of sustainable logging in Park buffer zones and stimulation of ecotourism initiatives in the southern region of the Park. Ecotourism development can provide an economic alternative to illegal logging for local communities and inhibit logging by increasing vigilance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalophyllum brasiliense 3aHevea 3aMacrolobium acaciifolium 3aOcotea 3aVirola surinamensis 3aadverse effects 3adendrochronology 3aecotourism 3afloodplains 3aforests 3aharvesting 3ahuman settlements 3aincome 3alogging 3amarket value 3amarkets 3anational parks 3apopulation structure 3astumps 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3awood 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil 0aAmazon 0adendrochronology 0aflood plains 0agrowth 0atrees 0ahuman pressure 0apopulation structure1 aCOSTA, FLÁVIA REGINA CAPELLOTTO1 aSCHÖNGART, JOCHEN0 tEnvironmental conservation.g2012 June, v. 39, no. 2 p.111-121dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25024x1469-43877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S03768929110006103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03917naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245014900174520201700323592002802340650001202368650001702380650001502397650001702412650001202429650002302441650001502464650000902479650001602488650001902504650002302523650002202546650001702568650002102585650001702606650001402623650000902637650001902646650003802665650001502703653002302718653002102741653002302762653001602785653003502801653001602836700002302852700001902875700001802894700001902912700001702931700001702948700005902965700001503024700001703039700001903056773011003075856008503185852000903270655001203279IND60770076020221120185017.0220531e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077007602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1190692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKareem, Hafiz Abdul10aNanosized zinc oxide (n-ZnO) particles pretreatment to alfalfa seedlings alleviate heat-induced morpho-physiological and ultrastructural damages  aGlobal efforts are in rapid progress to tackle the emerging conundrum of climate change-induced heat stress in grassland ecosystems. Zinc oxide nanoparticles (n-ZnO) are known to play a crucial role in plants’ abiotic stress regulation, but its response in alfalfa against heat stress has not been explored. This study aimed at assessing the effects of n-ZnO on alfalfa under heat stress by various morpho-physiological and cellular approaches. Five-week-old alfalfa seedlings were subjected to foliar application of n-ZnO as a pretreatment before the onset of heat stress (BHS) to evaluate its effect on heat tolerance, and as a post-treatment after heat stress (AHS) to evaluate recovery efficiency. In vitro studies on Zn release from n-ZnO by Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICPMS) disclosed that the particle uptake and Zn release were concentration dependent. The uptake and translocation of n-ZnO examined by transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveling showed that n-ZnO was primarily localized in the vacuoles and chloroplasts. TEM images showed that ultrastructural modifications to chloroplast, mitochondria, and cell wall were reversible by highest dose of n-ZnO applied before heat stress, and damages to these organelles were not recoverable when n-ZnO was applied after heat stress. The results further enlightened that 90 mg L⁻¹ n-ZnO better prevented the heat stress-mediated membrane damage, lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress by stimulating antioxidant systems and enhancing osmolyte contents in both BHS and AHS. Although, application of 90 mg L⁻¹ n-ZnO in BHS was more effective in averting heat-induced damages and maintaining better plant growth and morpho-physiological attributes compared to AHS. Conclusively, foliar application of n-ZnO can be encouraged as an effective strategy to protect alfalfa from heat stress damages while minimizing the risk of nanoparticle transmission to environmental compartments, which could happen with soil application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalfalfa 3aantioxidants 3acell walls 3achloroplasts 3aclimate 3afoliar application 3agrasslands 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3alipid peroxidation 3amass spectrometry 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aplant growth 3apollution 3arisk 3asoil treatment 3atransmission electron microscopes 3azinc oxide 0aMedicago sativa L. 0aOxidative stress 0aAntioxidant system 0aHeat stress 0aAlfalfa tolerance and recovery 0aChloroplast1 aHassan, Mahmood Ul1 aZain, Muhammad1 aIrshad, Annie1 aShakoor, Noman1 aSaleem, Sana1 aNiu, Junpeng1 aSkalicky, Milan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4114-69091 aChen, Zhao1 aGuo, Zhipeng1 aWang, Quanzhen0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 June 15, v. 303 p.119069-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1190693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009900169500001900268520147400287592002801761650002001789650001801809650001701827650001301844650001001857650001801867653002201885653002901907653003001936653001901966700005701985773009702042856008502139852000902224655001202233IND60704726720221121231426.0201216e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070472672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Luz, Nelson10aEvaluating the impact of sampling design on drinking water quality monitoring program outcomes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDrinking water suppliers around the world are required by regulations to sample and test water quality in their distribution systems with the intention of generating information that can be used to protect human health. Requirements for where samples must be collected can vary and guidance on how to select locations to meet these requirements is limited. There is a need to better define and evaluate the meaning of representative in the context of selecting locations for collecting grab samples while considering the regulatory context and resources available to suppliers. We develop sampling programs for monitoring disinfectant residual concentrations and compare the results and efficacy of these programs using synthetic water quality data for two example distribution systems. Results showed that achieving accurate estimates of worst quality conditions in a network was more likely than achieving accurate estimates of systemwide conditions, and that using constant locations makes it difficult to accurately represent systemwide conditions. Results also showed that timing of sample collection is likely important depending on factors such as consumer demand patterns, and that it is inappropriate to make conclusions about systemwide conditions when few samples are taken over an evaluation period. This research has implications for developing recommendations that water suppliers and regulators can use to design and evaluate effective sampling programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer demand 3adisinfectants 3ahuman health 3aresearch 3awater 3awater quality 0aSampling programs 0aWater quality monitoring 0aWater quality regulations 0aDrinking water1 aKumpel, Emily1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0138-84410 tWater research.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 185 p.116217-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009400176300001800270520104000288592002801328650001401356650001501370650001401385650001301399650000901412650002501421650002101446650001701467650001101484650001801495650000901513653003701522653002901559653003301588653001901621653002001640653003301660653003301693700001601726773012501742856008601867852000901953655001201962IND60778511120221119025446.0220528e20220603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077851112DNAL7 a10.1080/15440478.2020.18074442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhingare, Nirmala H.10aEnhancement in fire retardant Properties of Coconut Coir/Polyurethane acoustic composites  ap. 2254-2259.  aThis study aims to enhance the flammability properties of coconut coir and polyurethane resin sound-absorbing material. Sound absorption properties of the material for normal sound incidence were measured using impedance tube setup up based on ISO 10534-2 and ASTM E1050-98 standards whereas fire-retardant tests include limiting oxygen (ASTM D2863 standard) and flame extinguish tests. Results illustrate that coconut coir fiber with polyurethane resin has greater sound absorption characteristics; moreover, it has poor fire-retardant properties. Effect of different synthetic and natural fire retardants like diammonium phosphate (DAP), urea, and aloe vera were investigated. Fire-retardant tests show that material treated with DAP and aloe vera shows excellent self-extinguish properties. Morphological study of the acoustic material has been performed by using scanning electron microscope. Also, acoustic tests show that the effect of fire retardants on sound absorption characteristic of the material was not too deteriorating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAloe vera 3aabsorption 3aacoustics 3acoconuts 3acoir 3adiammonium phosphate 3aflame retardants 3aflammability 3aoxygen 3apolyurethanes 3aurea 0aCoconut coir/polyurethane sample 0asound-absorbing material 0alimiting oxygen index method 0afire retardant 0aself-extinguish 0asound absorption coefficient 0ascanning electron microscope1 aPrakash, S.0 tJournal of natural fibers.g2022 June 03, v. 19, no. 6 p.2254-2259dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl946540x1544-046X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15440478.2020.18074443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01891naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245008100174300001600255500002000271520096100291592002801252650001601280650001301296650001901309650001601328650001301344700001401357773011801371852000901489856009101498655001201589IND8905935620221119230609.0180619e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890593562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1989.tb00345.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWILLIAMS, P.

The cap was formed by two Bat lamellae continuous with, but more electron‐dense than, the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. The lamellae enclosed a lumen containing a deposit of electron‐dense material. The pore cap in the rhizoctonias was indistinguishable from that in an isolate of Sebacina vermifera Oberwinkler. In contrast, the pore caps in isolates of S. calcea (Pers.: Fr.) Bres., S. umbrina Rogers and S. grisea (Pets.: Fr.)

Acrylic fibres of homopolymer PAN are subjected to thermo-oxidative treatment following a four-stage or a two-stage isothermal programme, and the resulting oxidized fibres are pyrolyzed up to 1000 °C for 30 min or they are flash-pyrolyzed at 1000 °C for 5 min, and the shrinkage and weight loss are determined. According to FTIR spectra, two indices were expressed to follow the dehydrogenations and cyclizations (nitrile groups) and the band intensity of carbonyl groups to follow the oxidation. The carbon fibres produced from the four-stage oxidation were examined using SEM/EDS. Based on SEM/EDS analysis, an oxygen content of approx. 8.7 at.% in the fibres is needed for the stabilization of the fibres during the oxidation by a four-stage treatment up to 300 °C. These carbon fibres were electrochemically modified by Cyclic Voltammetry in narrow and wide potential regions, using aqueous H₂SO₄. The electrochemical treatment of carbon fibres in the wide region leads to the introduction of an additional amount of oxygen of about 5 at.%, exhibiting also acidic and basic groups in adequate amount. The formation of oxygenous groups on carbon fibres during the three processes is indirectly followed by their ability to adsorb methylene blue or alizarin yellow dyes, based on the concept of “acid–base interaction”. Considering a model of a graphitic monolayer of a basic square that includes 9 rings, the O atoms introduced in this segment were estimated. Carbon fibre applications depend on the amount and type of oxygenous groups that can be targeted by selecting proper treatment conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalizarin 3acarbon fibers 3acarbonization 3adehydrogenation 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apolyacrylonitrile 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ashrinkage 3asulfuric acid 3aweight loss1 aGeorgiou, P.

However, data are lacking on controlled comparative studies concerning the impact of such lights during the pullet rearing and subsequent laying phase. This study evaluated two types of poultry-specific LED light (PS-LED) vs. fluorescent light (FL) with regards to their effects on hen laying performance. A total of 432 Hy-Line W-36 laying hens were tested in two batches using four environmental chambers (nine cages per chamber and 6 birds per cage) from 17 to 41 weeks of age (WOA). Dim-to-red PS-LED and warm-white FL were used in the laying phase. The hens had been reared under a dim-to-blue PS-LED or a warm-white FL from 1 to 16 WOA. The measured performance variables included 1) timing of sexual maturity, 2) egg production performance, 3) egg quality, and 4) egg yolk cholesterol. Results showed that the two types of light used during the laying phase had comparable performance responses for all response parameters (P > 0.05) with a few exceptions. Specifically, eggs laid from hens in the PS-LED treatment had lower shell thickness (P = 0.01) and strength (P = 0.03) than those in the FL treatment at 41 WOA. The two types of light used during the rearing phase did not influence the 17 to 41 WOA laying performance, except that hens reared under the PS-LED laid eggs with lower shell thickness (P = 0.02) at 32 WOA as compared to hens reared under the FL. This study demonstrates that the emerging poultry-specific LED lights yield comparable production performance and egg quality of W-36 laying hens to the traditional fluorescent lights.  aPublisher supplied data 3acages 3acholesterol 3acomparative study 3aegg production 3aegg quality 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3aenergy efficiency 3afluorescence 3afluorescent lamps 3afluorescent lighting 3alaying hens 3alaying performance 3alight emitting diodes 3apullets 3arearing 3asexual maturity 0apoultry lighting 0alight characteristic 0aegg production 0aegg quality 0ayolk cholesterol1 aXin, Hongwei1 aSekhon, Jasreen1 aWang, Tong0 tPoultry science.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 97, no. 3 p.834-844dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45501x0032-57917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pex3713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245016800165300001400333520121300347592002801560650002801588650002701616650001701643650002801660650001501688650001901703650002301722650001201745650001401757650002001771650001701791650002001808650001601828650001401844650001901858653002301877653002001900653001701920653001501937653001401952700005601966700001702022700006102039700001602100700001702116700001802133700002002151700001302171700001302184773010902197856008702306852000902393655001202402IND60630945720221122052926.0190326e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063094572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Tao10aInfluence of polysaccharide as co-encapsulant on powder characteristics, survival and viability of microencapsulated Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37 by spray drying  ap. 10-17.  aIn the present work, five polysaccharides were selected as co-encapsulant of skim milk based matrix and used for the microencapsulation of Lactobacillus paracasei Lpc-37 by spray drying. The morphological characterization, physical properties, encapsulation efficiency, gastrointestinal simulation, and storage stability of microencapsules were examined to evaluate the protective capacity against the adverse conditions of the different wall matrices. Addition of polysaccharides was associated with the enhancement of physical performance of microencapsulated powders, such as the flowability and water activity. Encapsulation matrices containing gum Arabic showed the greatest encapsulation efficiency of 97.1% (maximum survival 7.78 log CFU/g). L. paracasei Lpc-37 encapsulated with the matrices incorporating sodium alginate or sodium carboxymethylcellulose exhibited higher survival (>6.5 log CFU/g) after exposed to simulated gastrointestinal condition and lower viability loss (<0.3 log CFU/g) after 8 weeks of refrigerated storage. The application of polysaccharides, however, showed the tendency of higher hygroscopicity and lower stability of the powders in high temperature and humid environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acold storage 3agastrointestinal system 3agum arabic 3ahygroscopicity 3amicroencapsulation 3apowders 3askim milk 3asodium alginate 3aspray drying 3astorage quality 3atemperature 3aviability 3awater activity 0aMicroencapsulation 0aPolysaccharides 0aSpray drying 0aProbiotics 0aViability1 aDing, Zhuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0227-692X1 aHou, Danping1 aPrakash, Sangeeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1297-39481 aZhao, Yanna1 aFan, Zhiping1 aZhang, Demeng1 aWang, Zhengping1 aLiu, Min1 aHan, Jun0 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 July, v. 252 p.10-17dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03618naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245017000214520194000384592002802324650001302352650001802365650001702383650002802400650001102428650001402439650002402453650001502477650001902492650001502511650001302526650002602539650001802565650002002583650001402603650001802617650001102635650001102646650001802657650002502675651001002700653001902710653003102729653001802760653002102778653001702799700001502816700001402831700001502845773011002860856008502970852000903055655001203064IND60770076320221120184850.0220531e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077007632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1191032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNwankwegu, Amechi S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3561-051410aVariabilities in autumn cyanobacterial responses to ecosystem external enrichments based on nutrient addition bioassay in Pengxi River, Three Gorges Reservoir, China  aNutrient availability, is a crucial anthropogenic stressor promoting freshwater eutrophication and rapid expansion of harmful algal blooms (HABs), deteriorating water quality and threatening public health worldwide. The estimation of the HABs community responses to diel changes in the nutrients while characterizing the ecosystem growth limiting factors, is key to prudent watershed management. The present study investigated the short-term variabilities in autumn cyanobacterial responses to the external nutrient inputs into the Pengxi River using the nutrient addition bioassay approach. Results reveal phytoplankton community structure dominated by the cyanobacteria: Anabaena and Aphanizomenon spp. (relative abundance = 46.20% equilibrium abundance), followed by the diatoms, out of which Lindayia bodaniica, are preponderant. Nutrient enrichment triggered strong variabilities in dominance and successions among the cyanobacterial group, with maximum dominance (76.34%) exhibited by the Aphanizomenon sp. upon NH₄ addition. Fe enrichment led to the succession of cyanobacteria, Leptolyngbya tenuis, which was below the detectable limit in the control, indicating the role of Fe in its proliferation. Studies on nutrient limitation demonstrated P/NH₄ co-limited ecosystem, with P as the primary and NH₄, a secondary limiting factor. The nitrate preference index (NO₃⁻RPI = 0.991) shows a high preference for NH₄ while NO₃ constitutes the bulk of the ecosystem TN. Considering the elevated NO₃ concentration, we posit that a shift in the phytoplankton community structure from cyanobacteria to diatoms dominated ecosystem, is expected following Fe depletion and a further stretch on the current ecosystem NH₄ limitation. The study provides useful and first-ever insights for nutrient reduction in the middle Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) before the onset of the heavy HABs during spring in the Pengxi River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3aAphanizomenon 3aLeptolyngbya 3aanthropogenic stressors 3aautumn 3abioassays 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3anitrates 3anutrient availability 3aphytoplankton 3apoisonous algae 3apollution 3apublic health 3arivers 3aspring 3awater quality 3awatershed management 3aChina 0aEutrophication 0aNutrient addition bioassay 0aCyanobacteria 0aLimiting factors 0aPengxi river1 aZhang, Lei1 aXie, Deti1 aLi, Yiping0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 June 15, v. 303 p.119103-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1191033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013700165500001900302520181100321592002802132650002002160650004402180650002202224650003702246650001602283650001202299650001602311650001002327650001602337650001702353650001502370650001402385650001902399650001902418650002902437650001302466650001902479650001802498650001702516650003702533650002902570650001002599653001002609653002402619653003102643653001402674700001802688700001602706700001302722700005402735700001502789700001902804700001902823700001702842700001702859773009702876856008502973852000903058655001203067IND60704727020221121113913.0201216e20201015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070472702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Shan10aCatalytic degradation mechanism of sulfamethazine via photosynergy of monoclinic BiVO4and microalgae under visible-light irradiation  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo improve the efficiency of antibiotic degradation, the photosynergistic performance of bismuth vanadate (BiVO₄) with a microalga, Dictyosphaerium sp., was demonstrated under visible-light irradiation for the first time. Sulfamethazine (SM2) was selected as a representative sulfanilamide antibiotic, and the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of SM2 was evaluated in media via the BiVO₄–algae system. The hydrothermally synthesized sample was characterized using X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. The results demonstrated that the prepared photocatalyst corresponded to phase-pure monoclinic scheelite BiVO₄. The synthesized BiVO₄ showed superior photocatalytic properties under irradiation with visible light, and more than 80% of photocatalytic degradation efficiency was obtained by the BiVO₄–algae system. Based on quenching experiments, the photocatalytic degradation of SM2 in the BiVO₄–algae system was primarily accomplished via the generation of triplet state dissolved organic matter, and hydroxyl radicals played a small role in the degradation process. The direct oxidation of holes made no contribution to the degradation. Metabolomics data showed that a total of 91 metabolites were significantly changed between the two comparison groups (algae–SM2 group vs algae group; algae–BiVO₄–SM2 group vs algae–BiVO₄ group). The glycometabolism pathways were increased and the tricarboxylic acid cycle was activated when BiVO₄ was present. The study provides a distinctive approach to remove antibiotics using visible light in the aqueous environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDictyosphaerium 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aantibiotics 3abismuth 3airradiation 3alight 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amicroalgae 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aresearch 3asulfamethazine 3asulfanilamide 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3awater 0aBiVO4 0aDictyosphaerium sp. 0aPhotocatalytic degradation 0aMechanism1 aYuan, Mingzhe1 aFeng, Wenbo1 aLiu, Wan1 aZhang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8626-61381 aXu, Houtao1 aZheng, Xiaoyan1 aShen, Genxiang1 aGuo, Chunxia1 aWang, Liqing0 tWater research.g2020 Oct. 15, v. 185 p.116220-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1162203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002500190245016800215300001400383506007600397520168700473592002802160506003702188650002502225650001102250650002202261650001502283650001102298650001002309650001102319650001502330650000902345650002302354650001802377650001202395650001402407650001302421650001302434650001402447650004402461653000902505653000902514653000802523653000802531653000702539653000902546653000802555653000902563653000702572653000702579653000802586653000702594653002102601653000902622653001402631653001302645653001102658700002402669773011102693856008402804852000902888655001202897IND60628105020221207143658.0190321e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062810502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.01.0142doi7 aPMC64453742pmcid7 a306956852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourgeois, Justin R.10aLoss of the neurodevelopmental Joubert syndrome causing protein, Ahi1, causes motor and muscle development delays independent of central nervous system involvement  ap. 36-47.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aJoubert syndrome (JBTS) is a predominantly autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder that presents with characteristic malformations of the cerebellar vermis, superior cerebellar peduncles and midbrain in humans. Accompanying these malformations are a heterogeneous set of clinical symptoms, which frequently include deficits in motor and muscle function, such as hypotonia (low muscle tone) and ataxia (clumsiness). These symptoms are attributed to improper development of the hindbrain, but no direct evidence has been reported linking these in JBTS. Here, we describe muscle developmental defects in a mouse with a targeted deletion of the Abelson helper integration site 1 gene, Ahi1, one of the genes known to cause JBTS in humans. While FVB/NJ Ahi1-/- mice display no gross malformations of the cerebellum, deficits are observed in several measures of motor function, strength, and body development. Specifically, Ahi1-/- mice show delayed physical development, delays in surface reflex righting as neonates, and reductions in grip strength and spontaneous locomotor activity as adults. Additionally, Ahi1-/- mice showed evidence of muscle-specific contributions to this phenotype, such as reductions in 1) myoblast differentiation potential in vitro, 2) muscle desmin expression, and 3) overall muscle mass, myonuclear domain, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area. Together, these data suggest that loss of Ahi1 may cause abnormalities in the differentiation of myoblasts to mature muscle cells. Moreover, Ahi1 loss impacts muscle development directly, outside of any indirect impact of cerebellar malformations, revealing a novel myogenic cause for hypotonia in JBTS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3aadults 3aataxia (disorder) 3acerebellum 3adesmin 3agenes 3ahumans 3alocomotion 3amice 3amuscle development 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3amyoblasts 3amyocytes 3aneonates 3aphenotype 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 0aAHI1 0aBrdU 0aCNS 0aCSA 0aDM 0aDSHB 0aMHC 0aJBTS 0aPM 0aRF 0aSCP 0aVI 0aJoubert syndrome 0aAhi1 0aHypotonia 0aMyogenic 0aDesmin1 aFerland, Russell J.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 448, no. 1 p.36-47dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002300169245012300192300001500315520069200330592002801022650001801050650001001068650001301078650001501091650001301106650001501119650000901134650005401143650001101197650001101208650002101219650004401240650000901284650001601293650002401309650005001333650005701383650003001440650001401470650003301484650003901517650003701556700002301593700002001616700002201636700002201658700001801680700001901698700001901717773009601736856008401832990002301916852000901939655001201948IND60092077320221121225927.0141103e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009207732DNAL7 a216694872pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsuchiya, Atsunori10aHepatocellular carcinoma with progenitor cell features distinguishable by the hepatic stem/progenitor cell marker NCAM  ap. 95-103.  aWe analyzed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with progenitor cell features using hepatic stem/progenitor cell marker neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM).

III. Response to the End of Drought and a Common Garden Experiment1  ap. 722-728.  aEvaporative water loss in Anolis cristatellus from the British Virgin Islands was negatively correlated with the aridity of their habitats. Phenotypic plasticity and//or differential mortality of less well-adapted individuals allowed rapid changes within populations. Here we report the results of two studies intended to differentiate between the two processes. We took advantage of the end of a major drought to study the rapidity with which populations recovered from unusually dry conditions. Population values changed rapidly from those measured in the past. There was no correlation between long-term habitat aridity and measured water-loss rate, but the multiyear correlation between aridity and skin resistance to water loss persisted. We also conducted a common garden experiment in which animals from the wettest and driest habitats were housed under intermediate conditions for one month. We detected no change in skin resistance to water loss in any of the three populations we studied; however, the mass of lizards from Sage Mountain increased significantly during the experiment, and their water loss per unit mass decreased significantly. These results support the existence of both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differences resulting from rapid selection within populations. The magnitude and relative importance of the two, however, remain to be determined.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAnolis cristatellus 0aBritish Virgin Islands 0aevaporative water loss 0ahabitat aridity 0aphenotypic plasticity 0arapid evolution1 aDmi'el, Razi1 aLazell, James0 tBiotropica.g2000 Dec., v. 32, no. 4 p.722-728dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F0006-3606%282000%29032%5B0722%3AEWLIIP%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03879naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005300149245012900202300001200331520295900343592002803302653001803330653001403348653001003362700001603372700001503388773010503403856008403508852000903592655001203601IND60679871720221120184158.0200207e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067987172DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-07-19-1386-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, J.

In 2018, during an inspection for plant-parasitic nematodes, around 100 s-stage juveniles (J2) of root-knot nematodes were extracted from soil (200 g) surrounding the roots of one of the 18 trees using a modified Baermann funnel. The roots were washed, and small round galls occurring in groups in close proximity were observed on roots with a dissecting microscope. Female root-knot nematodes excised from galls were white, globular to pear-shaped, with projecting neck, slightly flattened to round posteriorly, and without a posterior protuberance. The perineal pattern of females was slightly square to oval, with wavy and very fine, thin striae. The body length and tail of the J2 (n = 25) were 380 to 436 μm and 20.8 to 27.3 μm, respectively. Tail length/tail diameter (c′) = 2.7 to 3.7. Tail conoid and short, deeply constricted, usually one-third of tail length from a broad terminus, and 3.2 to 5.2 μm hyaline region. These morphological characteristics were similar to those of Meloidogyne suginamiensis Toida and Yaegashi, 1984 (Toida and Yaegashi 1984). M. mali Itoh, Ohshima & Ichinohe, 1969 was also reported on maple from Japan, but it could be separated by its oval outline, smooth striae of the female perineal pattern, and longer J2 tail length (30 to 40 μm) with finely rounded almost pointed terminus. The morphological identification was confirmed by sequence analysis of the region between the cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) gene and the 16S ribosomal RNA gene in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with primers C2F3 (5′-GGTCAATGTTCAGAAATTTGTGG-3′) and 1108 (5′-TACCTTTGACCAATCACGCT-3′) (Powers and Harris 1993). The PCR product of mtDNA was 536 bp long and analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism with the following restriction enzymes: AluI, BclI, DdeI, DraI, EcoRI, HindIII, HinfI, MsoI, MseI, SspI, StyI, and VspI. The result was identical to a previous report for M. suginamiensis (Orui 1998). Soil samples were collected for a pot experiment to confirm the nematode’s ability to reproduce on maple. Three maple trees were planted in infested soil and grown for 1 year. Galls, eggs, females, and juveniles were detected in all trees and identified as M. suginamiensis. To our knowledge this is the first report of M. suginamiensis on maple from Japan. M. suginamiensis was first reported on mulberry (Morus spp.) from Japan in 1984; its hosts include woody plants like mulberries, fig (Ficus carica L.), elm (Ulmus spp.), raspberry (Rubus spp.), and cherry (Prunus spp.), and also some weeds and vegetables. This species has only been reported from Japan. The mtDNA and rDNA sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession nos.: COII, MN115432; 18S, MN101829 to MN101832; ITS, MN101821 to MN101828; 28S, MN101833 to MN101838), which will benefit identification worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 0amorphological 0amolecular 0amaple1 aFang, Y.

The present study was aimed to detect the effect of this polymorphism on the expression of different growth factors and receptors in Indian colored parent line broilers. An array of economic traits body weights, conformation traits, carcass traits and cutup parts were also recorded among different genotypes (AA, AB and BB). Expression analyses of seven genes i.e. insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF1), insulin like growth factor 2 (IGF2), insulin like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), growth hormone receptor (GHR), insulin like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2), myostatin (MSTN) and transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFβ2) were carried out in liver and breast muscle of broilers with different genotypes. All the genes exhibited higher expression in hepatic tissue of AA and AB genotypes than BB genotypes. However, except MSTN and TGFβ2 the expression was higher in BB genotype. AA and AB genotypes exhibited significantly higher performance than BB genotype. The present results indicated that the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) present in the promoter region of IGF1 could modulate the effects of polymorphism on the expression of genes present on somatotropic axis as well as other growth regulating factors. These results also suggested that endocrine manner of IGF1 is important than para/autocrine mode of action during post-hatch growth of colored broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3abreast muscle 3acarcass characteristics 3achickens 3agenes 3agenotype 3ainsulin 3aliver 3amechanism of action 3amyostatin 3apromoter regions 3areceptors 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asomatotropin 3atransforming growth factor beta 2 0aGrowth family gene 0aGene expression 0aSNP 0aBroiler1 aSingh, R.P.1 aSaxena, V.K.1 aShit, N.1 aSingh, R.1 aSharma, R.K.1 aSastry, K.V.H.0 tLivestock science.g2013 Aug., v. 155, no. 2-3 p.157-164dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2013.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012000208300001600328520113200344592002801476650001101504650002101515650001401536650001301550650001601563650000901579650002201588650001301610650001101623650001101634700001601645700001701661700002001678773008601698856008401784852000901868655001201877IND60598969020221120153731.0180702e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059896902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.10.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Guofang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0436-782510aSingle-step CVD growth of high-density carbon nanotube forests on metallic Ti coatings through catalyst engineering  ap. 680-687.  aWe demonstrate the direct growth of carbon nanotube (CNT) forests on metallic titanium (Ti) coatings by single-step chemical vapor deposition. This was achieved by catalyst engineering, which involves a novel design of Fe/Ti/Fe nanostructure sputtering coated on SiO2/Si wafers. The Fe sublayer, an additional catalyst added to the conventional catalyst/support design, plays a key role in the growth of well aligned and highly dense CNT forests. Depth profile analysis of substrates by secondary ion mass spectroscopy shows that the Fe sublayer is thermally unstable at the Ti/SiO2 interface under the growth conditions. Catalyst diffusion back to the surface from the Fe sublayer is much more significant than down towards the SiO2/Si substrate from the surface Fe layer. This makes it possible to minimize the thickness of surface catalyst layer, and ensures the growth of well aligned and high-density CNT forests on Ti coatings. The filling factor of nanotubes on the substrate after liquid-induced compaction can be dramatically increased up to 57%, leading to an estimation of the areal density of around 10¹² cm⁻².  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3aengineering 3airon 3amass spectrometry 3atitanium 3avapors 3awafers1 aXie, Rongsi1 aYang, Junwei1 aRobertson, John0 tCarbon.g2014 Feb., v. 67 p.680-687dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.10.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002500190245010800215300001600323506007600339520134600415592002801761506003701789650002701826650001301853650001201866650001401878650001301892650001801905650001801923650001401941650002001955653001301975653001701988653001202005653001302017653001302030653001202043700002502055700002102080773011302101856008402214852000902298655001202307IND60628105320221207145111.0190328e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062810532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.01.0072doi7 aPMC64335132pmcid7 a306299552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNathaniel Clarke, D.14aThe cadherin-catenin complex is necessary for cell adhesion and embryogenesis in Nematostella vectensis  ap. 170-181.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe cadherin-catenin complex is a conserved, calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion module that is necessary for normal development and the maintenance of tissue integrity in bilaterian animals. Despite longstanding evidence of a deep ancestry of calcium-dependent cell adhesion in animals, the requirement of the cadherin-catenin complex to coordinate cell-cell adhesion has not been tested directly in a non-bilaterian organism. Here, we provide the first analysis of classical cadherins and catenins in the Starlet Sea Anemone, Nematostella vectensis. Gene expression, protein localization, siRNA-mediated knockdown of α-catenin, and calcium-dependent cell aggregation assays provide evidence that a bonafide cadherin-catenin complex is present in the early embryo, and that α-catenin is required for normal embryonic development and the formation of cell-cell adhesions between cells dissociated from whole embryos. Together these results support the hypothesis that the cadherin-catenin complex was likely a complete and functional cell-cell adhesion module in the last common cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor.Embryonic manipulations and ex vivo adhesion assays in the sea anemone, Nematostella vectensis, indicate that the necessity of the cadherin-catenin complex for mediating cell-cell adhesion is deeply conserved in animal evolution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNematostella vectensis 3aancestry 3aanimals 3acadherins 3acatenins 3acell adhesion 3aembryogenesis 3aevolution 3agene expression 0aCnidaria 0aNematostella 0aCalcium 0aAdhesion 0aCadherin 0aCatenin1 aLowe, Christopher J.1 aJames Nelson, W.0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 447, no. 2 p.170-181dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245011800180300001600298520107300314592002801387650002301415650001401438650002101452650001701473650001001490650001301500650000701513650003501520650001501555650002201570650001601592650002501608650001601633650001201649650001101661650001801672653001201690653002201702653001701724653001701741653001501758700001701773700002801790773010601818856008701924852000902011655001202020IND60612113220221122004410.0201125e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061211322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.07.1412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTizazu, Belachew Zegale10aUltrasonic enhancement of xylitol production from sugarcane bagasse using immobilized Candida tropicalis MTCC 184  ap. 247-258.  aThis study investigates ultrasonic enhancement of xylitol production from sugarcane bagasse using C. tropicalis MTCC 184 immobilized on PU foam. Initial xylitol yield of 0.53 g/g xylose improved to 0.65 g/g of xylose (in 36 h fermentation) after optimization of medium and fermentation parameters. Optimum values of experimental parameters for maximum xylitol were: yeast extract = 5.78 g/L, (NH₄)₂SO₄ = 3.22 g/L, KH₂PO₄ = 0.58 g/L, MgSO₄·7H₂O = 0.57 g/L and temperature = 29.3 °C, initial pH = 6.2, agitation rate = 151 rpm and initial xylose concentration = 20.9 g/L. Application of 37 kHz sonication @10% duty cycle during fermentation at optimum conditions resulted in marked intensification of fermentation kinetics. Xylitol yield of 0.66 g/g of xylose has been obtained in ultrasound-assisted fermentation in just 15 h. Fitting of time profiles of substrates and products to kinetic model has highlighted actual physical mechanisms underlying 2-fold faster kinetics induced by sonication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida tropicalis 3aagitation 3aammonium sulfate 3afermentation 3afoams 3akinetics 3apH 3apotassium dihydrogen phosphate 3asonication 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3axylitol 3axylose 3ayeast extract 0aXylitol 0aSugarcane bagasse 0aFermentation 0aOptimization 0aSonication1 aRoy, Kuldeep1 aMoholkar, Vijayanand S.0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Nov., v. 268 p.247-258dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.07.1413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003700135040001800172100002100190245012900211300001600340506007600356520110500432592002801537506003701565650001001602650001101612650004901623650002001672650002901692650001101721650001301732650001101745650001901756650002901775653000701804653000901811653000801820653000801828653000801836653000901844653000801853653000801861653000801869653000801877653000801885653000701893653000801900653000701908653000801915653000801923653000901931653000801940653001001948653001001958653000901968653001401977653001001991653001302001653002802014653001402042700001402056700002202070700002502092700001702117700002302134700002102157700002202178700001602200700002202216773011302238856008402351852000902435655001202444IND60628105420221207141900.0210513e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062810542DNAL7 a306616452pmid7 aPMC67888112pmcid7 a10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKugler, Jamie E.10aPositioning a multifunctional basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor within the Ciona notochord gene regulatory network  ap. 119-135.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn a multitude of organisms, transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family control the expression of genes required for organ development and tissue differentiation. The functions of different bHLH transcription factors in the specification of nervous system and paraxial mesoderm have been widely investigated in various model systems. Conversely, the knowledge of the role of these regulators in the development of the axial mesoderm, the embryonic territory that gives rise to the notochord, and the identities of their target genes, remain still fragmentary. Here we investigated the transcriptional regulation and target genes of Bhlh-tun1, a bHLH transcription factor expressed in the developing Ciona notochord as well as in additional embryonic territories that contribute to the formation of both larval and adult structures. We describe its possible role in notochord formation, its relationship with the key notochord transcription factor Brachyury, and suggest molecular mechanisms through which Bhlh-tun1 controls the spatial and temporal expression of its effectors.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCiona 3aadults 3abasic helix-loop-helix transcription factors 3agene expression 3agene regulatory networks 3alarvae 3amesoderm 3amodels 3anervous system 3atranscription (genetics) 0abp 0abHLH 0aCNS 0acpm 0aCRM 0aCtrl 0aECM 0aEST 0aGFP 0aGRN 0aGST 0akb 0ahpf 0ah. 0aORF 0aPCR 0aRACE 0aTXF 0aWMISH 0aX-Gal 0abHLH 0aBrachyury 0aCiona 0aEnhancer 0aGene regulatory network 0aNotochord1 aWu, Yushi1 aKatikala, Lavanya1 aPassamaneck, Yale J.1 aAddy, Jermyn1 aCaballero, Natalia1 aOda-Ishii, Izumi1 aMaguire, Julie E.1 aLi, Raymond1 aDi Gregorio, Anna0 tDevelopmental biology.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 448, no. 2 p.119-135dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12382x0012-16067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2019.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011100164300001600275520122300291592002801514650003401542650002301576650002501599650002401624650002801648650001601676650001101692650002801703650002101731650004301752650001201795650001501807650001701822650002901839653001901868653002901887653002001916653002601936653002501962700001801987700001602005700001802021700001502039700001502054773011202069856008202181852000902263655001202272IND60571125220221118093944.0190410e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057112522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfda.2017.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yudan10aEffect of drying processes on prenylflavonoid content and antioxidant activity of Epimedium koreanum Nakai  ap. 796-806.  aEpimedium koreanum Nakai is a famous Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of impotence, osteoporosis, immune suppression and cardiovascular diseases. Drying is the most common and fundamental procedure in post-harvest processing of E. koreanum, which contributes to the variations of flavonoid content, especially prenylflavonoids, the bioactive components. In present study, effect of drying processes on flavonoid content and antioxidant activity were investigated. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode-array detection and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry methods were employed. Twenty seven compounds were identified and 11 of them, including eight prenylflavonoids and three other types of flavonoids, were further quantified. The antioxidant activity of E. koreanum was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging method. The results showed that content of the eight prenylflavonoids exhibited significant variations after different drying processes, especially icariin and baohuoside I. The variation tendency of antioxidant activity was positively correlated with the content of total flavonoid, afzelin and icariin.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aEpimedium koreanum 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acardiovascular diseases 3acorrelation 3adrying 3afree radical scavengers 3aherbal medicines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aicariin 3aionization 3aosteoporosis 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aDrying process 0aEpimedium koreanum Nakai 0aPrenylflavonoid 0aQuantitative analysis 0aAntioxidant activity1 aChen, Shifeng1 aWang, Yadan1 aLv, Chongning1 aWang, Jing1 aLu, Jincai0 tYàowù shípǐn fēnxī.g2018 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.796-806dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23274x1021-94987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfda.2017.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010900169300001800278520128700296592002801583650002001611650001701631650002101648650001701669650001901686650001601705650001501721650001801736650001101754700001501765700001301780700001301793700001701806700002001823700007601843773012801919856008402047852000902131655001202140IND60598581420221122223111.0180702e20180206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059858142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b028832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Juanjuan10aSilica Nanoparticle-Enhanced Fluorescent Sensor Array for Heavy Metal Ions Detection in Colloid Solution  ap. 1628-1634.  aSensitivity and detection limit are two vital factors that affect fluorophores-based sensing and imaging system. However, it remains a challenge to improve the sensitivity and detection limit of fluorophores, largely due to their limited response and photophysical properties. In this study, we report for the first time, a novel approach to enhance the sensitivity and detection limit of probes using silica nanoparticles, also known as silica nanoparticles-enhanced fluorescence (SiEF). SiEF can drastically improve the fluorescence intensities and detection limit of fluorophores. A SiEF-improved fluorescent sensor array for rapid and sensitive identification of different heavy metal ions is achieved, and a 3D spatial dispersion graph is obtained based on the SiEF-improved fluorescent sensor array, which provides a lower concentration dependent pattern than fluorophores alone, allowing qualitative, quantitative, and sensitive detection of heavy metal ions. Furthermore, with UV lamp irradiation of the sensor–metal ion mixtures, the output signals enable direct visual of heavy metal ions with low concentration. Thus, the SiEF approach provides a simple and practical strategy for fluorescent probes to improve their sensitivity and detection limit in analytes sensing.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aheavy metals 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3ametal ions 3ananoparticles 3asilica1 aLi, Junyao1 aXu, Wang1 aWang, Lu1 aSu, Dongdong1 aTeoh, Chai Lean1 aChang, Yŏng-t'aec(Logistician)1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1927-36880 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 06, v. 90, no. 3 p.1628-1634dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b028833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012000175300001400295520102800309592002801337650002601365650002401391650002901415650001301444650001601457650001301473650001301486650001101499650001401510650001201524650001001536650001001546650001101556650000901567650001001576651001601586651001701602653001801619653002301637653001801660653001901678653001301697653003001710700002201740773010601762856008601868852000901954655001201963IND60691488320221118024426.0200430e20080401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069148832DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2008.114074112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowker, Meyrick B.14aThe status of habitat of great white and pink-backed pelicans in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa: a review  ap. 90-98.  aHabitat change, mainly through the actions of humans, poses a threat to great white (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed (P. rufescens) pelicans in northeastern KwaZulu-Natal, the southernmost distributions of these species on Africa’s eastern seaboard. This study assessed the relative importance and state of the potential pelican habitat in the northeastern KwaZulu-Natal region, focusing particularly on Lake St Lucia and the Phongolo River floodplain. Great white pelicans breed on islands in Lake St Lucia. Should these islands be lost through falling water levels or their becoming joined to mainland by deposits of silt, or by flooding, no suitable habitat for their breeding will remain in the region. By contrast, the pink-backed pelican nests in trees, and there appears to be plentiful alternative habitat. Lake St Lucia and, to a lesser extent, the Phongolo River floodplain, are important foraging areas for both pelican species. The hydrology of both these systems has been affected by human activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelecanus onocrotalus 3aPelecanus rufescens 3aanthropogenic activities 3abreeding 3afloodplains 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3ahydrology 3aislands 3alakes 3anests 3arivers 3asilt 3atrees 3aSaint Lucia 3aSouth Africa 0abreeding site 0ahabitat assessment 0aLake St Lucia 0aPelecanus spp. 0apelicans 0aPhongolo River floodplain1 aDowns, Colleen T.0 tAfrican zoology.g2008 Apr. 1, v. 43, no. 1 p.90-98dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2008.114074113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245014800170300001600318520133200334592002801666650001101694650001701705650002101722650001301743650001601756650001101772650002001783650002301803650001001826650001101836650002501847650001401872650004501886650001801931650000901949650001101958650001201969651001701981653003001998653001802028653001502046653001802061773010702079856008502186852000902271655001202280IND60560044620221120133347.0161218e20160101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056004462DNAL7 a10.1080/17429145.2016.11964012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmar, Ayman F.10aAssociation of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma cynodontis’ with Bermuda grass white leaf disease and its new hosts in Qassim province, Saudi Arabia  ap. 101-107.  aTypical symptoms of phytoplasma such as whitening of the leaves, shortening of the stolons on Bermuda grass, variegated leaves, yellows, stunting, little leaves and yellows on Giant reed, Cooba and sand olive shrub were observed in Qassim province, Saudi Arabia, during the autumn season of 2015. When tested for phytoplasma by universal primers P1/P7 followed by R16mF2/R16mR2, products of approximately 1400 bp (as expected) were amplified from 16 plants with symptoms but not from symptomless plants. Based on sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and virtual restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns of the 16S rDNA F2nR2 fragments of seven Qassim phytoplasma isolates, bermuda grass isolates 170, 175 and 177, giant reed isolate 180, sand olive isolates 181 and 182 and cooba isolate 185, the associated phytoplasma was identified as a member of ‘ Candidatus Phytoplasma cynodontis’ which belong to the 16SrXIV-A subgroup. The 16S rDNA gene sequences of seven Qassim phytoplasma isolates exhibited over 99.2% identity with members of ‘ Ca. Phytoplasma cynodontis’ group of phytoplasmas.

However, diet may also contribute towards shaping geographic distributions. We present preliminary data on diet composition based on analyses of faecal pellets of Cordylus cordylus (non-melanistic), C. niger (melanistic) and C. oelofseni (melanistic). Coleoptera were the most common prey ingested both in summer and early spring for all species, followed by Hymenoptera for all species in summer. The overlap in other arthropod taxa ingested was low across species and seasons, suggesting an opportunistic component to their foraging behaviour.We distinguished plant matter in faecal samples of all species in all seasons, reflecting either voluntary or accidental ingestion.

The first group was uninfected; the second group was infected but left untreated; the third group was infected and received thymol at a dose of 40 mg/kg; and the fourth group was infected and received ivermectin (0.2 mg/kg). In vitro, thymol inhibited the development of Toxocara larvae within the eggs. However, ivermectin, produced inconsistent results. The in vivo results indicated that the recovery rates of Toxocara larvae from the liver and lungs on day 7 post-infection were significantly lower in the thymol or ivermectin-treated groups than in the infected untreated control. Albumin levels were significantly increased in the thymol-treated group as compared to the positive control and ivermectin groups. Nitric oxide, IL-4, and IFN- levels in the serum of the thymol or ivermectin-treated groups were significantly lower than that of the positive control group. Histopathological examination demonstrated that thymol and ivermectin were effective in reducing larval load, reducing the number and size of granulomas in the absence of larvae, and improving tissue architecture. The current study concluded that thymol possessed anti-Toxocara activity in a rat model. Additionally, thymol possessed ovicidal properties and may be used as a disinfectant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxocara vitulorum 3aalbino 3aalbumins 3aanimal models 3ablood serum 3adisinfectants 3agranuloma 3ahistopathology 3ainterleukin-4 3aivermectin 3alarvae 3aliver 3amales 3anitric oxide 3aovicides 3athymol1 aAboelhadid, Shawky M.1 aArafa, Waleed M.1 aMoawad, Usama K.1 aHussien, Khaled H.1 aAli, Mona Ibrahim1 aEl-Ashram, Saeed1 aGawad, Samah Sayed Abdel1 aAbdel-Aziz, Sahar Abdel Aleem1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8671-08520 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2022 June, v. 46, no. 2 p.454-465dSpringer IndiawJournal:6190x0971-71967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-022-01465-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245016500163300001400328520146400342592002801806650004401834650002401878650002501902650001501927650001301942650002501955650001901980650002201999650002202021653002502043653002802068653004002096653002302136653002402159700001802183700001402201700001302215700001902228773011002247856008402357852000902441655001202450IND60601429820221120205331.0180706e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060142982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.09.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hong10aComposite proton conductive membranes composed of sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) and phosphotungstic acid-loaded imidazole microcapsules as acid reservoirs  ap. 74-84.  aImidazole microcapsules loaded with phosphotungstic acid (IMCs–HPW) were prepared and incorporated into the sulfonated polyether ether ketone (SPEEK) matrix to fabricate composite proton conductive membranes for potential use in direct methanol fuel cells. The hollow imidazole microcapsules (IMCs) were prepared via distillation–precipitation polymerization, immersed into HPW solution to obtain the acid loaded microcapsules (IMCs–HPW) which were subsequently embedded into membrane as acid-reservoirs. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the concentration-absorption UV–vis spectrum of the IMCs–HPW revealed the tight immobilization of HPW in the IMCs. The introduction of HPW greatly enhanced the thermal stability of the IMCs. The as-prepared SPEEK/IMCs–HPW membranes exhibited reduced swelling degree, reduced methanol crossover and in particular dramatically enhanced proton conductivity. The maximum conductivity at room temperature was 0.0316Scm⁻¹ for the SPEEK/IMCs–HPW composite membrane with a doping content of 15wt%, which was nearly three times higher than that of the pristine SPEEK membrane. Incorporation of the IMCs–HPW acid reservoirs not only rendered the composite membranes with improved water-retention property but also provided additional proton-transfer pathways, leading to a superior proton conduction even under 20% relative humidity which was two orders of magnitude over the pure SPEEK membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aambient temperature 3aasymmetric membranes 3afuel cells 3amethanol 3aphosphotungstic acid 3apolymerization 3arelative humidity 3athermal stability 0aPhosphotungstic acid 0aImidazole microcapsules 0aSulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) 0aComposite membrane 0aProton conductivity1 aShen, Xiaohui1 aCao, Ying1 aLi, Zhen1 aJiang, Zhongyi0 tJournal of membrane science.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 451 p.74-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2013.09.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01243naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245010900171300001800280520020200298592002800500650001000528650001900538650001400557650001900571650001300590700001400603700002300617700002700640700002500667773014200692856007400834852000900908655001200917IND60670710220221120175508.0191002e20140312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067071022DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb21756f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanchanapally, Rajashekhar10aMultifunctional hybrid graphene oxide for label-free detection of malignant melanoma from infected blood  ap. 1934-1937.  aThis communication reports for the first time the development of multifunctional graphene oxide for the ultra-sensitive and label-free detection of malignant melanoma from an infected blood sample.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3achemistry 3agraphene oxide 3amelanoma1 aFan, Zhen1 aSingh, Anant Kumar1 aSinha, Sudarson Sekhar1 aChandra Ray, Paresh,0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2014 Mar. 12, v. 2, no. 14 p.1934-1937dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb21756f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245015300161300001800314500002000332520170300352592002802055650001502083650001502098650003002113650002202143650001502165650002602180650002702206650002502233650001602258650002102274650001702295700002002312700001702332700002902349773010102378856007302479852000902552655001202561IND60572232820221119110351.0170712e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057223282DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.140192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLourenço, André10aTrapped within the city: integrating demography, time since isolation and population‐specific traits to assess the genetic effects of urbanization  ap. 1498-1514.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUrbanization is a severe form of habitat fragmentation that can cause many species to be locally extirpated and many others to become trapped and isolated within an urban matrix. The role of drift in reducing genetic diversity and increasing genetic differentiation is well recognized in urban populations. However, explicit incorporation and analysis of the demographic and temporal factors promoting drift in urban environments are poorly studied. Here, we genotyped 15 microsatellites in 320 fire salamanders from the historical city of Oviedo (Est. 8th century) to assess the effects of time since isolation, demographic history (historical effective population size; Nₑ) and patch size on genetic diversity, population structure and contemporary Nₑ. Our results indicate that urban populations of fire salamanders are highly differentiated, most likely due to the recent Nₑ declines, as calculated in coalescence analyses, concomitant with the urban development of Oviedo. However, urbanization only caused a small loss of genetic diversity. Regression modelling showed that patch size was positively associated with contemporary Nₑ, while we found only moderate support for the effects of demographic history when excluding populations with unresolved history. This highlights the interplay between different factors in determining current genetic diversity and structure. Overall, the results of our study on urban populations of fire salamanders provide some of the very first insights into the mechanisms affecting changes in genetic diversity and population differentiation via drift in urban environments, a crucial subject in a world where increasing urbanization is forecasted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalamandra 3ademography 3aeffective population size 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ahabitat fragmentation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aurbanization1 aAlvarez, David,1 aWang, Ian J.1 aVelo‐Antón, Guillermo0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Mar., v. 26, no. 6 p.1498-1514dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.140193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016100168500001900329520094700348592002801295650002301323650005201346650001101398650001901409650001701428650001301445650000901458650001301467650001201480653001301492653001601505653001501521653000801536653002401544653001501568653001201583653001201595700001701607700006801624700005801692773009801750856008701848852000901935655001201944IND60724185720221120130402.0210312e20210402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072418572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1983052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Sylvie12aA stable platform for the production of virus-like particles pseudotyped with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, we showed that a codon optimized version of the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 can migrate to the cell membrane. However, efficient production of Moloney murine leukemia (MLV) infectious viral particles was only achieved with stable expression of a shorter S version in C-terminal (ΔS) in MLV Gag-pol expressing cells. As compared to transient transfections, this platform generated viruses with a 1000-fold higher titer. ΔS was 15-times more efficiently incorporated into VLPs as compared to S, and that was not due to steric interference between the cytoplasmic tail and the MLV capsid, as similar differences were also observed with extracellular vesicles. The amount of ΔS incorporated into VLPs released from producer cells was high and estimated at 1.25 μg/mL S2 equivalent (S is comprised of S1 and S2). The resulting VLPs could potentially be used alone or as a boost of other immunization strategies for COVID-19.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3acapsid 3acell membranes 3aimmunization 3aleukemia 3amice 3aresearch 3aviruses 0aCOVID-19 0aCoronavirus 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aVLP 0aVirus-like particle 0aRetrovirus 0aMoloney 0aVaccine1 aKarim Ghani,1 ade Campos-Lima, Pedro O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8024-86281 aCaruso, Manuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7609-20150 tVirus research.g2021 Apr. 02, v. 295 p.198305-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1983053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245014700167300001600314520157500330592002801905650001001933650001201943650001201955650001201967650000901979650001501988650001402003650001402017650001202031650001102043650001602054653003602070653003102106653002002137653001702157653002002174700001302194700001402207700001302221700001402234773010602248856008702354852000902441655001202450IND60612113620221122004402.0201125e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061211362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.07.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rui10aEffects of alkali and alkaline earth metal species on the combustion characteristics of single particles from pine sawdust and bituminous coal  ap. 278-285.  aAlkali and alkaline earth metal (AAEM) species are the main components of the ash of biomass, and which would influence the combustion of biomass and coal during the co-firing process. The aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) on the combustion characteristics of pine sawdust (PS) and bituminous coal (BC) by a single particle combustion method. The raw, ash-free and impregnated samples were prepared, and their combustion processes were recorded by a high speed camera. Based on the recorded flame images, the effects of K, Na, Ca and Mg on the combustion characteristics (ignition, volatiles combustion, char combustion) of PS and BC were analyzed. The results reveal that the demineralization treatment brings negative effects on the combustion of PS, which reflects in longer ignition delay time, volatiles and char burnout time, and lower combustion temperature, while the effects on the combustion of BC are opposite. The impregnated samples exhibit shorter ignition delay time, volatiles and char burnout time, and higher combustion temperature than the ash-free samples. In the entire combustion process of PS and BC, K exhibits the strongest promotion effect. When the concentration of K increases from 0 to 2 wt%, the ignition delay time of PS and BC decreases about 5.5 ms and 16.4 ms respectively, the volatiles combustion temperature increases about 41 °C and 77 °C respectively, and the char combustion temperature increases about 226 °C and 141 °C respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acameras 3acoal 3acombustion 3amagnesium 3apotassium 3asawdust 3asodium 3atemperature 0aAlkali and alkaline earth metal 0aCombustion characteristics 0aSingle particle 0aPine sawdust 0aBituminous coal1 aLei, Kai1 aYe, Bu Q.1 aCao, Jin1 aLiu, Dong0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Nov., v. 268 p.278-285dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.07.1453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010300168500001900271520107100290592002801361650002601389650003101415650002101446650001501467650003101482650002701513650001001540650001301550650002001563650002001583650001501603650001001618650001201628650001301640650001301653650001201666653002901678653001601707700001501723700001701738700001801755700001801773700005601791773009801847856008701945852000902032655001202041IND60724185820221122103746.0210312e20210402xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072418582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1983062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Wenting10aCholesterol 25-hydroxylase suppresses porcine deltacoronavirus infection by inhibiting viral entry  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25 H) is a key enzyme regulating cholesterol metabolism and also acts as a broad antiviral host restriction factor. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging swine enteropathogenic coronavirus that can cause vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration and even death in newborn piglets. In this study, we found that PDCoV infection significantly upregulated the expression of CH25H in IPI-FX cells, a cell line of porcine ileum epithelium. Overexpression of CH25H inhibited PDCoV replication, whereas CH25H silencing using RNA interference promoted PDCoV infection. Treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), the catalysate of cholesterol via CH25H, inhibited PDCoV proliferation by impairing viral invasion of IPI-FX cells. Furthermore, a mutant CH25H (CH25H-M) lacking hydroxylase activity also inhibited PDCoV infection to a lesser extent. Taken together, our data suggest that CH25H acts as a host restriction factor to inhibit the proliferation of PDCoV but this inhibitory effect is not completely dependent on its enzymatic activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholesterol 3aPorcine deltacoronaviruses 3aRNA interference 3acell lines 3acholesterol 25-hydroxylase 3acholesterol metabolism 3adeath 3adiarrhea 3aenteropathogens 3aenzyme activity 3aepithelium 3aileum 3amutants 3aneonates 3aresearch 3aviruses 0aPorcine deltacoronavirus 0aViral entry1 aWu, Xiaoli1 aFang, Puxian1 aZhou, Yanrong1 aFang, Liurong1 aXiao, Shaobo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0023-91880 tVirus research.g2021 Apr. 02, v. 295 p.198306-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6283x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2021.1983063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002500169245009800194300001600292520095100308592002801259653002201287653002001309653001701329653001701346653001201363653002301375653003701398653001801435700002201453700003101475700003201506773010201538856011701640852000901757655001201766IND60125341820221120085324.0151103e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012534182DNAL7 a10.1646/0006-3606(2000)032[0872:BOSAFM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Leonora Pires10aBiogeography of South American Forest Mammals: Endemism and Diversity in the Atlantic Forest1  ap. 872-881.  aWe used parsimony analysis of endemicity (PAE) to investigate the distribution patterns of South American lowland forest mammals, focusing on centers of endemism and diversity. We utilized distribution data available for species of marsupials, rodents, and primates that occur in South America. Two grids were superimposed on the distribution maps: a larger one encompassing tropical and subtropical South America, and a smaller and more precise grid covering the Atlantic Forest only. Also, the number of species per quadrat was estimated. The results support the idea that the distribution of this fauna is structured in the form of centers of endemism. In addition, there is good congruence between the areas identified here and those proposed by other authors, reinforcing the value of PAE in this kind of analysis. The hierarchical relationships among areas, however, are not clear and sometimes discordant with other biogeographic analyses.  aPublisher supplied data 0aareas of endemism 0aAtlantic Forest 0abiogeography 0adistribution 0amammals 0aNeotropical region 0aparsimony analysis of endemicity 0aSouth America1 aLeite, Yuri L.

For the first time, an up to 3 kHz velocity response of OEOF has been successfully measured experimentally, even though the oscillating velocity is as low as 600 nm/s. It is found that the oscillating velocity decays with the forcing frequency ff as ff–⁰.⁶⁶. In the investigated range of electric field intensity (EA), below 1 kHz, the linear relation between oscillating velocity and EA is also observed. Because the oscillating velocity at high frequency is very small, the contribution of noise to velocity measurement is significant, and it is discussed in this manuscript. The investigation reveals the instantaneous response of OEOF to the temporal change of electric fields, which exists in almost all AC electrokinetic flows. Furthermore, the experimental observations are important for designing OEOF-based micro/nanofluidics systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3aelectroosmosis 3afluorescence 3aphotobleaching 3atemporal variation 3avelocimetry1 aLiu, Xin1 aYang, Fang1 aWang, Kaige1 aBai, Jintao1 aQiao, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5219-55301 aWang, Guiren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5379-08140 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Feb. 06, v. 90, no. 3 p.1652-1659dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b029853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02113naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012200158300001800280500001900298520086000317592002801177650000801205650002201213650002101235650002401256650002701280650001501307650001001322650001301332650001801345650001201363650001301375650001301388650001301401700001701414700001301431700001501444700001401459773012301473856007401596852000901670655001201679IND60729800620221118225354.0210302e20210224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072980062DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra00550b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qinghua10aApplication progress of RVG peptides to facilitate the delivery of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system  ap. 8505-8515.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe incidence of central nervous system (CNS) diseases is increasing with the aging population. However, it remains challenging to deliver drugs into the CNS because of the existence of a blood–brain barrier (BBB). Notably, rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) peptides have been developed as delivery ligands for CNS diseases. So far, massive RVG peptide modified carriers have been reported, such as liposomes, micelles, polymers, exosomes, dendrimers, and proteins. Moreover, these drug delivery systems can encapsulate almost all small molecules and macromolecule drugs, including siRNA, microRNAs, DNA, proteins, and other nanoparticles, to treat various CNS diseases with efficient and safe drugs. In this review, targeted delivery systems with RVG peptide modified carriers possessing favorable biocompatibility and delivery efficiency are summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRabies lyssavirus 3abiocompatibility 3ablood-brain barrier 3acentral nervous system 3adendrimers 3adrugs 3aexosomes 3aglycoproteins 3aligands 3amicelles 3amicroRNA 3apeptides1 aCheng, Shang1 aQin, Fen1 aFu, Ailing1 aFu, Zhen,0 tRSC advances.g2021 Feb. 24, v. 11, no. 15 p.8505-8515dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra00550b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013500170300001500305520196100320592002802281650001102309650001002320650001102330650002402341650001502365650001202380651001102392651001102403653002702414653002502441653002602466653003902492700002802531700002302559700002202582700002402604700002402628700002602652773010602678856008502784852000902869655001202878IND60571125920221118093954.0180904e20170505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057112592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2016.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Jean C.F.10aNeogene–Quaternary fault reactivation influences coastal basin sedimentation and landform in the continental margin of NE Brazil  ap. 92-107.  aWe investigate the role of reactivation of Precambrian basement fabric in the tectono-sedimentary and geomorphological evolution of the Paraíba Basin, continental margin of northeastern Brazil, during the Cretaceous, Neogene, and Quaternary. This basin represents part of the last bridge between South America and Africa before the last breakup stage of the South Atlantic rifting in the early Cretaceous. The Paraíba Basin infill is composed of siliciclastic and carbonate Cretaceous units, as well as aeolian, fluvial and marine Quaternary units. We used shuttle radar imagery, aeromagnetic, wellbore and field data. The reduced-to-the-pole magnetic map (RTP) indicates the continuity of the steeply dipping Precambrian basement shear zones beneath the Paraíba Basin. The combined analysis of surface and subsurface data shows that NE–SW and E–W-striking shear zones were subjected to brittle reactivation in the Aptian–Middle Albian during the basin opening and again in the Neogene–Quaternary, forming a system of horsts and grabens along the basin; some of these structures such as the E–W-oriented Pernambuco shear zone present modern-day seismicity. N–S- and mainly NW–SE-striking transfer faults cut across Aptian–Middle Albian to Neogene–Quaternary strata. These four main fault directions control main river channels and alluvial valleys up to 2 km wide. Topographic breaks up to 50 m were created by late reactivation of rift faults, which mark the boundary between horsts and grabens along the basin. In addition, structural data evidence syn-tectonic faulting with vertical offsets up to 80 m in the Cretaceous and up to 70 m in the Neogene–Quaternary. We conclude that shear zones across the study area are long-lived structures that have behaved as weakness zones. Their neotectonic brittle reactivation has controlled sediment deposition and landform development, which continued through the Neogene–Quaternary.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aradar 3arivers 3asediment deposition 3atopography 3avalleys 3aAfrica 3aBrazil 0aPost-rift reactivation 0aBasement inheritance 0aNeotectonic landforms 0aNeogene–Quaternary sedimentation1 aBezerra, Francisco H.R.1 aRossetti, Dilce F.1 aBarbosa, José A.1 aMedeiros, Walter E.1 ade Castro, David L.1 aVasconcelos, David L.0 tQuaternary international.g2017 May 05, v. 438 p.92-107dElsevier LtdwJournal:12411x1040-61827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2016.03.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006000155300001800215520118200233592002801415650001101443650001401454650001301468650001401481650002801495650002101523650001001544650001901554650001801573650001101591700001501602700002101617700001401638700002601652700001501678700001901693700002501712700001501737700002001752773014101772856007401913852000901987655001201996IND60670710520221120175503.0191002e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067071052DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb21763a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPloetz, E.10aSelective functionalization of patterned glass surfaces  ap. 2606-2615.  aTailored writing and specific positioning of molecules on nanostructures is a key step for creating functional materials and nano-optical devices, or interfaces for synthetic machines in various applications. We present a novel approach for the selective functionalization of patterned glass surfaces with functional probes of any nature. The presented strategy is optimized for imaging fluorophore labeled nanostructures for (single-molecule) fluorescence microscopy. The first step in the protocol is coating a glass surface, here a microscope cover slide, with a 60 nm thick diamond-like carbon film. Subsequently, the pattern is defined by either writing silicon oxide on the coating with a focused electron beam, or by etching the coating with a focused ion beam to expose the glass surface. Finally, the pattern is silanized and functionalized. We demonstrate the selective binding of organic fluorophores and imaging with high contrast, especially in total-internal-reflection mode. The presented approach is flexible and combines bottom-up assembly with high-resolution lithography on glass cover slides to precisely position and image functional molecules of any type.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3achemistry 3acoatings 3aequipment 3afluorescence microscopy 3afluorescent dyes 3aglass 3aimage analysis 3ananomaterials 3asilica1 aVisser, B.1 aSlingenbergh, W.1 aEvers, K.1 aMartinez-Martinez, D.1 aPei, Y.

These partially mycoheterotrophic orchids sometimes produce fully achlorophyllous, leaf‐bearing (albino) variants. Comparing green and albino individuals of these orchids will help to uncover the molecular mechanisms associated with mycoheterotrophy. We compared green and albino Epipactis helleborine by molecular barcoding of mycorrhizal fungi, nutrient sources based on ¹⁵N and ¹³C abundances and gene expression in their mycorrhizae by RNA‐seq and cDNA de novo assembly. Molecular identification of mycorrhizal fungi showed that green and albino E. helleborine harboured similar mycobionts, mainly Wilcoxina. Stable isotope analyses indicated that albino E. helleborine plants were fully mycoheterotrophic, whereas green individuals were partially mycoheterotrophic. Gene expression analyses showed that genes involved in antioxidant metabolism were upregulated in the albino variants, which indicates that these plants experience greater oxidative stress than the green variants, possibly due to a more frequent lysis of intracellular pelotons. It was also found that some genes involved in the transport of some metabolites, including carbon sources from plant to fungus, are higher in albino than in green variants. This result may indicate a bidirectional carbon flow even in the mycoheterotrophic symbiosis. The genes related to mycorrhizal symbiosis in autotrophic orchids and arbuscular mycorrhizal plants were also upregulated in the albino variants, indicating the existence of common molecular mechanisms among the different mycorrhizal types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aEpipactis 3aalbino 3aantioxidants 3acarbon 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ametabolites 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3aphotosynthesis 3aroots 3astable isotopes 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aYamato, Masahide1 aMiura, Chihiro1 aYamaguchi, Katsushi1 aTakahashi, Kazuya1 aIda, Yoshiko1 aShigenobu, Shuji1 aKaminaka, Hironori0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Mar., v. 26, no. 6 p.1652-1669dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.140213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245011700175300001600292520075000308592002801058650001801086650001101104650001301115650000901128650000901137650000901146650001301155650001201168650001601180650001401196650001601210650000701226650001801233651001101251653001501262653002601277653003101303653001601334653001301350700002401363700002101387773010801408856008601516852000901602655001201611IND60691488920221118024508.0200430e20081001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069148892DNAL7 a10.1080/15627020.2008.116572322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaczmarek, Łukasz10aDactylobiotus luci, a new freshwater tardigrade (Eutardigrada: Macrobiotidae) from theRwenzori Mountains, Uganda  ap. 150-155.  aA new freshwater eutardigrade, Dactylobiotus luci is described from a permanent marsh pool (Zaphania’s Pool) at 4225 m elevation in the Alpine zone of the Rwenzori Mountains, Uganda. The new species is most similar to D. dervizi Biserov, 1998 in the shape of the egg processes, absence of papillae and absence of eyes, but differs from it mainly by a different appearance of macroplacoids, by having tips of the egg processes usually sharp, not divided and more slender, and by several morphometric characters of eggs and adults.

So far, it has only been recorded in one other high-elevation water body in Rwenzori in a similar habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrobiotidae 3aadults 3aaltitude 3aeggs 3aeyes 3afens 3ahabitats 3amarshes 3amorphometry 3amountains 3anew species 3apH 3asurface water 3aUganda 0aTardigrada 0aDactylobiotus dervizi 0aDactylobiotus luci sp. nov 0aalpine pool 0aRwenzori1 aMichalczyk, Łukasz1 aEggermont, Hilde0 tAfrican zoology.g2008 Oct. 1, v. 43, no. 2 p.150-155dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12091x2224-073X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2008.116572323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006200153245009900215500001900314520138900333592002801722650001201750650001001762650001201772650001501784650001601799650002401815650001401839650001601853650001601869650001901885653001301904653003701917653005001954653003202004653002102036700002602057773012302083856008802206852000902294655001202303IND60724186120221120130431.0210301e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072418612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.1083162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurke, Morgen W.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0995-428710aScaling Phenocam GCC, NDVI, and EVI2 with Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel using Gaussian Processes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe use of near-surface remote sensing for monitoring vegetation phenology has advanced greatly over the past decade. The Phenocam Network has deployed more than 500 web-enabled cameras across the globe that use digital repeat photography to capture color information and measure changes in vegetation phenology across diverse ecosystems. Vegetation indices (VIs) such as the Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) have been derived from phenocam imagery. However, it is often necessary to scale these metrics to align them with satellite imagery since phenocam data are not standardised to surface reflectance. We developed a method to convert phenocam digital numbers (DNs) to align with Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 surface (HLS) reflectance products using a Gaussian process. We applied our method across six grassland phenocam sites. The Gaussian Process regression was on average able to account for 77.4 percent of the variation in the HLS surface reflectance, and our resulting phenocam VIs had a high level of agreement with the modeled HLS VIs with an R² of 0.811. This technique provides a novel method for standardising phenocam imagery, easing comparison between multiple phenocam locations and satellite or other sensors that have a standardised surface reflectance product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acolor 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ameteorology 3anormal distribution 3aphenology 3aphotography 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 0aphenocam 0aGreen Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) 0aNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) 0anear-surface remote sensing 0aGaussian process1 aRundquist, Bradley C.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 300 p.108316-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2020.1083163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009200157300001800249500002000267520184700287592002802134650001602162650001102178650001702189650002202206650002402228650002102252650002202273650001802295650002302313650001402336650002402350651001202374651001102386700001502397700002402412700001802436700002002454773010102474856007302575852000902648655001202657IND60572233120221119110555.0170712e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057223312DNAL7 a10.1111/mec.140142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaud, Michael10aMycorrhizal specificity does not limit the distribution of an endangered orchid species  ap. 1687-1701.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhat factors determine the distribution of a species is a central question in ecology and conservation biology. In general, the distribution of plant species is assumed to be controlled by dispersal or environmentally controlled recruitment. For plant species which are critically dependent on mycorrhizal symbionts for germination and seedling establishment, specificity in mycorrhizal associations and availability of suitable mycorrhizal fungi can be expected to have a major impact on successful colonization and establishment and thus ultimately on a species distribution. We combined seed germination experiments with soil analyses and fungal assessments using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing to test the relative importance of dispersal limitation, mycorrhizal availability and local growth conditions on the distribution of the orchid species Liparis loeselii, which, despite being widely distributed, is rare and endangered in Europe. We compared local soil conditions, seed germination and mycorrhizal availability in the soil between locations in northern Belgium and France where L. loeselii occurs naturally and locations where conditions appear suitable, but where adults of the species are absent. Our results indicated that mycorrhizal communities associating with L. loeselii varied among sites and plant life cycle stages, but the observed variations did not affect seed germination, which occurred regardless of current L. loeselii presence and was significantly affected by soil moisture content. These results indicate that L. loeselii is a mycorrhizal generalist capable of opportunistically associating with a variety of fungal partners to induce seed germination. They also indicate that availability of fungal associates is not necessarily the determining factor driving the distribution of mycorrhizal plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrchidaceae 3aadults 3abiogeography 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aplant establishment 3aseed germination 3asequence analysis 3asoil analysis 3asoil water content 3asymbionts 3awildlife management 3aBelgium 3aFrance1 aBrys, Rein1 aVan Landuyt, Wouter1 aLievens, Bart1 aJacquemyn, Hans0 tMolecular ecology.g2017 Mar., v. 26, no. 6 p.1687-1701dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.140143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245007000176300001600246520104200262592002801304650001101332650002101343650001401364650002601378650001801404650001101422650001101433650001601444700001901460700001801479700001901497700002001516700002201536700001901558700002401577700001501601700002101616700002401637773008601661856008401747852000901831655001201840IND60598970020221123022145.0180702e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059897002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.10.0672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsareva, Svetlana Yu.12aA step towards controlled-diameter single walled carbon nanotubes  ap. 753-765.  aThis research treats a particularly challenging undertaking in carbon nanoscience: controlling the diameter distribution of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) grown using CVD. To do so requires the fabrication of well-separated and monodispersed catalytic metal nanoparticles which can be uniformly distributed on a substrate. We propose a new strategy involving the preparation of a monolayer of chemisorbed nickel acetylacetonate which is shown by infrared spectroscopy and coupled thermogravimetric–mass spectrometry analyses to be anchored to the surface silanol groups of the substrate. After decomposition of this precursor, the nickel remains bonded with these surface silanol groups which upon further heating results in good dispersion of the nanoparticles over the silica surface. Using this catalyst, SWCNTs with a very discrete chiral preference and a narrow diameter distribution were synthesized at moderate temperature. This work thus opens new perspectives for the fabrication of uniform-diameter carbon nanotubes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3asilica 3atemperature1 aDevaux, Xavier1 aMcRae, Edward1 aAranda, Lionel1 aGregoire, Brian1 aCarteret, Cédric1 aDossot, Manuel1 aLamouroux, Emmanuel1 aFort, Yves1 aHumbert, Bernard1 aMevellec, Jean-Yves0 tCarbon.g2014 Feb., v. 67 p.753-765dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.10.0673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02711naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002100169245010300190300001600293520070600309592002801015650001901043650001501062650002301077650001201100650002201112650001501134650002301149650003901172650003901211650005501250650004201305650004201347650001701389650001501406650001101421650003801432650002001470650005001490650004601540650004801586650005401634650002101688650002801709650002401737650004401761650004701805700001801852700001901870700001801889773009801907856008402005990002302089852000902112655001202121IND60092078420221121175237.0141103e20111028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009207842DNAL7 a217051352pmid7 a10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTso, Prudence H.10aRGS19 stimulates cell proliferation by deregulating cell cycle control and enhancing Akt signaling  ap. 199-208.  aRGS19 is a regulator of G protein signaling which is upregulated in ovarian cancers and its overexpression promotes cell proliferation in several mammalian cell types. Here we showed that cyclin D1/3 and Cdk6 were upregulated in HEK293 cells overexpressing RGS19, while INK4A and INK4B were reduced. Moreover, RGS19 augmented serum-stimulated PTEN/PDK/Akt and Rb phosphorylations in 293/RGS19 and Caco2/RGS19 cells. These changes were reversed upon the knockdown of RGS19. Consistent with an elevated Akt activity, increased levels of phosphorylated Bad and c-Raf and a diminished expression of TSC2 were detected, thus demonstrating that RGS19 can deregulate cell proliferation via multiple pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3acell cycle 3acell proliferation 3amammals 3aovarian neoplasms 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Proliferation 2aCyclin D1xbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCyclin D3xbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase 6xbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15 2aCyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16 2aHEK293 Cells 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aPTEN Phosphohydrolasexmetabolism 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxmetabolism. 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxmetabolism 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-rafxbiosynthesis 2aRGS Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Small Interfering. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTumor Suppressor Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2abcl-Associated Death Proteinxbiosynthesis1 aYung, Lisa Y.1 aWang, Yingchun1 aWong, Yung H.0 tCancer letters.g2011 Oct. 28, v. 309, no. 2 p.199-208dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.06.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002600144245007500170500002000245520099800265592002801263650000801291650002001299650001601319650001501335650001301350700001901363700001801382700002001400773011301420856007901533852000901612655001201621IND60777797820221119050634.0220521e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077779782DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2021002842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuarato, Piergiuseppe10aInheritance and maintenance of small RNA‐mediated epigenetic effects  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHeritable traits are predominantly encoded within genomic DNA, but it is now appreciated that epigenetic information is also inherited through DNA methylation, histone modifications, and small RNAs. Several examples of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance of traits have been documented in plants and animals. These include even the inheritance of traits acquired through the soma during the life of an organism, implicating the transfer of epigenetic information via the germline to the next generation. Small RNAs appear to play a significant role in carrying epigenetic information across generations. This review focuses on how epigenetic information in the form of small RNAs is transmitted from the germline to the embryos through the gametes. We also consider how inherited epigenetic information is maintained across generations in a small RNA‐dependent and independent manner. Finally, we discuss how epigenetic traits acquired from the soma can be inherited through small RNAs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aepigenetics 3agerm cells 3ahistones1 aSingh, Meetali1 aBourdon, Loan1 aCecere, Germano0 tBioEssays.g2022 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.e2100284-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2021002843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
