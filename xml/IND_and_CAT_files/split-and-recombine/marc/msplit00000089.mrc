Current practice is to perform a totally separate meta-analysis of each set of studies; however, when the meta-analyses investigate related questions, it is possible that the estimates in one meta-analysis could be improved by using information from another. The meta-analytic model for a genetic association study can be parameterized in terms of four meaningful parameters: the size of the genetic effect, the genetic model, the allele frequency in controls and the degree of departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls. Even when the size of the genetic effect differs across meta-analyses, it may be possible to assume that some of the other parameters are common. The models are applied to a meta-analysis of the same gene-disease relationship in three different ethnic groups. 3agene frequency 3ameta-analysis 0aBayesian methods 0aGenetic association studies 0aGenetic model 0aHardy-Weinberg equilibrium1 aMinelli, C.1 aAbrams, K.R.1 aThakkinstian, A.1 aAttia, J.0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Analyses of the massive spatiotemporal functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets often focus on parametric or non-parametric modelling of the temporal component, whereas spatial smoothing is based on Gaussian kernels or random fields. A weakness of Gaussian spatial smoothing is underestimation of activation peaks or blurring of high curvature transitions between activated and non-activated regions of the brain. To improve spatial adaptivity, we introduce a class of inhomogeneous Markov random fields with stochastic interaction weights in a space-varying coefficient model. For given weights, the random field is conditionally Gaussian, but marginally it is non-Gaussian. Fully Bayesian inference, including estimation of weights and variance parameters, can be carried out through efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Although motivated by the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, the methodological development is general and can also be used for spatial smoothing and regression analysis of areal data on irregular lattices. An application to stylized artificial data and to real functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a visual stimulation experiment demonstrates the performance of our approach in comparison with Gaussian and robustified non-Gaussian Markov random-field models. 0aAdaptive weights 0aHuman brain mapping 0aInhomogeneous Markov random fields 0aMarkov chain Monte Carlo methods 0aSpace-varying coefficient models 0aSpatiotemporal modelling1 aFahrmeir, L.1 aHennerfeind, A.0 tJournal of the Royal Statistical Society.

PCC 7002  ap. 1367-1374.  aThe photoreduction of flavodoxin by trimeric photosystem I, both from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, was investigated by flash absorption spectroscopy. After addition of flavodoxin in darkness. single flash experiments show that the transient signals change between individual flashes. This behavior is assigned to a progressive accumulation of flavodoxin semiquinone, which is relatively stable under most experimental conditions. Different conditions were devised in order to study the reduction of the oxidized and semiquinone forms of flavodoxin separately. Both processes were identified by their differential spectra measured between 460 and 630 nm. Detailed kinetic characteristics of flavodoxin reduction were obtained at pH 8.0 in the presence of salts. The kinetics of reduction of oxidized flavodoxin displays a single-exponential component. The rate of this component increases with the flavodoxin concentration up to an asymptotic value of about 600 s-1. The semiquinone form of flavodoxin being protonated, this rate corresponds to a rate-limiting reaction which could be either an electron transfer reaction or a protonation reaction. In contrast, the reduction of flavodoxin semiquinone is biphasic. A fast first-order phase with t1/2 approximately 10 micros is interpreted as an electron transfer process within a preformed complex. A dissociation constant of 2.64 micromolar is calculated for this complex by assuming a simple binding equilibrium between photosystem I and flavodoxin semiquinone. The slower phase observed for semiquinone reduction is concentration dependent, and a second-order rate constant of 1.7 X 10(8) M-1 s-1 is calculated. For both one-electron reduction steps, different optimal salt concentrations are observed indicating slightly different interactions between photosystem I and flavodoxin in its oxidized and semiquinone states. 3aSynechococcus 3aabsorption 3adissociation 3aelectron transfer 3apH 3aphotosystem I 3asalts 3aspectroscopy 2aCyanobacteriaxmetabolism 2aFlavodoxinxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLasers 2aMagnesium Chloridexpharmacology 2aModels, Chemical 2aOxidation-Reductionxdrug effects 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complex 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSpectrophotometryxmethods1 aSetif, P.0 tBiochemistry.g1996 Feb. 6, v. 35, no. 5 p.1367-1374x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi952381c3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle04038naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002700110040001800137100002000155245015300175300001800328520227700346650002802623650001502651650002202666650001102688650002602699650002502725650000902750650001402759650001202773650001402785650001202799650003602811650001302847650001402860650002002874650001302894650001702907650001602924650002702940650002102967650003902988650002503027650002403052650006303076650003103139650002903170700001303199700001603212773007503228852000903303856007703312930003303389945001303422946001303435655001203448IND2056464320221118065927.0970411e19960220dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205646432DNAL7 a86525852pmid7 a10.1021/bi95233652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldsmith, J.O.10aMg coordination by amino acid side chains is not required for assembly and function of the special pair in bacterial photosynthetic reaction centers  ap. 2421-2428.  aA conserved histidine serves as the axial ligand to the Mg of bacteriochlorophylls in the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) and many other photosynthetic systems. The histidine axial ligands to each and both bacteriochlorophylls of the special-pair primary electron donor of the Rhodobacter sphaeroides RC have been replaced with glycine to create a cavity. In each case, RCs assemble and a normal special-pair comprised of Mg-containing bacteriochlorophylls is formed, as judged by many different spectroscopic and functional probes (e.g., absorption and Stark spectra, *P decay kinetics, P+QA-recombination rate, and the redox potential of P). In contrast with heme proteins, where this strategy has been exploited to introduce exogenous organic ligands that can greatly affect the functional properties of the protein [DePillis, G. D., Decatur, S. M., Barrick, D., & Boxer, S. G. (1994) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 116, 6981-6982], addition of exogenous imidazole, pyridine, and ethanethiol has no measurable effect on the functional properties of the special pair in these cavity mutants. FT-Raman spectroscopy is used to provide more detailed information on local interactions around the special pair. Data in the core-size marker mode and carbonyl stretching region suggest that an adventitious ligand replaces histidine as the axial ligand to bacteriochlorophylls in the cavity mutants. We speculate that this ligand is water. Furthermore, the position of the core-size marker mode changes when the cavity mutant RCs are incubated with exogenous ligands such as imidazole, pyridine, or ethanethiol, suggesting that the axial ligand to the special pair BChls can be exchanged in the cavity mutants. Interestingly the temperature dependence of P+QA- recombination kinetics is very similar in the cavity mutants and WT, suggesting that the axial ligands to the special pair are not significant contributors to the solvent reorganization energy for this reaction. These results lead to the surprising conclusion that the nature of the axial ligand to the special pair has little influence on the properties of the macrocycle, and that axial coordination from the protein by histidine is not required for bacteriochlorophyll binding or for efficient electron transfer in the RC. 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3aabsorption 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3afunctional properties 3aglycine (amino acid) 3aheme 3ahistidine 3aligands 3amagnesium 3amutants 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers 3aproteins 3apyridines 3aredox potential 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature 2aAmino Acidsxchemistry 2aFourier Analysis 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aMagnesiumxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescence 2aSpectrum Analysis, Raman1 aKing, B.1 aBoxer, S.G.0 tBiochemistry.g1996 Feb. 20, v. 35, no. 7 p.2421-2428x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi95233653Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03517naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002700110040001800137100001300155245011000168300001800278520198300296650002902279650002202308650001302330650001302343650003002356650001802386650001102404650001602415650003102431650005202462650002202514650001302536650001302549650001402562650004202576650004002618650003202658650004102690650005402731700001702785773007602802852000902878856007702887930003302964945001302997946001303010655001203023IND2056477220221118065911.0970411e19960326dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205647722DNAL7 a86200002pmid7 a10.1021/bi952808f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, W.I.10aRegulation of phosphatidate phosphatase activity from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by phospholipids  ap. 3790-3796.  aRegulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae membrane-associated phosphatidate phosphatase (3-sn-phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.4) activity by phospholipids was examined using purified enzyme and Triton X-100/phospholipid-mixed micelles. Anionic phospholipids activated phosphatidate phosphatase activity whereas zwitterionic phospholipids had a slight inhibitory effect on activity. Cardiolipin (A0.5 = 1.9 mol %), CDP-diacylglycerol (A0.5 = 2.6 mol %), and phosphatidylinositol (A0.5 = 5.5 mol %) were the most potent anionic phospholipid activators. Enzyme activation by cardiolipin (n = 2.8), CDP-diacylglycerol (n = 2.1), and phosphatidylinositol (n = 3.3) followed positive cooperative kinetics. A kinetic analysis was performed to determine the mechanism of phosphatidate phosphatase activation by anionic phospholipids. The dependence of phosphatidate phosphatase on phosphatidate was cooperative (n approximately 2.2) in the absence and presence of phospholipid activators. Cardiolipin, CDP-diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were mixed competitive activators of phosphatidate phosphatase activity. The major effect of the activators was to cause a decrease in the Km for phosphatidate. Sphinganine, a positively charged sphingoid base, inhibited phosphatidate phosphatase activity and antagonized the activation of the enzyme by cardiolipin and phosphatidylinositol. Sphinganine caused an increase in the cooperativity of cardiolipin activation, but had little effect on the A0.5 value for cardiolipin. On the other hand, sphinganine had little effect on the cooperativity of phosphatidylinositol activation, but caused an increase in the A0.5 value for phosphatidylinositol. The activation constants for cardiolipin, CDP-diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were within the range of their cellular concentrations. These results suggested that the activation of phosphatidate phosphatase activity by anionic phospholipids may be physiologically relevant. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aenzyme activation 3akinetics 3amicelles 3aphosphatidate phosphatase 3aphospholipids 3ayeasts 3azwitterions 2aCardiolipinsxpharmacology 2aCytidine Diphosphate Diglyceridesxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aKinetics 2aMicelles 2aOctoxynol 2aPhosphatidate Phosphatasexmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylinositolsxpharmacology 2aPhospholipidsxpharmacology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSphingosinexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology.1 aCarman, G.M.0 tBiochemistry.g1996 Mar. 26, v. 35, no. 12 p.3790-3796x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi952808f3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle03518naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002700110040001800137100001400155245016300169300002000332520164700352650002101999650002402020650002102044650001602065650001902081650001802100650002502118650001302143650001202156650001202168650001202180650001202192650001302204650001302217650001402230650001202244650001602256650002802272650001502300650001502315650001402330650001102344650002602355650001502381650003102396650002402427650002202451650001802473650003102491650001102522650002202533650001902555700001202574700001902586700001702605773007702622852000902699856007702708930003302785945001302818946001302831655001202844IND2056191620221118065643.0970327e19961203dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205619162DNAL7 a89524722pmid7 a10.1021/bi961458+2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, D.10aThermodynamics of carbohydrate binding to galectin-1 from Chinese hamster ovary cells and two mutants.

Recombinant Gal-1 from Escherichia coli, a Cys leads to Ser mutant with enhanced stability (C2S-Gal-1), and a monomeric mutant of the lectin (N-Gal-1) were studied along with the soybean agglutinin and the lectins from Erythrina indica, Erythrina crystagalli, and Erythrina corollodendrum. Although the pattern of association constants of the Erythrina lectins was similar for mono- and disaccharides, variations exist in their enthalpy of binding (-delta H) values for individual carbohydrates. While the Erythrina lectins show greater affinities and -delta H values for lactose and N-acetyllactosamine, the soybean agglutinin possesses similar affinities for methyl beta-galactopyranoside, lactose, and N-acetyllactosamine and a greater -delta H value for the monosaccharide. Gal-1 and the plant lectins possess essentially the same affinities for N-acetyllactosamine; however, the animal lectin shows a lower -delta H value and more favorable binding entropy for the disaccharide. While Gal-1, C2S-Gal-1, and N-Gal-1 all possess essentially the same affinities for N-acetyllactosamine, the two mutants possess much lower -delta H values, even though the mutation site(s) are far removed from the carbohydrate binding site. These results indicate that there are different energetic mechanisms of carbohydrate binding between galectin-1, its two mutants, and the Gal-specific plant lectins. 3aChinese hamsters 3aErythrina variegata 3aEscherichia coli 3aagglutinins 3aanimal ovaries 3abinding sites 3acarbohydrate binding 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3alactose 3alectins 3amutants 3amutation 3asoybeans 3atitration 2aAnimals 2aCalorimetry 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCricetinae 2aCricetulus 2aErythrina 2aFemale 2aGalactosexmetabolism 2aGalectin 1 2aHemagglutininsxmetabolism 2aLectinsxmetabolism 2aOvaryxmetabolism 2aPlant Lectins 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aPlants 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aThermodynamics1 aCho, M.1 aCummings, R.D.1 aBrewer, C.F.0 tBiochemistry.g1996 Dec. 3, v. 35, no. 48 p.15236-15243x0006-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/bi961458+3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aOther US 7aarticle02846naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001900158245007100177300001600248520124400264650002101508650001201529650001501541650001501556650002001571650001901591650002101610650002201631650002301653650001401676650001401690650001401704650000901718650001701727650002801744650002101772650001201793650002201805650001601827650002101843650001201864650000901876650001901885650002101904650002501925650001201950650003101962653002001993653001202013773007202025852000902097856007902106930003302185945001302218946001302231655001202244IND2201873720221118065746.0991207e199905  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220187372DNAL7 a102289642pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.5.6832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldroup, P.W.10aNutritional approaches to reducing phosphorus excretion by poultry  ap. 683-691.  aPhosphorus is an essential mineral for growing poultry, and the consequences of a failure to provide for adequate quantities of this nutrient are physiologically and economically disastrous. Therefore, nutritionists provide a margin of safety for this mineral in their diets. However, because of growing concerns regarding the potential contribution of P in poultry excreta on eutrophication of surface waters, increasing pressure is being placed to limit the amount of excess P in diets and thus reduce fecal output. In order to significantly reduce fecal P while maintaining economic productivity, the nutritionist must establish and maintain an integrated program of activities, including an effective quality control program for incoming animal protein feeds, selection of P supplements of the highest biological value, use of phytase enzymes, and judicious selection of dietary P levels. Potential benefits of newer isomers of vitamin D and the commercial development of grains with high levels of nonphytate P offer promise in the future. Whatever measures are taken to increase the biological availability of the phytate-bound and nonphytate P portions of the diet, commensurate reductions in overall dietary P content must be made. 3abroiler chickens 3aturkeys 3aphosphorus 3aphosphates 3abioavailability 3aeutrophication 3afeed formulation 3afeed requirements 3ameat and bone meal 3afish meal 3ameat meal 3abone meal 3acorn 3asoybean meal 3ahydroxycholecalciferols 3adietary minerals 3ahybrids 3afeces composition 2aAgriculture 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aEutrophication 2aFecesxchemistry 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPoultry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical 0aage differences 0aphytase0 tPoultry science.g1999 May, v. 78, no. 5 p.683-691x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.5.6833Available from publisher's Web site  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02797naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001800159245012000177300001800297500001500315520112100330650001301451650001501464650002301479650001201502650003001514650001901544650001601563650002001579650001801599650001001617650001601627650001001643650001601653650001401669650001201683650001301695650002201708650001301730650002001743650002601763650002101789650000901810650001601819653000901835653002401844653001801868653001401886700001701900700001501917700001601932773007501948852000902023856008002032930003302112945001302145946001302158655001202171IND2202488620221118065725.0000210e199907  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220248862DNAL7 a104046902pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.7.10652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMielnik, M.B.14aThe effect of evaporative air chilling and storage temperature on quality and shelf life of fresh chicken carcasses  ap. 1065-1073.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of evaporative air chilling on quality of fresh chicken carcasses was compared with air chilling as reference method. Cooling efficiency and total heat loss were significantly higher for evaporative air chilling. The chilling method was of great importance for weight loss. Chicken chilled in cold air lost considerably more weight than chicken cooled by evaporative air chilling; the difference was 1.8%. The chilling method also affected the skin color and the amount of moisture on skin surface. After evaporative air chilling, the chicken carcasses had a lighter color and more water on the back and under the wings. The moisture content in skin and meat, cooking loss, and pH were not affected by chilling method. Odor attributes of raw chicken and odor and flavor attributes of cooked chicken did not show any significant differences between the two chilling methods. The shelf life of chicken stored at 4 and -1 C were not affected significantly by chilling method. Storage time and temperature appeared to be the decisive factors for sensory and microbiological quality of fresh chicken carcasses. 3achickens 3ashelf life 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3acooling 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3ameat carcasses 3aplate count 3acarcass quality 3awater content 3acolor 3atemperature 3aodors 3aPseudomonas 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aFood Preservation 2aHumidity 2aMeatxstandards 2aMeat-Packing Industry 2aMuscle, Skeletal 2aSkin 2aTemperature 0askin 0aevaporative cooling 0aweight losses 0aheat loss1 aDainty, R.H.1 aLundby, F.1 aMielnik, J.0 tPoultry science.g1999 July, v. 78, no. 7 p.1065-1073x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.7.10653Available from publisher's Web site  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02886naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001700159245008900176300001800265520128100283650002101564650001301585650001701598650001601615650001001631650002101641650001401662650002001676650000901696650002001705650002001725650002101745650001201766650001601778650002301794650001801817650001301835650003001848650005001878650002301928650002501951650001201976653001301988653001602001653001002017653001802027700001102045700001702056773007502073852000902148856008002157930003302237945001302270946001302283655001202296IND2203491820221118065639.0000331e199908  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220349182DNAL7 a104728322pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.8.10852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKestin, S.C.10aDifferent commercial broiler crosses have different susceptibilities to leg weakness  ap. 1085-1090.  aA trial was conducted to investigate the susceptibility of different genotypes of broilers to leg weakness. Four crosses of commercial broiler lines were assessed. Birds were reared on commercial diets at commercial stocking densities. Indices of leg weakness examined included: walking ability, tibial dyschondroplasia (TD), foot pad burn, hock burn, and angulation of the hock joint. Body weight and feed efficiency were also measured. There were small differences in BW and feed efficiency among the commercial crosses; however, there were large differences in some of the indices of leg weakness among the crosses. Three crosses had similar prevalence of TD; one cross had much less TD than the others. There were large differences in walking ability among crosses. There were also differences among crosses in the prevalence of foot pad and hock burn and angulation of the hock joint. Adjusting the observations for differences in BW did not substantially alter the findings. There were differences among genotypes regarding the correlation coefficients between walking ability and BW, walking ability and hock burn, and TD and BW. It was concluded that there were large differences in some important traits associated with leg weakness among the commercial line crosses. 3abroiler chickens 3acrossing 3aleg weakness 3abody weight 3atibia 3adyschondroplasia 3aincidence 3afeed conversion 3agait 3aliveweight gain 3aanimal injuries 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgenetics 2aEnergy Intake 2aGenotype 2aMuscle Weaknessxgenetics 2aOsteochondrodysplasiasxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTibiaxabnormalities 2aWalking 0afootpads 0adeformities 0ahocks 0abroiler lines1 aSu, G.1 aSorensen, P.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.1085-1090x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.8.10853Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03383naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001700159245010200176300001800278520183400296650001202130650001102142650002302153650001402176650002302190650001602213650001602229650002102245650002302266650001602289650001502305650001602320650002102336650001202357650001602369650001102385650001102396650001402407650000902421650003402430653002502464653002802489653002002517700001702537700002202554700001802576773007502594852000902669856008002678930003302758945001302791946001302804655001202817IND2203492320221118065713.0000331e199908  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220349232DNAL7 a104728352pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.8.11022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrouch, A.N.10aRestriction of feed consumption and body weight in two strains of large white turkey breeder hens  ap. 1102-1109.  aLarge White female-line turkey breeder hen poults (576) of two strains (N, female line and B, male line) were brooded by strain in floor pens from day of hatch until 3 wk of age (WOA). At 3 WOA, all poults were randomly distributed by strain to 48 floor pens in a curtain-sided house. Poults were fed (calorie) restricted beginning at 3 (N3, B3) or 6 (N6, B6) WOA to obtain a 45% reduction in BW at 16 WOA compared to ad libitum controls (NC, BC). At 16 WOA, all hens were gradually returned to ad libitum feeding. At 18 to 30 WOA, all hens were subjected to 8 h light/d. At 30 WOA, all hens were photostimulated with 15.5 h/d. Hens were inseminated weekly with semen from same strain, male-line breeder males. Eggs were collected daily, and all settable eggs from weeks of lay (WOL) 5 to 6, 10 to 11, 15 to 16, 20 to 21, and 24 to 25 were incubated by pen in a common incubator for each set date. Measurements included BW, feed consumption, egg production, mortality, egg fertility, egg hatchability, and poult weight. Statistical analysis of means was performed by strain. Target BW were obtained for feed-restricted hens. Restricted hens increased their feed consumption upon re-alimentation but did not achieve the cumulative feed consumption or BW of control fed hens by 56 WOA. Egg production of N3 hens was greater than NC hens for WOL 2 and 3. Total and settable eggs per hen were greater for N3 hens than for NC for WOL 1 to 5. There were no differences observed for egg weight, egg fertility, hatch of all eggs set, hatch of fertile eggs, or offspring weight among N hen treatments. The B0 hens produced more eggs than B3 or B6 hens. The B6 hens produced lighter weight eggs than B0 hens. It was concluded that early severe feed restriction of female line breeder hens might improve subsequent reproductive performance. 3aturkeys 3apoults 3arestricted feeding 3arepletion 3aad libitum feeding 3afeed intake 3abody weight 3aline differences 3alaying performance 3aturkey eggs 3aegg weight 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aEating 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aMale 2aTurkeysxgrowth & development 0aturkey egg fertility 0aturkey egg hatchability 0aage differences1 aGrimes, J.L.1 aChristensen, V.L.1 aGarlich, J.D.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.1102-1109x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.8.11023Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02381naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001400158245009300172300001600265520097600281650001301257650001701270650001301287650001601300650001201316650000901328650001201337650001001349650001901359650001201378650001301390650001001403650001201413650002701425650002501452650002001477650003201497650001201529653003001541700001601571700001701587700001501604700001201619773007301631852000901704856007901713930003301792945001301825946001301838655001201851IND2202192020221118065619.0000111e199906  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220219202DNAL7 a104381402pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.6.9142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuste, J.10aMechanically recovered poultry meat sausages manufactured with high hydrostatic pressure  ap. 914-921.  aThe effect of high pressure processing at high temperature on texture and color of frankfurter-type sausages made with different contents of mechanically recovered poultry meat (MRPM) was evaluated and compared with that of a standard cooking process. Five types of sausages containing 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0% MRPM and 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% of minced pork meat (MPM), respectively, were manufactured. They were pressurized at 500 MPa for 30 min at 50, 60, 70, and 75 C or cooked at 75 C for 30 min. Pressure-treated sausages were less springy and firm, but more cohesive. Moreover, color of pressurized sausages was lighter and more yellow than that of conventionally cooked sausages. Addition of MPM increased cohesiveness, hardness, and force at 80% compression. Minced pork meat also caused the appearance of sausages to be lighter, less red, and less yellow. Cooked sausages made with MRPM can have an attractive appearance and texture via high pressure processing. 3ahot dogs 3achicken meat 3apressure 3atemperature 3acooking 3apork 3atexture 3acolor 3ashear strength 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aColor 2aCooking 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHydrostatic Pressure 2aMeatxstandards 2aPoultry Productsxstandards 2aTurkeys 0amechanically deboned meat1 aMor-Mur, M.1 aCapellas, M.1 aGuamis, B.1 aPla, R.0 tPoultry science.g1999 June, v. 78, no. 6 p.914-921x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.6.9143Available from publisher's Web site  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03217naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002200158245009400180300001600274520156000290650001201850650001801862650002301880650002101903650001601924650002301940650001501963650002001978650001201998650001302010650003202023650002302055650002102078650001202099650002602111650002402137650000902161650001102170650003702181650000902218650002302227650003502250650003002285653001602315653002002331700002002351700001702371700001902388773007302407852000902480856007902489930003302568945001302601946001302614655001202627IND2202190820221118065701.0000111e199906  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220219082DNAL7 a104381342pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.6.8832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristensen, V.L.10aEffect of genetics and maternal dietary iodide supplementation on turkey embryonic growth  ap. 883-889.  aEmbryonic growth of a turkey lines selected for 16-wk BW (F) or 180-d egg production (E) was measured and compared to randombred controls (RBC2 or RBC1). Egg weight at setting relative to poult weight at hatching indicated increased growth in F as well as E embryos compared to randombred controls. Eggs from F weighed 10 g more than those of RBC2 (P < or = 0.0001) but the poults at hatching were only 8 g heavier (p < or = 0.0001). Water vapor loss during incubation indicated that only 0.9% of the difference could be accounted for by water vapor loss. Selection for increased 16-wk BW resulted in decreased embryo growth rates relative to hatchling mass (P < or = 0.0001) beginning at Day 16 of incubation compared to that of RBC2. Eggs from E weighed 15 g less than RBC1 (P < or = 0.0001) but produced poults weighing only 7 g less (P < or = 0.0001). Incubation water vapor loss was depressed in E compared to RBC1 (P < or = 0.0001) but accounted for only 1.4% of the difference between hatchling weights. Selection for egg production increased embryo growth rates (relative to hatchling mass) measured at 4-d intervals compared to those of the RBC1 line (P < or = 0.05). Iodide supplementation of the maternal diet depressed (P < or = 0.05) glycogen in F embryos but interacted with line to generally increase glycogen in E embryos. Increased glycogen was related to increased growth rates in E but not F line embryos. It may be concluded that iodide supplementation of the material diet and genetics are determinants of embryonic growth in turkeys. 3aturkeys 3aembryogenesis 3aselection criteria 3aline differences 3abody weight 3alaying performance 3aegg weight 3amaternal effect 3aiodides 3aglycogen 3adietary mineral supplements 3aselection response 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxgenetics 2aDietary Supplements 2aEggs 2aFemale 2aIodidesxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aSelection, Genetic 2aTurkeysxembryologyxgenetics. 2aWater-Electrolyte Balance 0agrowth rate 0ahatching weight1 aDonaldson, W.E.1 aNestor, K.E.1 aMcMurtry, J.P.0 tPoultry science.g1999 June, v. 78, no. 6 p.883-889x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.6.8833Available from publisher's Web site  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02916naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100002400180245009100204300001400295500002400309520167100333650001502004650002402019650001702043650001002060650001602070650001402086650001802100650002302118650001402141650001702155653002602172700002402198773008902222852000902311856009302320930003302413945002502446946001102471655001202482IND4402003020140724000000.0080227e20080131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440200302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aM001 0aM1201 aRubio-Godoy, Miguel10aRecruitment and effects of Discocotyle sagittata (Monogenea) infection on farmed trout  ap. 15-23.  aIncludes references  aFarmed rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and brown trout Salmo trutta were monitored over 3 years for infection with the blood-feeding gill fluke Discocotyle sagittata. Parasite transmission is seasonal: new infections take place during summer/autumn, and transmission is generally negligible during winter/spring. There are 2 sources of infection for naïve fish-of-the-year: limited invasion when fish are in the raceways by riverborne larvae originating external to the farm; and internally, within the farm, when 0+ fish are transferred to ponds previously occupied by older cohorts of infected fish. Thereafter, infection levels continue to increase in rainbow trout primarily through transmission within the farm. Prevalence rose to 100% in 1+ fish by the end of their second summer. In O. mykiss, mean abundance reached 194 worms/host for 1+ fish (up to 489 worms/host) and 160 worms/host for 2+ fish. By contrast, in S. trutta, parasite prevalence never exceeded 85% and, after the first year's invasions, infection levels decreased over time: in 1+ and 2+ brown trout, parasite mean abundance was <4 (maximum 15) worms/host. We present evidence of the detrimental effects of D. sagittata on the host: high burdens are associated with pale gills, decreased body condition and host mortality. Parasite burdens become overdispersed during the warmer part of the year, as prevalence and mean abundance increase. However, the degree of parasite overdispersion decreases over winter; we cannot distinguish whether decreased aggregation is due to parasite losses from infected fish (including immune-mediated parasite mortality) or parasite-induced host mortality. 3afish farms 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aSalmo trutta 3atrout 3afarmed fish 3aMonogenea 3ahelminthiasis 3aseasonal variation 3amortality 3afish culture 0aDiscocotyle sagittata1 aTinsley, Richard C.0 tAquaculture.g2008 Jan. 31, v. 274, no. 1 p.15-23dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2007.11.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20081013b20081101c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/10/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02554naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001300158245014400171300001600315520095400331650001101285650001301296650001001309650001001319650001101329650001401340650001801354650002501372650001201397650001601409650002201425650004601447650002101493650001101514650001701525650000901542650002401551650001501575650002401590653002201614653001101636653002001647653001801667653001401685700001901699700002101718700001701739773007301756852000901829856007901838930003301917945001301950946001301963655001201976IND2202438820221118065741.0000208e199907  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220243882DNAL7 a104046732pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.7.9422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, A.10aHeterosis and developmental stability of body and organ weights at hatch for parental line broiler breeders and specific crosses among them  ap. 942-948.  aBody, yolk sac, left and right shanks with toes, empty left and right ceca, left and right lungs, heart, and bursa of Fabricius weights were obtained at hatch for 50 chicks from each of five commercial broiler parental lines (three sire and two dam) and three F(1) crosses involving them.

The ANN more effectively identified the complex relationship between nutrients and feed ingredients than linear regression (LR). Three types of ANN (NeuroShell 2): three-layer backpropagation (BP3), Ward Backpropagation (WBP), a general regression neural network (GRNN); and LR (SAS Proc GLM) were used to predict the AA level in corn, soybean meal, meat and bone meal, fish meal, and wheat based on proximate analysis. In contrast to a past study, a variety of alternative ANN training parameters were examined to improve ANN performance. Predictive performance was judged on the basis of the maximum R(2) value resulting from all defaults tested. Advanced selection of ANN training parameters led to further improvement in performance, especially within the GRNN architecture. In 34 of 35 ANN developed, the maximum R(2) value for each individual AA in each feed ingredient was higher for GRNN than for LR, BP3, or WBP prediction methods. For example, the highest R(2) value for Met in corn was 0.32 for LR, 0.40 for 3LBP, 0.51 for WBP, and 0.95 for GRNN analysis. Predictive performance was also improved overall as compared to results of a previous study. For example, corn maximum R(2) values (GRNN) for Met, TSAA, and Trp were: 0.78, 0.81 and 0.44, previously, and 0.95, 0.96 and 0.88, in the current study. Current soybean meal maximum R values (GRNN) were: Met, 0.92; TSAA, 0.94; and Lys, 0.90. Current meat and bone mean maximum R(2) values (GRNN) were: Met, 0.97; TSAA, 0.97; and Lys, 0.97. The ANN computation is a successful alternative to statistical regression analysis for predicting AA levels in feed ingredients. 3alearning 3aneural networks 3aregression analysis 3aamino acids 3aproximate composition 3afeed formulation 3acomputer techniques 3adatabases 3aprediction 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBone and Bonesxchemistry 2aCalibration 2aDatabases as Topic 2aMeatxanalysis 2aNeural Networks, Computer. 2aPoultry 2aRegression Analysis 2aSoftware 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aZea maysxchemistry 0achemical composition1 aRoush, W.B.0 tPoultry science.g1999 July, v. 78, no. 7 p.983-991x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.7.9833Available from publisher's Web site  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03901naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001100158245012600169300001600295500001500311520188500326650002102211650001002232650002202242650001602264650002002280650000802300650002002308650002102328650000902349650002302358650000902381650001602390650001202406650001602418650001302434650001102447650003302458650001102491650000902502650001302511650002702524650000902551650006502560650007602625650007502701650001502776650002402791650002402815650001702839650001602856653001802872653001002890653001202900653001602912653000902928700001702937700001702954773007302971852000903044856007903053930003303132945001303165946001303178655001203191IND2202438920221118065629.0000208e199907  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220243892DNAL7 a104046742pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.7.9492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, G.10aMeal feeding is more effective than early feed restriction at reducing the prevalence of leg weakness in broiler chickens  ap. 949-955.  a2019-12-04  aTwo trials were conducted to investigate whether manipulation of feeding pattern or early feed intake affected the prevalence of leg weakness in broiler chickens. In Trial 1, the birds were offered two, three, or four meals per day or consumed feed ad libitum. In Trial 2, a multifactorial design was used with age at start, duration of restriction, and severity of restriction as factors. The start of restrictions were at 5, 7, or 9 d, duration of restriction was 5 or 7 d, and feed was restricted to achieve 25, 50, and 75% of predicted growth during the restriction period. Ad libitum birds served as controls. Leg weakness was assessed by gait scoring (GS) and tibial dyschondroplasia (TD) by radiography. Foot burn, hock burn, angulation of the hock joint, feed consumption, and body weight gain were also assessed. The response of the birds to meal feeding was clear. Fewer meals per day was associated with less TD, less hock burn, better walking ability, lower body weight, and better feed conversion. The response of the birds to feed restriction was also clear. Earlier restriction, longer duration, and more severe level of restriction were all associated with lower prevalence of TD, better walking ability, lower body weight, and better relative growth rates and feed efficiency. However, adjusting the observations for differences in body weight removed many of the significant differences; only birds that started feed restriction earlier had less TD. From these trials, it was concluded that meal feeding can beneficially affect the prevalence of leg weakness, and that the major part of this effect is independent of changes in body weight. It was also concluded that early feed restriction reduced many aspects of leg weakness, but that these effects were mainly a result of reduced body weight. Meal feeding and early feed restriction improved feed efficiency. 3abroiler chickens 3atibia 3afeeding frequency 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3aage 3aliveweight gain 3adyschondroplasia 3agait 3aad libitum feeding 3afeet 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickens 2aEating 2aFactor Analysis, Statistical 2aFemale 2aGait 2aHindlimb 2aLeast-Squares Analysis 2aMale 2aMuscle Weaknessxetiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aOsteochondrodysplasiasxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aPrevalence 2aRegression Analysis 2aTibiaxradiography. 2aTime Factors 2aWeight Gain 0afeeding level 0ahocks 0alesions 0agrowth rate 0alegs1 aSorensen, P.1 aKestin, S.C.0 tPoultry science.g1999 July, v. 78, no. 7 p.949-955x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.7.9493Available from publisher's Web site  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02754naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002200140245010900162300001800271500001500289520144500304650001601749650001701765650001901782650002001801650001601821650001401837650001001851650001901861650002001880650001201900650001601912650001901928650002001947650001101967650001401978653002701992653002402019700001802043773007502061852000902136856008002145930003302225945001302258946001302271655001202284IND2203493420221118065721.0000331e199908  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220349342DNAL7 a10.1093/ps/78.8.11842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilversides, F.G.10aEffect of pelleting temperature on the recovery and efficiency of a xylanase enzyme in wheat-based diets  ap. 1184-1190.  a2019-12-04  aTwo trials were performed to test the stability and efficacy of a commercial enzyme preparation containing xylanase and protease activities to pelleting. In Trial 1, 576 male Cobb chicks were fed wheat-based diets to 21 d with or without enzyme and pelleted after conditioning for 55 or 140 s at 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, or 95 C. In Trial 2, 2,880 male Cobb chicks were fed wheat-based diets to 42 d with no enzyme, or with enzyme addition before or after pelleting with conditioning for 30 s at 70, 80, 90, or 95 C. Enzyme addition had a positive effect on BW gain and the feed to gain ratio (FG) in Trial 1 and on FG to 42 d in Trial 2. All treatment effects were significant for intestinal viscosity in both trials. Two- (BW) and three-way (BW, FG) interactions between enzyme, temperature, and time were seen in Trial 1. With enzyme supplementation, second degree polynomial equations of performance on conditioning temperature had high R(2) values for BW and FG, with temperatures between 80 and 85 C being most favorable. Enzyme activity in unsupplemented diets measured in vitro was largely eliminated at temperatures above 80 C, whereas the decline in activity in supplemented diets was linear. In spite of the decline in enzyme activity measured in vitro, intestinal viscosity of chicks fed enzyme-supplemented diets remained low with high processing temperatures, whereas that of chicks fed unsupplemented diets increased dramatically. 3atemperature 3aglycosidases 3aheat stability 3afeed conversion 3aproteinases 3aviscosity 3awheat 3apelleted feeds 3aliveweight gain 3adigesta 3afeed intake 3aheat treatment 3aenzyme activity 3achicks 3amortality 0aO-glycoside hydrolases 0aenzyme preparations1 aBedford, M.R.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.1184-1190x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.8.11843Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02544naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001600159245009300175300001800268520111400286650002101400650002301421650001801444650001701462650002101479650002301500650002301523650001201546650004601558650002201604650002101626650003101647650002901678650000901707650004401716650003301760650001601793700001501809700001501824773007501839852000901914856008001923930003302003945001302036946001302049655001202062IND2203494020221118065805.0000331e199908  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220349402DNAL7 a104728482pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.8.12032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoswell, T.10aHypothalamic neuropeptide Y mRNA is increased after feed restriction in growing broilers  ap. 1203-1207.  aAs part of an approach to uncover the brain mechanisms underlying the regulation of energy balance in broiler chickens, we investigated the possible role of neuropeptide Y (NPY). The NPY gene expression was measured in the hypothalamus of birds from a standard Ross male line and a Ross relaxed line. Both lines are derived from the same founder stock, but the relaxed line has not been selected for rapid growth since 1976. Birds of each line consumed feed either ad libitum or according to a standard commercial restricted feeding program. All groups of birds were killed at an average body weight of 2.4 kg. The NPY mRNA levels were significantly increased (P < 0.0001) in feed-restricted birds of both lines relative to ad libitum controls. No significant differences were detected between the lines. These results show that NPY gene expression in the broiler hypothalamus is sensitive to changes in energetic status, as it is in mammals. However, the maintenance of selection pressure for high growth rate is not associated with altered hypothalamic NPY mRNA levels in the ad libitum or restricted state. 3abroiler chickens 3arestricted feeding 3aneuropeptides 3ahypothalamus 3aline differences 3aad libitum feeding 3aselection criteria 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aFood Deprivation 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHypothalamusxphysiology 2aMale 2aNeuropeptide Yxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aWeight Gain1 aDunn, I.C.1 aCorr, S.A.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.1203-1207x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.8.12033Available from publisher's Web site  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02602naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001300159245011700172300001800289500001500307520072200322650001301044650002801057650001601085650001601101650002201117650002501139650001601164650002501180650002401205650001201229650001801241650002301259650003301282650003101315650001601346650001101362650002101373650000901394650002801403650002901431650000901460650004901469650005201518650002701570650002201597650001201619653002401631653002801655653002101683653002101704700001601725773007501741852000901816856008001825930003301905945001301938946001301951655001201964IND2203493720221118065821.0000331e199908  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220349372DNAL7 a104728472pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.8.11982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiot, C.10aCharacterization of a cDNA sequence encoding the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha in the chicken  ap. 1198-1202.  a2019-12-04  aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) belong to the superfamily of the nuclear hormone receptors that play an important role in lipid homeostasis.

Evolution may affect this result, but our theoretical knowledge of its role is mostly limited to models of small food webs. In the present article, I introduce evolution in a two‐species Lotka-Volterra model in which I vary the interaction type and the cost constraining evolution. Regardless of the cost type, evolution tends to stabilize the dynamics more often in trophic interactions than for mutualism or competition. I then use simulations to study the effect of evolution in larger communities that contain all interaction types. Results suggest that evolution usually stabilizes the dynamics. This stabilizing effect is stronger when evolution affects trophic interactions, but happens for all interaction types. Stabilization decreases with diversity and evolution becomes destabilizing in very diverse communities. This suggests that evolution may not counteract the destabilizing effect of diversity observed in random communities. 3aevolution 3afood webs 3amodels 3amutualism 2aBiodiversity 2aBiological Evolution 2aComputer Simulation 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aModels, Biological 2aSelection, Genetic0 tEcology letters.g2010 Dec., v. 13, no. 12 p.1536-1545dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01545.x 7aarticle01737naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245004400156300001400200500002400214520086900238650001601107650002401123650001101147650000901158650001301167773019101180852000901371856007901380655001201459IND4378188620221118065644.0060227e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437818862DNAL7 a10.1093/erae/jbi0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKvaløy, Ola10aSelf-enforcing contracts in agriculture  ap. 73-92.  aIncludes references  aThis article examines a self-enforcing contract between a risk-neutral principal and a risk-averse agent who is able to hold up values ex post. It shows that risk aversion and variance can only partly explain the contract's incentive intensity. Ex post bargaining power and outside options will also determine contract choice. If the agent's ex post bargaining position is weak, the principal cannot commit to high-powered incentives, whereas if the agent's ex post bargaining position is good, the agent cannot commit to low-powered incentives. The model may thus explain some puzzles in agricultural contracts, in particular why risk-averse agents sometimes accept to be governed by high-powered incentive contracts that are quite similar to fixed rental contracts, and why risk-neutral agents are sometimes offered share contracts with lower-powered incentives. 3aagriculture 3aeconomic incentives 3amodels 3arisk 3avariance0 tEuropean review of agricultural economics.g2006 Mar., v. 33, no. 1 p.73-92dOxford University Press and the Foundation for the European Review of Agricultural Economicsx0165-15877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/erae/jbi0373Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01962naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001900150245011300169300001800282500002400300520090200324650001301226650001301239650001501252650001901267650001001286650001701296650001501313650001401328650001801342650001001360650001601370700002101386700002101407773009801428852000901526856005301535655001201588IND4407231520221118065619.0080627e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440723152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.02.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorella, José10aPerformance of CaO and MgO for the hot gas clean up in gasification of a chlorine-containing (RDF) feedstock  ap. 7539-7544.  aIncludes references  aCalcined limestone (CaO) and calcined dolomite (CaO·MgO) were tested at bench scale to study their usefulness in cleaning hot raw gas from a fluidized bed gasifier of a synthetic or simulated refuse-derived fuel (RDF) with a high (3wt%) content in chlorine. In the gas cleaning reactor two main reactions occurred simultaneously: the elimination of HCl and the elimination of tar by steam reforming. The elimination of HCl formed CaCl₂ and MgCl₂ with melting points below the high (above 800°C) temperatures required for the simultaneous tar elimination reaction. So, the CaO-based particles progressively melted and the catalytic gas cleaning reactor became a compact, agglomerated or glued, cake. Therefore, the life and usefulness of the CaO-based solids used was very low. Nevertheless, and to further avoid these problems, some positive guidelines for future research are proposed here. 3achlorine 3adolomite 3afeedstocks 3afluidized beds 3afuels 3agasification 3aguidelines 3alimestone 3amelting point 3asteam 3atemperature1 aToledo, José M.1 aMolina, Gregorio0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Nov., v. 99, no. 16 p.7539-7544dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.02.018 7aarticle03060naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245013900147300001800286500002400304520172400328650002102052650002302073650002002096650002502116650002602141650003402167650001102201650001402212650006802226650001002294650003702304650001102341650003102352650001802383650001102401650004802412650001402460700001302474700001502487773011502502852000902617655001202626IND4371710020221118065633.0050623e200410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437171002DNAL7 a154657662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaltussen, R.10aIron fortification and iron supplementation are cost-effective interventions to reduce iron deficiency in four subregions of the world  ap. 2678-2684.  aIncludes references  aIron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world, affecting millions of people in both nonindustrialized and industrialized countries. We estimated the costs, effects, and cost-effectiveness of iron supplementation and iron fortification interventions in 4 regions of the world. The effects on population health were arrived at by using a population model designed to estimate the lifelong impact of iron supplementation or iron fortification on individuals benefiting from such interventions. The population model took into consideration effectiveness, patient adherence, and geographic coverage. Costs were based on primary data collection and on a review of the literature. At 95% geographic coverage, iron supplementation has a larger impact on population health than iron fortification. Iron supplementation would avert <12,500 disability adjusted life years (DALY) annually in the European subregion, with very low rates of adult and child mortality, to almost 2.5 million DALYs in the African and Southeast Asian subregions, with high rates of adult and child mortality. On the other hand, fortification is less costly than supplementation and appears to be more cost effective than iron supplementation, regardless of the geographic coverage of fortification. We conclude that iron fortification is economically more attractive than iron supplementation. However, spending the extra resources to implement iron supplementation is still a cost-effective option. The results should be interpreted with caution, because evidence of intervention effectiveness predominantly relates to small-scale efficacy trials, which may not reflect the actual effect under expected conditions. 3aSoutheast Asians 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3adeveloping countries 3adiet-related diseases 3adisability-adjusted life year 3amodels 3amortality 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxdrug therapyxeconomicsxepidemiology. 2aChild 2aCost-Benefit Analysisxeconomics 2aFemale 2aFood, Fortifiedxeconomics 2aGlobal Health 2aHumans 2aIron Compoundsxeconomicsxtherapeutic use. 2aPregnancy1 aKnai, C.1 aSharan, M.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2004 Oct., v. 134, no. 10 p.2678-2684dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03375naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171100002100180245009600201300001600297500002400313500001500337520143000352650001901782650001401801650001701815650002001832650001301852650001801865650002301883650001401906650001401920650003101934650001301965650002101978650002001999650001102019650002402030650001502054650001402069650002002083650002502103650001102128650002302139650002602162650001302188650002202201650002202223650001002245650001402255653002702269653002702296653002002323653002802343700001802371700002102389773010702410852000902517856009202526930003302618945002502651946001302676655001202689IND4401851620221118065910.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185162DNAL7 a182987302pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00649.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aZinoviadou, K.G.10aTribological Properties of Neutral Polysaccharide Solutions under Simulated Oral Conditions  ap. E88-E94.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPredictability of the perception of foods thickened by polysaccharides is only poor. Therefore, the effect of saliva on the lubrication properties of 2 types of neutral polysaccharides, cross-linked starch and locust bean gum, was studied. Despite the similar bulk rheological behavior of the 2 polysaccharides, the starch solution exhibited a significantly lower friction coefficient. Although starch viscosity was strongly decreased upon 10 s incubation with human saliva, a low friction coefficient was retained. The presence of remaining granules is held partly responsible for this. Addition of starch granules to locust bean gum also resulted in a decrease in the friction coefficient, but the effect was smaller compared to starch solutions digested by saliva. Smaller contact angles were measured for (digested) starch compared to locust bean gum solutions. This points to other parameters that assist in lubrication, such as the interaction of starch solution constituents with the rubbing surfaces. In addition, the importance of bulk viscosity for spreadability on surfaces was demonstrated. This study illustrates that the type of starch will determine not only the viscosity change but also the presence of intact granules upon digestion by saliva in the oral cavity; the combination of these 2 properties is regarded to be responsible for the poor predictability of sensory responses of starch containing foods. 3aneutralization 3asolutions 3acrosslinking 3astarch granules 3aamylases 3acontact angle 3asensory properties 3aviscosity 3asensation 3aphysicochemical properties 3afriction 3ain vitro studies 3aenzyme activity 3asaliva 3ainterface phenomena 3aprediction 2aDigestion 2aFood Technology 2aGalactansxchemistry 2aHumans 2aMannansxchemistry 2aPlant Gumsxchemistry 2aRheology 2aSalivaxchemistry 2aStarchxchemistry 2aTaste 2aViscosity 0alubrication properties 0arheological properties 0apolysaccharides 0atribological properties1 aJanssen, A.M.1 ade Jongh, H.H.J.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Mar., v. 73, no. 2 p.E88-E94dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00649.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle03420naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001700189245010300206300001600309500002400325520127200349650001101621650002701632650002201659650001901681650001301700650001601713650001201729650001701741650002701758650000901785650001701794650001901811650002101830650002101851650002301872650001901895650001801914650002101932650003301953650003901986650002402025650002702049650002002076650000902096650002002105650003102125650003702156650004702193650002402240650002502264650002702289650003202316650001702348653001802365700001602383700002002399773010702419852000902526856009202535930003302627945002502660946001302685655001202698IND4401851120221118070011.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185112DNAL7 a182987252pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00618.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aTseng, Y.-C.10aEffects of Inulin/Oligofructose on the Thermal Stability and Acid-Induced Gelation of Soy Proteins  ap.

Addition of 10% (w/v) inulin/oligofructose or sucrose increased (P < 0.05) the peak denaturation temperatures (Tm) of 7S and 11S soy proteins in SPI dispersion (5%[w/v], pH 7.0) by an average of 1.9 and 2.3 °C, respectively. GDL induced SPI thermal gelation, and the gel rheology was affected by both the pH decline and the specific temperature of heating. Addition of inulin/oligofructose (8%, w/v) improved the gelling properties of preheated SPI dispersion (8%, w/v) coagulated with GDL, showing 14.4 to 45.6% increase (P < 0.05) in gel rigidity (G' value) at the end of heating (81 °C). Microstructural examination revealed a denser protein cross-linking structure and reduced pore sizes in SPI gels containing inulin/oligofructose. In general, inulin was more capable of improving SPI gelation than oligofructose, suggesting that the degree of fructose polymerization in the fructans was of thermal and rheological importance. 3ainulin 3afructooligosaccharides 3athermal stability 3aacid treatment 3agelation 3asoy protein 3asucrose 3adenaturation 3arheological properties 3agels 3acrosslinking 3apolymerization 3afunctional foods 3aprotein isolates 3amodel food systems 3amicrostructure 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aprotein-protein interactions 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aChemistry, Physical 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Technology 2aGels 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInulinxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aOligosaccharidesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aProtein Denaturation 2aRheologyxdrug effects 2aSoybean Proteinsxchemistry 2aTime Factors 0aoligofructose1 aXiong, Y.L.1 aBoatright, W.L.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Mar., v. 73, no. 2 p.E44-E50dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00618.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle03451naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170100002000179245018900199300001600388500002400404500001500428520166000443650002302103650002202126650002802148650001802176650001902194650002802213650002702241650002302268650001902291650002402310650002102334650001602355650004402371650001902415650002702434653003202461653006002493700001202553700001802565700001902583700001602602773010702618852000902725856009202734930003302826945002502859946001302884655001202897IND4401852220221118065853.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185222DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00640.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ200 0aQ5001 aAl-Qadiri, H.M.10aDetection of Sublethal Thermal Injury in Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes Using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) Spectroscopy (4000 to 600 cm⁻¹)  ap. M54-M61.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy (4000 to 600 cm⁻¹) was utilized to detect sublethally heat-injured microorganisms: Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium ATCC 14028, a Gram-negative bacterium, and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19113, a Gram-positive bacterium. A range of heat treatments (N= 2) at 60 °C were evaluated: 0D (control), 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D using a D₆₀ °C (S. enterica serotype Typhimurium ATCC 14028 = 0.30 min, L. monocytogenes ATCC 19113 = 0.43 min). The mechanism of cell injury appeared to be different for Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbes as observed from differences in the 2nd derivative transformations and loadings plot of bacterial spectra following heat treatment. The loadings for PC1 and PC2 confirmed that the amide I and amide II bands were the major contribution to spectral variation, with relatively small contributions from C-H deformations, the antisymmetric P==O stretching modes of the phosphodiester nucleic acid backbone, and the C-O-C stretching modes of polysaccharides. Using soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), the extent of injury could be predicted correctly at least 83% of the time. Partial least squares (PLS) calibration analysis was constructed using 5 latent variables for predicting the bacterial counts for survivors of the different heat treatments and yielded a high correlation coefficient (R= 0.97 [S. enterica serotype Typhimurium] and 0.98 [L. monocytogenes]) and a standard error of prediction (SEP= 0.51 [S. enterica serotype Typhimurium] and 0.39 log₁₀ CFU/mL [L. monocytogenes]), indicating that the degree of heat injury could be predicted. 3amodel food systems 3athermal stability 3abacterial contamination 3afood analysis 3aheat tolerance 3amicrobiological quality 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial detection 3afood composition 3aheat injury 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aheat treatment 3aListeria monocytogenes 0aheat-injured microorganisms 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium1 aLin, M.1 aAl-Holy, M.A.1 aCavinato, A.G.1 aRasco, B.A.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Mar., v. 73, no. 2 p.M54-M61dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00640.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle03395naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100001700198245012100215300001700336500002400353520130500377650001401682650002501696650001101721650001701732650002001749650001601769650002001785650001901805650001801824650002101842650002401863650001201887650004501899650001401944650003301958650003701991650002702028650002202055650002002077650003102097650003202128650003602160650002602196650002902222650002002251650002502271650003402296650001602330653002202346700001702368700002102385700002302406773010802429852000902537856009202546930003302638945002502671946001302696655001202709IND4401853320221118065954.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185332DNAL7 a182987472pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00630.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ106 0aQ406 0aQ5061 aEakpetch, P.10aAutolysis of Pacific White Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) Meat: Characterization and the Effects of Protein Additives  ap.

Pacific white shrimp mince exhibited the maximum autolytic activity at 35 and 40 °C in the absence and in the presence of 2.5%NaCl, respectively, as evidenced by the highest TCA-soluble peptide content and the greatest disappearance of myosin heavy chain (MHC). The autolysis was more pronounced in the acidic pH values, followed by alkaline pH ranges. Pepstatin A showed the highest inhibition toward autolysis in the acidic condition, revealing that aspartic proteinase was dominant in shrimp muscle. Nevertheless, soybean trypsin inhibitor effectively inhibited the autolysis at neutral and alkaline pH values, suggesting that serine proteinase was present in shrimp mince but contributed to autolysis at a lower extent in shrimp meat. Autolysis in shrimp meat could be inhibited partially by all protein additives, including bovine plasma protein (BPP), egg white (EW), and whey protein concentrate (WPC). The inhibition of autolysis increased when the level of protein additives increased with the concomitant increase in band intensity of MHC retained. WPC and BPP in the range of 2% to 3% exhibited the highest inhibition toward autolysis of shrimp mince. 3aautolysis 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3ashrimp 3aminced foods 3asodium chloride 3aproteinases 3aanimal proteins 3afood additives 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3amyosin heavy chains 2aAnimals 2aAspartic Acid Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aAutolysis 2aBlood Proteinsxpharmacology 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Preservation 2aFood Technology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMilk Proteinsxpharmacology 2aMyosin Heavy Chainsxmetabolism 2aPenaeidaexmetabolism 2aPepstatinsxpharmacology 2aQuality Control 2aShellfishxstandards 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aTemperature 0aprotein additives1 aBenjakul, S.1 aVisessanguan, W.1 aKijroongrojana, K.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Mar., v. 73, no. 2 p.S95-S103dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00630.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle03113naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100002400138245016800162300001800330500002400348520163900372650001502011650001002026650001702036650000902053650001102062650001302073650001602086650001702102650002302119650002402142650001602166650001502182650001502197650001902212650002102231650001402252650001102266650001502277651001002292700002102302700001902323700001802342700002102360700002002381773011902401852000902520856007802529655001202607IND4400001220221118065923.0080113e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440000122DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/erm3032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinberger, Florian10aDifferent regulation of haloperoxidation during agar oligosaccharide-activated defence mechanisms in two related red algae, Gracilaria sp. and Gracilaria chilensis  ap. 4365-4372.  aIncludes references  aThe related red seaweeds Gracilaria sp. from the eastern Mediterranean and Gracilaria chilensis from Chile were similar in their enzymatic inventory for halogenation. In both species, halogenation was dependent upon H₂O₂ and thus driven by haloperoxidases. These could be inhibited with phosphate and reversibly inhibited with azide and were therefore apparently dependent upon vanadate. Both species generated in the first line bromoform and other brominated halocarbons. Gel electrophoresis under non-denaturating conditions demonstrated that both species expressed halogenating peroxidases. Elicitation of Gracilaria sp. with agar oligosaccharides resulted in marked increases in bromination, iodination, and chlorination. Production rates of volatile halocarbons and phenol red bromination both increased by a factor of eight, presumably due to increased availability for haloperoxidases of H₂O₂ during the oxidative burst response. Elicitation of Gracilaria sp. also triggered a release of bromide ions through DIDS-sensitive anion channels, which allowed for some bromination in bromide-free medium. However, this effect was relatively limited. By contrast, agar oligosaccharide oxidation in G. chilensis did not increase halogenation. Obviously, agar oligosaccharide oxidation does not provide sufficient amounts of hypohalous acids for such increases, because it does not deliver H₂O₂ at the active site of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases. These results correlate with earlier findings that the agar oligosaccharide-elicited oxidative burst controls microorganisms while agar oligosaccharide oxidation does not. 3aGracilaria 3aacids 3aactive sites 3aagar 3aanions 3abromides 3abromination 3achlorination 3adefense mechanisms 3agel electrophoresis 3ainventories 3aiodination 3amacroalgae 3amicroorganisms 3aoligosaccharides 3aoxidation 3aphenol 3aphosphates 3aChile1 aCoquempot, Boris1 aForner, Sandra1 aMorin, Pascal1 aKloareg, Bernard1 aPotin, Philippe0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 Dec., v. 58, no. 15-16 p.4365-4372dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm3033Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03137naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100002000170245013500190300001600325500002400341520168400365650001602049650002702065650002202092650002002114650002202134650002202156650002502178650003102203650004802234650002702282650002302309650001402332650001802346650002102364700001502385773010702400852000902507856009202516930003302608945002502641946001302666655001202679IND4401852620221118065953.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00643.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ121 0aQ5011 aRamchandran, L.10aProteolytic Profiles and Angiotensin-I Converting Enzyme and α-Glucosidase Inhibitory Activities of Selected Lactic Acid Bacteria  ap.

Two strains each of yogurt bacteria (Streptococcus thermophilus--1275 and 285, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus--1092 and 1368), and probiotics (L. acidophilus--4461 and 33200, and L. casei--2607 and 15286, and 1 strain of Bifidobacterium longum 5022), were cultivated in reconstituted skim milk (RSM) at 37 °C and their proteolytic profiles and ACE as well as α-glu inhibitory activities were determined. Among all the strains of lactic acid bacteria studied, yogurt bacteria grew very well, with the exception of L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368 which showed a slower growth during the initial 3 h of incubation. The growth pattern corresponded well with the decrease in pH for the organisms. All the organisms showed an increase in proteolysis with time. The variations in proteolytic capabilities translated into corresponding variations in ACE inhibitory potential of these organisms. Bifidobacterium longum 5022 showed the highest ACE inhibitory potential followed by L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus 1368, L. casei 15286, S. thermophilus 1275, and L. acidophilus 4461. Organisms with high intracellular enzymatic activities grew well. Also, aminopeptidases of strains of L. acidophilus 4461 and S. thermophilus 1275 that could better utilize proline containing substrates showed enhanced ACE inhibitory potential. Lactic acid bacteria possessed the ability to inhibit α-glu activity, which endowed them an antidiabetic property as well. 3aproteolysis 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme inhibitors 3alactic acid bacteria 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aBifidobacterium longum 3areconstituted milk 3askim milk 3afood analysis 3afood composition1 aShah, N.P.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Mar., v. 73, no. 2 p.M75-M81dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00643.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/22  aOther US 7aarticle03098naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001500171245009100186300001600277500002400293520147800317650001001795650001201805650002401817650001301841650000901854650002301863650001601886650000901902650001701911650001901928650002801947650004401975650001202019650001202031650002302043650003702066650002102103650002002124650001302144650003402157650000902191650002102200650001302221650002802234650001002262700001302272700001402285700001502299700001502314700001602329773009902345852000902444856005502453655001202508IND4457967420221118070017.0110513e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445796742DNAL7 a215543482pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02133.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, R.M.10aValidation of a paternally imprinted QTL affecting pH24h distinct from PRKAG3 on SSC15  ap. 316-320.  aIncludes references  aWe previously performed a genome scan in a White Duroc × Erhualian F₂ population and identified a QTL on SSC15 with strong effect on pH24h in M. Longissimus dorsi and M. Semimembranous muscle tissue. At that time, the mode of inheritance of this QTL was not clarified, and it was also unclear whether the observed QTL effect was completely or partially caused by mutations in the PRKAG3 gene, which is the only major gene on SSC15 so far known to influence pH24h. In this study, effects of the PRKAG3 gene on meat quality traits were estimated by association analyses. Two substitutions in PRKAG3, p.Ile199Val (p.I199V) and p.Thr30Asn (p.T30N), were found to be segregating in the F₂ population and to significantly affect pH24h and total glycogen in meat, respectively. However, we excluded PRKAG3 as a causative gene for the detected QTL based on the following reasons: (i) the gene was located outside of the QTL confidence interval; (ii) when the PRKAG3 substitution was included as a fixed effect in the QTL model, the F-ratio for the QTL increased rather than decreased; (iii) favourable alleles for pH24h at the QTL and at the PRKAG3 p.I199V locus originated from Erhualian and White Duroc founders, respectively; (iv) more importantly, this QTL showed exclusive maternal expression, differing from the Mendelian expression of PRKAG3. In conclusion, this study is the first to report a maternally-expressed QTL for pH24h on SSC15, which is distinct from PRKAG3. 3aDuroc 3aalleles 3aconfidence interval 3aglycogen 3aloci 3alongissimus muscle 3amajor genes 3ameat 3ameat quality 3amuscle tissues 3aquantitative trait loci 2aAMP-Activated Protein Kinasesxgenetics 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Mammalianxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenotype 2aGlycogenxanalysisxgenetics. 2aMeat 2aMuscle, Skeletal 2aMutation 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSwine1 aMa, J.W.1 aGuo, Y.M.1 aDuan, Y.Y.1 aZhou, L.H.1 aHuang, L.S.0 tAnimal genetics.g2011 June, v. 42, no. 3 p.316-320dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02133.x 7aarticle02800naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010200172300001600274500002400290520170400314650001602018653001702034653001902051653001702070653001402087653001502101700002502116700001302141700002602154773012502180852000902305856009202314930003302406946001102439655001202450IND4401854220221118064617.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2007.00757.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKABOUW, PATRICK10aStyloid crystals in Claoxylon (Euphorbiaceae) and allies (Claoxylinae) with notes on leaf anatomy  ap. 445-457.  aIncludes references  aClaoxylon and Micrococca are the only Euphorbiaceae genera that have rough dried leaves (fresh ones are smooth) because of protruding styloid (needle-like) crystals more or less perpendicular to the leaf surface, which perforate the epidermis and cuticle. A broad leaf anatomical study of the subtribes Claoxylinae, the monogeneric Lobaniliinae, and Mercurialis of the Mercurialinae (95 of a possible 235 species in all six genera) showed that styloids are present in Claoxylon, Discoclaoxylon, Erythrococca, Lobanilia, and Micrococca, and lacking in Claoxylopsis and Mercurialis. Contrary to Claoxylon, the dried leaves of Discoclaoxylon, Erythrococca, Lobanilia, and Micrococca are not rough, because the styloids do not perforate the epidermis during drying and therefore herbarium leaves generally remain smooth. The presence of styloids supports a clade in a recent molecular phylogenetic study that unites subtribes Claoxylinae and Lobaniliinae as Claoxylinae s.l. Mercurialis (no styloids) is sister to all other taxa (with styloids) in the monophyletic Claoxylinae s.l. The styloids form a synapomorphy for a monophyletic part of the Claoxylinae (Claoxylon, Discoclaoxylon, Erythrococca, Lobanilia, and Micrococca). Other leaf anatomical notes are provided, together with an overview of the occurrence of styloids, stomata, and druse crystals for most species in the Claoxylinae. The indumentum ranges from (virtually) absent to a sparse or dense tomentum of straight and thick- or thin-walled unicellular hairs (most common), curly hairs, or two-armed hairs ('Malpighiaceous hairs'). The last two hair types probably form diagnostic characters for species groups within the genus Claoxylon. 3aMercurialis 0aClaoxylopsis 0aDiscoclaoxylon 0aErythrococca 0aLobanilia 0aMicrococca1 aVAN WELZEN, PETER C.1 aBaas, P.1 aVAN HEUVEN, BERTIE J.0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2008 Mar., v. 156, no. 3 p.445-457dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2007.00757.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03650naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001300181245010900194300001800303500002400321506007600345520238300421506003702804650002702841650002502868650001302893650001402906650001002920650002202930650002502952650002202977650001402999700002503013773013703038852000903175856008003184655001203264IND4409632620221207143039.0080829e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440963262DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00951-082doi7 aPMC25466142pmcid7 a185869692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Dong10aSequence Diversity of Bacillus thuringiensis Flagellin (H Antigen) Protein at the Intra-H Serotype Level  ap. 5524-5532.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Bacillus thuringiensis, the hag gene encodes flagellin, the protein responsible for eliciting the immunological reaction in H serotyping. Specific flagellin amino acid sequences have been correlated to specific B. thuringiensis H serotypes, H1 to H67. Ten H serotypes, however, contain three or more antigenic subfactors, labeled a, b, c, d, or e, and have been subdivided into 23 serovars. In the present study, we set out to analyze the sequence diversity of flagellins among serovars from the same H serotypes. We studied the hag genes in 39 B. thuringiensis strains representing the 23 serovars from the 10 H serotypes mentioned above. A serovar and a biovar from an 11th H serotype were also included. The hag genes were amplified and cloned and their nucleotide sequences were determined and translated into amino acid sequences, or the sequences were retrieved directly from GenBank when available. Strains of the H3 serotype contained two or three copies of the fla gene, an ortholog of the hag gene. Strains of the H6 serotype contained three copies. Strains of all other H serotypes each contained a single copy of the hag gene. Alignments of amino acid sequences from all copies in all strains of the H3 serotype revealed short signature sequences, GGAG and SGG, GPDPDDAVKNLT, and DITTTK, that appeared to be specific to the H3c, H3d, and H3e antigenic subfactors, respectively. Similar short signature sequences, GDIT, AFIK, TSAGKA, and SAPSKG, were revealed for H8b, H8c, H20b, and H20c, respectively. Amino acid sequences in the flagellin central variable region were highly conserved among serovars of the H3, H5, H11, and H20 serotypes and much more divergent among serovars of the H4, H10, H18, H24, and H28 serotypes. Two bootstrapped neighbor-joining trees were respectively generated from the alignments of the amino acid sequences translated from all copies of the hag genes in the B. thuringiensis strains of the H3 and H6 serotypes. Sequence identities and relationships were revealed. A third bootstrapped neighbor-joining tree was generated, this one from the alignment of the flagellin amino acid sequences from all the B. thuringiensis strains in the study. Eight clusters, I to VIII, were revealed. Although most clusters contained strains and serovars from the same H serotype, clusters VII and VIII contained serovars from different H serotypes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aamino acid sequences 3aantigens 3aflagellin 3agenes 3amolecular cloning 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3aserotypes1 aCôté, Jean-Charles0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 74, no. 17 p.5524-5532dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00951-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02622naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245017600174300001600350500002400366520148800390650001201878650002301890650002301913650002201936653002601958653002001984700002202004773012502026852000902151856009202160930003302252946001102285655001202296IND4401854620221118064522.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2007.00774.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDAVILA, YVONNE C.10aVariation in native pollinators in the absence of honeybees: implications for reproductive success of an Australian generalist-pollinated herb Trachymene incisa (Apiaceae)  ap. 479-490.  aIncludes references  aMost plants are generalist in terms of pollination, with the potential for significant spatial and temporal variation in their pollinators. Few studies have investigated how variable pollinators are in a generalist pollination system or how this variation affects plant reproduction. We investigated the degree of variation in pollinators and resulting reproductive success among populations of a widespread generalist-pollinated herb, Trachymene incisa (Apiaceae). The European honeybee was unexpectedly absent from the pollinator assemblages, providing the unique opportunity to study the native Australian pollinators. Insect visitation rates and the taxonomic composition of the pollinator assemblage varied significantly across populations, indicating that populations of T. incisa are not equally serviced and are not equally generalist. This highlights that sampling one population would not characterize the extent of species generalization. There was no positive correlation between insect visitation rate and reproductive success, with the Agnes Banks population receiving the highest visitation rate but producing the lowest reproductive output, and the Myall Lakes population receiving the lowest visitation rate and producing the highest seedling emergence. This study shows that variation in pollinators can have measurable effects on populations of generalist-pollinated plants, therefore there is potential for large-scale change in all plant-pollinator interactions. 3aApiales 3ainsect pollination 3aseedling emergence 3aspatial variation 0apollinator assemblage 0aseed production1 aWARDLE, GLENDA M.0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2008 Mar., v. 156, no. 3 p.479-490dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2007.00774.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080224b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02877naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009100165300001600256520147700272650001801749650002801767650001701795650002501812650003801837650002601875650001301901650002101914650003101935650001001966650001401976650001401990650001202004650001902016650002602035650001402061653002402075653003102099653002002130700001702150773010202167852000902269856008502278930003302363946001102396655001202407IND4394226220221118064730.0070819e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439422622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-007-0933-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuczkowski, G. 10aProtein marking reveals predation on termites by the woodland ant, Aphaenogaster rudis  ap. 219-224.  aSubterranean termites provide a major potential food source for forest-dwelling ants, yet the interactions between ants and termites are seldom investigated largely due to the cryptic nature of both the predator and the prey. We used protein marking (rabbit immunoglobin protein, IgG) and double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) to examine the trophic interactions between the woodland ant, Aphaenogaster rudis (Emery) and the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar). We marked the prey by feeding the termites paper treated with a solution of rabbit immunoglobin protein (IgG). Subsequently, we offered live, IgG-fed termites to ant colonies and monitored the intracolony distribution of IgG-marked prey. Laboratory experiments on the distribution of protein-marked termite prey in colonies of A. rudis revealed that all castes and developmental stages receive termite prey within 24 h. In field experiments, live, protein-marked termites were offered to foraging ants. Following predation, the marker was recovered from the ants, demonstrating that A. rudis preys on R. flavipes under field conditions. Our results provide a unique picture of the trophic-level interactions between predatory ants and subterranean termites. Furthermore, we show that protein markers are highly suitable to track trophic interactions between predators and prey, especially when observing elusive animals with cryptic food-web ecology. 3aAphaenogaster 3aReticulitermes flavipes 3aant colonies 3adevelopmental stages 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afield experimentation 3aforaging 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alaboratory experimentation 3apaper 3apredation 3apredators 3arabbits 3asocial insects 3asubterranean termites 3awoodlands 0aAphaenogaster rudis 0aprey-predator interactions 0aprotein marking1 aBennett, G. 0 tInsectes sociaux.g2007 Aug., v. 54, no. 3 p.219-224dBasel : Birkhäuser-Verlagx0020-18127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-007-0933-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070819b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02501naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009600164300001700260520145400277653000801731653001301739653001401752700001701766700002301783700002001806700002001826700002501846700002101871700002501892700001801917773011101935852000902046856008502055946001102140655001202151IND4443709320221118064545.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444370932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00535-010-0245-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobori, Ayako 10aInterleukin-33 expression is specifically enhanced in inflamed mucosa of ulcerative colitis  ap. 999-1007.  aBackground Interleukin (IL)-33 is a cytokine belonging to the IL-1 family. IL-33 has been shown to elicit a Th2-like cytokine response in immune cells. In this study, we investigated IL-33 expression in the inflamed mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and characterized the molecular mechanisms responsible for IL-33 expression in human colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts (SEMFs). Methods IL-33 mRNA expression was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). IL-33 expression in the IBD mucosa was evaluated by immunohistochemical methods. Results IL-33 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in active lesions from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but was not detected in inactive lesions from UC patients or in lesions from patients with either active or inactive Crohn's disease. Colonic SEMFs were identified as a major source of IL-33 in the mucosa. IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) significantly enhanced IL-33 mRNA and protein expression in isolated colonic SEMFs. IL-1β and TNF-α did not affect IL-33 expression in intestinal epithelial cell lines (HT-29 and Caco-2 cells). This IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced IL-33 mRNA expression was mediated by p42/44 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway-dependent activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB and activator protein (AP)-1. Conclusions IL-33, derived from colonic SEMFs, may play an important role in the pathophysiology of UC. 0aIBD 0aCytokine 0aBiomarker1 aYagi, Yuhki 1 aImaeda, Hirotsugu 1 aBan, Hiromitsu 1 aBamba, Shigeki 1 aTsujikawa, Tomoyuki 1 aSaito, Yasuharu 1 aFujiyama, Yoshihide 1 aAndoh, Akira 0 tJournal of gastroenterology.g2010 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.999-1007dJapan : Springer Japanx0944-11747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00535-010-0245-13Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02126naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245008600162300001600248520107900264650001601343650001701359653002001376653001801396653001601414653002501430700002201455700002101477700001701498773013301515852000901648856008501657930003301742946001301775655001201788IND4447752220221118064414.0110121e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444775222DNAL7 a10.1134/S10630740100600762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImbs, A.

Analysis of the distribution of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) among the zooxanthellae and the host organism showed that 18: 3n-6 and C₁₈₋₂₂ PUFAs of the n-3 series (18: 4n-3, 20: 5n-3, 22: 5n-3, and 22: 6n-3) were mainly synthesized by the zooxanthellae and that C₂₀₋₂₂ PUFAs of the n-6 series (20: 3n-6, 20: 4n-6, and 22: 4n-6) were synthesized in the polyp tissue. Soft coral polyps were able to synthesize tetracosapolyenoic FAs (24: 5n-6 and 24: 6n-3) and 18: 2n-7, their zooxanthellae synthesized C₁₆ PUFAs (16: 2n-7, 16: 3n-4, and 16: 4n-1). It is supposed that the biosynthesis of 16: 2n-7 in Sinularia sp. and 18: 3n-6 in Acropora sp. is catalyzed by Δ6 desaturase. The relatively even distribution of three FAs (18: 2n-6, 18: 3n-6, and 16: 2n-7) among lipids of zooxanthellae and coral polyps indicates the possible transport of these FAs between symbionts and the host organism. 3afatty acids 3abiosynthesis 0alipid transport 0azooxanthellae 0asoft corals 0areef-building corals1 aYakovleva, I.

Numerical modeling of the flow structures surrounding these obstructions is challenging, yet it represents an important tool for aquatic habitat assessment. In this study, the ability of two- (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) computational fluid dynamics models to reproduce these localized complex flow features is examined. The 3-D model is validated with laboratory data obtained from the literature for the case of a flow around a hemisphere under emergent and submerged conditions. The performance of the 2-D and 3-D models is then evaluated by comparing the numerical results with field measurements of flow around several boulders located at a reach of the Smith River, a regulated mountainous stream, obtained at base and peak flows. Close agreement between measured values and the velocity profiles predicted by the two models is obtained outside the wakes behind the hemisphere and boulders. However, the results suggest that in the vicinity of these obstructions the 3-D model is better suited for reproducing the circulation flow behavior at both low and high discharges. Application of the 2-D and 3-D models to meso-scale stream flows of ecological significance is furthermore demonstrated by using a recently developed spatial hydraulic metric to quantify flow complexity surrounding a number of brown trout spawning sites. It is concluded that the 3-D model can provide a much more accurate description of the heterogeneous velocity patterns favored by many aquatic species over a broad range of flows, especially under deep flow conditions when the various obstructions are submerged. Issues pertaining to selection of appropriate models for a variety of flow regimes and potential implication of the 3-D model on the development of better habitat suitability criteria are discussed. The research suggests ways of improving the modeling practices for ecosystem management studies. 3atopography 3asimulation models 3astream flow 3astream channels 3arocks 3ahydrologic models 0amathematical models 0athree-dimensional computational fluid dynamics models 0acomputational fluid dynamics 0airregular stream channel topography 0atwo-dimensional computational fluid dynamics motdels1 aDiplas, Panayiotis0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 348, no. 1-2 p.195-214dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.09.0603Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle01666naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002000158245003400178300001600212520042900228650000900657650001600666650001600682650002100698650002500719650002000744650001400764650001200778650001200790650001300802650001600815650000900831650000900840650001600849650001100865650001300876650003200889650001900921653002400940773007300964852000901037856007901046930003301125945001301158946001301171655001201184IND2202188420221118064516.0000111e199906  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220218842DNAL7 a104381222pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.6.8072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStadelman, W.J.14aThe incredibly functional egg  ap. 807-811.  aA review of some of the old and newer uses of eggs.

In order to assess the extent of environmental impacts due to establishment of the Integrated Industrial Estate—Pantnagar (IIE-Pantnagar), ambient air and groundwater were monitored from June 2007 to May 2008. Collected baseline information was normalized and interpreted with the application of air (AQI) and water quality indices (WQI). Among the pre-identified air pollutants, suspended particulate matter was found to be the principal culprit to deteriorate ambient air quality, with a maximum annual concentration of 418.5 μg/m³. Monthly average concentrations of respirable particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter < 10 μm) also persist at a critical level with an annual maximum of 207.3 μg/m³. A segmented linear function with maximum operator concept was used to compute AQI, and the developed index was found well suitable to demonstrate temporal variations of ambient air quality. The computed AQI value for the selected study region varied from moderate (97.0) to very poor pollution level (309.2) in respect to developed air quality standards. Furthermore, an integrated WQI was developed comprising 9 parameters, and among all the 10 pre-identified locations, the average groundwater quality was found acceptable in terms of Indian drinking water standards. The maximum WQI (70.6) was found at the Kichha Railway Station during summer months, revealing moderate pollution load. Industrial discharge from IIE-Pantnagar coupled with other industrial setup may hold responsible for such kind of degradation of water quality. In contrast, WQI computed at Rudrapur City demonstrate minimum (15.0-22.1) pollution load. For 95% of the monitoring period, the computed WQI was found acceptable for all selected locations with few exceptions. The application of WQI to assess temporal variations in groundwater quality was therefore found satisfactory. 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3agroundwater 3aindustrialization 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apollution load 3arailroads 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awater quality 0aAir quality index 0aMaximum operator 0aTemporal variations 0aWater quality index1 aSrivastava, Rajeev Kumar 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2011 Jan., v. 172, no. 1-4 p.547-560dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1353-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02607naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001900176245010500195300001600300500002400316500001500340520119300355650001901548650002201567650002201589650002401611650003701635650002101672650001601693650002701709650002801736651001001764653002401774653001801798700001901816700001401835700001501849773009401864852000901958856008901967930003302056945002502089946001102114655001202125IND4401997220221118064821.0080227e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440199722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ800 0aP200 0aX1001 aPandey, Ashish10aRunoff and sediment yield modeling from a small agricultural watershed in India using the WEPP model  ap. 305-319.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) watershed model was calibrated and validated for a small hilly watershed (Karso) of India. Sensitivity analysis of the model was carried out for the input parameters. The analysis shows that the sediment yield is highly sensitive to interrill erodibility and effective hydraulic conductivity, whereas, runoff is sensitive to effective hydraulic conductivity only. Initially, the model was calibrated using data from the 1996 monsoon season and subsequently its performance was evaluated by estimating the daily runoff and sediment yield using the monsoon season data of different years. Coefficient of determination (R ²) (0.86-0.91), Nash-Sutcliffe simulation model efficiency (0.85-0.95), and percent deviation values (7.90-15.15) indicate accurate simulation of runoff from the watershed. Performance of the WEPP model for simulation of sediment yield was also evaluated. High value of coefficient of determination (R ²) (0.81-0.95), Nash-Sutcliffe simulation model efficiency (0.78-0.92) and percent deviation values (4.43-19.30) for sediment yield indicate that the WEPP model can be successfully used in the upper Damodar Valley, India. 3asediment yield 3asimulation models 3ainterrill erosion 3aagricultural runoff 3aWater Erosion Prediction Project 3amodel validation 3aerodibility 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aagricultural watersheds 3aIndia 0amathematical models 0awater erosion1 aChowdary, V.M.1 aMal, B.C.1 aBillib, M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 348, no. 3-4 p.305-319dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.10.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03124naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002300167245009400190300001600284500002400300500001500324520187400339650002302213650001602236650002502252650002102277650001302298650000902311650001302320650002202333651001602355653001502371653001702386700002602403773009402429852000902523856008902532930003302621945002502654946001102679655001202690IND4401997120221118064704.0080227e20080115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440199712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aVissers, Marc J.M.14aThe stability of groundwater flow systems in unconfined sandy aquifers in the Netherlands  ap. 292-304.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGroundwater flow is temporally variable and uncertain, due to climatologically or anthropogenically induced variation in boundary conditions that result in changes in the drainage network, and uncertainties in hydraulic model parameters used in the quantification of groundwater flow. The quantification and mapping of the variation and uncertainty in groundwater flow is especially essential in relatively flat areas where flow direction is sensitive to decimetre-scale head variations. In these areas, the variability and uncertainty of groundwater flow directions may therefore have important implications for the uncertainties in the spatial configuration of groundwater flow systems. In this study we aim to quantify and map the sensitivity of shallow groundwater flow systems to uncertainties in aquifer anisotropy and drainage resistance, and variations in drainage level and groundwater recharge for a sandy unconfined aquifer in the Salland region, the Netherlands. For this purpose, the most probable configuration of current groundwater flow systems was mapped using particle tracking and Monte Carlo analysis. Sensitivity was represented by the membership of each model cell to the defined groundwater flow systems given the uncertainties and variations in the hydraulic parameters and boundary conditions. In addition, the current configuration of groundwater flow systems was compared to the historical situation without artificial drainage. The average groundwater flow system size was found to be in the order of a few square kilometres, with a relatively stable configuration. In contrast to the intrinsic and temporally invariant hydraulic parameters, which were shown to have a minor influence on the spatial configuration of groundwater flow systems, natural variation in recharge and variations in drainage level management exert a large influence. 3aMonte Carlo method 3asandy soils 3agroundwater recharge 3agroundwater flow 3aaquifers 3asand 3adrainage 3ahydrologic models 3aNetherlands 0aanisotropy 0ahydrogeology1 aPerk, Marcel van der.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Jan. 15, v. 348, no. 3-4 p.292-304dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.10.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02151naa a2200541 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245008200151300001600233300002100249520059900270650001800869650001300887650001900900650002200919650001200941650001700953650002000970650001000990650002801000650002101028650003501049650001101084650002001095650003101115650002501146650002001171650001101191650002901202650002901231650001501260650003701275650001401312650006501326653002701391700002801418700002201446773006601468852000901534939003301543945000801576946001301584655001201597991630855090742620221118064710.0840327e198303  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840046282DNAL7 a63037262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKühl, Claus.10aGuar gum and glycemic control of pregnant insulin-dependent diabetic patients  ap. 152-154.  ap. 152-154. ill.  aA 3-week study assessed whether the addition of guar gum (an unabsorbable carbohydrate) to the diet of 12 pregnant, insulin-dependent diabetic women (ages 21-33) improved their metabolic glycemic control.

Between 60 and 67% of consumers prepared poultry once or twice per week. A majority of Hispanics (57%), minors (79%) and uneducated (55%) respondents thaw poultry outside of the refrigerator, either on a counter, in a microwave, or in a sink or water. A majority of Caucasians receive food safety information from either magazines (52%) or television (60%), whereas minors receive education mainly from the educational system (57%) or family (71%). Through increased education in these areas, good food safety habits may be increased in those target groups, especially the next generation of consumers. 3apoultry meat 3afood safety 3ahome food preparation 3aquestionnaires 3adiffusion 3ainformation dissemination 3amass media 3aeducation 3anationalities and ethnic groups 2aAnimals 2aData Collection 2aEducation 2aEthnicity. 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aFood Handling 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aPoultry 2aPublic Opinion 2aUrban Population 3aTexas 0aTexas 0anewspapers 0amagazines1 aRicke, S.C.1 aBirkhold, S.G.0 tPoultry science.g1999 June, v. 78, no. 6 p.833-840x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.6.8333Available from publisher's Web site  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03223naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245008600176300001600262500001500278520161000293650001101903650001401914650001001928650002501938650002301963650001601986650002402002650001302026650002702039650001402066650001902080650001602099650001702115650002302132650002102155650001202176650004602188650001102234650001402245650000902259650002702268650002302295650002802318653001302346653001202359653002402371653001802395773007302413852000902486856007902495930003302574945001302607946001302620655001202633IND2201269820221118064736.0991025e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220126982DNAL7 a100902732pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.3.4442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbato, G.F.10aGenetic relationships between selection for growth and reproductive effectiveness  ap. 444-452.  a2019-12-04  aThe domestic and international poultry industries have gone through many changes over the last 50 yr. One constant in the meat-type poultry industry has been the emphasis on genetic improvement of growth. Using lines from a double, divergent selection experiment, data are presented on the genetic relationships between growth to different ages and reproductive parameters. During the last three generations of selection an in vitro sperm binding assay was used and evaluated for its usefulness in a selection program for growth-related phenotypes. Growth to different ages can have markedly different genetic architecture, compared to evaluating body weight at a fixed age. Growth is a nonlinear phenomenon and should be evaluated as such within the context of a genetics program. Fertility is positively correlated with growth to 14 d of age (EGR(14)), but negatively correlated with growth to 42 d of age (EGR(42)). This difference is primarily due to the high, negative correlation between exponential growth from 14 to 42 d of age (EGR(14/42)) and reproductive phenotypes. Roosters were also evaluated with an in vitro sperm binding assay, which is highly correlated with fertility. The genetic architecture of the sperm binding assay was very similar to that of fertility, with an additive genetic correlation of 0.75. Further, it was shown that culling the worst 25% roosters on the basis of the sperm binding assay would have very little effect on the growth performance of the resulting progeny, yet increased the number of chicks produced per rooster by 10 to 25% (depending upon the population) 3aweight 3aheterosis 3atesta 3acorrelated responses 3aselection response 3abody weight 3agenetic correlation 3aroosters 3aphenotypic correlation 3abioassays 3amale fertility 3aspermatozoa 3aheritability 3aselection criteria 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aMale 2aReproductionxgenetics 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSperm-Ovum Interactions 0achickens 0aculling 0asperm-binding assay 0abroiler lines0 tPoultry science.g1999 Mar., v. 78, no. 3 p.444-452x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.3.4443Available from publisher's Web site  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02092naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245016500151300001600316300003000332520068100362650001801043650002201061650001801083650000901101650002801110650005201138650002001190650005101210650004201261650004601303650001801349650001101367650001901378650000901397650001601406653001901422700002001441700001701461700001501478773006601493852000901559939003301568945000801601946001301609655001201622991630854550742620221118064841.0840509e198309  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840047852DNAL7 a64007012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuttall, F.Q.14aThe Glycemic effect of different meals approximately isocaloric and similar in protein, carbohydrate, and fat content as calculated using the ADA exchange lists  ap. 432-435.  ap. 432-435. ill., charts.  aThe effect on plasma glucose concentration of 4 different, approximately isocaloric breakfasts designed using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) food exchange lists in 8 type II diabetics was studied.

Set 1 comprises the oldest NNE-SSW and NW-SE trending tensile lineaments, Set 2 is N-S and WNW-ESE and Set 3 is NE-SW and ENE-WSW. Both Set 2 and Set 3 are conjugate shear fractures. Frequency of groundwater occurrence (producing wells close to fracture lineaments), well yield and distance or locations of well data from the fractures are the main parameters considered in the analysis using geographic information systems (GIS). In the Set 2 and Set 3 shear fractures, well yields at distances of 0-60m to lineaments are low while well yields at a distance of about 90-120m away from the major lineaments are high. In the NNE-SSW fractures of Set 1, well yields at distances of 0-60m from the major fractures are high but much lower than the highest well yields in the shear fractures at about 90-120m. The relationship between well yield and distance to fracture lineaments in the three sets of fractures indicates that both of the shear fractures are hydrotectonically more significant than the tensile fractures. Of the shear fractures the N-S trending Set 2 lineaments are relatively the most important in terms of groundwater potential. The data summarized in a conceptual hydrotectonic model can be used as a working reference in selecting potential sites for future groundwater exploration in the region. Although drilling sites can be designed within the optimum distances, for example, 90m distance, along the N-S trending fractures, supplementary detailed geophysical investigations should be carried out prior to drilling. The lineament analysis using GIS thus provides a means for scaling down target areas and design cost-effective and successful groundwater exploration programmes. 3ahighlands 3agroundwater 3aaquifers 3arocks 3ageographic information systems 3aremote sensing 3aLandsat 3athematic maps 3awells 3aEritrea 0ahydrotectonics 0agroundwater exploration1 aGhebreab, Woldai0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Jan. 30, v. 349, no. 1-2 p.147-155dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.10.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20080623b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02624naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002400176245007500200300001200275500002400287500001500311520123900326650002201565650002301587650001601610650002101626650002201647650001901669650001701688650001601705650002201721650001601743651001201759653002401771653001401795700002401809700001901833700002101852773009001873852000901963856008901972930003302061945002502094946001102119655001202130IND4401999320221118064807.0080227e20080130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440199932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aM500 0aX1001 aSzilágyi, József.10aOn diurnal riparian zone groundwater-level and streamflow fluctuations  ap. 1-5.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGribovszki et al. (Gribovszki, Z., Kalicz, P., Szilagyi, J., Kucsara, M., 2008. Riparian zone evapotranspiration estimation from diurnal groundwater-level fluctuations. J. Hydrol.) recently reported a peculiar phase-shift in diurnal streamflow and riparian zone groundwater-level fluctuations during streamflow recession for a small forested watershed. Employing high-frequency (10min) groundwater-level and streamflow measurements in a wooded riparian zone of a gaining stream they demonstrated that groundwater-level changes lagged behind that of streamflow changes by about 1-1.5h. To check the validity of their claim, a 2D finite element numerical model of the coupled system of vadose and saturated zones was employed with diurnal fluctuations in evapotranspiration. The model successfully reproduced the reported phase-shift and produced diurnal groundwater and streamflow fluctuations similar in their characteristics to what was reported. This finding demonstrates that by observing a similar phase-shift in diurnal fluctuations between high-frequency streamflow rate (or stream stage) and groundwater-level measurements during recession flow conditions, does not, in itself, indicate that the stream section is a losing one. 3asimulation models 3aevapotranspiration 3astream flow 3ariparian forests 3adiurnal variation 3ariparian areas 3ahydrogeology 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3awater table 3aHungary 0amathematical models 0ahydrology1 aGribovszki, Zoltán1 aKalicz, Péter1 aKucsara, Mihály0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Jan. 30, v. 349, no. 1-2 p.1-5dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.09.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle01800naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001600158245006100174300001600235520053600251650002000787650001100807650001500818650001200833650002700845650002000872650002500892650001800917650001200935650002200947650003100969650003301000650004601033650001201079650002101091653002301112773007201135852000901207856007901216930003301295945001301328946001301341655001201354IND2201874320221118064756.0991207e199905  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220187432DNAL7 a102289702pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.5.7292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBandman, E.10aFunctional properties of myosin isoforms in avian muscle  ap. 729-734.  aSarcomeric myosin is the major skeletal muscle protein and is encoded by a large and complex multigene family whose members are differentially expressed in developing and adult muscle cells.

During the present study, we evaluated the effect of preslaughter feed withdrawal on the presence of Salmonella in the crops of broilers from nine commercial broiler flocks reared in individual growout houses. Crops were collected aseptically from 40 randomly selected broilers in each flock before feed removal and at the end of the feed withdrawal period, immediately before capture and transport to the processing plant. Similarly, the ceca were collected before and after feed withdrawal in six of the nine broiler flocks. The presence of Salmonella in the crops and ceca was determined by enrichment culture in tetrathionate broth followed by culture on brilliant green agar. The incidence of Salmonella in crop contents increased significantly (P < 0.05) in five of the nine flocks during feed withdrawal. The total number of Salmonella contaminated crops from all nine flocks increased significantly (P < 0.005) from 7/360 (1.9%) before feed removal to 36/359 (10.0%) at the end of feed withdrawal. The increased incidence of Salmonella in the crop contents was associated with an increased tendency of the broilers to consume contaminated rearing house litter during feed withdrawal. The incidence of Salmonella in the ceca increased nonsignificantly from 14/240 (5.8%) before feed removal to 19/240 (7.9%) at the end of feed withdrawal. The results indicate that the incidence of Salmonella crop contamination may increase as much as fivefold during preslaughter feed withdrawal and represent a critical preharvest control point in reducing Salmonella entry into the processing plant. 3abroiler chickens 3aSalmonella 3acecum 3astarvation 3aduration 3adigesta 3apoultry manure 3amicrobial contamination 3alitter (bedding) 2aAnimals 2aCecumxmicrobiology 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aCrop, Avianxmicrobiology 2aFood Deprivation 2aFood Handling 2aFood Microbiology 2aSalmonella enteritidisxisolation & purification 0acrop1 aByrd, J.A.1 aHargis, B.M.1 aHume, M.E.1 aBailey, R.H.1 aStanker, L.H.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Jan., v. 78, no. 1 p.45-49x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.1.453Available from publisher's Web site  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01973naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001400159245005800173300001800231520045500249650000900704650002300713650002300736650001400759650001800773650002000791650001800811650000900829650002400838650001400862650002100876650002000897650004000917650001900957650001200976650002100988650002301009650001601032650001101048650001601059650002301075653002301098653001401121653001101135653002001146700001601166773007601182852000901258856008101267930003301348945001301381946001301394655001201407IND2199018320221118064633.0990601e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219901832DNAL7 a98725792pmid7 a10.1093/ps/77.12.17812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuir, Wm.10aImproving animal well-being through genetic selection  ap. 1781-1788.  aThis paper reviews the possibilities of adapting laying hens to cages by means of genetic selection.

Ninety-six mixed sex broilers were electrically stunned and slaughtered. Half the carcasses were electrically stimulated during bleeding and half were not. Forequarters were harvested immediately after chilling and after 2, 4, and 6 h postchill. Left forequarters were marinated in salt solution and right forequarters in salt solution plus sodium tripolyphosphate. After marination, the quarters were cooked. Yield and meat pH were evaluated immediately after marinating; and color, yield, and cooking loss were evaluated after cooking. Electrical stimulation resulted in a decline in muscle pH for the 0 postchill group. The pH of muscles from unstimulated and stimulated carcasses from the remainder of the postchill times were equivalent. Phosphate treatment increased pH at all postchill times. Electrical stimulation of the marinated quarters increased cooking loss and decreased yield regardless of marinade composition. Both cooking loss and yield were superior for forequarters harvested at 0 or 2 h postchill compared to those harvested at 4 or 6 h postchill. The phosphate improved moisture binding regardless of electrical treatment or time of harvest. Color values of cooked muscles were unaffected by marination time, but the phosphate-treated muscles had higher b* (yellowness) values than controls. Shear values of unstimulated carcasses that received phosphate treatment were 35% greater than those that received no phosphate treatment. When the carcasses were electrically stimulated, the toughening effect of the phosphate was eliminated. 3abroiler chickens 3achicken meat 3abreast muscle 3apolyphosphates 3apH 3apostmortem changes 3amarinating 3ayields 3ameat quality 3atenderizing 3acolor 3ashear strength 2aAnimals 2aChickens 2aCooking 2aElectric Stimulation 2aFemale 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Technology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiology 2aPolyphosphates 0aaging 0aelectrical stimulation1 aBuhr, R.J.1 aLyon, C.E.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.267-271x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.2.2673Available from publisher's Web site  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02543naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008900166300001600255520086000271650001401131650001901145650001101164650002701175653001301202653001401215653002301229700002401252700002101276700002301297700002201320700002201342700002301364700002101387700002101408700001801429700002401447700002001471700001901491700002301510700002501533700002501558700002101583700002501604700002401629700002001653700002801673700002301701773011501724852000901839856008501848939003301933946001101966655001201977IND4449627520221118064603.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444962752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10552-010-9717-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoffetta, Paolo 10aCohorts and consortia conference: a summary report (Banff, Canada, June 17-19, 2009)  ap. 463-468.  aEpidemiologic studies have adapted to the genomics era by forming large international consortia to overcome issues of large data volume and small sample size. Whereas both cohort and well-conducted case-control studies can inform disease risk from genetic susceptibility, cohort studies offer the additional advantages of assessing lifestyle and environmental exposure-disease time sequences often over a life course. Consortium involvement poses several logistical and ethical issues to investigators, some of which are unique to cohort studies, including the challenge to harmonize prospectively collected lifestyle and environmental exposures validly across individual studies. An open forum to discuss the opportunities and challenges of large-scale cohorts and their consortia was held in June 2009 in Banff, Canada, and is summarized in this report. 3aneoplasms 3acohort studies 3aethics 3amolecular epidemiology 0aBiobanks 0aConsortia 0aData harmonization1 aColditz, Graham A. 1 aPotter, John D. 1 aKolonel, Laurence 1 aRobson, Paula J. 1 aMalekzadeh, Reza 1 aSeminara, Daniela 1 aGoode, Ellen L. 1 aYoo, Keun-Young 1 aDemers, Paul 1 aGallagher, Richard 1 aPrentice, Ross 1 aYasui, Yutaka 1 aO'Doherty, Kieran 1 aPetersen, Gloria M. 1 aUlrich, Cornelia M. 1 aCsizmadi, Ilona 1 aAmankwah, Ernest K. 1 aBrockton, Nigel T. 1 aKopciuk, Karen 1 aMcGregor, S.

At 14 d of age, male and female broiler chicks were sham-operated (SHAM, n = 27), or pulmonary hypertension was initiated by occluding one extrapulmonary primary bronchus (BRONCHUS CLAMP, n = 57). Lead II ECG and BW were recorded on Days 28 (ECG1) and 42 (ECG2), necropsies were conducted on all birds dying after Day 28, and final necropsies were conducted on Day 49. Data collected at necropsy included the presence (ASCITIC) or absence (NONASCITIC) of ascites, sex, and ventricular weights for calculating the right:total ventricular weight ratio (RV:TV), which serves as a reliable index of pulmonary hypertension. In each bird, three consecutive ECG1 and ECG2 wave cycles were quantified for both amplitude and duration of the following wave segments: Rb-R, R-S, S-R', R'-R'b, and S-T. The S wave amplitude was calculated by subtracting R-S from Rb-R and heart rate (HR) was measured from the peak of one T wave to the peak of the next. In the majority of comparisons, ASCITIC and BRONCHUS CLAMP broilers had larger S, R'-R'b, and S-T amplitudes, longer R-S, R'-R'b, and S-T durations, and a slower HR than NONASCITIC and SHAM broilers, regardless of sex. The differences in ECG wave forms and durations between ASCITIC and NONASCITIC broilers were greater on Day 42 (ECG2) than on Day 28 (ECG1), but when both ECG were used to develop a regression equation to estimate RV:TV, the R2 was 0.79. The most important Lead II ECG parameters associated with the development of ascites were an increasingly negative S wave amplitude and greater amplitudes and durations for R'-R'b and S-T as well as a decrease in the HR. 3abroiler chickens 3aascites 3ahypertension 3asurgery 3aelectrocardiography 3alungs 3agender differences 3abody weight 3aequations 2aAirway Obstructionxveterinary 2aAnimals 2aAscites 2aBronchixpathology 2aChickensxphysiology 2aElectrocardiographyxveterinary 2aFemale 2aHypertension, Pulmonaryxveterinary 2aMale 2aVentricular Function, Rightxphysiology 0aventricles1 aMcNew, R.W.1 aAnthony, N.B.1 aKirby, J.D.1 aMarson, N.E.1 aHughes, J.D.

The object of this study was to determine whether dehydration-induced proteins from wheat seeds could protect turkey sperm and improve survival and function after liquid storage. A partially purified heat-soluble protein extract was isolated from dry, mature wheat seed embryos and added to semen diluent. Hens were inseminated with either fresh or semen stored 24 h at 5 C and fertility and hatchability data collected. The addition of 10% wheat protein extract to semen stored 24 h at 5 C improved fertility and hatchability of eggs over semen stored in diluent alone (P < 0.05). The heat-soluble proteins isolated from wheat seed embryos are capable of protecting turkey sperm during in vitro storage and could potentially improve long-term storage of sperm from other species. 3adialysis 3aturkeys 3aadenosine triphosphate 3asolubility 3aspermatozoa 3awheat protein 3atemperature 3aegg hatchability 3aartificial insemination 3acold storage 3aadditives 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aDehydration 2aFertility 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aMale 2aPlant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSemen Preservation 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 2aTriticumxchemistry 2aTurkeysxphysiology 0asemen preservation 0asemen diluent additives 0aegg fertility1 aWalker-Simmons, M.K.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.235-241x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.2.2353Available from publisher's Web site  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03448naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245013700175300001600312520163000328650002101958650002501979650001402004650001602018650001802034650001702052650001602069650000902085650001602094650002002110650001402130650001602144650002302160650002102183650001202204650001202216650002102228650001002249650001602259650001202275650004002287650004802327650001102375650002802386650001002414650000902424650002802433650001202461653001202473653001202485653001702497700001602514700001802530700001802548773007302566852000902639856007902648930003302727945001302760946001302773655001202786IND2200825020221118064759.0990929e199902  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220082502DNAL7 a100510312pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.2.1972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaster, C.P.10aEffects of dietary roxarsone supplementation, lighting program, and season on the incidence of leg abnormalities in broiler chickens  ap. 197-203.  aTwo 4 X 2 factorial experiments were designed to test the effects of four diets, differing in anticoccidial programs and roxarsone (3-nitro-4-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid) content, and two lighting programs on the incidence of leg abnormalities in 56-d-old male and female broiler chickens. The four diets were: A) basal diet + salinomycin (60.0 g/ton); B) basal diet + salinomycin (60.0 g/ton) + roxarsone (45.4 g/ton); C) basal diet + roxarsone (45.4 g/ton) + live coccidial vaccine; and D) basal diet + live coccidial vaccine. The light treatments were: 1) restricted (R) [18 h light (L): 6 h dark (D)] and 2) standard (S) [23L:1D]. The respective experiments were conducted during winter (Experiment 1, November to January) and summer (Experiment 2, June to August) growing conditions in the southeastern U.S. Light treatment had no significant (P > 0.10) effect on the incidence of leg abnormalities in either experiment. However, in Experiment 1, there was a light treatment by sex interaction; leg abnormalities were greater for males on Treatment R than Treatment S. In Experiment 2, females had a higher incidence of leg abnormalities than males (8.29 vs 4.73%). There was a diet by sex interaction for the incidence of leg abnormalities in Experiment 2, females had a greater incidence of leg abnormalities than males on Treatment A. In both experiments, the incidence was greater with dietary treatments containing roxarsone (P < 0.10). The percentage of leg abnormalities was greater in Experiment 2 than Experiment 1. Leg abnormalities were primarily due to fibrosis of the gastrocnemius tendons and tendon sheaths. 3abroiler chickens 3aabnormal development 3aroxarsone 3asalinomycin 3alive vaccines 3aleg weakness 3acoccidiosis 3alegs 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3amortality 3aphotoperiod 3agender differences 3asynovial sheaths 3amuscles 3atendons 3adyschondroplasia 3atibia 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHindlimbxabnormalities 2aLight 2aMale 2aRoxarsonexpharmacology 2aSeasons 0alesions 0arupture 0agastronemius1 aHoerr, F.J.1 aBilgili, S.F.1 aKincaid, S.A.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Feb., v. 78, no. 2 p.197-203x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.2.1973Available from publisher's Web site  a19991031b19991104c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03480naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139072000900157072000900166072000900175100002200184245015100206300001600357500002400373500001500397520132500412650002501737650002301762650002201785650002201807650001401829650002301843650002501866650001001891650002501901650002701926650002701953650002201980650003502002650003502037650002402072650001202096650001802108650003802126650003302164650003702197650003102234650002802265650001402293653001302307653002802320653003302348653001602381653001602397700002602413700001902439700002202458773015602480852000902636856007802645930003302723945002502756946001302781655001202794IND4401918020221118064746.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440191802DNAL7 a181635272pmid7 a10.1002/arch.202292doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL200 0aL0011 aKozaki, Toshinori10aComparison of two acetylcholinesterase gene cDNAs of the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus, in insecticide susceptible and resistant strains  ap. 130-138.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo cDNAs encoding different acetylcholinesterase (AChE) genes (AdAce1 and AdAce2) were sequenced and analyzed from the lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus. Both AdAce1 and AdAce2 were highly similar (95 and 93% amino acid identity, respectively) with the Ace genes of Tribolium castaneum. Both AdAce1 and AdAce2 have the conserved residues characteristic of AChE (catalytic triad, intra-disulfide bonds, and so on). Partial cDNA sequences of the Alphitobius Ace genes were compared between two tetrachlorvinphos resistant (Kennebec and Waycross) and one susceptible strain of beetles. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected, but only one non-synonymous mutation was found (A271S in AdAce2). No SNPs were exclusively found in the resistant strains, the A271S mutation does not correspond to any mutations previously reported to alter sensitivity of AChE to organophosphates or carbamates, and the A271S was found only as a heterozygote in one individual from one of the resistant A. diaperinus strains. This suggests that tetrachlorvinphos resistance in the Kennebec and Waycross strains of A. diaperinus is not due to mutations in either AChE gene. The sequences of AdAce1 and AdAce2 provide new information about the evolution of these important genes in insects.

Blood loss during bleeding was measured in 30-s intervals for a total of 120 s. After conventional processing and chilling, carcass damage was subjectively evaluated. Results indicated that the birds stunned with electricity bled faster than the CO2-stunned birds until 60 s. However, the cumulative blood loss was not different after 90 s. Carcass damage evaluation indicated that birds stunned with CO2 had a significantly lower percentage of broken clavicles, and had fewer hemorrhages on the surface of the Pectoralis. However, there was no difference between the two stunning methods in the frequency of damage at the shoulder. In Experiment 2, 256 broilers were stunned using the same conditions as in Experiment 1. Measurements of pH, R-value, sarcomere length (SL), and fragmentation index (FI) were evaluated from the left breast fillets harvested at 0, 1, 2, and 6 h postmortem. Shear values (SV) were determined using the right fillets harvested at the same four postmortem times and aged on ice until 24 h. No significant difference in breast muscle pH value was observed at 0, 2, and 6 h postmortem. However, CO2-stunned fillets had significantly higher pH values than the ES fillets at 1 h postmortem. Carbon dioxide produced greater R values than electricity at 2 and 6 h. Sarcomere length, FI, and SV were not significantly different at any time tested. These data suggest that CO2 stunning reduced carcass damage but did not reduce the need for aging before deboning when compared to the electrical stunning method used. 3abroiler chickens 3aelectric current 3acarbon dioxide 3aslaughter 3ahemorrhage 3acarcass quality 3abone fractures 3abreast muscle 3apostmortem changes 3apH 3asarcomeres 3alength 3achicken meat 3ashear strength 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Dioxidexpharmacology 2aChickensxphysiology 2aElectroshock 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aHemorrhage 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aRigor Mortis 2aSarcomeresxultrastructure 0aaging 0astunning 0aexsanguination1 aSams, A.R.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Jan., v. 78, no. 1 p.139-143x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.1.1393Available from publisher's Web site  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03810naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002200158245017900180300001600359520200900375650002102384650001202405650001702417650001002434650001102444650002302455650001402478650002302492650002402515650001602539650001902555650002102574650001202595650004402607650003502651650001602686650005102702650003602753650002102789650001102810650006102821650000902882650001302891650003202904650002302936653001102959653001502970700001502985773007303000852000903073856007903082930003303161945001303194946001303207655001203220IND2201269020221118064207.0991025e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220126902DNAL7 a100902682pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.3.4042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWideman, R.F.

In the present study, the left pulmonary artery was chronically occluded in 295 male and 255 female chicks pedigreed from 18 sire families, leading to PHS in 74% of the males and 45% of the females. Survivors were reared to breeding age and served as parents for the resulting PHS-resistant chicks (Resistant), whereas control chicks were produced from the base population for this line (Base). In two experiments, male and female Resistant and Base chicks were reared separately by sex but mixed by group within environmental chambers, where they were exposed to cool (14 C) temperatures. In both experiments, the incidence of PHS was at least 50% lower in the Resistant males and females than in the Base males and females, respectively. When compared within a sex, the Base and Resistant broilers surviving to the end of both experiments did not differ in final body weight or body weight gain, nor did their right:total ventricular weight (RV:TV) ratios differ. These results demonstrate that broiler breeders capable of thriving after having their entire cardiac output forced to flow through one lung, subsequently produced male and female progeny with substantially improved resistance to the onset of PHS induced by fast growth and exposure to cool environmental temperatures. Fast growth and cool temperatures are primary triggers for PHS under most conditions of commercial broiler growout. In both experiments, final necropsies revealed higher RV:TV ratios in ascitic than in nonascitic broilers, whereas normalizing the left ventricle plus septum weight for differences in body weight generated similar values for ascitic and nonascitic males or females, respectively. These results support a primary role for pulmonary hypertension but not cardiomyopathy in the pathogenesis of ascites triggered by cool temperatures in both the Base and Resistant populations. 3abroiler chickens 3aascites 3ahypertension 3alungs 3aweight 3aselection criteria 3amortality 3agender differences 3aambient temperature 3abody weight 3acardiomyopathy 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aArterial Occlusive Diseasesxveterinary 2aAscitesxetiologyxveterinary. 2aBody Weight 2aCardiomyopathiesxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aChickensxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCold Temperature 2aFemale 2aHypertension, Pulmonaryxetiologyxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPedigree 2aPulmonary Arteryxpathology 2aSelection, Genetic 0aratios 0aventricles1 aFrench, H.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Mar., v. 78, no. 3 p.404-411x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.3.4043Available from publisher's Web site  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02827naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245006800175300001600243520149800259650001101757650002001768650001101788650002001799650002001819650002101839650001601860650002101876650001201897650002801909650001601937650003501953650002901988650002302017650001602040700001802056700001702074700001802091700001602109773007302125852000902198856007902207930003302286945001302319946001302332655001202345IND2201268520221118064233.0991025e199903  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220126852DNAL7 a100902662pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.3.3832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmmert, J.L.10aBioavailability of lysine from a liquid lysine source in chicks  ap. 383-386.  aTwo experiments were conducted to assess the bioavailability of lysine from a liquid lysine product (LLP; 60% lysine) relative to crystalline L-lysine(.)HCl. In the first experiment, four groups of five chicks were fed a lysine-deficient basal diet containing corn, soybean meal, and feather meal or the basal diet supplemented with 0.1 or 0.2% lysine from L-lysine(.)HCl or LLP from Day 8 to 22 posthatching.

Experiment 2 was conducted using a lysine-deficient basal diet containing corn, peanut meal, and feather meal, and all diets were fed to five groups of five chicks from Day 8 to 21 posthatching. Treatment additions again consisted of 0.1 or 0.2% lysine from L-lysine(.)HCl or LLP.

These data indicate that lysine from LLP is fully bioavailable relative to lysine from crystalline L-lysine(.)HCl, and could therefore be used as a source of lysine in practical poultry diets. 3achicks 3abioavailability 3alysine 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 3afeed supplements 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aLysinexpharmacokinetics 2aNutritional Status 2aWeight Gain1 aDouglas, M.W.1 aBoling, S.D.1 aParsons, C.M.1 aBaker, D.H.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Mar., v. 78, no. 3 p.383-386x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.3.3833Available from publisher's Web site  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03182naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002200158245014200180300001600322520149900338650002101837650001801858650001501876650001701891650001601908650002301924650001301947650001001960650000701970650001801977650001001995650001402005650001602019650001202035650003002047650002502077650001802102650003802120650001102158650003102169650002202200650000902222650000902231650002402240653001702264700002002281700001902301700001402320700002602334773007302360852000902433856007902442930003302521945001302554946001302567655001202580IND2201235720221118064239.0991022e199904  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220123572DNAL7 a102309112pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.4.5692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWal, P.G. van der14aThe effect of feed withdrawal on broiler blood glucose and nonesterified fatty acid levels, postmortem liver pH values, and carcass yield  ap. 569-573.  aFeed withdrawal should start 5 h before broilers are captured and transported to the processing plant. This practice results in a total feed withdrawal period of about 8 h before slaughter. To check observance of this period at the plant reliably, blood samples were collected at slaughter from broilers. These samples were analyzed for glucose and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA). Glucose levels decreased, whereas the amount of NEFA increased as a consequence of deprivation. It was found that the decrease in glucose was smaller than could be expected from data in the literature, whereas the level tended to rise again after longer deprivation periods. The increase of the NEFA was lower in males than in females, and the glucose: NEFA ratio also showed a difference between the sexes. Therefore, it was concluded that these blood metabolites were not suitable for use as an indicator of the duration of feed withdrawal. The estimation of liver pH seemed to be a more reliable indicator of the length of feed withdrawal. Longer periods of feed withdrawal resulted in higher ultimate liver pH values, which were 6.10 to 6.20 in full-fed broilers, increasing to 6.60 in livers from broilers deprived during longer withdrawal periods. Further research, however, is needed because broilers in the present study were exposed to minimal amounts of stress. Other carcass characteristics such as slaughter, evisceration, and oven-ready yields matched results previously described in the literature. 3abroiler chickens 3ablood glucose 3astarvation 3ablood lipids 3afatty acids 3agender differences 3aduration 3aliver 3apH 3acarcass yield 3awheat 2aAbattoirs 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aChickensxphysiology 2aEnergy Intake 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLiverxphysiology 2aMale 2aMeat 2aSex Characteristics 0awhole grains1 aReimert, H.G.M.1 aGoedhart, H.A.1 aEngel, B.1 aUijttenboogaart, T.G.0 tPoultry science.g1999 Apr., v. 78, no. 4 p.569-573x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/78.4.5693Available from publisher's Web site  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02685naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001900158245006700177300001600244500001500260520069800275650001300973650002600986650002301012650001001035650001701045650001001062650002001072650001101092650002501103650001001128650002401138650001501162650002001177650002101197650001201218650001201230650002201242650003501264650001401299650001301313650003501326650001101361650003101372650002401403650002301427650002201450650002101472650002801493650000901521650003501530650002201565650002201587650002301609650002901632650003601661653001201697700001701709700001701726773007301743852000901816856007901825930003301904945001301937946001301950655001201963IND2201236020221118064346.0991022e199904  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220123602DNAL7 a102309122pmid7 a10.1093/ps/78.4.5742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeltemes, L.M.10aTissue expression patterns of chicken octamer-binding proteins  ap. 574-578.  a2019-12-04  aThe octamer motif is important in transcriptional regulation of genes of the immune system in many species, including the chicken.

Farmers preferentially apply manure to fields closest to homesteads (homefields), which are more fertile than fields further away (outfields). A three-year experiment was established on homefields and outfields on sandy and clayey soils to assess the effects of mineral nitrogen (N) fertilizer application in combination with manure or mineral phosphorus (P) on maize yields and soil chemical properties. Significant maize responses to application of N and manure were observed on all fields except the depleted sandy outfield. Large amounts of manure (17 t ha-¹ year-¹) were required to significantly increase soil organic carbon (SOC), pH, available P, and base saturation, and restore productivity of the depleted sandy outfield. Sole N as ammonium nitrate (100 kg N ha-¹) or in combination with single superphosphate led to acidification of the sandy soils, with a decrease of up to 0.8 pH units after three seasons. In a greenhouse experiment, N and calcium (Ca) were identified as deficient in the sandy homefield, while N, P, Ca, and zinc (Zn) were deficient or low on the sandy outfield. The deficiencies of Ca and Zn were alleviated by the addition of manure. This study highlights the essential role of manure in sustaining and replenishing soil fertility on smallholder farms through its multiple effects, although it should be used in combination with N mineral fertilizers due to its low capacity to supply N. 3asandy soils 3aZea mays 3aclay soils 3aanimal manures 3asoil organic carbon 3asuperphosphate 3anutrient availability 3asoil quality 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3acorn 3agrain yield 3asoil fertility 3aspatial variation 3asoil pH 3aammonium nitrate 3aapplication rate 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aZimbabwe 0amineral fertilizers1 aDelve, Robert J. 1 aNyamangara, Justice 1 aGiller, K.

The aim of the present study was to develop a multimethod for the analysis of photoinitiators in paperboard packages and commercial beverage packages. The proposed method is simple and fairly rapid. Extraction is carried out with acetonitrile. A reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with UV detection was developed to quantify the 6 selected photoionitiators. Total HPLC time analysis was 30 min and the flow-rate was 1 mL/min. Method validation parameters such as linearity and detection limit are reported. Recovery of all photoinitiators (at 1 mg/kg) from orange juice was satisfactory (mean = 88.4%; ranging from 84.6% to 93.4%). Recovery of benzophenone and Irgacure 651 was good (ranging from 85.2% to 98.1% and 86.1% to 92.2%, respectively) at the 4 concentrations studied (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg). Commercial beverage packages were analyzed and when photoinitiators were detected, the beverages were also analyzed. 3achemical composition 3apackaging materials 3apackaging materials migration 3aprinting inks 3achemical analysis 3afood packaging 3adetection 3apaperboard 3abeverages 2aBeveragesxanalysis 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aFood Packagingxinstrumentation 2aInk 2aPaper 2aPhotochemistry 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aphotoinitiators 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aPastorelli, S.1 aCruz, J.M.1 aSimoneau, C.1 aPaseiro-Losada, P.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Mar., v. 73, no. 2 p.C92-C99dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00642.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/21  aOther US 7aarticle03225naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001800189245011500207300001600322500002400338500001500362520120900377650001801586650001401604650000901618650001901627650001401646650001801660650001201678650001501690650001701705650003101722650002601753650001201779650002101791650001101812650002301823650002001846650001901866650001601885650002201901650002401923650001801947650001101965650002101976650004401997650002402041650002902065650002402094651001302118651001502131651001302146651001502159653002402174700001602198700002202214773010702236852000902343856009202352930003302444945002502477946001302502655001202515IND4401850520221118064156.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185052DNAL7 a182987192pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00631.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aCameron, D.K.10aComparison of Physical and Chemical Properties of Medium-Grain Rice Cultivars Grown in California and Arkansas  ap.

Variations existed in grain dimensions, particularly length distribution, among cultivars and between crop years. When grown separately, the Arkansas cultivars tended to have higher protein and lipid contents but lower amylose contents than the California cultivars. M204 contained a significantly higher apparent amylose content (21.0%) compared with the other 3 cultivars (14.3% to 16.4%). The Arkansas rice cultivars exhibited higher pasting and gelatinization temperatures and produced harder gels and less sticky cooked rice. However, when the 4 cultivars were grown together in Arkansas, differences in protein and amylose contents, gelatinization and pasting properties, and cooked rice texture decreased. This study demonstrated that genetics, location, and crop year all contributed to variations in rice chemical and physical characteristics. 3alipid content 3acultivars 3arice 3aplant genetics 3acrop year 3afood analysis 3aamylose 3arice flour 3aOryza sativa 3aphysicochemical properties 3aenvironmental factors 3amilling 3afood composition 3alength 3apasting properties 3aprotein content 3agelatinization 2aAgriculture 2aAmylosexanalysis 2aChemistry, Physical 2aFood Analysis 2aHumans 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aOryzaxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysis 2aSpecies Specificity 3aArkansas 3aCalifornia 0aArkansas 0aCalifornia 0aphysical properties1 aWang, Y.

C41-C49.  aIncludes references  aThe molecular characteristics of ovalbumin aggregates formed by heating with NaCl and glucose were investigated with a multi-angle laser light scattering system. The presence of NaCl and glucose affected the formation and molecular structure of the aggregates. Specifically, glucose increased the denaturation temperature of ovalbumin due to thermal stabilization of the native state of ovalbumin, regardless of the content of added NaCl. The surface hydrophobicity of the aggregates was increased by the addition of NaCl, which induced the denaturation of ovalbumin at a lower temperature. Aggregates with a larger weight-average molar mass (Mw) and root mean square radius (Rg) formed from heat-denatured ovalbumin with NaCl and glucose. The presence of NaCl during heat denaturation caused the formation of aggregates with a larger Mw (1.9 x 10⁵ and 3.5 x 10⁶ g/mol for 0 and 10 mM NaCl, respectively) and Rg (14.8 and 80.4 nm for 0 and 10 mM NaCl, respectively). Over a certain amount of NaCl, the addition of more glucose resulted in the formation of more aggregates with greater Mw and Rg values. In sum, the thermostability of ovalbumin was affected primarily by glucose, but the molecular characteristics of the soluble aggregates formed by heat denaturation varied primarily with NaCl content. 3asodium chloride 3aglucose 3aprotein aggregates 3aheat treatment 3adenaturation 3aprotein degradation 3aovalbumin 3alasers 3alight scattering 3amolecular conformation 3athermal stability 3asalt content 2aChemistry, Physical 2aGlucosexchemistry 2aHot Temperature 2aLight 2aMolecular Weight 2aOvalbuminxchemistry 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aProtein Denaturationxdrug effects 2aScattering, Radiation 2aSodium Chloridexchemistry 0amultiangle laser light scattering technique1 aMoon, T.W.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Mar., v. 73, no. 2 p.C41-C49dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00615.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/18  aOther US 7aarticle03389naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001600189245009500205300001800300500002400318500001500342520156200357650001601919650001001935650002801945650001801973650002701991650001302018650001402031650002102045650001202066650001402078650002502092650001102117650002702128650002502155650002702180650005002207650002202257650001602279650002202295650002102317650002402338653002002362653001702382653002302399700001602422700002502438700001902463773010902482852000902591856009202600930003302692945002502725946001302750655001202763IND4401850020221118064347.0080223e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440185002DNAL7 a182987142pmid7 a10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00637.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aGarrido, I.10aPolyphenols and Antioxidant Properties of Almond Skins: Influence of Industrial Processing  ap.

In this article, the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of almond skins obtained from different processes (blanching [freeze-drying], blanching + drying, and roasting) were studied. A total of 31 phenolic compounds corresponding to flavan-3-ols (33% to 56% of the total of phenolic compounds identified), flavonol glycosides (9% to 36%), hydroxybenzoic acids and aldehydes (6% to 26%), flavonol aglycones (1.7% to 18%), flavanone glycosides (3% to 7.7%), flavanone aglycones (0.69% to 5.4%), hydroxycinnamic acids (0.65% to 2.6%), and dihydroflavonol aglycones (0% to 2.8%) were determined in the skins from 3 different varieties of almonds. The total contents of phenolic compounds identified were significantly (P < 0.05) higher (around 2-fold) in the roasted samples than in the blanched almonds (freeze-dried). Industrial drying (oven drying) of the blanched almond skins produced an increase (< 2-fold) in the contents of phenolic compounds, although the results were only statistically significant (P < 0.05) for some samples. The antioxidant activity (ORAC values) was higher for the roasted samples (0.803 to 1.08 mmol Trolox/g), followed by the samples subjected to blanching + drying (0.398 to 0.575 mmol Trolox/g) and then the blanched (freeze-dried) samples (0.331 to 0.451 mmol Trolox/g). Roasting is the most suitable type of industrial processing of almonds to obtain almond skin extracts with the greatest antioxidant capacity. 3apolyphenols 3atesta 3afood processing quality 3afood analysis 3afood processing wastes 3aroasting 3ablanching 3afood composition 3aalmonds 3aflavanols 3aantioxidant activity 3adrying 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood-Processing Industryxmethodsxstandards. 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPolyphenols 2aPrunusxchemistry 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity 0afood processing 0aalmond skins 0aphenolic compounds1 aMonagas, M.1 aGómez-Cordovés, C.1 aBartolomé, B.0 tJournal of food science.g2008 Mar., v. 73, no. 2 p.C106-C115dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00637.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/02/21  aOther US 7aarticle03863naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245012200170300001800292520190200310650002002212650002402232650002102256650002402277650004302301650002602344650002102370650002202391650002302413650001002436650001202446650003002458650001602488650002102504650002302525650001502548650001702563650001302580650001502593650002502608650001802633650001502651650001002666650003402676650001402710650002202724650001102746650001702757650001902774650001302793650001002806651001702816653000902833653002202842653003802864700002102902773014002923852000903063856008503072930003303157946001103190655001203201IND4442641520221118064128.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444264152DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-010-0365-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassen, Ahmed Idris 10aRoot colonization and growth enhancement in wheat and tomato by rhizobacteria isolated from the rhizoplane of grasses  ap. 1837-1846.  aRhizobacteria isolated from the rhizoplane of grasses growing at the Nylsvlei Nature Reserve in South Africa were investigated for growth promotion and root colonization in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) under greenhouse and microplot field conditions. The identities of the isolates were determined by means of 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Bacillus simplex (KBS1F-3), Bacillus megaterium (NAS7-L), Bacillus cereus (KFP9-F) and Paenibacillus alvei (NAS6G-6). The three Bacillus strains were isolated from the perennial grass Themeda triandra while the Paenibacillus strain was isolated from another perennial grass Sporobolus fimbriatus. Enhanced plant shoot and root weight in wheat was achieved by single inoculation with three of the isolates whereas no significant increase was observed in root length. Combined inoculation of Paenibacillus alvei (NAS6G-6) and Bacillus cereus (KFP9-F) on wheat resulted in significant increase in these parameters. Single inoculations of Bacillus simplex (KBS1F-3) and Bacillus cereus (KFP9-F) resulted in significant increase in root and shoots fresh weight, root dry weight and total root length in tomatoes. Indoleacetic acid production, phosphate solubilization and siderophore secretion were studied as possible mechanisms by which the bacterial isolates enhanced plant growth. Root colonization was studied by means of spontaneous rifampicin resistant strains of the wild type isolates. Except for B. megaterium (NAS7-L), the rest of the isolates colonized the roots efficiently resulting in concentrations of 10⁶-10⁸ cfu g⁻¹ root. The root colonization of Bacillus simplex (KBS1F-3) and Paenibacillus alvei (NAS6G-6) was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM) after successful transformation of the isolates with the pNF8 plasmid carrying the gene for the green fluorescent protein (gfp). 3aBacillus cereus 3aBacillus megaterium 3aBacillus simplex 3aPaenibacillus alvei 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSporobolus fimbriatus 3aThemeda triandra 3aTriticum aestivum 3aconservation areas 3agenes 3agrasses 3agreen fluorescent protein 3agreenhouses 3agrowth promotion 3aindole acetic acid 3aphosphates 3aplant growth 3aplasmids 3arhizoplane 3arhizosphere bacteria 3aribosomal RNA 3arifampicin 3aroots 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3ashoots 3asiderophores 3asolubilization 3atomatoes 3awheat 3aSouth Africa 0aPGPR 0aRoot colonization 0aGreen fluorescent protein tagging1 aLabuschagne, N. 0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2010 Oct., v. 26, no. 10 p.1837-1846dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-010-0365-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02566naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245016200170300001400332520100700346650001301353650001901366650002901385650002901414650001801443650001201461650002501473650001501498650002301513650002201536650001901558650001501577650001901592650000901611650002401620650001801644650001401662651001301676653001601689653001301705700002801718700002201746700002201768773013201790852000901922856008501931930003302016946001102049655001202060IND4448821520221118064512.0110204e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444882152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-010-1755-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGömöryová, Erika 10aSoil microbial characteristics at the monitoring plots on windthrow areas of the Tatra National Park (Slovakia): their assessment as environmental indicators  ap. 31-45.  aThis study focused on the responses of soil microorganisms to different management regimes on disturbed windthrow areas. Microbial parameters potentially serving as indicators of environmental changes within a long-term monitoring of forest development after large-scale disturbance events were assessed. Basal and substrate-induced respiration, N mineralisation, catalase activity, microbial biomass as well as functional diversity based on Biolog assay were determined in soil samples from three disturbed plots and an undisturbed reference plot in the Tatra National Park (Slovakia) since 2006. A relative congruence of inter-annual trends of microbial activity indicators at all plots results from a common response of microbiota to changes of climate at the landscape level after forest stands were destroyed. While catalase activity and functional diversity proved to be useful indicators of temporal trends, microbial biomass seems to reflect different management regimes at the disturbed plots. 3acatalase 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental indicators 3aforest stands 3aforests 3afunctional diversity 3alandscapes 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil sampling 3awindthrow 3aSlovakia 0aForest soil 0aBiolog®1 aStřelcovà, Katarína.1 aFleischer, Peter 1 aGömöry, Dušan 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2011 Mar., v. 174, no. 1-4 p.31-45dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-010-1755-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03335naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245010600184300001800290520122400308650002101532650002301553650001801576650001701594650002201611650001001633650002201643650001301665650001501678650000901693650002401702650001301726650001701739650003101756650004001787650002501827650002701852650001301879650002501892650001501917650003601932650002001968650002801988650002902016650002602045650002302071650002702094650002202121650002602143651001002169651000902179653001602188653002102204653002502225653001802250700003202268700002202300700002202322700001902344773011702363852000902480856009202489930003302581946001102614655001202625IND4442777620221118064532.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444277762DNAL7 a208316452pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04762.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Hui10aNucleotide diversity patterns of local adaptation at drought-related candidate genes in wild tomatoes  ap. 4144-4154.  aWe surveyed nucleotide diversity at two candidate genes LeNCED1 and pLC30-15, involved in an ABA (abscisic acid) signalling pathway, in two closely related tomato species Solanum peruvianum and Solanum chilense. Our six population samples (three for each species) cover a range of mesic to very dry habitats. The ABA pathway plays an important role in the plants' response to drought stress. LeNCED1 is an upstream gene involved in ABA biosynthesis, and pLC30-15 is a dehydrin gene positioned downstream in the pathway. The two genes show very different patterns of nucleotide variation. LeNCED1 exhibits very low nucleotide diversity relative to the eight neutral reference loci that were previously surveyed in these populations. This suggests that strong purifying selection has been acting on this gene. In contrast, pLC30-15 exhibits higher levels of nucleotide diversity and, in particular in S. chilense, higher genetic differentiation between populations than the reference loci, which is indicative of local adaptation. In the more drought-tolerant species S. chilense, one population (from Quicacha) shows a significant haplotype structure, which appears to be the result of positive (diversifying) selection. 3aSolanum chilense 3aSolanum peruvianum 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahabitats 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3asignal transduction 3atomatoes 3awater stress 2aAbscisic Acidxphysiology. 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aDioxygenasesxgenetics 2aDroughts 2aGenetics, Population 2aHaplotypes 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgenetics. 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSolanumxgenetics 2aStress, Physiological 0aChile 0aPeru 0aABA pathway 0alocal adaptation 0anucleotide diversity 0awild tomatoes1 aCamus-Kulandaivelu, Letizia1 aStephan, Wolfgang1 aTellier, Aurelien1 aZhang, Zhenwen0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 19, no. 19 p.4144-4154dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04762.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120114b20120203c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03091naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245006600163300001600229520178600245650002002031650002602051650002702077650001102104650001602115650002202131650002502153650001902178653002602197653002602223653002602249653001902275653002702294700002202321700002202343700002802365700002002393700001902413773012002432852000902552856008502561946001102646655001202657IND4441233320221118064439.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444123332DNAL7 a10.1007/s10546-010-9510-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinn, Dennis 10aAnalysis of Urban Atmosphere Plume Concentration Fluctuations  ap. 431-456.  aConcentration variability in the fast-response tracer dataset for continuous, near-surface, point source releases in the urban core from the Joint Urban 2003 field study is analyzed. Concentration variability for conditionally and unconditionally sampled time series is characterized by probability densities, concentration fluctuation intensity, skewness, and kurtosis. Significant day-night differences in plume dispersion are observed. Relative to daytime, nighttime plumes were more likely to have reduced concentration fluctuation intensities, higher normalized surface concentrations, suppressed vertical mixing, and a greater prevalence of Gaussian-like distributions rather than log-normal or mixed mode distributions. This was in spite of the similar stability and turbulence conditions in the urban core for day and night. The potential roles of flow meander and thermal stability in explaining these differences are examined. Probability densities of concentration are found to be a strong function of fluctuation intensity. There are few differences in probability densities between day and night when classified by fluctuation intensity. There are no appreciable differences between conditional and unconditional probability densities and only small differences between conditional and unconditional sampling statistics relative to the larger differences usually observed in more homogeneous settings. Fluctuation intensity, skewness, and kurtosis are higher for the daytime experiments, and closer to the source, but show little difference between conditional and unconditional results over most of their range of values. The log-normal distribution provides a better overall fit to a broader range of the dataset than the exponential or clipped-normal distributions. 3adata collection 3afield experimentation 3alognormal distribution 3amixing 3aprobability 3athermal stability 3atime series analysis 3aturbulent flow 0aDay-night differences 0aFluctuation intensity 0aProbability densities 0aToxic dosement 0aUrban plume dispersion1 aClawson, Kirk L. 1 aCarter, Roger G. 1 aRich, J.

Films of isotactic polypropylene, high density polyethylene and ethylene-propylene (EP) copolymer were sterilized under γ-radiation with doses of 10 and 25 kGy. Two different ⁶⁰Co sources were used with dose rate 600 and 780 Gy h⁻¹. Neat and sterilized samples were incubated in compost and fungal culture environments. The changes in functional groups, surface morphology and intrinsic viscosity in polymer chains were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM and viscometric measurements, respectively. It was observed that both γ-degradation and biodegradation processes depend on the dose rate of γ-source. It was found that the biodegradation of γ-sterilized polyolefins in composting and microbial culture environments increased with decreasing the γ-dose rate. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiodegradation 3acomposite polymers 3acomposting 3acomposts 3afungi 3agamma radiation 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aviscometry 3aviscosity 0aPolyolefins 0aSterilization 0aγ-Dose rate 0aComposting and fungal culture1 aSingh, R.

Diapause and cold winter temperatures, as well as freezing in E. solidaginis, all strongly reduce the need for mitochondrial activity. To evaluate the responses of mitochondria to these conditions, we assessed the maximal activity of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), transcript levels of COX subunit 1 (encoded on the mitochondrial genome), mitochondrial 12S rRNA levels and mitochondrial DNA content. COX activity decreased over the winter months in both species to levels that were about one-third of September values. COX activity also dropped significantly in E. scudderiana in response to cold acclimation (4,-4,-20 °C) or hypoxia exposure. COX activity was less sensitive to these stresses in E. solidaginis but rose by 50% when larvae were thawed after freezing. COX 1 mRNA transcripts and 12S rRNA levels were unchanged over the winter months in E. scudderiana, as was COX 1 DNA content; this indicates that changes in COX enzymatic activity are likely mediated mainly by post-translational modification. However, both COX transcript and 12S rRNA levels decreased in response to hypoxia exposure in both species, whereas COX DNA did not, which indicates that transcription of the mitochondrial genome is sensitive to oxygen levels. 3aEpiblema scudderiana 3aEurosta solidaginis 3acold tolerance 3acold stress 3aanaerobic conditions 3amitochondrial DNA 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aribosomal RNA 3aenzyme activity 3aacclimation 3aoverwintering 3adiapause 2aAcclimatizationxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aHypoxiaxenzymology. 2aCyclooxygenase 1xmetabolism 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxmetabolism 2aFreezing 2aInsect Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMitochondriaxphysiology 2aMitochondrial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMothsxphysiology 2aRNAxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSeasons 2aTephritidaexphysiology 0afreeze avoidance 0afreeze tolerance 0aDNA content 0aCOX1 0acold acclimation1 aStorey, K.B.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2008 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.367-373dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2007.12.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/08/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02896naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001700159245007200176300001800248500001500266520144200281650002101723650002001744650001701764650000901781650001001790650001201800650001901812650001901831650002101850650001201871650001901883650001201902650002401914650003401938650001301972650003501985650002102020650000902041650003102050650003402081653001602115653001002131773007602141852000902217856008102226930003302307945001302340946001302353655001202366IND2199018220221118064329.0990601e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219901822DNAL7 a98725782pmid7 a10.1093/ps/77.12.17732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJulian, R.J.10aRapid growth problems: ascites and skeletal deformities in broilers  ap. 1773-1780.  a2019-12-04  aOver the last 40 yr, genetic selection for rapid growth and improved feed efficiency has been very effective in meat-type poultry.

In the chicken, sudden death syndrome (flip-over) and pulmonary hypertension syndrome resulting in ascites are the most important. Ruptured aorta, spontaneous turkey cardiomyopathy (round heart), and cardiomyopathy causing sudden death produce high mortality in turkeys. Rapid growth induced by high nutrient intake alone can cause severe lameness, bone defects, and deformity, as these problems are seen in animals that have not been selected for rapid growth: dogs, horses, pigs, ratites and wild birds kept in zoologic gardens. In meat-type poultry, growth-related disease can be reduced or eliminated by reducing feed intake without affecting final body weight. Rapid growth alone may not be the pathogenic mechanism that results in cardiovascular or musculoskeletal defects. Metabolic imbalance induced by high nutrient intake may cause some of the conditions. These metabolic problems might be corrected without reducing growth rate. 3abroiler chickens 3aspinal diseases 3aleg weakness 3apain 3atibia 3aascites 3abone fractures 3aanimal welfare 3adyschondroplasia 3arickets 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aAscitesxveterinary 2aBone and Bonesxabnormalities 2aBreeding 2aChickensxgrowth & development 2aGrowthxgenetics 2aPain 2aPoultry Diseasesxetiology 2aTurkeysxgrowth & development 0adeformities 0aspine0 tPoultry science.g1998 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.1773-1780x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/77.12.17733Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02696naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001900159245003400178300001800212520158600230650001301816650002101829650001701850650001201867650001901879650001001898650002001908650001901928650001201947650002101959650002101980650002402001653001102025653001302036773007602049852000902125856008102134930003302215945001302248946001302261655001202274IND2199018120221118064216.0990601e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219901812DNAL7 a98725772pmid7 a10.1093/ps/77.12.17662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuncan, I.J.H.10aBehavior and behavioral needs  ap. 1766-1772.  aAn understanding of behavior is important in any consideration of poultry welfare. Behavior is a good indicator of states of suffering such as fear, frustration, and pain. It might also be possible to use social interactions as indicators of welfare. The possibility of using "luxury" behavior, such as play and exploratory behavior, as an indicator of positive emotional states, requires investigation. Important welfare consequences arise from the fact that some behavior may be so strongly motivated as to constitute a "need". A behavioral need will arise in the case of behavior, such as nesting, that is controlled largely by internal factors, because these factors will be present no matter what type of environment is provided. Behavior triggered largely by external stimuli, such as responses to predators, will not give rise to a need if the external factors can be removed from the environment. Dustbathing is an example of behavior controlled by complex interactions between internal and external factors; the extent to which this constitutes a need is still being debated. If a behavioral need arises, then it is important that the environment provided allows it to be performed without damage to the performer or other birds. It should also be remembered that birds may need to perform behavior, including appetitive as well as consummatory elements, although the functional consequences of these are no longer required for survival. Finally, the performance of certain behavior leads to an increase in health or physical condition that improves welfare later in life. 3achickens 3afeeding behavior 3adust bathing 3anesting 3aanimal welfare 3asleep 3asexual behavior 2aAnimal Welfare 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animal 2aNesting Behavior 2aPoultryxphysiology 0afright 0agrooming0 tPoultry science.g1998 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.1766-1772x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/77.12.17663Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02767naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100002300133245010100156300001600257300003000273500001500303520111500318650001801433650002001451650001301471650001801484650001801502650002101520650001601541650000901557650001201566650001001578650000901588650002801597650001601625650004601641650002001687650001201707650001101719650002201730650001101752650004101763650000901804650001601813650002201829650002501851653001901876653001101895653002201906700002101928700002101949700002001970700002201990773006602012852000902078939003302087945000802120946001302128655001202141991630838890742620221118064438.0821101e198207  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820012362DNAL7 a71516522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnard, R.

Data was obtained from 60 patients who completed the 26 day residential program. Twenty-one of 23 patients who were taking oral hypoglycemic agents upon entry and 13 of 17 patients who were taking insulin were off medication at discharge. Two of the remaining 4 had insulin intake reduced by 50%; the other 2 showed no major change in insulin dosage. Fasting blood glucose was reduced from 194.9 to 144.6 mg/dl. Serum cholesterol was reduced from 225.4 to 181.7 mg/dl; triglycerides were reduced from 283.7 to 186.2 mg/dl. The average weight loss was 4.3 kg/body wt.; maximum work capacity increased from 5.6 to 7.9 METs. Daily walking increased from 11.7 to 102.8 min/day. The decrease in fasting glucose was not correlated with weight loss, increase in walking time or increase in MET capacity. The total Pritikin program is effective for NIDDM patients; the high-complex-carbohydrate, high-fiber, low-fat diet is an effective regimen for these patients.

  1 aSmith, I.M.10aTrace Metal Concentrations in an Intensive Agricultural Watershed in British Columbia, Canada  ap. 1455-1467.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEffects of agricultural intensification and a naturally occurring landslide of asbestos material upon water and sediment quality in a transboundary watershed were investigated. The water and sediments of the Sumas River watershed were analyzed for copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni) concentrations in 1993/1994 and 2003/2004 and differences within sites over time were examined. Based upon a review of the literature, Cu and Zn were used as indicators of agricultural impacts while Cr and Ni were used as indicators of impacts from an asbestos landslide. Animal unit equivalents (AUEs) were calculated on a per area basis as an indicator of livestock density using detailed statistical census data. Whatman #42 filtered metals, bioavailable metals, and sediment-bound metals (in the <63 μm fraction) were determined at 22 sites along the mainstem and tributaries, including two reference sites. Temperature, pH, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also measured. The bioavailable metal fraction was determined using the diffusive gradient thin film technique (DGT). Sediment-bound results were compared with British Columbia's Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines (ISQGs) and Severe Effects Levels (SELs). A Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine if the concentrations of metals changed significantly within sites between 1993/1994 and 2003/2004. Spearman rank correlation analysis was used to determine relationships between trace metals, water quality parameters, and AUEs/hectare. The results indicate that Cu and Zn levels in sediments increased significantly to concentrations above the ISQGs of 35.7 mg/kg and 123 mg/kg, respectively from 1993/1994 to 2003/2004 in streams, where associated land use was dominated by intensive agriculture. Higher AUEs/hectare were significantly correlated with greater bioavailable levels of Zn as well as higher sediment-bound Zn concentrations. Neither Cu nor Cr were detected by the DGTs on any of the sampling occasions. The Cr and Ni sediment concentrations were highest in Swift Creek, the headwater tributary affected by the natural landslide of asbestos material, and decreased in the Sumas River downstream from the point of input. Cr and Ni concentrations have increased in the mid-region of the Sumas River since 1993/1994, suggesting downstream movement of the asbestos material over time. DGT results indicated that bioavailable Zn is significantly positively correlated to sediment-bound Zn and livestock density, and bioavailable Ni is significantly correlated to sediment-bound Ni. 3asediment contamination 3aheavy metals 3aguidelines 3adissolved organic carbon 3aagricultural watersheds 3alandslides 3aasbestos 3abioavailability 3apoint source pollution 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3acopper 3aagricultural statistics 3anonpoint source pollution 3atemperature 3achromium 3arivers 3azinc 3apH 3anickel 3aenvironmental impact 3aintensive livestock farming 3aenvironmental indicators 3aBritish Columbia 0atrace elements1 aHall, K.J.1 aLavkulich, L.M.1 aSchreier, H.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2007 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.1455-1467dAmerican Water Resources AssociationwJournal:jnl55232x1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle02946naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245007700179300001600256500002400272520173800296650002702034650002102061650002502082650000902107650001302116650001702129650001402146650001002160700002802170700003302198700003802231700003102269700003702300700003102337773012802368852000902496856005502505655001202560IND4400881620221118064154.0080203e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440088162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-459X.2007.00146.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlves, Leonardo Rangel10aTime-intensity profile and internal preference mapping of strawberry jam  ap. 125-135.  aIncludes references  aTime-intensity analysis was applied for sweet and sour tastes and strawberry flavor of six commercial brands of strawberry jam. For this test, 11 subjects, between 25 and 35 years old, were selected from an initial 12-member group. An affective test, with 117 consumers was also carried out and the results were analyzed by internal preference mapping. The least accepted samples were the ones with the lowest sweetness intensity, indicating that jam consumers prefer sweeter products. Also, one of them presented a higher sourness intensity, which may have had a negative influence on its acceptance. It is important to point out the fact that those least accepted samples were the low-calorie products. The internal preference mapping and cluster analysis showed two consumer clusters. The first one was a higher concentration of consumers toward traditional samples, and the second one showed a lower concentration of consumers in the direction of one of the low-calorie samples. Time-intensity analysis is used in order to obtain the temporal profile of an attribute in a certain product. This technique is different from the conventional descriptive analysis because it allows the verification of changes in the perception of a product's attribute over time. Consumer preference responses are usually heterogeneous, and averaged consumer data may not be representative of any individual opinion. Thus, the awareness of interindividual differences in preference behavior gave rise to an increasing popularity of consumer segmentation. In this case, a preference map is applied. Observing both descriptive and affective data at the same time, it is possible to determine which attributes have influenced the consumer's preference. 3aattitudes and opinions 3acluster analysis 3aconsumer preferences 3ajams 3asourness 3astrawberries 3asweetness 3ataste1 aBattochio, Juliana Rosa1 aCardoso, Juliana Maria Porto1 aMelo, Lauro Luis Martins Medeiros1 aSilva, Valquiria Seixas da1 aSiqueira, Adriana Camurca Pontes1 aBolini, Helena Maria Andre0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2008 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.125-135dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl66238x0887-82507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-459X.2007.00146.x 7aarticle01668naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001600128245005700144300001800201500002400219500001500243520059700258650001500855650002300870650001500893650001600908650001100924650001600935653001800951653001800969773014900987852000901136856007801145930003301223945002501256946001301281655001201294IND4401945920221118064202.0080226e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440194592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aF6001 aBlack, P.E.10aRevisiting the Thornthwaite and Mather Water Balance  ap. 1604-1605.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis technical note clarifies confusion currently present in research using and/or citing the 1955 and 1957 editions of the Thornthwaite and Mather Water Balance (or Budget) resulting from corrections to errant tables in the 1955 edition made by the authors for the 1957 edition.

Statistical forecasts of streamflow based on historical records of streamflow can be useful, but statistical assumptions, such as stationarity of flows, need to be evaluated. This study evaluated the relation between climatic fluctuations and stationarity and developed regression equations to forecast streamflow by using climatic fluctuations as explanatory variables. Climatic fluctuations were represented by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Historical streamflow within the 25- to 30-year positive or negative phases of AMO or PDO was generally stationary. Monotonic trends in annual mean flows were tested at the 21 sites evaluated in this study; 76% of the sites had no significant trends within phases of AMO and 86% of the sites had no significant trends within phases of PDO. As climatic phases shifted in signs, however, many sites had nonstationary flows; 67% of the sites had significant changes in annual mean flow as AMO shifted in signs. The regression equations developed in this study to forecast streamflow incorporate these shifts in climate and streamflow, thus that source of nonstationarity is accounted for. The R2 value of regression equations that forecast individual years of annual flow for the central part of the study area ranged from 0.28 to 0.49 and averaged 0.39. AMO was the most significant variable, and a combination of indices from both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans explained much more variation in flows than only the Pacific Ocean indices. The average R2 value for equations with PDO and SOI was 0.15. 3awater supply 3arivers 3astream flow 3aequations 3awater management 3aregression analysis 3aweather 3aclimate change 3asurface water 3aclimatic factors 3astatistical models 3ahydrologic models 3aprediction 3aColorado 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aPacific Ocean 0amathematical models 0areservoirs0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2007 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.1550-1569dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/11  aOther US 7aarticle03955naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128072000900137100001500146245014400161300001800305500002400323500001500347520217000362650001302532650001502545650001502560650001502575650001202590650001502602650002202617650002302639650002302662650003002685650002202715650002502737650002202762650002602784650001102810650003502821650002402856650001202880650001902892650002102911650001302932651001802945653001302963653002602976653001603002700001603018773014903034852000903183856007803192930003303270945002503303946001303328655001203341IND4401944820221118064203.0080226e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440194482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX330 0aP200 0aL300 0aM3101 aEkness, P.10aEffects of Riparian Areas, Stream Order, and Land Use Disturbance on Watershed-Scale Habitat Potential: An Ecohydrologic Approach to Policy  ap. 1468-1482.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSpatio-temporal linkages between hydrologic and ecologic dimensions of watersheds play a critical role in conservation policies. Habitat potential is influenced by variation along longitudinal and lateral gradients and land use disturbance. An assessment of these influences provides critical information for protecting watershed ecosystems and in making spatially explicit, conservation decisions. We use an ecohydrologic approach that focuses on interface between hydrological and ecological processes. This study focuses on changes in watershed habitat potentials along lateral (riparian), and longitudinal (stream order) dimensions and disturbance (land use). The habitat potentials were evaluated for amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds in the Westfield River Watershed of Massachusetts using geographic information systems and multivariate analysis. We use a polynomial model to study nonlinear effects using robust regression. Various spatial policies were modeled and evaluated for influence on species diversity. All habitat potentials showed a strong influence along spatial dimensions and disturbance. The habitat potential for all vertebrate groups studied decreased as the distance from the riparian zone increased. Headwaters and lower order subwatersheds had higher levels of species diversity compared to higher order subwatersheds. It was observed that locations with the least disturbance also had higher habitat potential. The study identifies three policy criteria that could be used to identify critical areas within a watershed to conserve habitat suitable for various species through management and restoration activities. A spatially variable policy that is based on stream order, riparian distance, and land use can be used to maximize watershed ecological benefits. Wider riparian zones with variable widths, protection of headwaters and lower order subwatersheds, and minimizing disturbance in riparian and headwater areas can be used in watershed policy. These management objectives could be achieved using targeted economic incentives, best management practices, zoning laws, and educational programs using a watershed perspective. 3areptiles 3aamphibians 3awatersheds 3awild birds 3amammals 3aecosystems 3ahydrologic models 3atemporal variation 3awater conservation 3abest management practices 3aspecies diversity 3aenvironmental policy 3aspatial variation 3aconservation programs 3azoning 3ageographic information systems 3aregression analysis 3astreams 3ariparian areas 3anonlinear models 3ahabitats 3aMassachusetts 0aland use 0amultivariate analysis 0avertebrates1 aRandhir, T.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2007 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.1468-1482dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/10  aOther US 7aarticle03126naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001700146245010900163300001800272500002400290500001500314520159000329650001701919650003101936650001401967650001801981650001701999650002102016650001402037650002202051650002102073650001302094653003502107653002702142653001702169653001702186653002002203653002002223653002502243700001302268700001902281773016302300852000902463856007702472930003302549945002502582946001302607655001202620IND4401946620140724000000.0080226e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440194662DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07090002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aJordheim, M.10aAnthocyanins in Berries of Ribes Including Gooseberry Cultivars with a High Content of Acylated Pigments  ap. 5529-5535.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aConsumption of berries from various sources including the genus Ribes has been associated with diverse potential health benefits. The 14 examined cultivars of European gooseberry (R. grossularia L.) contained in various proportions the 3-glucoside (3), 3-rutinoside (4), 3-xyloside (7), 3-O-β-(6' '-E-caffeoylglucopyranoside) (8), and 3-O-β-(6' '-E-p-coumaroylglucopyranoside) (10) of cyanidin and the 3-rutinoside (6) and 3-glucoside of peonidin (5). Pigments 3, 4, delphinidin 3-rutinoside (2), delphinidin 3-glucoside (1), and minor amounts of 6, 7, and 10 were found in red flowering currant (R. sanguineum Pursh). Golden currant (R. aureum Pursh) contained 3, 4, and trace amounts of 1, 6, and 7, while alpine currant (R. alpinum L.) contained 3, 4, and trace amounts of 10. The major anthocyanins in two cultivars of jostaberries (R. x nidigrolaria Bauer), 1-4, 8, and 10, reflected that this hybrid contained the major anthocyanins of both parents, black currant and gooseberry. This is the first complete identification of 8 and the ring size of the sugar of 10. Pigment 9 was tentatively identified as cyanidin 3-(6' '-Z-p-coumaroylglucoside). This new pigment occurred in minor amounts (<2%) in all R. grosssularia and R. x nidigrolaria cultivars. No commercially available berries have been reported to contain such high proportions of aromatic acylated anthocyanins as found in the gooseberry cultivars "Samso", "Hinnomäki Red", "Taastrup", "Lofthus", and "Glendal", which are in this context the most obvious candidates for consumption, colorant, and breeding programs. 3aanthocyanins 3aRibes aureum var. villosum 3acultivars 3aRibes alpinum 3agooseberries 3aRibes uva-crispa 3aacylation 3afruit composition 3aRibes sanguineum 3acurrants 0aaromatic acylated anthocyanins 0ared flowering currants 0asmall fruits 0ajostaberries 0aalpine currants 0agolden currants 0aRibes x nidigrolaria1 aMage, F.1 aAndersen, O.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5529-5535dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07090003Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle02867naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100001700119245011100136300001800247500002400265500001500289520126400304650001701568650001501585650002201600650001101622650002201633650001701655650001501672650001001687650002301697650001601720650001501736650002001751650002501771650002801796650002201824650002201846650001301868650002301881650000901904650001601913651001201929653002101941653002001962700002401982773014902006852000902155856007802164930003302242945002502275946001302300655001202313IND4401945520221118064227.0080226e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440194552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2001 aMaliva, R.G.10aImpacts of Residential Development on Humid Subtropical Freshwater Resources: Southwest Florida Experience  ap. 1540-1549.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe population of Collier and Lee Counties in southwestern Florida has increased 11-fold from 1960 to 2004 with a concomitant increase in freshwater demand. Water levels and salinity within the water table aquifer over the past two to three decades have generally been stable, with more monitoring wells showing statistically significant temporal increases in water level than decreases. Residential development has had a neutral impact on the water table aquifer because the total annual evapotranspiration of residential communities is comparable to that of native vegetation and less than that of most agricultural land uses. Public water supply systems and private wells also result in net recharge to the water table aquifer with water produced from deeper aquifers. Confined freshwater aquifers have overall trends of decreasing water levels. However, with the exception of the mid-Hawthorn aquifer, water levels in most areas recover to near background levels each summer wet season. Freshwater resources in humid subtropical areas, such as southwestern Florida, are relatively robust because of the great aquifer recharge potential from the excess of rainfall over ET during the wet season. Proper management can result in sustainable water resources. 3awater supply 3asubtropics 3apopulation growth 3asummer 3aurban development 3asaline water 3awet season 3awells 3atemporal variation 3ahumid zones 3afreshwater 3aland use change 3agroundwater recharge 3asustainable development 3aagricultural land 3aresidential areas 3aaquifers 3aevapotranspiration 3arain 3awater table 3aFlorida 0awater management 0awater resources1 aHopfensperger, K.P.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2007 Dec., v. 43, no. 6 p.1540-1549dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080311b20080404c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/03/11  aOther US 7aarticle02442naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245009900160300001600259500002400275520132000299650002401619650001301643650002301656650001701679650002601696650001201722650001701734650001401751650001801765650001301783650001001796650001001806650001701816651001401833651001101847700001801858773010101876852000901977856004601986655001202032IND4463363620221118064238.0120605s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446336362DNAL7 a10.1023/A:10260813078932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullen, B.F.10aPsyllid resistance in Leucaena.

Biomass production losses due to predation by the psyllid were determined for 12accessions of Leucaena in a randomised split-plot field experiment conducted at Brisbane, Australia. Regrowthfrom well-established Leucaena trees, cut back to bare stems 50 cm high, was measured over a 9-week period from plants subjected to psyllid damage and from plants with psyllids controlled by spraying with chlorpyrifos (1 mg ai/l water). Psyllid damage was scored using a ratings scale developed by the University of Hawaii. Lossof potential DM production due to psyllids ranged from 10% for L. trichandra OFI53/88 to 76% for L. collinsii ssp. zacapana OFI56/88. Production losses were significantly correlated with psyllid damage ratings for 10 of the 12 accessions, and also for a combined data set comprising these 10 accessions. From correlations for the combined data set, a 50% loss of potential DM production occurred at a psyllid damage rating of approximately3.2. Results indicated that a "0" rating should be added to the scale to indicate the absence of psyllids. 3aHeteropsylla cubana 3aLeucaena 3abiomass production 3achlorpyrifos 3afield experimentation 3ainsects 3aplant damage 3apredation 3arating scales 3aspraying 3astems 3atrees 3auniversities 3aAustralia 3aHawaii1 aShelton, H.M.0 tAgroforestry systems.g2003, v. 58, no. 3 p.163-171dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-43667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1026081307893 7aarticle02531naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001500155245010800170300001800278500002400296500001500320520108000335650002601415650001101441650001401452650001501466650002501481650001201506650003001518650002001548650001301568653002801581653002401609653003601633700001601669700001401685700001501699700001501714773016301729852000901892856007701901930003301978945002502011946001302036655001202049IND4401949620221118064303.0080226e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440194962DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07012792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX350 0aX3201 aFang, T.Y.10aProtein Engineering of Sulfolobus solfataricus Maltooligosyltrehalose Synthase To Alter Its Selectivity  ap. 5588-5594.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMaltooligosyltrehalose synthase (MTSase) is one of the key enzymes involved in trehalose production from starch and catalyzes an intramolecular transglycosylation reaction by converting the α-1,4- to α,α-1,1-glucosidic linkage. Mutations at residues F206, F207, and F405 were constructed to change the selectivity of the enzyme because the changes in selectivity could reduce the side hydrolysis reaction of releasing glucose and thus increase trehalose production from starch. As compared with wild-type MTSase, F405Y and F405M MTSases had decreased ratios of the initial rate of glucose formation to that of trehalose formation in starch digestion at 75 °C when wild-type and mutant MTSases were, respectively, used with isoamylase and maltooligosyltrehalose trehalohydrolase (MTHase). The highest trehalose yield from starch digestion was by the mutant MTSase having the lowest initial rate of glucose formation to trehalose formation, and this predicted high trehalose yield better than the ratio of catalytic efficiency for hydrolysis to that for transglycosylation. 3asubstrate specificity 3astarch 3atrehalose 3aisomerases 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3amutants 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aenzyme activity 3abacteria 0aSulfolobus solfataricus 0aprotein engineering 0amaltooligosyltrehalose synthase1 aTseng, W.C.1 aPan, C.H.1 aChun, Y.T.1 aWang, M.Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5588-5594dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07012793Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle02983naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001600146245006800162300001800230500002400248520165100272650002301923650001101946650001001957650002401967650001001991650002502001650001502026650002002041650001402061650002502075650002202100653002902122700001102151700001402162700001402176700001502190773016302205852000902368856007702377930003302454945002502487946001302512655001202525IND4401947720221118064313.0080226e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440194772DNAL7 a10.1021/jf063580d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aAkpinar, O.10aEnzymatic Production of Xylooligosaccharides from Cotton Stalks  ap. 5544-5551.  aIncludes references  aXylooligosaccharide (XO) production was performed from xylan, which was obtained by alkali extraction from cotton stalk, a major agricultural waste in Turkey. Enzymatic hydrolysis was selected to prevent byproduct formation such as xylose and furfural. Xylan was hydrolyzed using a commercial xylanase preparation, and the effects of pH, temperature, hydrolysis period, and substrate and enzyme concentrations on the XO yield and degree of polymerization (DP) were investigated. Cotton stalk contains about 21% xylan, the composition of which was determined as 84% xylose, 7% glucose, and 9% uronic acid after complete acid hydrolysis. XOs in the DP range of 2-7 (X6 approximately equal to X5 > X2 > X3) were obtained with minor quantities of xylose in all of the hydrolysis conditions used. Although after 24 h of hydrolysis at 40 °C, the yield was about 53%, the XO production rate leveled off after 8-24 h of hydrolysis. XO yield was affected by all of the parameters investigated; however, none of them affected the DP of the end product significantly, except the hydrolysis period. Enzyme hydrolysis was maintained by the addition of fresh substrate after 72 h of hydrolysis, indicating the persistence of enzyme activity. The optimal hydrolysis conditions were determined as 40 C, pH 5.4, and 2% xylan. The obtained product was fractionated via ultrafiltration by using 10, 3, and 1 kDa membranes. Complete removal of xylanase and unhydrolyzed xylan was achieved without losing any oligosaccharides having DP 5 or smaller by 10 kDa membrane. After a two-step membrane processing, a permeate containing mostly oligosaccharides was obtained. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acotton 3astems 3aagricultural wastes 3axylan 3axylooligosaccharides 3aextraction 3aacid hydrolysis 3axylanases 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3awaste utilization 0adegree of polymerization1 aAk, O.1 aKavas, A.1 aBakir, U.1 aYilmaz, L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5544-5551dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf063580d3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle02667naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001500146245014400161300001800305500002400323500001500347520115700362650003301519650001401552650001901566650001501585650001701600650002201617650001001639653001601649653002301665653001801688653002301706653001601729700001501745700001201760700001501772700001501787700001501802700001301817700001101830773016301841852000902004856007702013930003302090945002502123946001302148655001202161IND4401948020221118064337.0080226e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440194802DNAL7 a10.1021/jf063623q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aWang, M.F.10aComparison of Various Extraction Methods for Policosanol from Rice Bran Wax and Establishment of Chromatographic Fingerprint of Policosanol  ap. 5552-5558.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA capillary gas chromatographic (GC) method has been developed for the separation and determination of policosanol components extracted from rice bran wax. A Varian CP-sil 8 CB column was employed, and an oven temperature was programmed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify the composition of policosanol. Quantitative analysis was carried out by means of hydrogen flame ionization detector (FID) with dinonyl phthalate (DNP) as internal standard. The results indicated that the extract obtained by dry saponification has the highest contents of octacosanol and triacontanol among extracts by all used extraction methods including dry saponification, saponification in alcohol, saponification in water (neutralized and non-neutralized), and transesterification. Meanwhile, the GC-MS fingerprint of policosanol extracted by dry saponification has been established. Euclidean distance similarity calculation showed remarkable consistency of compositions and contents among 12 batches of policosanol from a rice bran wax variety. This protocol provided a rapid and feasible method for quality control of policosanol products. 3acapillary gas chromatography 3arice bran 3asaponification 3aextraction 3atriacontanol 3amass spectrometry 3awaxes 0aoctacosanol 0adry saponification 0arice bran wax 0agas chromatography 0apolicosanol1 aLian, H.Z.1 aMao, L.1 aZhou, J.P.1 aGong, H.J.1 aQian, B.Y.1 aFang, Y.1 aLi, J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5552-5558dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf063623q3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle02616naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001800146245017400164300001800338500002400356520116700380650001601547650002101563650001801584650002501602650002001627650001501647650001201662650001401674650001601688650001801704650002001722653002401742653002501766653004201791700001701833773016301850852000902013856007702022930003302099945002502132946001302157655001202170IND4401951320221118064528.0080226e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440195132DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070518n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1041 aSkorepova, J.10aCarbohydrate and Mineral Removal during the Production of Low-Phytate Soy Protein Isolate by Combined Electroacidification and High Shear Tangential Flow Ultrafiltration  ap. 5645-5652.  aIncludes references  aIn this work, soy protein isolates were produced by a combination of electroacidification and high shear tangential flow hollow fiber ultrafiltration with a 100 kDa membrane under constant pressure. The filtration performance was evaluated by comparing the filtration time and the final product composition for an electroacidified (pH 6) and a non-electroacidified (pH 9) soy protein extract. The removal of carbohydrates during the filtration was always consistent with the theoretical predictions (based on free permeability assumption) for both the electroacidified and the non-electroacidified feeds. A higher removal of calcium, magnesium, and phytic acid was achieved during the filtration of the electroacidified feed compared to the non-electroacidified feed. However, the electroacidification pretreatment had a negative impact on the permeate flux and resulted in more significant membrane fouling with correspondingly longer filtration times. A discontinuous diafiltration enhanced the removal of carbohydrates and minerals, thus yielding a product with higher protein content but was unable to improve the permeate flux for the electroacidified feed. 3asoy protein 3aprotein isolates 3aacidification 3aelectrical treatment 3aultrafiltration 3aseparation 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3aphytic acid 3acarbohydrates 3afood processing 0asoy protein isolate 0aelectroacidification 0ahigh shear tangential ultrafiltration1 aMoresoli, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5645-5652dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070518n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001700159245011900176300001600295500002400311520134500335650001601680651001101696653001201707653002001719773010001739852000901839856009001848930003301938945002501971946001101996655001202007IND4401955020221118064432.0080226e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440195502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aE1101 aCaldeira, R.10a'My land, your social transformation': Conflicts within the landless people movement (MST), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  ap. 150-160.  aIncludes references  aThe Brazilian Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem-Terra (MST) is one of the best-known and most prominent rural social movements. The unequal distribution of land in Brazil, and the neglect of this problem by successive Brazilian governments contributed greatly to the organisation of rural movements striving for the implementation of land reform in the country. The struggle for land therefore frames the MST collective action and legitimates its raison d'être as a social movement. The MST framing process, carried out mainly by the movement leaders and organisers, intends to unify the social movement by articulating private beliefs, interpretations and preferences into shared values and meanings. However, this process of framing does not take place without competition or/and conflict: leaders are many times forced to compete with other institutions, with the media, or even with inherited cultural understandings which provide alternative frames. This paper focuses particularly on the conflicting process of framing internal to the MST. More specifically, the present paper looks at how the MST leaders/organisers frame, and interpret, community and land differently from the MST settlers/followers whose lived experiences and inherited cultural understandings naturally informed their perceptions both on community and land. 3aland reform 3aBrazil 0aframing 0asocial movement0 tJournal of rural studies.g2008 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.150-160dElsevier Sciencex0743-01677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20080418b20080502c00000000  aINDdRLGe2008/04/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02821naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002000150245010600170300001800276500002400294520153700318650002401855650001201879650001101891650002601902650001301928650002001941650001501961650001301976650001001989650001501999650001302014650002102027650000702048650001502055650001402070650001902084650001202103650001902115700001802134700001802152700002102170773009802191852000902289856005302298655001202351IND4407231020221118064348.0080627e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440723102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgunwande, G.A.10aNitrogen loss in chicken litter compost as affected by carbon to nitrogen ratio and turning frequency  ap. 7495-7503.  aIncludes references  aThe study was undertaken to investigate the effects of carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio and turning frequency (TF) on the loss of total nitrogen (TN) during composting of chicken litter (a mixture of chicken manure, waste feed, feathers and sawdust) with a view to producing good quality compost. Carbon to nitrogen ratios of 20:1, 25:1 and 30:1 and TF of 2, 4 and 6days were experimented. The initial physico-chemical properties of the litter were determined. During the composting process, moisture level in the piles was periodically replenished to 55% and the temperature, pH and TN of the chicken litter were periodically monitored. Also, the dry matter (DM), total carbon (TC), total phosphorus (P) and total potassium (K) were examined at the end of composting. The results showed that both C:N ratio and TF had significant (p <=0.05) effect on pile temperature, pH changes, TN, TC, P and K losses while DM was only affected (p <=0.05) by C:N ratio. All treatments reached maturation at about 87days as indicated by the decline of pile temperatures to near ambient temperature. Losses of TN, which were largely attributed to volatilization of ammonia (NH₃), were highest within the first 28days when the pile temperatures and pH values were above 33°C and 7.7, respectively. Moisture loss increased as C:N ratio and TF increased. In conclusion, the treatment with a combination of 4days TF and C:N ratio 25:1 (T₄R₂₅) had the minimum TN loss (70.73% of the initial TN) and this indicated the most efficient combination. 3aambient temperature 3aammonia 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3achickens 3acompost quality 3acomposting 3afeathers 3afeeds 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3apoultry manure 3asawdust 3avolatilization1 aOsunade, J.A.1 aAdekalu, K.O.1 aOgunjimi, L.A.O.0 tBioresource technology.g2008 Nov., v. 99, no. 16 p.7495-7503dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.02.020 7aarticle02713naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001800155245010900173300001800282500002400300520133800324650001601662650001901678650001301697650002001710650001301730650001201743650001901755650001001774650001101784650002101795650002301816650001701839653002701856653003601883700001601919773016301935852000902098856007702107930003302184945002502217946001302242655001202255IND4401957720221118064331.0080226e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440195772DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07031472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ5051 aMajcher, M.A.10aEffect of Cysteine and Cystine Addition on Sensory Profile and Potent Odorants of Extruded Potato Snacks  ap. 5754-5760.  aIncludes references  aAromas generated in extruded potato snacks without and with addition of 0.25, 0.5, and 1% (w/w) of flavor precursors, cysteine and cystine, were compared and evaluated by descriptive sensory profiling. The results showed that high addition of cysteine (0.5 and 1%) resulted in the formation of undesirable odor and taste described as mercaptanic/sulfur, onion-like, and bitter; on the contrary, addition of cystine even at high concentration gave product with pleasant odor and taste, slightly changed into breadlike notes. GC/O analysis showed cysteine to be a much more reactive flavor precursor than cystine, stimulating formation of 12 compounds with garlic, sulfury, burnt, pungent/beer, cabbage/mold, meatlike, roasted, and popcorn odor notes. Further analysis performed by the AEDA technique identified 2-methyl-3-furanthiol (FD 2048) as a most potent odorant of extruded potato snacks with 1% addition of cysteine. Other identified compounds with high FD were butanal, 3-methyl-2-butenethiol, 2-methylthiazole, methional, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, and 3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl-2(5H)-furanone. In the case of cystine addition (1%) the highest FD factors were calculated for butanal, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, benzenemethanethiol, methional, phenylacetaldehyde, dimethyltrisulfide, 1-octen-3-ol, 1,5-octadien-3-one, and 2-acetylpyrazine. 3asnack foods 3aextruded foods 3apotatoes 3afood processing 3acysteine 3acystine 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3agas chromatography 3aolfactometry 0aextruded potato snacks 0aaroma extract dilution analysis1 aJelen, H.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5754-5760dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07031473Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle03480naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245009300186300001600279500002400295520177000319650001302089650001802102650002602120650002002146650001402166650002402180650001502204650002702219650002102246650002502267650001902292650002202311650001702333650001202350650001502362650001802377650004002395650007402435650003702509650003402546650002302580650001302603651001302616700001902629700002202648700002402670700001802694700002202712700001902734773009202753852000902845856004802854655001202902IND4441242020221118064359.0100813e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444124202DNAL7 a204957972pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-010-9678-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Vanessa10aEffects of Monospecific Banks of Salt Marsh Vegetation on Sediment Bacterial Communities  ap. 167-179.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to understand if two species of salt marsh plants, widely distributed in European estuaries (Spartina maritima and Halimione portulacoides) differently influence the distribution, activity, and metabolic physiology of sediment bacterial communities in monospecific banks, in comparison with uncolonized sediment (control). Microbiological descriptors of abundance and activity were assessed along vertical profiles of sediments. Rates of activity of the extracellular enzymes β-glucosidase, α-glucosidase, aminopeptidase, arylsulfatase, and phosphatase were generally higher in the vegetation banks in relation to control sediments where they were also less variable with depth. This is interpreted as an indirect effect related to supply of plant-derived polymeric substrates for bacterial growth. Parameters related to sediment texture (grain size, percent of fines or water content) showed significant relations with cell abundance or maximum hydrolysis rates, pointing to an indirect effect of plant colonization exerted through the modification of sediment physical properties. The profiles of utilization of sole-carbon-source (Biolog Ecoplates) showed that only the communities from the upper sediment layer of the S. maritima and the H. portulacoides banks exhibit consistent differences in terms of physiological profiles. Bacterial communities in control sediments exhibited the lowest physiological variability between surface and sub-surface communities. The results indicate that microbial colonization and organic matter decomposition are enhanced under the influence of salt marsh plants and confirm that plant coverage is a major determinant of the processes of organic matter recycling in intertidal estuarine sediments. 3aSpartina 3aarylsulfatase 3abacterial communities 3aenzyme activity 3aestuaries 3aestuarine sediments 3ahydrolysis 3amicrobial colonization 3amicrobial growth 3amicrobial physiology 3aorganic matter 3asalt marsh plants 3asalt marshes 3atexture 3avegetation 3awater content 2aAmaranthaceaexgrowth & development 2aBacteriaxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purification. 2aGeologic Sedimentsxmicrobiology 2aPoaceaexgrowth & development 2aWater Microbiology 2aWetlands 0aPortugal1 aSantos, Ana L.1 aCoelho, Francisco1 aGomes, Newton C.

Sensory flavor profile data indicated that the primary odor (orthonasal) attributes were tropical fruit/grapefruit, cooked/caramel, musty, and medicine. By comparison fresh-squeezed juice lacked these odor attributes. GC-O analysis found 43 odor-active components in canned juices. Eight of these aroma volatiles were sulfur based. Four of the 12 most intense aroma peaks were sulfur compounds that included methanethiol, 1-p-menth-1-ene-8-thiol, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, and dimethyl trisulfide. The other most intense odorants included 7-methyl-3-methylene-1,6-octadiene (myrcene), octanal, 2-methoxyphenol (guaiacol), 2-ethyl-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (homofuraneol), (E)-non-2-enal, (E,E)-deca-2,4-dienal, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde (vanillin), and -sinensal. Odorants probably responsible for the undesirable sensory attributes included grapefruit (1-p-menth-1-ene-8-thiol), cooked [2-ethyl-4-hydroxy-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (Furaneol), and 3-(methylthio)propanal (methional)], musty [7-methyl-3-methylene-1,6-octadiene and (E)-non-2-enal], and medicine (2-methoxyphenol). The canned juices also lacked several aldehydes and esters normally found in fresh orange juice. 3acanned juice 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3aorange juice 3afood composition 3aodor compounds 3aoff odors 0avolatile compounds 0acanned orange juice1 aMahattanatawee, K.1 aSmoot, J.M.1 aRouseff, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5761-5767dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07038563Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle03119naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001700155245008800172300001800260500002400278500001500302520171800317650001202035650001702047650002402064650002002088650001802108650001702126650001902143650001102162650001402173653002302187653002102210653002802231653003602259700001502295700001902310773016302329852000902492856007702501930003302578945002502611946001302636655001202649IND4401958020221118064429.0080226e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440195802DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070488o2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ110 0aQ5001 aScheidig, C.10aChanges in Key Odorants of Raw Coffee Beans during Storage under Defined Conditions  ap. 5768-5775.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDuring storage of raw coffee beans (green coffee) atypical odors may develop, which are suggested to influence the aroma of particularly the coffee beverage. To gain insight into the aroma compounds responsible for such odor changes, a comparative aroma extract dilution analysis was applied on unstored, raw Arabica coffee beans from Colombia (water content = 11.75%) and on the same beans with a water content of 13.5%, which were stored for 9 months at 40 °C. In combination with the flavor dilution (FD) factors, the results of the identification experiments showed strong increases in (E)-β-damascenone (cooked apple-like), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove-like), and methyl 2-methyl- and methyl 3-methylbutanoate (fruity), whereas others, such as the earthy smelling 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine as well as 2-phenylethanol and 3-methoxyphenol, remained unchanged during storage. In addition, the previously unknown coffee odorant 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol (intense smoky odor) increased significantly during storage. Quantitative measurements performed on raw coffee samples stored at various temperatures, water contents, and oxygen availabilities indicated that the significant increase of, in particular, the methyl esters of 2- and 3-methylbutanoic acid were responsible for the pronounced and fruity odor quality perceived in the stored green coffee, whereas the higher concentrations of 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and 2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol led to the more pronounced smoky, clove-like odor quality. On the basis of the results obtained, in particular the reduction of the water content in combination with lower temperatures can be suggested to avoid aroma changes in raw coffee beans caused by storage. 3aphenols 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage quality 3awater content 3acoffee beans 3aodor compounds 3aoxygen 3aoff odors 0astorage conditions 0araw coffee beans 0a2-methoxy-5-vinylphenol 0aaroma extract dilution analysis1 aCzerny, M.1 aSchieberle, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5768-5775dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070488o3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080326b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/26  aOther US 7aarticle02741naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001600159245017700175300001800352520117700370650001101547650001301558650002401571650002101595650001701616650002001633650002001653650001201673650005101685650002501736650001101761650002101772650001101793650003801804650000901842650002501851650002401876650001601900653001901916653002901935700001801964700001601982773007601998852000902074856008102083930003302164945001302197946001302210655001202223IND2199022120221118064306.0990601e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219902212DNAL7 a98725932pmid7 a10.1093/ps/77.12.18932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWebel, D.M.10aLipopolysaccharide-induced reductions in body weight gain and feed intake do not reduce the efficiency of arginine utilization for whole-body protein accretion in the chick  ap. 1893-1898.  aThe effects of repeated injections of 400 micrograms Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on chick performance from 11 to 22 d posthatching were examined in chicks fed casein-based diets containing graded levels of arginine. Administration of LPS reduced (P < 0.05) weight gain, feed intake, and protein accretion, and there was a tendency (P = 0.07) for LPS administration to be more growth-depressing at the higher than at the lower levels of supplemental arginine. Regression analysis of protein accretion for the first three doses of arginine indicated that protein accretion was a linear (P < 0.01) function of supplemental arginine intake for both salin-injected (r2 = 0.94) and LPS-injected (r2 = 0.93) chicks. Slopes of the best-fit regression lines for both treatment groups were equal, indicating that arginine utilization for protein accretion was not affected by LPS administration. The dietary arginine concentration required to maximize weight gain and feed efficiency was unaffected by LPS administration, with both salin- and LPS-injected chicks reaching plateaus in weight gain and feed efficiency at 0.90 and 0.98% digestible arginine, respectively. 3achicks 3aarginine 3alipopolysaccharides 3aEscherichia coli 3abody protein 3aliveweight gain 3afeed conversion 2aAnimals 2aArgininexadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aChickensxmetabolism 2aEating 2aEscherichia coli 2aFemale 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMale 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aRegression Analysis 2aWeight Gain 0astress factors 0aprotein efficiency ratio1 aJohnson, R.W.1 aBaker, D.H.0 tPoultry science.g1998 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.1893-1898x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/77.12.18933Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03074naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001600159245008200175300001800257500001500275520136000290650001301650650001301663650001801676650001401694650002301708650002501731650003701756650002201793650002701815650002501842650002401867650001201891650006101903650006101964650002502025650003602050650001102086650002802097650003102125650003002156650002402186653002302210653001602233653001702249653001702266773007602283852000902359856008102368930003302449945001302482946001302495655001202508IND2199021120221118064214.0990601e199812  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219902112DNAL7 a98725902pmid7 a10.1093/ps/77.12.18582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuhtala, M.10aChicken CD4, CD8 alpha beta, and CD8 alpha alpha T cell co-receptor molecules  ap. 1858-1873.  a2019-12-04  aNew knowledge has recently been obtained about the evolutionary conservation of CD4, CD8 alpha alpha, and CD8 alpha beta T cell receptor (TCR) co-receptor molecules between chicken and mammals. This conservation extends from biochemical structure and tissue distribution to function. Panels of monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antisera against different epitopes of chicken CD8 and CD4 molecules have proven their value in several recent studies. Chicken CD8 allotypes and homozygous strains carrying these allotypes have been established and these strains provide excellent models for further studies. The extensive polymorphism of CD8 alpha in chickens has not been observed in any other species, suggesting that CD8 alpha and CD8 beta have evolved under different selective pressure in the chicken. A large peripheral blood CD4+CD8+ T cell population in chicken resembles that observed in some human individuals but the inheritance of peripheral blood CD4CD8 alpha alpha T cells in the chicken is a unique observation, which suggests the presence of a single gene responsible for CD8 alpha, but not CD8 beta, specific expression. Despite these unique findings in chicken, the data on CD4, CD8 alpha alpha, and CD8 alpha beta molecules show that they have evolved before the divergence of mammalian and avian branches from their reptilian ancestors. 3achickens 3aepitopes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aevolution 3astrain differences 3aamino acid sequences 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3aintestinal mucosa 3amolecular conformation 3agenetic polymorphism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCD4 Antigensxanalysisxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCD8 Antigensxanalysisxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBiological Evolution 2aChickensxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aReceptors, Antigen, T-Cell 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aTissue Distribution 0aliterature reviews 0ablood cells 0acd4 antigens 0acd8 antigens0 tPoultry science.g1998 Dec., v. 77, no. 12 p.1858-1873x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/77.12.18583Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02433naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002000179245005100199300001200250506007600262520127300338506003701611650003701648650001101685650002201696650004201718650002401760650001801784650002501802700002101827773008001848852000901928856007801937930003302015946001102048655001202059IND4418034220221207140900.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441803422DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp0342doi7 aPMC26556632pmcid7 a191817012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, William10aIntegrating sequence with FPC fingerprint maps  ap. e36.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent advances in both clone fingerprinting and draft sequencing technology have made it increasingly common for species to have a bacterial artificial clone (BAC) fingerprint map, BAC end sequences (BESs) and draft genomic sequence. The FPC (fingerprinted contigs) software package contains three modules that maximize the value of these resources. The BSS (blast some sequence) module provides a way to easily view the results of aligning draft sequence to the BESs, and integrates the results with the following two modules. The MTP (minimal tiling path) module uses sequence and fingerprints to determine a minimal tiling path of clones. The DSI (draft sequence integration) module aligns draft sequences to FPC contigs, displays them alongside the contigs and identifies potential discrepancies; the alignment can be based on either individual BES alignments to the draft, or on the locations of BESs that have been assembled into the draft. FPC also supports high-throughput fingerprint map generation as its time-intensive functions have been parallelized for Unix-based desktops or servers with multiple CPUs. Simulation results are provided for the MTP, DSI and parallelization. These features are in the FPC V9.3 software package, which is freely available.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3aclones 3acomputer software 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amathematical models 3anucleic acids 3anucleotide sequences1 aSoderlund, Carol0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Apr., v. 37, no. 5 p.e36-e36x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp0343Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02250naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245017800129300001600307500001500323520102200338650001601360650001801376650004401394650002101438650002601459650000901485650002301494650001101517650001501528650001501543650001001558653001901568700002101587700001601608700001601624700001501640700001601655700001701671773007301688852000901761939003301770946001301803655001201816IND8905199320221118064507.0890926e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890519932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBienfait, H.F.10aRhizosphere acidification by iron deficient bean plants: the role of trace amounts of divalent metal ions.

The induction of this Fe-efficiency reaction was studied by 14CO2 and 11CO2 fixation experiments, and with 31P-NMR on roots of whole plants. The starting and ending of an acidification cycle was closely coupled to parallel changes in CO2 fixation, within the maximal resolution capacity of 20 min. 31P-NMR experiments on intact root systems showed one peak which was ascribed to vacuolar free phosphate. At the onset of proton extrusion this peak shifted, indicating increase of pH in the cells. Proton extrusion was inhibited, with a lag period of 2 hours, by the protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and hygromycin. It is assumed that Zn and Mn induce proton extrusion in Fe-deficient bean roots by activating the synthesis of a short-living polypeptide; the NMR data suggest a role for this peptide in the functioning of a proton pumping ATPase in the plasma membrane. 3arhizosphere 3aacidification 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aisotope labeling 3anutrient deficiencies 3airon 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3acarbon 3aphosphorus 3ametal ions 3aroots 0atrace elements1 aLubberding, H.J.1 aHeutink, P.1 aLindner, L.1 aVisser, J.1 aKaptein, R.1 aDijkstra, K.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 May, v. 90, no. 1 p.359-364x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02207naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001600129245008900145300001600234500001500250520116400265650004401429650002301473650002101496650001501517650001001532650001301542650001501555650001801570651001101588653002301599653001101622700001701633700001601650700001501666773007301681852000901754939003301763946001301796655001201809IND8905197420221118064437.0890925e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890519742DNAL7 a166667412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeich, R.G.10aPhosphorus-31 NMR studies of cell wall-associated calcium-phosphates in Ulva lactuca  ap. 230-236.  a2019-12-04  aPhosphate concentrations in the range 0.1 to 2.0 millimolar induced the formation of extracellular amorphous calcium-phosphates in the cell wall of the marine macro algae Ulva lactuca when they were cultivated in light in seawater at 20 degrees C. A broad resonance representing these compounds as well as resonances for extracellular orthophosphate and polyphosphates could be followed by 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The presence of the calcium-phosphate made the cells brittle and it inhibited the growth of the macro algae and caused mortality within 1 week. The formation of the calcium-phosphates was influenced by the external phosphate concentration, the extracellular pH and the nature and concentration of the external nitrogen source. Futhermore, no formation of these compounds was observed when Ulva lactuca was cultivated in the dark, at low temperatures (5 degrees C) or in the presence of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea. The complex could be removed through washes with ethylenediaminetetraacetate; this treatment did not alter the intracellular pH or the orthophosphate and polyphosphate pools and it restored growth. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3acalcium phosphates 3aisotope labeling 3acell walls 3aalgae 3aseawater 3aphosphorus 3aculture media 3aSweden 0aalgae and seaweeds 0agrowth1 aLundberg, P.1 aVogel, H.J.1 aJensen, P.0 tPlant physiology.g1989 May, v. 90, no. 1 p.230-236x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01866naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001800146245004900164300001600213520105500229650001901284650002301303650001701326653001301343700001801356773009801374852000901472856004901481930003301530946001301563655001201576IND8905226420221118064319.0890922e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890522642DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X-52.8.5782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozyrod, R.P.12aA survey of plasticizer migration into foods  ap. 578-580.  aA survey of 184 samples of food packaged in a range of plastics was carried out to assess the incidence of plasticizer migration into foods.

Only samples in contact with poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) films were found to contain a detectable amount of DEHA. Of the 98 samples wrapped in PVC films, 44 (45%) showed levels of migration exceeding 30 mg/kg. In particular, significant quantities of DEHA were observed in cheeses which had been wrapped at the point of sale. DEHA was detected in 36 out of 38 samples (95%) of cheese wrapped in PVC film, with levels ranging from 31 to 429 mg/kg. Fresh meats packaged in PVC film gave positive results in 5 of the 42 samples analyzed (12%), with levels ranging from 49 to 151 mg/kg. Migration of DEHA into other foods such as sandwiches was also observed, while some food types, such as frozen chicken, showed no detectable migration. 3afood packaging 3afood contamination 3aplasticizers 0amovement1 aZiaziaris, J.0 tJournal of food protection.g1989 Aug., v. 52, no. 8 p.578-580wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-52.8.578  a19950320b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02144naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001500146245012600161300001600287520109400303650001201397650002001409650002301429650001501452650001401467650000801481653002301489700001901512700001601531700001701547700001601564773009801580852000901678856004901687930003301736946001301769655001201782IND8905226220221118064423.0890922e198908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890522622DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X-52.8.5642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIzat, A.L.10aComparison of the DNA probe to culture methods for the detection of Salmonella on poultry carcasses and processing waters  ap. 564-570.  aIn a series of five experiments a total of 269 broiler carcass and chill tank water samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella using the DNA probe and the standard cultural method. Carcasses were sampled using a whole carcass rinse technique. Samples consisted of pre- (48) and post-chill (103) carcasses, and pre-chill (48) and chill (70) tank water. Samples to be evaluated with the DNA probe were subjected to three preenrichment/enrichment procedures to determine the most accurate and reliable enrichment procedure to use with the DNA probe assay. Direct enrichment in Selenite Cystine followed by 24 h incubation in Gram Negative broth allowed for recovery of 0.03 salmonellae/ml from carcass rinse and from pre-chill water using either the standard cultural method or the DNA probe. Pre-enrichment in Lactose broth produced inaccurate results for pre-chill carcass and pre-chill water samples using the DNA probe assay, and may be due to extreme microbiological competition. No false positive results were obtained using the DNA probe assay for any of the four sample types. 3apoultry 3afood processing 3afood contamination 3aSalmonella 3adetection 3aDNA 0aculture techniques1 aDriggers, C.D.1 aColberg, M.1 aReiber, M.A.1 aAdams, M.H.0 tJournal of food protection.g1989 Aug., v. 52, no. 8 p.564-570wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-52.8.564  a19950320b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02297naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005100144245014000195300001800335520071500353592002801068650001101096650002601107650001601133650002301149650002101172650002201193650001301215650001301228650003301241650001601274650003701290650001401327653001201341653002701353653002201380653002301402653003201425700001601457700001501473700005701488700005601545773013901601856007801740852000901818655001201827IND60595611020221118012219.0180605e20180131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059561102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b187232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Qing1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3117-958710aVesicles Constructed with Chiral Amphiphilic Oxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine Derivatives for Enantioselective Recognition of Organic Anions  ap. 3181-3185.  aChiral amphiphilic oxacalix[2]arene[2]triazine derivatives 1–3 bearing l-prolinol moieties were synthesized.

Despite numerous reports on synthesis of graphene, the mass production of high quality graphene in an inexpensive and eco-friendly method has remained as a challenge. In this work, we present a simple and green method for biosynthesis of graphene by using nontoxic reducing agent from Allium Cepa (onion) extracts. Modified Hummers' method was used to synthesis the Graphene oxide (G0) and extracts from Allium Cepa was used as reducing agent. The prepared graphene was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM and XPS. The experimental results showed that GO was successfully reduced to graphene using onion extract. The Raman spectroscopy results, XPS results and XRD results confirmed the reduction of GO to graphene. The SEM and TEM results also reconfirmed the reduction of GO into graphene, where GO exhibited different morphologies, i.e. hexagonal larger sheets than graphene. The antibacterial properties of the graphene were studied against two gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Graphene inhibited cell growth, which proves that our prepared graphene can be useful as an antimicrobial agent against different microorganisms. This work thus reports the design of a novel, facile synthetic route for a new production method of graphene.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium cepa 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibacterial properties 3abioengineering 3abiosynthesis 3acell growth 3acomposite materials 3aelectronics 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3ananotechnology 3aonions 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aBiomacromolecule 0aGraphene 0aHummers method 0aAllium Cepa 0aAnti-bacterial properties1 aHasan, Anwarul0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 126 p.151-158dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.2133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02558naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008800156300001800244520133400262592002801596650002201624650001201646650000901658650001501667650001601682650001301698650001101711650001101722650001601733650001101749650000901760650001401769650001601783700001901799700001501818700002101833700001401854700001501868700001301883700001601896773010401912856007502016852000902091655001202100IND60534020820170629000000.0160802e20120816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053402082DNAL7 a10.1021/ef300852w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarsenty, F.10aExperimental and Kinetic Modeling Study of 3-Methylheptane in a Jet-Stirred Reactor  ap. 4680-4689.  aImproving the combustion of conventional and alternative fuels in practical applications requires the fundamental understanding of large hydrocarbon combustion chemistry. The focus of the present study is on a high-molecular-weight branched alkane, namely, 3-methylheptane, oxidized in a jet-stirred reactor. This fuel, along with 2-methylheptane, 2,5-dimethylhexane, and n-octane, are candidate surrogate components for conventional diesel fuels derived from petroleum, synthetic Fischer–Tropsch diesel and jet fuels derived from coal, natural gas, and/or biomass, and renewable diesel and jet fuels derived from the thermochemical treatment of bioderived fats and oils. This study presents new experimental results along with a low- and high-temperature chemical kinetic model for the oxidation of 3-methylheptane. The proposed model is validated against these new experimental data from a jet-stirred reactor operated at 10 atm, over the temperature range of 530–1220 K, and for equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1, and 2. Significant effort is placed on the understanding of the effects of methyl substitution on important combustion properties, such as fuel reactivity and species formation. It was found that 3-methylheptane reacts more slowly than 2-methylheptane at both low and high temperatures in the jet-stirred reactor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3abiomass 3acoal 3acombustion 3adiesel fuel 3akinetics 3alipids 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aoctane 3aoils 3apetroleum 3atemperature1 aSarathy, S.

From May until September measurements of stomatal conductance to water vapour (gₛ) were made on trees in the chambers. On six out of seven occasions, leaves which had expanded during the first flush (initial shoot extension, during May) in unfiltered air, had lower stomatal conductances, compared with those grown in filtered air; this was significant on three occasions (P < 0.05). Leaves which expanded later in the season (second Hush or lammas growth) responded differently to the air quality treatments, with greater stomatal conductances recorded for trees exposed to unfiltered air. Measurements of leaf (psychrometry) and shoot (pressure bomb) water relations indicated that air quality had little effect on turgor pressure (P). Values of solute (ψₛ) and water (ψw) potential were higher for trees grown in unfiltered air. Trees were transported to the laboralory for measurement of photosynthesis (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gₛ). Measurements of CO, uptake were also made whilst the CO, concentration within the leaf (Cf) was experimentally controlled (A/Cᵢ analysis). This revealed that higher rates of photosynthesis for lammas leaves grown in unfiltered air were due to enhanced regeneration of RuBP (increased Jₘₐₓ, P < 0.08). Carboxylation efficiency (d.A/dCf) and percentage stomatal limitation were not significantly altered by air quality. Jₘₐₓ and dA/dCᵢ were similarly reduced following exposure to drought regardless of the air quality treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica 3aair 3aair quality 3acarboxylation 3adrought 3alammas growth 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3asolutes 3astomatal conductance 3aturgor 3awater vapor 3aUnited Kingdom1 aDOBSON, M.

Holstein heifers were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial design. Heifers in the EST group were inseminated with sex‐sorted (n = 114) or conventional semen (n = 100) after spontaneous or induced oestrus. Heifers in the TAI, subjected to the 5‐day Cosynch+Progesterone protocol (GnRH+P4 insertion‐5d‐PGF₂α+P4 removal‐1d‐PGF₂α‐2d‐GnRH+TAI), were inseminated with sex‐sorted (n = 113) or conventional semen (n = 88). Statistical analyses were performed using PROC GLIMMIX procedure of SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Overall P/AI was 60.7% for EST and 54.2% for TAI regardless of types of semen and 68.1% for conventional and 48.9% for sex‐sorted semen regardless of insemination strategies. Fertility of heifers inseminated with either sex‐sorted (53.5%; 44.2%) or conventional (69.0%; 67.0%) semen did not differ between EST and TAI respectively. Besides, the interaction between the semen type and the insemination strategy was not significant for P/AI. The embryonic loss was significantly greater with sex‐sorted semen (17.1%) compared to conventional semen (1.6%). There was no sire effect with sex‐sorted semen on P/AI (52.6% vs. 46.2%) and embryonic loss (16.4% vs. 18.0%). As expected, sex‐sorted semen resulted in more female calves (89.8% vs. 51.6%) than conventional semen. Thus, sex‐sorted semen can be used with 5‐day Cosynch+Progesterone protocol to eliminate the inadequate oestrus detection and to increase female calves born in dairy heifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3aembryonic mortality 3aestrus 3ainsemination 3apregnancy 3asemen 3asires1 aSelcuk, Gulsum1 aGuclu, Sevket1 aSengul, Sultan1 aAltun, Ismail1 aDikmen, Serdal1 aGumen, Ahmet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3607-43650 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Sept., v. 56, no. 9 p.1254-1260dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.139843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245012400203300001200327520113600339592002801475650002201503650003701525650001901562650001401581650002301595650002701618650003701645650000901682650001301691650001101704650002401715650003301739650001701772650001501789700001401804700001801818773014201836856008201978852000902060655001202069IND60585611020221123025205.0180619e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058561102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3632-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jianjun1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1042-336014aThe Effect of Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Modification on Fe Dispersal and the Catalytic Degradation of Phenol Wastewater  ap. 442.  aModification of a catalyst with polyethylene glycol (PEG) created a dramatic increase in the catalytic activity for the degradation of phenol wastewater. The Fe/PEG-modified γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst was prepared by an impregnation method. The as-prepared catalyst was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, wide- and small-angle X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and N₂ adsorption-desorption experiments, and the results showed that the Fe species were highly dispersed on the surface of the PEG-modified support. At the same time, the PEG modification resulted in an increase in the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area and pore volume. The catalytic activity test showed that the Fe/PEG-modified γ-Al₂O₃ catalyst exhibited a superior performance for the degradation of phenol wastewater in this study, and the phenol and COD removal values reached 94.1 and 88.9%, respectively, within 60 min. The results clearly show that PEG modification is a promising methodology for the preparation of a catalyst with good dispersal of the active component on the support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airon 3anitrogen 3aphenol 3apolyethylene glycol 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3awastewater1 aDing, Kun1 aDing, Bosheng0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Nov., v. 228, no. 11 p.442-442dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3632-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03796naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010500164300001600269520173000285592002802015650002402043650002702067650002502094650001702119650002402136650002102160650001902181650001702200650002902217650001702246650001102263650001602274650001002290650004302300650001202343650002602355650002302381650002302404650001302427650001702440650002702457650002402484650001102508650002302519650001502542650002302557650002202580650001302602650002002615653002702635653001302662653000902675653002102684653002402705653001702729653003002746653002902776653003702805700002102842700002002863700001602883773009702899856008102996852000903077655001203086IND60606318320221118212400.0180725e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060631832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2016.03.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReshma, P.L.10aMitochondrial dysfunction in H9c2 cells during ischemia and amelioration with Tribulus terrestris L.  ap. 220-230.  aThe present study investigates the protective effect of partially characterized Tribulus terrestris L. fruit methanol extract against mitochondrial dysfunction in cell based (H9c2) myocardial ischemia model.To induce ischemia, the cells were maintained in an ischemic buffer (composition in mM −137 NaCl, 12 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 0.9 CaCl2, 20 HEPES, 20 2-deoxy-d-glucose, pH−6.2) at 37°C with 0.1% O2, 5% CO2, and 95% N2 in a hypoxia incubator for 1h. Cells were pretreated with various concentrations of T. terrestris L. fruit methanol extract (10 and 25μg/ml) and Cyclosporin A (1μM) for 24h prior to the induction of ischemia.Different parameters like lactate dehydrogenase release, total antioxidant capacity, glutathione content and antioxidant enzymes were investigated. Studies were conducted on mitochondria by analyzing alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential, integrity, and dynamics (fission and fusion proteins — Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1, Drp1 and Fis1). Various biochemical processes in mitochondria like activity of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, oxygen consumption and ATP production was measured. Ischemia for 1h caused a significant (p≤0.05) increase in LDH leakage, decrease in antioxidant activity and caused mitochondrial dysfunction. T. terrestris L. fruit methanol extract pretreatment was found effective in safeguarding mitochondria via its antioxidant potential, mediated through various bioactives. HPLC of T. terrestris L. fruit methanol extract revealed the presence of ferulic acid, phloridzin and diosgenin.T. terrestris L. fruit ameliorate ischemic insult in H9c2 cells by safeguarding mitochondrial function.

Chlorogenic acid (CGA) and their analogues are important components of polar extracts of these species, as well in several European and Asian medicinal plants. Some of these phenolic compounds display anti-inflammatory effects. In this paper we report the isolation of CGA from Lychnophora salicifolia and its effects on functions involved in neutrophils locomotion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LC–MSⁿ data confirmed the presence of CGA in the plant. Actions of CGA were investigated on neutrophils obtained from peritoneal cavity of Wistar rats (4h after 1% oyster glycogen solution injection; 10ml), and incubated with vehicle or with 50, 100 or 1000μM CGA in presence of lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli (LPS, 5μg/ml). Nitric oxide (NO; Griess reaction); prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA)]; protein (flow cytometry) and gene (RT-PCR) expression of L-selectin, β₂integrin and platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) were quantified. In vitro neutrophil adhesion to primary culture of microvascular endothelial cell (PMEC) and neutrophil migration in response to formyl-methionil-leucil-phenilalanine (fMLP, 10⁻⁸M, Boyden chamber) was determined. RESULTS: CGA treatment did not modify the secretion of inflammatory mediators, but inhibited L-selectin cleavage and reduced β₂ integrin, independently from its mRNA synthesis, and reduced membrane PECAM-1 expression; inhibited neutrophil adhesion and neutrophil migration induced by fMLP. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these findings, we highlight the direct inhibitory actions of CGA on adhesive and locomotion properties of neutrophils, which may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects and help to explain the use of Lychnophora salicifolia as an anti-inflammatory agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aEuropeans 3aLychnophora 3aadhesion 3aanalgesics 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3acell adhesion 3achlorogenic acid 3aendothelial cells 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3aglycogen 3alipopolysaccharides 3alocomotion 3amedicinal plants 3amessenger RNA 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aneutrophils 3anitric oxide 3aoysters 3aphenolic compounds 3aprostaglandins 3aproteins 3arats 3asecretion 3atraditional medicine 2aAnimals 2aCell Movementxdrug effects 2aChlorogenic Acidxpharmacology 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aFlow Cytometry 2aInflammationxchemically induced 2aNeutrophilsxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry1 aBolonheis, S.M.1 aNakasato, A.1 aBelinati, K.1 aSouza, P.D.C.1 aGouvea, D.R.1 aLopes, N.P.1 aFarsky, S.H.P.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2011 May 17, v. 135, no. 2 p.261-269dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2011.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01302naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100002400179245006600203300001800269506007600287520014600363592002800509506003700537650002300574650002300597650001800620650001300638700001800651700001900669700002200688700001900710773012900729856007300858852000900931655001200940IND60658298520221207092258.0190817e20081021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065829852DNAL7 a10.1039/b809537j2doi7 aPMC26929142pmcid7 a188304952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaranger, Elisabeth10aSimplified syntheses of complex multifunctional nanomaterials  ap. 4792-4794.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultifunctional probes are synthesized in a single step using peptide scaffold-based multifunctional single-attachment-point (MSAP) reagents.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3ananomaterials 3apeptides1 aAikawa, Elena1 aReynolds, Fred1 aWeissleder, Ralph1 aJosephson, Lee0 tChemical communications.g2008 Oct. 21, , no. 39 p.4792-4794dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b809537j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011400167300001400281520086600295592002801161650001901189650001101208650001201219650001601231650002301247650001701270653002501287653001401312653003001326653001601356653001801372700001801390700001401408700002001422700001401442700001601456700001701472700001801489700001601507773013801523856008501661852000901746655001201755IND60745897920221121065532.0211003e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074589792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2021.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHao, Zhi-You10aAlkaloids from the rhizomes of Acorus calamus and their PPARα, PPARγ, and glucokinase-activating activities  ap. 37-43.  aFourteen alkaloids of diverse carbon skeletons, including a new compound 2R-4-(5′-methyl-pyrazin)-2-yl-but-3-ene-1,2-diol (1) and a new natural product methyl 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetyl glycinate (3), were isolated from the ethanol extract of Acorus calamus Linn. rhizomes.

The cooperative addressed in this study restricts the participation of small-scale farmers, implying that selection into the program must be taken into consideration for an accurate assessment of the treatment effect. The econometric analysis revealed that government extension services have a modest effect on farm income. In contrast, the treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is robust and substantially large, accounting for nearly 70% of the pre-matching difference. This suggests that the agricultural cooperative system is an important avenue for farmers to improve their economic status. The treatment effect of the agricultural cooperative is highly heterogeneous; the economic benefits arising from the cooperative are significant only for small-scale farms. We can argue that a coexistence of smallholder exclusion and the treatment effect in favor of small-scale farms poses serious challenges to pro-poor agricultural growth in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometrics 3aextension education 3afarm income 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahouseholds 3asocioeconomic status 3aChina1 aBao, Zongshun1 aSu, Qun0 tFood policy.g2012 Dec., v. 37, no. 6 p.700-709dElsevier Ltdx0306-91927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2012.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002800137245006600165300001800231520089300249650002801142650001901170650001501189650001501204650003201219650002501251650001301276650001101289650001501300650001101315650001501326700002001341700002701361700002401388700002701412700002901439773015901468856004001627852000901667655001201676IND4535076720221120052013.0160225e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453507672DNAL7 a10.1021/jf502560k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaramillo-Carmona, Sara10aCell Wall Bound Anionic Peroxidases from Asparagus Byproducts  ap. 9644-9650.  aAsparagus byproducts are a good source of cationic soluble peroxidases (CAP) useful for the bioremediation of phenol-contaminated wastewaters. In this study, cell wall bound peroxidases (POD) from the same byproducts have been purified and characterized. The covalent forms of POD represent >90% of the total cell wall bound POD. Isoelectric focusing showed that whereas the covalent fraction is constituted primarily by anionic isoenzymes, the ionic fraction is a mixture of anionic, neutral, and cationic isoenzymes. Covalently bound peroxidases were purified by means of ion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography. In vitro detoxification studies showed that although CAP are more effective for the removal of 4-CP and 2,4-DCP, anionic asparagus peroxidase (AAP) is a better option for the removal of hydroxytyrosol (HT), the main phenol present in olive mill wastewaters. 3aaffinity chromatography 3abioremediation 3abyproducts 3acell walls 3aion exchange chromatography 3aisoelectric focusing 3aisozymes 3aolives 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3awastewater1 aLópez, Sergio,1 aVazquez-Castilla, Sara1 aJimenez-Araujo, Ana1 aRodriguez-Acros, Rocio1 aGuillen-Bejarano, Rafael0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 62, no. 40 p.9644-9650dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf502560k  aDNAL 7aarticle02494naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245012600174300001200300520131600312592002801628650001601656650001501672650001401687650001901701650001801720650001501738650001401753650001801767650001501785650001701800700003801817700004401855773014201899856008202041852000902123655001202132IND60585611120221123040404.0180619e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058561112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3624-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatista, MaryliaDuarte10aUse of Hydrodynamic Cavitation for Algae Removal: Effect on the Inactivation of Microalgae Belonging to Genus Scenedesmus  ap. 443.  aExcessive algae growth has generated conflicts on the use of water supplies; therefore, the focus on new technologies to remove algae from water bodies is demanding. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of hydrodynamic cavitation on the inactivation of microalgae belonging to genus Scenedesmus. A laboratory-scale experimental apparatus was built in order to accomplish this goal; it consisted of a Venturi device designed to generate the cavitation phenomenon. Suspended microalgae samples were treated for 60 minutes under different cavitation intensities (cavitation number—Cv—ranging from 0.17 to 0.27). Results evidenced that microalgae decay over time can be modeled through first-order kinetics. The maximum removal efficiency (85%) was recorded at the highest cavitation intensity (Cv = 0.17). The removal efficiency decreased as the cavitation number increased. Hydrodynamic cavitation was effective in inactivating Scenedesmus; it produced irreversible damages to cell morphology such as flotation spines removal, cell wall lesions, cytoplasm extravasation, and cavity formation. Assumingly, hydrodynamic cavitation has great potential to treat eutrophic water bodies. Furthermore, it represents a sustainable removal technique, since it does not produce secondary pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3acell walls 3acytoplasm 3aeutrophication 3ahydrodynamics 3amicroalgae 3apollution 3asurface water 3atechnology 3awater supply1 aAnhê, AnaCarolina Borella Marfil1 ade Souza Inácio Gonçalves, JulioCesar0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Nov., v. 228, no. 11 p.443-443dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3624-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100006400184242007200248245010000320300001600420500001100436506007600447520135400523592002801877506003701905650001501942650001301957650001101970650001301981650001001994650002702004650001202031650001302043650001302056650000702069650002202076650001702098650001002115650001402125650002402139650001802163650001902181650001302200650001702213700001302230700006002243773012902303856007702432852000902509655001202518IND60644656920221207144200.0190518e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064465692DNAL7 a10.1631/jzus.B19001882doi7 aPMC65682182pmcid7 a310902772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jianli,d1963-1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0385-578710a铝诱导植物根系分泌有机酸阴离子的机理及其 调控10aMechanisms and regulation of aluminum-induced secretion of organic acid anions from plant roots  ap. 513-527.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAluminum (Al) is the most abundant metal element in the earth’s crust. On acid soils, at pH 5.5 or lower, part of insoluble Al-containing minerals become solubilized into soil solution, with resultant highly toxic effects on plant growth and development. Nevertheless, some plants have developed Al-tolerance mechanisms that enable them to counteract this Al toxicity. One such well-documented mechanism is the Al-induced secretion of organic acid anions, including citrate, malate, and oxalate, from plant roots. Once secreted, these anions chelate external Al ions, thus protecting the secreting plant from Al toxicity. Genes encoding the citrate and malate transporters responsible for secretion have been identified and characterized, and accumulating evidence indicates that regulation of the expression of these transporter genes is critical for plant Al tolerance. In this review, we outline the recent history of research into plant Al-tolerance mechanisms, with special emphasis on the physiology of Al-induced secretion of organic acid anions from plant roots. In particular, we summarize the identification of genes encoding organic acid transporters and review current understanding of genes regulating organic acid secretion. We also discuss the possible signaling pathways regulating the expression of organic acid transporter genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacid soils 3aaluminum 3aanions 3acitrates 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3amalates 3aminerals 3aoxalates 3apH 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aroots 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3asoil solution 3asolubilization 3atoxicity 3atransporters1 aFan, Wei1 aZheng, Shao-jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3336-81650 tJournal of Zhejiang University.g2019 June, v. 20, no. 6 p.513-527dZhejiang University PresswJournal:5353x1673-15817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B19001883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245008700173506011700260506007600377520125600453592002801709506003701737650002001774650000901794650001501803650001301818650000901831650002401840653003801864653002801902653002401930653003001954653001101984700002201995773010302017856008602120852000902206655001202215IND60781844220221207130452.0220802e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078184422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2022.1064272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopetegui, Itsaso13aAn efficient portfolio approach towards ecosystem-based fisheries governance in EU  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the framework of multispecies fisheries governance, the main objective of this paper is to apply modern portfolio theory (MPT) to the North-East Atlantic European fisheries, including all the key commercial fish species subject to total allowable catches (TAC) and quota regimes within the EU. This is done, first, quantifying the inherent return and risk of the potential fish portfolios and, secondly, estimating an individual constrained financial efficient frontier (FEF) for each of the nine fishing countries in the North-East Atlantic. Unlike previous studies in the field of financial fisheries economics, and due to its major robustness under non-normality and the presence of fat tails, we are using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) instead of the conventional mean-variance optimization (MVO) as the method to solve the optimization problem of minimizing risk under a set of alternative constraints so as to obtain the respective FEFs. Our results show that changing the species portfolio distribution, it would be possible to improve efficiency, that is to say, to simultaneously get increasing returns and decreasing risk levels. Moreover, this efficiency gain would be compatible with specific quota transfers among fishing countries.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aeconomic theory 3afish 3agovernance 3aresearch 3arisk 3asystem optimization 0aMultispecies fisheries management 0aModern Portfolio Theory 0aEfficient Portfolio 0aConditional Value-at-Risk 0aReturn1 adel Valle, Ikerne0 tFisheries research.g2022 Oct., v. 254 p.106427-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2022.1064273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245015900169300001600328520132900344592002801673650002101701650001101722650001901733650002301752650002001775650001201795650003501807650001001842650001501852650001301867650001001880650000901890650004101899650002201940650002101962650002201983650004302005650005202048650001302100650001502113650001102128653001002139653001002149653001002159653001102169653001602180700001602196773024302212856008502455852000902540655001202549IND60717701920221119121309.0210601e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071770192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.repbio.2020.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYildirim, Ecem10aDetermination of c-Abl tyrosine kinase and mTERT catalytic subunit of telomerase expression level during prenatal-postnatal mouse ovary-testis development  ap. 555-567.  aExpression levels of genes involved in the development of germ cells vary throughout the process from bipotential gonadal period to adult gonadal formation. In mice, developments of female and male reproductive system are regulated by germ cell-specific factors and hormones, and determinative days in this regulation are very important. c-Abl is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase with cellular functions including cell proliferation, growth and development. mTERT is involved in maintaining telomerase activity and proliferation of surviving cells. We suggested that c-Abl and mTERT might be important for the healthy development of prenatal and postnatal mouse ovary and testis. We aim to demonstrate localization and expressions of c-Abl and mTERT in crucial days of ovary and testis development in prenatal and postnatal period in mouse by immunofluorescence staining and qRT-PCR, respectively. The importance of c-Abl and mTERT expressions during the healthy gonadal development is indicated in the prenatal and postnatal gonadal development. Also, protein expression levels were detected by Western Blot in only postnatal ovary and testis. Determining the functions of the c-Abl and mTERT throughout the process will be important in terms of understanding the infertility cases in the female and male with future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadults 3aanimal ovaries 3acell proliferation 3aenzyme activity 3afemales 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3agerm cells 3ahormones 3amales 3amice 3anon-specific protein-tyrosine kinase 3apostpartum period 3aprotein subunits 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3atelomerase 3atestes 0ac-Abl 0amTERT 0aovary 0atestis 0adevelopment1 aYaba, Aylin0 tReproductive Biology.g2020 Dec., v. 20, no. 4 p.555-567dElsevier B.V.aSociety for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in OlsztynwJournal:23206x1642-431X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.repbio.2020.10.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245013200176520161700308592002801925650002801953650002701981650002902008650002902037650002702066650001602093650001102109650001202120650002302132650002202155650001302177650001402190650001302204650001102217650001102228650000902239653001002248653002202258653001902280653002302299700003002322700002802352700002202380700002902402773013002431856009002561852000902651655001202660IND60731398320221118191753.0211218e20210602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073139832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1091692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGschaedler, Anne10aUse of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in cider fermentation: Importance of the nutrients addition to obtain an efficient fermentation  aThe isolation of autochthonous yeast species presents a good strategy to select new microorganisms for developing an adequate inoculum to carry out fermentations and generate representative products of the cider production zone. However, non-Saccharomyces yeasts have been considered to have low capacity to carry out a complete fermentation as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this work, five autochthonous yeasts from a cider fermentation process were isolated and identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Pichia membranaefaciens, P. kluyveri and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii. A series of fermentations were developed at laboratory level, using each species individually and it was observed that only S. cerevisiae was able to finish the process. K. marxianus consumed less than 50% of the sugars; P. kluyveri and Z. rouxii consumed less than 70% and P. membranaefaciens consumed more than 90% but the yield (ethanol produced for sugar consumed (YP/S)) was 0.39. Nevertheless, the addition of magnesium, zinc and nitrogen increased the fermentative capacity of almost all species: K. marxianus, Z. rouxii and P. kluyveri, showed an increase in ethanol production when nutrients were added, obtaining more than 80 g/L of ethanol, and showing that those nutrients are necessary to complete the fermentation. This work describes the potential use of different non-Saccharomyces species to carry out fermentation of apple juice and highlights the importance of certain nutrients to enable an efficient alcoholic fermentation and the generation of desirable volatile compounds for cider production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aPichia membranifaciens 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aZygosaccharomyces rouxii 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aapple juice 3aciders 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afood microbiology 3ainoculum 3amagnesium 3anitrogen 3asugars 3ayeasts 3azinc 0aCider 0aNon-Saccharomyces 0aMicronutrients 0aVolatile compounds1 aIñiguez-Muñoz, Laura E.1 aFlores-Flores, Nilda Y.1 aKirchmayr, Manuel1 aArellano Plaza, Melchor,0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2021 June 02, v. 347 p.109169-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2021.1091693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013300170300001600303520106000319592002801379650002301407650002201430650002301452650002001475650001401495650001501509650001101524650001101535650001401546650002101560650001901581650001001600650001301610650001501623650001201638650002201650650001701672700002201689700002401711700002401735700002401759700001801783773011801801856008101919852000902000655001202009IND60583305020221120032425.0171010e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058330502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-017-1276-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Carolina S.10aVascular expression driven by the promoter of a gene encoding a high-affinity potassium transporter HAK5 from Eucalyptus grandis  ap. 213-222.  aThe construction of expression cassettes harboring tissue-specific promoters is a viable alternative to limit transgene expression to specific organs and cell types. In this study, we have functionally characterized the promoter of a Eucalyptus grandis gene encoding a putative high-affinity HAK5-like potassium (K⁺) transporter (designated EgHAK5) showing root-specific expression. The ability of the EgHAK 5′-flanking region (~1.3 kb) to drive root-specific expression of a reporter gene (β-glucuronidase; GUS) was examined using transgenic tobacco plants. Histochemical analysis revealed enhanced GUS staining in the vasculature of leaves, hypocotyls and roots, which was also confirmed in histological cross-sections. Moreover, the relative expression of GUS in the roots of the generated transgenic lines was increased in response to K⁺ starvation. Overall, our results indicate that, in a heterologous system, the EgHAK5 promoter shows expression in vascular tissues, mainly within the phloem, and is up-regulated upon potassium deprivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aNicotiana tabacum 3abeta-glucuronidase 3agene expression 3ahistology 3ahypocotyls 3aleaves 3aphloem 3apotassium 3apromoter regions 3areporter genes 3aroots 3astaining 3astarvation 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3atransporters1 aBravo, Juliana P.1 aRibeiro, Cíntia L.1 aSoprano, Adriana S.1 aSassaki, Flávio T.1 aMaia, Ivan G.0 tPlant cell, tissue, and organ culture.g2017 Nov., v. 131, no. 2 p.213-222dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-68577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-017-1276-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010400172300001600276520169000292592002801982650001902010650002502029650001902054650002902073650002802102651001002130651001002140653001302150653001002163653001002173653002502183653002002208700001202228700001602240773009802256856008702354852000902441655001202450IND60621697820221119190911.0190203e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062169782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jingjing10aResearch on the peak of CO2 emissions in the developing world: Current progress and future prospect  ap. 186-203.  aThe developing world will largely determine the trajectory of future global CO2 emissions. An accurate projection of CO2 emissions from the developing world and a good understanding of possible timelines and pathways to reach their peaks are of great significance to combat global climate change. This issue has recently attracted increasing attention; however, it is far from solved. China and India are the two largest developing countries and have a decisive influence on CO2 emissions growth across the developing world. This article critically reviews the current literature regarding CO2 emissions projections of the developing world, particularly of China and India, with an aim to summarize recent study progresses and enlighten future studies. It is generally agreed that China will peak its CO2 emissions by 2030 and has an excellent chance of reaching an earlier peak during 2020–2030. By contrast, India is very likely to undergo sustained emissions growths for decades. The constraints of keeping global warming below 2 °C may enable India to peak CO2 emissions by 2040; however, the associated costs will be too high to pay. Across the developing world, the timeline to peak CO2 emission remains difficult to determine; however, a rapid transition of major developing countries towards low-carbon sustainable development is essential for reaching such a peak. Four topics urgently require further study in the future: improvements in study methodology and data, key country groups and fields to peak CO2 emissions, the peak morphology and post-peak CO2 emissions in China, and a more in-depth understanding of the timeline and pathway to peak CO2 emissions in India.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adeveloping countries 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3asustainable development 3aChina 3aIndia 0aCO2 peak 0aChina 0aIndia 0aThe developing world 0aFuture prospect1 aYe, Bin1 aLiu, Junguo0 tApplied energy.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 235 p.186-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245006700168300001400235520126900249592002801518650002301546650001201569650002301581650001101604650001101615650002501626650001401651650001801665650001201683650001301695650002501708650001801733650001201751650002701763653002401790653001001814653002301824653002001847653001601867653002101883700001801904700002401922700001801946700001701964773010501981856008402086852000902170655001202179IND60606887320221118235852.0180730e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060688732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakai, Masaru10aDifferent cesium-137 transfers to forest and stream ecosystems  ap. 46-52.  aUnderstanding the mechanisms of ¹³⁷Cs movement across different ecosystems is crucial for projecting the environmental impact and management of nuclear contamination events. Here, we report differential movement of ¹³⁷Cs in adjacent forest and stream ecosystems. The food webs of the forest and stream ecosystems in our study were similar, in that they were both dominated by detrital-based food webs and the basal energy source was terrestrial litter. However, the concentration of ¹³⁷Cs in stream litter was significantly lower than in forest litter, the result of ¹³⁷Cs leaching from litter in stream water. The difference in ¹³⁷Cs concentrations between the two types of litter was reflected in the ¹³⁷Cs concentrations in the animal community. While the importance of ¹³⁷Cs fallout and the associated transfer to food webs has been well studied, research has been primarily limited to cases in a single ecosystem. Our results indicate that there are differences in the flow of ¹³⁷Cs through terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and that ¹³⁷Cs concentrations are reduced in both basal food resources and higher trophic animals in aquatic systems, where primary production is subsidized by a neighboring terrestrial ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communities 3aanimals 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acesium 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3afood webs 3aforest litter 3aforests 3aleaching 3aprimary productivity 3aradionuclides 3astreams 3aterrestrial ecosystems 0aDetrital food chain 0aFrogs 0aMacroinvertebrates 0aSalmonid fishes 0aRadiocesium 0aResource subsidy1 aGomi, Takashi1 aNegishi, Junjiro N.1 aIwamoto, Aimu1 aOkada, Kengo0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Feb., v. 209 p.46-52dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.11.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245017800178520164400356592002802000650000802028650001902036650002502055650001902080650001102099650001302110650001002123650001902133650003002152650001102182650001102193653003102204653002102235653003802256653001202294653001902306653001102325700006302336700002102399700002302420700002302443700002502466700003002491773013302521856008202654852000902736655001202745IND60779106420221120104803.0220719e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077910642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2022.1077842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunkongwongsiri, Natthinee10aPropionigenium and Vibrio species identified as possible component causes of shrimp white feces syndrome (WFS) associated with the microsporidian Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei  aWhite feces syndrome (WFS) in cultivated shrimp is characterized by white shrimp midguts (intestines) and white fecal strings that float as mats on pond surfaces. The etiology of WFS is complex, but one type called EHP-WFS is associated with the microsporidian Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP). The hepatopancreas (HP), midgut and fecal strings of EHP-WFS shrimp exhibit massive quantities of EHP spores together with mixed, unidentified bacteria. In EHP-WFS ponds, some EHP-infected shrimp show white midguts (WG) and produce white feces while other EHP-infected shrimp in the same pond show grossly normal midguts (NG) and produce no white feces. We hypothesized that comparison of the microbial flora between WG and NG shrimp would reveal probable combinations of microbes significantly associated with EHP-WFS. To test this, we selected a Penaeus vannamei cultivation pond exhibiting severe WFS and used microscopic and microbial profiling analyses to compare WG and NG samples. Histologically, EHP was confirmed in the HP and midgut of both WG and NG shrimp, but EHP burdens were higher and EHP tissue damage was more severe in WG shrimp. Further, intestinal microbiomes in WG shrimp were less diverse and had higher abundance of bacteria from the genera Vibrio and Propionigenium. Propionigenium burden in the HP of WG shrimp (9364 copies/100 ng DNA) was significantly higher (P = 1.1 × 10⁻⁵) than in NG shrimp (12 copies/100 ng DNA). These findings supported our hypothesis by revealing two candidate bacterial genera that should be tested in combination with EHP as potential component causes of EHP-WFS in P. vannamei.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEnterocytozoon 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aPropionigenium 3aVibrio 3aetiology 3afeces 3ahepatopancreas 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amidgut 3ashrimp 0aWhite feces syndrome (WFS) 0aPenaeus vannamei 0aEnterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) 0aEHP-WFS 0aPropionigenium 0aVibrio1 aPrachumwat, Anuphap1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2009-55241 aEamsaard, Wiraya1 aLertsiri, Kanokwan1 aFlegel, Timothy W.1 aStentiford, Grant D.1 aSritunyalucksana, Kallaya0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g2022 July, v. 192 p.107784-dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45771x0022-20117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2022.1077843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002300143245006700166300001600233500000900249520155400258592002801812650001601840650001301856650001401869650001801883650002001901650001501921650002401936650001601960650001901976650002301995650000902018650001502027650002002042650002302062651000902085700002002094773012302114852000902237856008002246655001202326IND4407418820221118202754.0191226e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440741882DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2007.01162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Bruin, Jason L.10aSoybean Cultivar and Planting Date Response to Soil Fumigation  ap. 965-970.  aepub  aSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] seed yield will be maximized by planting the last week of April or the first week of May in Iowa. Soybean cyst nematode (Heterodera glycines Ichinohe; SCN) is present in the majority of Iowa fields and may influence cultivar responses to planting date. This study was conducted to determine whether specific cultivars need to be selected based on planting date. The effects of soil fumigation, planting date, and cultivar selection were evaluated at three sites in Iowa near De Witt, Nevada, and Whiting during 2005 and 2006. These sites varied in rainfall, soil type, and SCN population densities. Yields of the first two planting dates were increased an average of 10% by fumigation and yields of the SCN-susceptible cultivar NK-S32-G5 and the SCN-resistant cultivar P91M90 increased 11%. Cultivars with the PI88788 source of SCN resistance produced greater yields than other sources of SCN resistance in the nonfumigated treatment but yields were equal among all sources of SCN resistance in the fumigated treatment. Cultivars responded similarly to planting date, with maximum yields at early dates followed by a consistent decline as planting was delayed. The combination of SCN-resistant cultivars and early planting resulted in the greatest and most consistent yields across diverse production environments. Cultivar selection should focus on high-yielding, adapted cultivars with resistance to SCN when SCN is present in a field, and these cultivars should be selected for both early and late planting dates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3acultivars 3aplanting date 3asoil fumigation 3acrop yield 3aHeterodera glycines 3aplant pests 3acyst nematodes 3apopulation density 3arain 3asoil types 3apest resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aIowa1 aPedersen, Palle0 tAgronomy journal.g2008 July, v. 100, no. 4 p.965-970dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2007.01163Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02703naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001900159245009500178300001600273500000900289500001500298520154700313592002801860650001801888650002301906650002301929650002401952650001801976650001301994650002302007653001902030700001702049700002202066773014802088852000902236856009602245655001202341IND2036622720221120205451.0191125e199307  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203662272DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1993.03615995005700040016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuster, Jörg,10aOn the Interpretation of Labile Aluminum as Determined by Reaction with 8-Hydroxyquinoline  ap. 976-980.  aepub  a2019-12-04  aThe interpretation of labile Al, as defined operationally by a 15-s reaction with 8-hydroxyquinoline, remains problematic. In solutions free of complexing ligands other than OH⁻, one question is whether the chemical species (Al(OH)⁺₂ should be included. To resolve this issue, labile Al was measured in Al(ClO₄)₃ solutions at total Al (AlT) concentrations in the range 4 to 60 µmol kg⁻¹ and pH in the range 4 to 6. In solutions equilibrated for 4 h without shaking, no effect of pH in the range 4 ≤ pH ≤ 5 on the values of labile Al was observed. Thus, Al³⁺ and all significant mononuclear hydrolytic species of Al that formed under the experimental conditions were reactive with 8-hydroxyquinoline within 15 s. Shaking the sample solutions at pH 5 throughout equilibration, however, produced a gradual decline in labile Al with concomitant changes in light scattering that indicated the formation of colloidal or macromolecular Al species that were unreactive with 8-hydroxyquinoline during a 15-s period. Even in unshaken solutions, a decline in labile Al (and the inferred formation of colloidal Al species) was observed at pH 5 if solutions with AlT > 1 mmol kg⁻¹ were used to prepare standard solutions for calibration. These results are important not only for the application of the 15-s 8-hydroxyquinoline method, but also for any experimental study of aqueous Al at pH values where Al hydrolysis is significant.

Cytoplasmic DPP9 has roles in epidermal growth factor signalling and in antigen processing, whilst the role of the recently discovered nuclear form of DPP9 is unknown. Mice lacking DPP9 proteolytic activity die as neonates. We applied a modified 2D differential in‐gel electrophoresis approach to identify novel DPP9 substrates, using mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking endogenous DPP9 activity. A total of 111 potential new DPP9 substrates were identified, with nine proteins/peptides confirmed as DPP9 substrates by MALDI‐TOF or immunoblotting. Moreover, we also identified the dipeptide Val‐Ala as a consensus site for DPP9 cleavage that was not recognized by DPP8, suggesting different in vivo roles for these closely related enzymes. The relative kinetics for the cleavage of these nine candidate substrates by DPP9, DPP8 and DPP4 were determined. This is the first identification of DPP9 substrates from cells lacking endogenous DPP9 activity. These data greatly expand the potential roles of DPP9 and suggest different in vivo roles for DPP9 and DPP8.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aconsensus sequence 3adipeptides 3aelectrophoresis 3aepidermal growth factor 3afibroblasts 3aimmunoblotting 3amice 3aneonates 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3aserine proteinases1 aMaqsudi, Sadiqa1 aRainczuk, Adam1 aDuffield, Nadine1 aLawrence, Josie1 aKeane, Fiona M.1 aJusta‐Schuch, Daniela1 aGeiss‐Friedlander, Ruth1 aGorrell, Mark D.1 aStephens, Andrew N.0 tFEBS journal.g2015 Oct., v. 282, no. 19 p.3737-3757dPublished by Blackwell Pub. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societiesx1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.133713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245010300155300001800258520042300276592002800699650002200727650001100749650002000760650001400780700001700794700001700811700001500828700001600843700001300859700001600872773013300888856007401021852000901095655001201104IND60550341420221121112926.0201214e20140324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055034142DNAL7 a10.1021/jo500312n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yulei10aCs₂CO₃-Promoted One-Pot Synthesis of Alkynylphosphonates, -phosphinates, and -phosphine Oxides  ap. 3678-3683.  aA novel and efficient Cs₂CO₃-promoted phosphorylation or phosphinylation of various 1,1-dibromo-1-alkenes with readily available trialkyl phosphites, ethyl diphenylphosphinite, or diethyl phenylphosphonite has been developed under metal-free conditions, providing a practical and powerful tool for one-pot synthesis of valuable alkynylphosphonates, -phosphinates, and -phosphine oxides in good to excellent yields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorganic chemistry 3aoxides 3aphosphorylation 3asynthesis1 aGan, Jiepeng1 aLiu, Liu Leo1 aYuan, Hang1 aGao, Yuxing1 aLiu, Yan1 aZhao, Yufen0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2014 Mar. 24, v. 79, no. 8 p.3678-3683dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jo500312n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245010000204300002000304506007600324520133900400592002801739506003701767650001201804650001401816650002101830650001101851650000901862650001201871650001301883650001301896650001401909700002201923700002401945700002401969700002401993700002102017700002402038773013502062856007802197852000902275655001202284IND60549144720221207082713.0160907e20160907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054914472DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.6b049842doi7 aPMC52665232pmcid7 a275712712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacLeod, K.

One of the key challenges is to make the products of N₂ activation reactive enough to undergo further reactions under mild conditions. This paper explores the strategy of “alkali control,” where the presence of an alkali metal cation enables the reduction of N₂ under mild conditions, and then chelation of the alkali metal cation uncovers a highly reactive species that can break benzylic C–H bonds to give new N–H and Fe–C bonds. The ability to “turn on” this C–H activation pathway with 18-crown-6 is demonstrated with three different N₂ reduction products of N₂ cleavage in an iron–potassium system. The alkali control strategy can also turn on an intermolecular reaction of an N₂-derived nitride with methyl tosylate that gives a new N–C bond. Since the transient K⁺-free intermediate reacts with this electrophile but not with the weak C–H bonds in 1,4-cyclohexadiene, it is proposed that the C–H cleavage occurs by a deprotonation mechanism. The combined results demonstrate that a K⁺ ion can mask the latent nucleophilicity of N₂-derived nitride and imide ligands within a trimetallic iron system and points a way toward control over N₂ functionalization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acations 3achelation 3achemical bonding 3aimides 3airon 3aligands 3anitrides 3anitrogen 3apotassium1 aMenges, Fabian

A useful tool for mapping chromatin structure is micrococcal nuclease (MNase), which induces double-strand breaks within nucleosome linker regions, and with more extensive digestion, single-strand nicks within the nucleosome itself. Many studies, carried out largely with microbes and cell cultures, have used MNase to determine the positions of nucleosomes within a region of DNA to identify dynamic changes induced during gene regulation. To measure similar processes in a developmental context, we turned to a tractable model system, the Drosophila embryo. Here we describe a protocol that enables MNase mapping of the enhancer chromatin structure in the embryo, and show how it can be used to identify structural changes on a cis-regulatory element targeted by the Knirps repressor.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3acell culture 3adigestion 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3amicrococcal nuclease 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3anucleosomes 3aprotocols1 aArnosti, David N.0 tFly.g2010 July 1, v. 4, no. 3 p.213-215dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.4.3.122003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01686naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245013000155300002000285500001900305520056100324592002800885650001500913650001400928650002200942650002400964700001800988700002101006700002001027700002801047700001901075700002201094773013701116856007401253852000901327655001201336IND60710551420221122030334.0200911e20200910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071055142DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc04509h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Yusen10aIs electron ping-pong limiting the catalytic hydrogen evolution activity in covalent photosensitizer–polyoxometalate dyads?  ap. 10485-10488.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding the limitations of catalytic processes enables the design of optimized catalysts.

However, whether the change in light availability affects the bioeffects of MPs on surrounding microalgae is currently unknown. This study investigated the effects of micron-sized polyvinyl chloride (mPVC, 143.5 μm) microplastics, alone and in combination with light intensity (from 7.5 to 162.5 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹) on the growth and physiology of Desmodesmus sp. Although mPVC did not impact microalgal growth under optimal light (40 and 93.8 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹), it could induce a no-contact shading effect, thereby significantly affecting the physiology of Desmodesmus sp. The growth of Desmodesmus sp. exposed to mPVC was enhanced under a high light intensity of 162.5 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹ which can induce growth inhibition but was retarded when under a light inadequacy condition (20 μmol·m⁻²·s⁻¹), along with a dose-dependent effect. Significantly, the photosynthesis of Desmodesmus sp. was a highly sensitive metabolic pathway to mPVC stress and largely influenced by the plastic particles under different light conditions. Additionally, mPVC modulated the energy metabolism strategy of Desmodesmus sp., depending on exposure dose and external light availability. Our findings provided a critical basis for the risk assessment of MPs in fluctuating light conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesmodesmus 3abioactive properties 3abiochemical pathways 3adose response 3agrowth retardation 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3amicroplastics 3aphotosynthesis 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3arisk assessment 3atoxicology 0aMicroplastics 0aLight intensity 0aDesmodesmus sp. 0aInteractive effect 0aPhotosynthesis1 aJiang, Lijuan1 aHuang, Wenxi1 aWang, Changhai1 aHe, Meilin0 tAquatic toxicology.g2022 Aug., v. 249 p.106234-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2022.1062343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02678naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010400168300001600272500002000288520162900308592002801937650002501965650001101990650001202001650001002013650002502023650001402048700002302062700001802085700001502103700002202118773010002140856007902240852000902319655001202328IND60571793820221119162454.0170712e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057179382DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.127662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouslay, Thomas M.10aMating opportunities and energetic constraints drive variation in age‐dependent sexual signalling  ap. 728-741.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhen males repeatedly produce energetically expensive sexual signals, trade‐offs between current and future investment can cause plasticity in age‐dependent signalling. Such variation is often interpreted as alternate adaptive strategies: live fast and die young vs. slow and steady. An alternative (yet rarely tested) explanation is that condition‐dependent constraints on allocation cause variation in signalling with age (‘late bloomers’ do not have early investment options). Testing this hypothesis is challenging because resource acquisition and allocation are difficult to measure, and energetic reserves both affect and are affected by reproductive effort. We simultaneously manipulated acquisition (through dietary nutrition) and access to potential mates (as a proxy for manipulating sexual trait allocation) in male decorated crickets (Gryllodes sigillatus), while measuring age‐ and signalling effort‐mediated changes in energy storage components. Increased diet quality caused increased signalling effort and energy storage, while access to females increased both the likelihood of and time spent signalling. Males with lower resource budgets signalled less, but still suffered energetic storage loss and viability costs. Our results suggest that energetic constraints, rather than strategic resource accumulation, reduced signalling levels in males with lower resource acquisition ability. Our findings imply a non‐adaptive explanation for age‐dependent variation in sexual signalling, and an important role for energetic constraints in maintaining the honesty of costly behavioural displays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGryllodes sigillatus 3aenergy 3afemales 3amales 3anutritional adequacy 3aviability1 aHouslay, Kirsty F.1 aRapkin, James1 aHunt, John1 aBussière, Luc F.0 tFunctional ecology.g2017 Mar., v. 31, no. 3 p.728-741dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.127663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02857naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148242055700175245013100732300001800863520112400881592002802005596007902033650001802112650001602130650001702146650001102163650001502174650001602189650001002205700001902215700001602234700002502250773012802275856008302403852000902486655001202495IND60644766120221116200918.0200819e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064476612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-018-01921-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJúnez-Ferreira, H.

Those that employ geostatistical techniques are usually dependent on a variogram. In practice, different variograms for an environmental variable can be fitted depending on the number of available data, their spatial distribution, and their variability. For this reason, in most cases, it is difficult to get an adequate variogram. This report evaluates the influence of the groundwater level data available in the construction of a product-sum spatiotemporal variogram model and its consequences on a geostatistical-based methodology that uses the Kalman filter for the design of optimal spatiotemporal monitoring networks. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the variations in the optimal number of wells and monitoring frequency for the monitoring network, depending on the selected spatiotemporal variogram model. The results show the importance of getting a good quality spatiotemporal variogram when designing optimal groundwater-level monitoring networks using geostatistical-based methodologies.  aPublisher supplied data  aPhD student fellowshipcConsejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnolog?a (CONACYT) 3ageostatistics 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeology 3amodels 3amonitoring 3awater table 3awells1 aHerrera, G.

Although direct neurorrhaphy in the early phase may reduce its devastating effects, direct end-to-end neurorrhaphy is sometimes impossible owing to a defect at the injured site of the nerve. Autogenous nerve graft is a primary consideration for peripheral nerve defects; however, significant morbidity of the donor site is inevitable. Recently, the treatment using engineered synthetic nerve conduits has been regarded as a promising strategy to promote the regeneration of peripheral nerve defects. In this study, we developed longitudinally oriented collagen hydrogel-grafted elastic nerve guidance conduits (NGC) to reconstruct sciatic nerve defects. An elastic NGC was prepared by using poly(lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL), and electrospun PLCL was adopted to fabricate nanoporous structures with appropriate permeability for nerve regeneration. Oriented collagen hydrogels were prepared by the 3D printing method to achieve a microscale hydrogel pattern. Based on sciatic nerve injury models in rats, we confirmed the beneficial effects of the NGC with 3D printed collagen hydrogel on axonal regeneration and remyelination along with superior functional recovery in comparison with the NGC filled with the bulk collagen hydrogel. It is believed that the aligned collagen hydrogels provide a preferable environment for nerve regeneration, functioning as an oriented guidance path. In conclusion, the PLCL nerve guide conduit containing a 3D printed aligned collagen hydrogel can be useful for peripheral nerve regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3acollagen 3ahydrogels 3amorbidity 3ananopores 3anerve regeneration 3anerve tissue 3apermeability 3athree-dimensional printing 3atissue transplantation1 aPark, Ji Hun1 aKwon, Young Woo1 aChung, Justin J.1 aChoi, In Cheul1 aNam, Jae Joon1 aLee, Hyun Su1 aJeon, Eun Young1 aLee, Kangwon1 aKim, Soo Hyun1 aJung, Youngmee1 aPark, Jong Woong0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 8, no. 22 p.6261-6271dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0bm00847h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03652naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100006300169245008400232300001400316500002000330520183800350592002802188596002702216596003002243596006702273596008002340596007902420596006302499596006002562596006102622650003002683650001002713650003102723650001002754650001602764650002502780650002202805650001502827650001202842651001202854700002702866700002002893700001902913700002702932773010502959856007303064852000903137655001203146IND60626835720221122053426.0190101e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062683572DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.125982doi7 a10.1111/ibi.125982chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFremgen, Aleshia L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3530-096210aWeather conditions and date influence male Sage Grouse attendance rates at leks  ap. 35-49.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFor lek‐breeding birds, lek attendance can be correlated with mating success. Variability in lek attendance could confound interpretation of male reproductive effort and complicate the use of lek counts as an index to monitor abundance. We assessed the daily probability of male Sage Grouse Centrocercus urophasianus lek attendance and explored implications of attendance on lek counts. We fitted 145 males with global positioning system (GPS) transmitters over 4 years in Carbon County, Wyoming. We evaluated influences of lek size and topography, date, weather, and bird characteristics such as age on daily morning lek attendance. The daily probability of attendance ranged considerably each year, from 0.120 (x¯, 95% CI 0.051–0.259) in 2012 to 0.917 (95% CI 0.844–0.957) in 2013 with peak attendance dates ranging from 8 April (2012) to 11 May (2011). Attendance decreased with increasing precipitation on the observation day. Only 44–79% of lek counts occurred on days without precipitation and with high attendance (i.e. within 0.1 probability of peak predicted attendance). Although lek counts and population abundance, predicted using attendance rates, followed a similar trend, the relationship was not significantly correlated. We provide empirical evidence supporting current lek‐count protocols: managers should avoid counting leks on days with precipitation because attendance is reduced. Although managers sometimes only complete one to two lek counts per year on active leks, completing at least three lek counts as recommended in protocols increases chances for higher male counts and improves the relationship between counts and abundance. Attendance varies annually, making it challenging to use lek counts to assess regional population trends over short time periods unless attendance is accounted for.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Missouri  cBureau of Land Management  cU.S. Department of Energy National Renewable Energy Laboratory  a13‐CO‐11221632‐007cWestern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies  a13‐JV11221632‐046cU.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station  a11‐CO‐11221632‐018cWyoming Game and Fish Department  a10‐ CO‐11221632‐238cPower Company of Wyoming LLC  a10‐CO‐11221632‐238cSWCA Environmental Consultants 3aCentrocercus urophasianus 3abirds 3aglobal positioning systems 3amales 3aprobability 3areproductive success 3aspecies abundance 3atopography 3aweather 3aWyoming1 aHansen, Christopher P.1 aRumble, Mark A.1 aGamo, R.

To protect the gut microbiota during treatment with antibiotics, use of activated carbon (AC) has recently been reported as a method to adsorb antibiotics. However, the antibiotic adsorption by AC is nonspecific and may also result in the adsorption of essential biological molecules. In this work, we reported that an anion exchange resin (AER) has better specificity than AC for adsorbing the β-lactam antibiotic cefoperazone (CEF). Because CEF has a negatively charged carboxylate group and a conjugated system, the AER was used to adsorb CEF through electrostatic and π–π interactions. The AER was specific for CEF over biological molecules such as bile acids and vitamins in the intestine. The AER protected Escherichia coli from CEF in vitro. Furthermore, oral administration of the AER reduced the fecal free CEF concentration, and protected the gut microbiota from CEF-induced dysbiosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aanion exchange resins 3abile 3abiocompatible materials 3acefoperazone 3adysbiosis 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3aoral administration1 aYakabe, Kyosuke1 aZai, Khadijah1 aLiu, Yiwei1 aKishimura, Akihiro1 aHase, Koji1 aKim, Yun-Gi1 aMori, Takeshi1 aKatayama, Yoshiki0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 9, no. 21 p.7219-7227dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1bm00958c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100007000151245011300221300001600334520157300350592002801923650002601951650001201977650001001989650002201999650001302021650001402034650001302048650001202061650000702073650000902080650002502089653001702114653002602131653001502157653001702172653001302189653001102202700002702213700002402240700003202264700002002296700004002316700002902356700002602385773010902411856008602520852000902606655001202615IND60637987220221121045913.0190509e20190727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063798722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.04.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagalhães, Deniete Soares1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1487-316310aChanges in the physical and physico-chemical characteristics of red-pulp dragon fruit during its development  ap. 180-186.  aThe red-fleshed dragon fruit (Hylocereus polyrhizus) has high functional potential; however, but there have been only few studies on it. Knowledge about the changes that occur during fruit development facilitates the adoption of strategies that address issues related to fruit management, quality, conservation, and harvest. The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality evolution of red-fleshed dragon fruit at different development stages and to ascertain the ideal season for fruit harvest. The following parameters were evaluated: fruit, pulp and skin weight, yield, longitudinal and transverse diameter, firmness, skin thickness, pH, soluble solids, acidity, pulp and skin color. Measurements were taken every two days, from 28 to 42 days after anthesis. Significant physical and physico-chemical changes occured in red-fleshed dragon fruit during its development, including increase in soluble solids, pH, diameter and mass, as well as decrease in acidity, firmness, and skin thickness. Skin color and external appearance were found to be good indicators of the degree of maturity and can be thus be used to determine the fruit harvest point. From 34 to 42 days, the fruits showed characteristics appropriate for consumption and commercialization. Our findings demonstrate that the fruit should be harvested atat 34 days of anthesis or when the fruit skin is predominantly reddish, when destined to more distant markets. For marketing in nearby markets and immediate consumption, fruits should be harvested after 36 days or with intense red coloration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHylocereus polyrhizus 3aacidity 3acolor 3acommercialization 3afirmness 3aflowering 3afruiting 3amarkets 3apH 3apulp 3atotal soluble solids 0aDragon fruit 0aHylocereus polyrhizus 0aMaturation 0aPost-harvest 0aRipening 0aGrowth1 ada Silva, Diogo Mendes1 aRamos, José Darlan1 aSalles Pio, Leila Aparecida1 aPasqual, Moacir1 aVilas Boas, Eduardo Valério Barros1 aGalvão, Elaine Cristina1 ade Melo, Evaldo Tadeu0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 July 27, v. 253 p.180-186dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.04.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010800171300001600279520146000295592002801755650002501783650002501808650001201833650001901845650001301864650002301877650001001900650001101910650001201921650001501933650002501948650001401973650001701987650002302004650002202027651001202049773013002061856008402191852000902275655001202284IND60123410620221121033059.0150325e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012341062DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2012.6948372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaeding, Lynn R.10aAre Yellowstone Lake Temperatures More Suitable to Nonnative Lake Trout than to Native Cutthroat Trout?  ap. 848-852.  aA recent study revealed limitations to the reproduction potential of Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri (YCT) in Yellowstone Lake, Wyoming, resulting from suboptimal conditions for somatic growth. The present study evaluated the lake as suitable thermal habitat for YCT and lake trout Salvelinus namaycush , a highly piscivorous, nonnative species, a reproducing population of which was discovered there in 1994. Because the fundamental thermal niche of lake trout delimits a zone of the lake's annual temperature profile that surrounds the corresponding, separate zone for YCT, the annual growing season and volume of suitable Yellowstone Lake habitat will invariably be larger for lake trout than YCT across the range of cool-to-warm climate years. Ongoing management actions to control lake trout emphasize intensive gill netting, while temporal changes in lake trout catch rates and population structure provide metrics of program success. However, the limits to YCT reproduction potential attributed to the short growing season make the YCT population especially susceptible to lake trout predation, perhaps even from a measurably reduced predator population. Identification of such effects requires that dynamic, age-structured models of the YCT population that incorporate all important population drivers be formulated and used in data analyses and control program assessment.

Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of single gene intellectual disability (ID) and is frequently associated with autism. Our results suggest that dfmr1 mutants are less active than wild-type flies and interact with each other less often. In addition, mutants for one allele of dfmr1, dfmr1ᴮ⁵⁵, are more likely to come in close contact with a wild-type fly than another dfmr1ᴮ⁵⁵ mutant. Our results raise the possibility of defective social expression with preserved receptive abilities. We further suggest that the assay may be applied in a general strategy of examining endophenoypes of complex human neurological disorders in Drosophila, and specifically in order to understand the genetic basis of social interaction defects linked with ID.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aalleles 3aassays 3aautism 3ahumans 3amutants 3anervous system diseases 3asocial behavior 0aFragile X 0anovel assay1 aValente, Dan1 aNguyen, Antoinette T.1 aMitra, Partha P.1 aTully, Tim0 tFly.g2010 July 1, v. 4, no. 3 p.216-225dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.4.3.122803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245010700159500001900266520173500285592002802020650002202048650002002070650002202090650001502112650002002127650002802147650001702175650001302192700001602205700001302221700001502234773011802249856007602367852000902443655001202452IND60732126120221119203929.0210326e20210308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073212612DNAL7 a10.3390/land100302752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lingyue 10aAgricultural Land Use Change in Chongqing and the Policy Rationale behind It: A Multiscale Perspective  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAgricultural land resources have been the central issue for the Chinese government in its attempts to secure food and agricultural sustainability. Yet strict land use control does not protect the agricultural land from erosion by urban expansion. Identifying the specific patterns and mechanisms of the agricultural land conversion, thus, is critical for land management and related decision making. Based on the annual nominal 30 m land use/land cover datasets (called CLUD-A), this study goes below the national/regional level to examine agricultural land conversion in Chongqing from a multiscale perspective. At the metropolis and its subdivision’s scales, the volume of the conversion area has been generally increasing, from 122.40 km² in 1980–1990, 162.26 km² in 1990–2000, and 706.14 km² in 2000–2010, to 684.83 km² in 2010–2015. Such a conversion in the main city area and its surroundings far outweighed that in the rural outskirts, as 68.9% (1990–2000), 92.2% (2000–2010), and 82.7% (2010–2015) of the conversion happened in the former. Moreover, values of Gini coefficients and coefficient of variation (CV) based on the county/district scale (Gini [0.46, 0.64], CV [0.69, 0.99] throughout the four periods) are much lower than those based on the town/village scale (Gini [0.88, 0.94], CV [3.18, 4.47] throughout the four periods), suggesting the uneven extent of spatial distribution of the agricultural land conversion trickles down along with the downscale of administration: the lower the administrative level, the more severe the unbalance. The policy rationale behind this transition is also discussed. This research argues for tangible approaches to a sustainable rural-urban transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3adata collection 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aland use change 3asustainable agriculture 3aurbanization 3avillages1 aQi, Zhixin 1 aXianshi,1 aYao, Dong 0 tLand.g2021 Mar. 08, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land100302753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03343naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245009800174300001600272520192700288592002802215650002602243650001502269650001902284650000902303650001302312650001902325650001402344650002602358650002202384650001302406650001602419653002402435653001602459653002402475653002902499653003102528653002502559700002502584700002102609700002102630700002002651773010602671856008702777852000902864655001202873IND60610890420221118221336.0190705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061089042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodgers, Essie M.10aPlastic responses to diel thermal variation in juvenile green sturgeon, Acipenser medirostris  ap. 147-155.  aHuman-induced thermal variability can disrupt energy balance and performance in ectotherms; however, phenotypic plasticity may play a pivotal protective role. Ectotherm performance can be maintained in thermally heterogeneous habitats by reducing the thermal sensitivity of physiological processes and concomitant performance. We examined the capacity of juvenile green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) to respond to daily thermal variation. Juveniles (47 days post-hatch) were exposed to either stable (15 ± 0.5 °C) or variable (narrowly variable: 13–17 °C day−1 or widely variable 11–21 °C day−1) thermoperiod treatments, with equivalent mean temperatures (15 ± 0.5 °C), for 21 days. Growth (relative growth rate, % body mass gain), upper thermal tolerance (critical thermal maxima, CTMax) and the thermal sensitivity of swimming performance (critical swimming speed, Ucrit) were assessed in fish from all treatments. Accelerated growth was observed in fish maintained under widely variable temperatures compared to narrowly variable and stable temperatures. No significant variation in CTMax was observed among thermoperiod treatments, suggesting all treatment groups acclimated to the mean temperature rather than daily maximums. The widely variable treatment induced a plastic response in swimming performance, where Ucrit was insensitive to temperature and performance was maintained across a widened thermal breadth. Maximum Ucrit attained was similar among thermoperiod treatments, but performance was maximised at different test temperatures (stable: 4.62 ± 0.44 BL s−1 at 15 °C; narrowly variable: 4.52 ± 0.23 BL s−1 at 21 °C; widely variable: 3.90 ± 0.24 BL s−1 at 11 °C, mean ± s.e.m.). In combination, these findings suggest juvenile A. medirostris are resilient to daily fluctuations in temperature, within the temperature range tested here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser medirostris 3aectothermy 3aenergy balance 3afish 3ahabitats 3aheat tolerance 3ajuveniles 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aprotective effect 3aswimming 3atemperature 0aThermal variability 0aAcclimation 0aThermal sensitivity 0aOscillating temperatures 0aThermal performance curves 0aSwimming performance1 aCocherell, Dennis E.1 aNguyen, Trinh X.1 aTodgham, Anne E.1 aFangue, Nann A.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2018 Aug., v. 76 p.147-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03589naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013500170300001600305520192000321592002802241650004302269650002102312650001902333650002302352650002202375650002002397650002202417650001102439650003402450650001402484650001502498650002402513650001802537650001502555650002702570650000902597650001602606650001702622650002502639650002402664650003502688650001302723700002302736700002002759700001902779700002002798700002102818773011802839856008102957852000903038655001203047IND60572557920221119210755.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057255792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-017-2857-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauchet, Guillaume10aUse of modern tomato breeding germplasm for deciphering the genetic control of agronomical traits by Genome Wide Association study  ap. 875-889.  aKEY MESSAGE: A panel of 300 tomato accessions including breeding materials was built and characterized with >11,000 SNP. A population structure in six subgroups was identified. Strong heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium and recombination landscape among groups and chromosomes was shown. GWAS identified several associations for fruit weight, earliness and plant growth. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become a method of choice in quantitative trait dissection. First limited to highly polymorphic and outcrossing species, it is now applied in horticultural crops, notably in tomato. Until now GWAS in tomato has been performed on panels of heirloom and wild accessions. Using modern breeding materials would be of direct interest for breeding purpose. To implement GWAS on a large panel of 300 tomato accessions including 168 breeding lines, this study assessed the genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium decay and revealed the population structure and performed GWA experiment. Genetic diversity and population structure analyses were based on molecular markers (>11,000 SNP) covering the whole genome. Six genetic subgroups were revealed and associated to traits of agronomical interest, such as fruit weight and disease resistance. Estimates of linkage disequilibrium highlighted the heterogeneity of its decay among genetic subgroups. Haplotype definition allowed a fine characterization of the groups and their recombination landscape revealing the patterns of admixture along the genome. Selection footprints showed results in congruence with introgressions. Taken together, all these elements refined our knowledge of the genetic material included in this panel and allowed the identification of several associations for fruit weight, plant growth and earliness, deciphering the genetic architecture of these complex traits and identifying several new loci useful for tomato breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aagronomic traits 3abreeding lines 3adisease resistance 3aearly development 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3agenome-wide association study 3agermplasm 3ahaplotypes 3ahorticultural crops 3aintrogression 3alandscapes 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3aoutcrossing 3aplant growth 3apopulation structure 3aquantitative traits 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atomatoes1 aGrenier, Stéphane1 aSamson, Nicolas1 aBonnet, Julien1 aGrivet, Laurent1 aCausse, Mathilde0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2017 May, v. 130, no. 5 p.875-889dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-017-2857-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245008700201300001600288500002000304520092300324592002801247650003001275650001701305650001001322650001201332650003101344650001001375650002401385650001401409700002101423700002401444773010701468856007301575852000901648655001201657IND60626835820221122053405.0190101e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062683582DNAL7 a10.1111/ibi.126702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDudko, Jonathan E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3534-079910aMovements of female Sage Grouse Centrocercus urophasianus during incubation recess  ap. 222-229.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe combined GPS data‐loggers, VHF transmitters and DVR video‐monitoring to measure fine‐scale movement patterns during daily incubation recesses by female Sage Grouse Centrocercus urophasianus, a species with uniparental incubation that has experienced widespread population decline and distributional contraction. Most (69.6%) Sage Grouse recess activity was highly localized within a core recess area averaging 2.58 ± 0.64 ha, and females remained within 242.3 ± 30.0 m from the nest during recesses (total recess areas were 11.06 ± 2.27 ha). Visually conspicuous Sage Grouse movements near nests at the start and end of recesses and consistent occupation of core recess areas point to a mechanism for newly abundant predators such as the Northern Raven Corvus corax to detect and depredate Sage Grouse nests. Our methods apply to other avian species of scientific interest and conservation concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentrocercus urophasianus 3aCorvus corax 3abirds 3afemales 3aglobal positioning systems 3anests 3apopulation dynamics 3apredators1 aCoates, Peter S.1 aDelehanty, David J.0 tIbis.g2019 Jan., v. 161, no. 1 p.222-229dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949850x0019-10197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ibi.126703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015500155300001800310520094900328592002801277650002101305650001501326650002801341650002101369650001101390650001401401650002401415650001501439650000701454650002401461650001501485700001801500700002101518700001501539700001901554700001901573700002201592700002001614773013001634856007501764852000901839655001201848IND60754973320221118042540.0211027e20211026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075497332DNAL7 a10.1039/d1bm00970b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Peng10aBiodegradable polycaprolactone metallopolymer–antibiotic bioconjugates containing phenylboronic acid and cobaltocenium for antimicrobial application  ap. 7237-7246.  aThis paper reports antimicrobial metallopolymers containing biodegradable polycaprolactone as the backbone with boronic acid and cobaltocenium as the side chain. While boronic acid promotes interactions with bacterial cells via boronolectin with lipopolysaccharides, cationic cobaltocenium facilitates the unique complexation with anionic β-lactam antibiotics. The synergistic interactions in these metallopolymer–antibiotic bioconjugates were evidenced by re-sensitized efficacy of penicillin-G against four different Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae). The degradability of the polyester backbone was validated through tests under physiological pH (7.4) and acidic pH (5.5) or under enzymatic conditions. These metallopolymers exhibited time-dependent uptake and reduction of cobalt metals in different organs of mice via in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aabsorption 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3acobalt 3aexcretion 3alipopolysaccharides 3ametabolism 3apH 3aphenylboronic acids 3apolyesters1 aLuo, Yuanyuan1 aKurnaz, Leman B.1 aBam, Marpe1 aYang, Xiaoming1 aDecho, Alan W.1 aNagarkatti, Mitzi1 aTang, Chuanbing0 tBiomaterials science.g2021 Oct. 26, v. 9, no. 21 p.7237-7246dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1bm00970b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008800158300001800246520164000264592002801904650000801932650002701940650002801967650001401995650001102009650003902020650001102059650001102070650001502081650002002096650001202116650001302128650001302141650001302154700002002167700003002187700002502217700003202242700002502274700002402299700002302323773016502346856007402511852000902585655001202594IND60419357920221119232450.0151002e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6041935792DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.133822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Meghna10aLigand‐induced conformation changes drive ATP hydrolysis and function in SMARCAL1  ap. 3841-3859.  aMutations and deletions in SMARCAL1, an SWI2/SNF2 protein, cause Schimke immuno‐osseous dysplasia (SIOD). SMARCAL1 preferentially binds to DNA molecules possessing double‐stranded to single‐stranded transition regions and mediates annealing helicase activity. The protein is critical for alleviating replication stress and maintaining genome integrity. In this study, we have analysed the ATPase activity of three mutations – A468P, I548N and S579L – present in SIOD patients. These mutations are present in RecA‐like domain I of the protein. Analysis using active DNA‐dependent ATPase A domain (ADAAD), an N‐terminal deleted construct of bovine SMARCAL1, showed that all three mutants were unable to hydrolyse ATP. Conformational studies indicated that the α‐helix and β‐sheet content of the mutant proteins was altered compared to the wild‐type protein. Molecular simulation studies confirmed that major structural changes had occurred in the mutant proteins. These changes included alteration of a loop region connecting motif Ia and II. As motif Ia has been implicated in DNA binding, ligand binding studies were done using fluorescence spectroscopy. These studies revealed that the Kd for protein–DNA interaction in the presence of ATP was indeed altered in the case of mutant proteins compared to the wild‐type. Finally, in vivo studies were done to complement the in vitro and in silico studies. The results from these experiments demonstrate that mutations in human SMARCAL1 that result in loss in ATPase activity lead to increased replication stress and therefore possibly manifestation of SIOD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aannealing 3acattle 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3agenome 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ain vivo studies 3amutants 3amutation 3apatients 3aproteins1 aMazumder, Mohit1 aDhatchinamoorthy, Karthik1 aNongkhlaw, Macmillan1 aHaokip, Dominic Thangminlen1 aGourinath, Samudrala1 aKomath, Sneha Sudha1 aMuthuswami, Rohini0 tFEBS journal.g2015 Oct., v. 282, no. 19 p.3841-3859dPublished by Blackwell Pub. on behalf of the Federation of European Biochemical Societiesx1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.133823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010100172300001400273520153100287592002801818650001301846650001401859650001301873650001001886650000901896650001001905650002101915653001001936653000701946653000801953653001301961653000701974653000801981653000701989653000801996653000802004653000802012653000802020653000802028653000802036653001902044653002402063653002302087653001602110653001902126700001902145700002502164700005702189700002302246700002102269773010402290856008702394852000902481655001202490IND60610890520221118221445.0190705e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061089052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoussey, Gilles10aInteractions between perceived exertion and thermal perception in the heat in endurance athletes  ap. 68-76.  aThe study aimed to investigate how a distortion of perceived exertion in the heat may affect, during a self-paced cycling exercise preceded by prior cognitive task, the thermal perception and the subsequent regulation of power output in high level athletes.Eleven endurance trained male athletes completed four experimental sessions including a 30-min fixed-RPE (15-Hard) cycling exercise in neutral (TMP-22 °C) and hot (HOT-37 °C) conditions, following a 60-min incongruent Stroop task (EXP) or passively watching documentary films (CON). Central and peripheral performances of the knee extensors were assessed before the cognitive task and after the exercise.Although mental demand and effort were higher in EXP (P < 0.05), no effect of prior cognitive task was observed on subjective feelings of mental fatigue or decline in power output at a fixed RPE. Average exercise intensity was lower in HOT than TMP (3.14 ± 0.09 W⋅kg−1vs. 3.42 ± 0.10 W⋅kg−1 respectively, P < 0.05). Skin temperature and warmth sensations were higher in HOT throughout the exercise (P < 0.05) but not thermal comfort. Central and peripheral parameters were not affected more in HOT than in TMP.Although the effects of combined stressors on the distortion of perceived exertion could not be verified, the greater decline in power output recorded in HOT than TMP suggest a high contribution of both perceptual and cardiovascular responses in the regulation of work rate when the subject is in mild hyperthermia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletes 3acognition 3aexercise 3afever 3aheat 3amales 3askin temperature 0aANOVA 0aHR 0aMVC 0aNASA-TLX 0aPO 0aPPO 0aRH 0aRPE 0aVT1 0aVT2 0aTCO 0aTSK 0aVAL 0aMental fatigue 0aSelf-paced exercise 0aPerceived exertion 0aHeat strain 0aTraining level1 aGruet, Mathieu1 aVercruyssen, Fabrice1 aLouis, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9109-09581 aVallier, Jean-Marc1 aBernard, Thierry0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2018 Aug., v. 76 p.68-76dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2018.07.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245012000168520134000288592002801628650002201656650000801678650001201686650001001698650001401708650001701722650003801739650001701777650001301794650001501807650004301822650001701865651001201882700002201894700002301916700002401939700002301963700002201986773013202008856007802140852000902218655001202227IND60768528720221116181603.0220225e20220122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076852872DNAL7 a10.3390/vetsci90200402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenadi, Salah Eddine10aSerological, Molecular Prevalence and Genotyping of Coxiella burnetii in Dairy Cattle Herds in Northeastern Algeria  aIn Algeria, data on the epidemiology of coxiellosis in cattle are still lacking. In this study, bulk tank milk (BTM) samples from 200 randomly selected dairy cattle herds from Setif province of Algeria were analyzed by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results highlighted that 37% (95% CI: 30.31–43.69%) and 9% (95% CI: 5.03–12.96%) of BTM samples contained Coxiella burnetii antibodies and DNA, respectively. Based on Cohen’s kappa coefficient, a very low agreement between the ELISA and PCR results was found (k = 0.0849) (95% CI: 0.00–0.189). For a second experiment, 186 whole blood samples of cows from farms with reproduction disorders were analyzed by molecular tools to detect C. burnetii. This study revealed an overall prevalence of 6.98% (95% CI: 3.32–10.65%). All positive samples determined by conventional PCR were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Eleven samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values lower than 35 were selected for genotyping by the multispacer sequence typing (MST) method. The MST12 genotype in BTM samples, the MST32 genotype and a new MST genotype (partial profile) in whole blood samples were identified. Obtained results have allowed us to better understand the epidemiology of bovine coxiellosis in the region of Setif.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aDNA 3aQ fever 3ablood 3abulk milk 3adairy cattle 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepidemiology 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areproduction 3aAlgeria1 aChisu, Valentina 1 aSantucciu, Cinzia 1 aDi Domenico, Marco 1 aCurini, Valentina 1 aMasala, Giovanna 0 tVeterinary sciences.g2022 Jan. 22, v. 9, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27139x2306-73817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/vetsci90200403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01200naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245011600216500002200332500002200354520025700376592002800633650001100661650001200672650001600684700002500700700002600725773006600751856008400817852000900901655001200910IND60613787020221122054516.0180914s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061378702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2014.01.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreiro Garcia, Ramon1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9466-862010aRETRACTION: Design study of a trilateral regenerative quasi-Rankine thermal cycle efficient at low temperatures  aPre-press version  aPre-press version  aThis article has been withdrawn at the request of the author(s) and/or editor.

Vegetation dynamics as well as soil wind erosion control effects are very important for assessing the ecological success of sandstorm control programs in China. However, no comprehensive evaluation of vegetation dynamics and soil wind erosion control effects in this region has been achieved. In this study, we illustrate the vegetation and soil wind erosion dynamics of sandstorm control programs in the northern Shanxi Province using remote sensing data and soil wind erosion models. There was a significant increase in vegetation cover for 63.59% of the study area from 2001 to 2014 and a significant decrease for 2.00% of the study area. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) showed that the largest increase occurred in autumn. Soil wind erosion mass decreased from 20.90 million tons in 2001 to 7.65 million tons in 2014. Compared with 2001, the soil wind erosion moduli were reduced by 43.05%, 36.16%, and 62.66% in 2005, 2010, and 2014, respectively. Spatially, soil wind erosion in most of the study area was alleviated between 2001 and 2014. The relationship between NDVI and soil wind erosion mass showed that the increased vegetation coverage reduced the soil wind erosion mass. In addition, wind was the main driving force behind the soil wind erosion dynamics. The results indicate that the vegetation coverage has increased and soil wind erosion mass has been reduced following the implementation of the sandstorm control programs. However, the ecological effects of the sandstorm control programs may vary over different periods. While the programs appear to be beneficial in the short term, there may be unintended consequences in the long term. Research on the sustainability of the ecological benefits of sandstorm control programs needs to be conducted in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautumn 3adesertification 3adust storms 3aenvironmental impact 3aerosion control 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3asoil 3asoil erosion models 3aspatial data 3avegetation cover 3awind 3awind erosion 3aChina1 aWang, Mingyue1 aZhang, Hong1 aDu, Ziqiang0 tFrontiers of earth science.g2019 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.430-443dHigher Education PresswJournal:J000001783x2095-01957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11707-018-0715-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010300177300001400280500001900294520119800313592002801511650002101539650001801560650001801578650001401596650001701610650001401627650001301641650001901654650001401673650001801687650002501705650002301730650002801753650001101781650001301792650001701805653002701822653001201849653001701861653002301878653002301901700001901924700002301943700003101966700002101997700002202018700002202040700002402062700002602086700002402112700002102136700002502157700001902182700002702201773011002228856008602338852000902424655001202433IND60731398820221118191337.0210408e20210410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073139882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharoyko, Vladimir V.10aBiocompatibility of a nanocomposite based on Aerosil 380 and carboxylated fullerene C60[C(COOH)2]3  ap. 83-98.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSilica is silicon dioxide, which, depending on the production method, can exist in various amorphous forms with varying specific surface area, particle size, pore volume and size, and, as a result, with different physicochemical and sorption characteristics. The presence of silanol groups on the surface of silicas provides the possibility of its further functionalisation. In addition, the developed specific surface of Aerosil allows to obtain composites with a high content of biologically active substances. In this work, we studied the biocompatibility of a composite based on Aerosil 380 and carboxylated fullerene C₆₀[C(COOH)₂]₃, namely: haemolysis (spontaneous and photoinduced), platelet aggregation, binding to HSA, cyto- and genotoxicity, antiradical activity. Interest in the creation of this nanomaterial is due to the fact that carboxylated fullerenes have potential applications in various fields of biomedicine, including the ability to bind reactive oxygen species, inhibition of tumour development, inactivation of viruses and bacteria. The obtained composite can be used for the immobilisation of various drugs and the further development of drugs for theranostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3abiotechnology 3acarboxylation 3afullerene 3agenotoxicity 3ahemolysis 3amedicine 3ananocomposites 3aneoplasms 3aparticle size 3aplatelet aggregation 3aprecision medicine 3areactive oxygen species 3asilica 3asorption 3asurface area 0aCarboxylated fullerene 0aAerosil 0aCytotoxicity 0aHaemocompatibility 0aMolecular dynamics1 aIurev, Gleb O.1 aPostnov, Viktor N.1 aMeshcheriakov, Anatolii A.1 aAgeev, Sergei V.1 aIvanova, Daria A.1 aPetrov, Andrey V.1 aLuttsev, Michail D.1 aNashchekin, Alexei V.1 aIamalova, Nailia R.1 aVasina, Lubov V.1 aSolovtsova, Irina L.1 aMurin, Igor V.1 aSemenov, Konstantin N.0 tJournal of biotechnology.g2021 Apr. 10, v. 331 p.83-98dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46789x0168-16567nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiotec.2021.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002600150245017500176300001600351520087900367592002801246650000901274650001501283650001601298650001701314650001701331650001301348650001301361650001401374700002001388700001901408700002101427773008901448856008601537852000901623655001201632IND4457681020221118173355.0141111e20111001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445768102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.03.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, Staffan C.10aCarotenoid content and composition in rose hips (Rosa spp.) during ripening, determination of suitable maturity marker and implications for health promoting food products  ap. 689-696.  aCarotenoids are important antioxidants and valuable bioactive compounds contributing to the health benefits of different foods, and rose hips are known for high bioactive content. This study investigated the content of carotenoids and chlorophylls in hips from four rose species during the ripening period. Carotenoid content varied greatly between harvesting times, although species and year, and interactions between factors, also played an important role. Some carotenoids were identified only in hips of specific rose species. Some of the investigated compounds decreased (chlorophyll a) or increased (lycopene) consistently over the ripening period and could therefore be useful as maturity markers. An optimal content of total or specific carotenoids, e.g. for food products containing rose hips, might be obtained by proper choice of harvesting time and rose species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa 3abiomarkers 3achlorophyll 3aharvest date 3ahealth foods 3alycopene 3aripening 3arose hips1 aRumpunen, Kimmo1 aJohansson, Eva1 aOlsson, Marie E.0 tFood chemistry.g2011 Oct. 1, v. 128, no. 3 p.689-696dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.03.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009400168300001800262520124600280592002801526650001201554650001701566650001401583650001201597650002201609650002001631650001501651700001901666700002001685700001601705700001901721773013001740856008201870852000901952655001201961IND60089516920221116150231.0141102e20120120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008951692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Tae-yŏng,10aIdentification of the phosphorylation sites on intact TRPM7 channels from mammalian cells  ap. 1030-1034.  aTransient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channels are divalent cation-selective ion channels that are permeable to Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺. TRPM7 is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrate cells and contains both an ion channel and a kinase domain. TRPM7 plays an important role in regulating cellular homeostatic levels of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ in mammalian cells. Although studies have shown that the kinase domain of TRPM7 is required for channel activation and can phosphorylate other target proteins, a systematic analysis of intact TRPM7 channel phosphorylation sites expressed in mammalian cells is lacking. We applied mass spectrometric proteomic techniques to identify and characterize the key phosphorylation sites in TRPM7 channels. We identified 14 phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain of TRPM7, eight of which have not been previously reported. The identification of phosphorylation sites using antibody-based immunopurification and mass spectrometry is an effective approach for defining the phosphorylation status of TRPM7 channels. The present results show that TRPM7 channels are phosphorylated at multiple sites, which serves as a mechanism to modulate the dynamic functions of TRPM7 channels in mammalian cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3aion channels 3amagnesium 3amammals 3amass spectrometry 3aphosphorylation 3aproteomics1 aShin, Seok Kyo1 aSong, Min-Young1 aLee, Ji Eun1 aPark, Kang-Sik0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 417, no. 3 p.1030-1034dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.12.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02637naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245011000210300001600320520130800336592002801644650002001672650001901692650003001711650002501741650001001766650001301776650001401789650001501803650001201818653002801830653002701858653002901885653002101914653002301935653003101958700001701989700001502006773009802021856008702119852000902206655001202215IND60621698220221119190637.0190203e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062169822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.1062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei-Hsin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5009-396010aEvolutionary computation for maximizing CO2 and H2 separation in multiple-tube palladium-membrane systems  ap. 299-310.  aMembrane separation is a promising method to separate CO2 and H2 from hydrogen-rich gases. This simultaneously achieves H2 recovery and CO2 enrichment. The latter is conducive to subsequent carbon capture and storage, and thereby the development of negative emission technologies. In this study, single-, double-, triple-, and quadruple-tube systems with palladium (Pd) membranes and cross-flow configuration are considered, while the Reynolds number (Re) is in the range of 1–50. To maximize H2 recovery and CO2 enrichment in the systems, the systems are designed using a two-stage optimization in which the parametric sweep technology followed by the evolutionary computation of the Nelder-Mead simplex method is applied to find the best configuration and the exit H2 concentration is chosen as the objective function. On account of the scavenging waves stemming from the upstream tubes, the goals of the optimization is to diminish the concentration polarization effect of the upstream tubes upon the downstream ones. The predictions indicate that an increase in the number of tubes raises the optimization efficiency. Compared to the tubes in tandem, the optimized configuration at Re = 10 can improve the hydrogen recovery up to 12.2%, while the CO2 enrichment can be intensified by up to 7%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarbon sequestration 3agases 3ahydrogen 3apalladium 3aprediction 3arhenium 0aPalladium (Pd) membrane 0aTwo-stage optimization 0aEvolutionary computation 0aParametric sweep 0aNelder-Mead method 0aConcentration polarization1 aKuo, Pei-Chi1 aLin, Yu-Li0 tApplied energy.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 235 p.299-310dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.10.1063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003300148245015000181300001600331520166100347592002802008650001302036650002602049650001402075650001602089650002302105650002602128650001702154650001302171650001102184650001202195650001602207651001402223653003102237653001202268653003102280653001902311700001702330700001802347773010902365856008202474852000902556655001202565IND60621911220221122224513.0181121e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062191122DNAL7 a10.1177/1564826514035004062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauludyani, Anna Vipta Resti10aRelationship between Household Expenditures on Strategic Foods and Prevalence of Undernutrition among Children 0 to 23 Months of Age in Indonesia  ap. 440-448.  aThe global economic crisis in 2007/08 resulted in higher food prices, which increased household food expenditures while worsening the quantity and quality of food consumed, potentially leading to child undernutrition. To characterize the relationship of the mean proportions of household expenditures on strategic foods with the prevalence of undernutrition (high stunting, wasting, and underweight) among children under 2 years of age in Indonesia. The study used data from 437 districts from two nationally representative surveys conducted in 2007, the National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas) and the Basic Health Research (Riskesdas). A higher mean proportion of household expenditure on soybeans was significantly associated with lower odds (3rd vs. 1st tertile) of prevalence of high wasting (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.28 to 0.94; p = .031) and high underweight (OR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.28; p < .0001). A lower mean proportion of household expenditure on sugar and cooking oil was significantly associated with lower odds of prevalence of high wasting (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.37 to 4.23; p = .002) and high underweight (2nd vs. 1st tertile) (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.05 to 5.41; p = .039). Among all strategic foods, a higher proportion of household expenditure on soybeans and a lower proportion of household expenditure on sugar and cooking oil are associated with lower odds of high wasting and underweight prevalence among children 0 to 23 months of age. The results indicate the need for promotion of consumption of fermented soybeans and education aiming at decreasing expenditure on sugar and cooking oil to increase consumption of more nutritious foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3acooking fats and oils 3aeducation 3afood prices 3agrowth retardation 3ahousehold expenditure 3amalnutrition 3asoybeans 3asugars 3asurveys 3aunderweight 3aIndonesia 0aChildren 0–23 months old 0asoybean 0astrategic food expenditure 0aundernutrition1 aFahmida, Umi1 aSantika, Otte0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 35, no. 4 p.440-448dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1564826514035004063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245016900167300001400336520111100350592002801461650001901489650001201508650001301520650001501533650001801548650001001566650002001576650002201596650001901618650001001637650001501647650000901662650002701671650001701698650001601715650001201731651001301743653001401756653002001770653002201790700002501812700002201837700003001859700002101889700002201910700002501932773014201957856007402099852000902173655001202182IND60687116420221120084544.0200325e20191126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068711642DNAL7 a10.1093/jee/toz2982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRattanawannee, Atsalek10aGenetic Characterization of Exotic Commercial Honey Bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) Populations in Thailand Reveals High Genetic Diversity and Low Population Substructure  ap. 34-42.  aDomestication of animal species is often associated with a reduction in genetic diversity. The honey bee, Apis mellifera Linnaeus, 1758, has been managed by beekeepers for millennia for both honey and wax production and for crop pollination. Here we use both microsatellite markers and sequence data from the mitochondrial COI gene to evaluate genetic variation of managed A. mellifera in Thailand, where the species is introduced. Microsatellite analysis revealed high average genetic diversity with expected heterozygosities ranging from 0.620 ± 0.184 to 0.734 ± 0.071 per locus per province. Observed heterozygosities were generally lower than those expected under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, both locally and across the population as a whole. Mitochondrial sequencing revealed that the frequency of two evolutionary linages (C—Eastern European and O—Middle Eastern) are similar to those observed in a previous survey 10 yr ago. Our results suggest that Thai beekeepers are managing their A. mellifera in ways that retain overall genetic diversity, but reduce genetic diversity between apiaries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aanimals 3aapiaries 3abeekeepers 3adomestication 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3apollination 3asurveys 3aThailand 0ahoney bee 0amicrosatellites 0amitochondrial COI1 aDuangphakdee, Orawan1 aChanchao, Chanpen1 aTeerapakpinyo, Chinachote1 aWarrit, Nattapot1 aWongsiri, Siriwat1 aOldroyd, Benjamin P.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2019 Nov. 26, v. 113, no. 1 p.34-42dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl46276x0022-04937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/toz2983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245011900151300002000270520088500290592002801175650002201203650002001225650001601245650001301261650001301274650002601287700002001313700001601333773013701349856007501486852000901561655001201570IND60538154920221122035548.0160815e20140910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053815492DNAL7 a10.1021/ie502657h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Jie10aCrystallization of Asiaticoside from Total Triterpenoid Saponins of Centella Asiatica in a Methanol + Water System  ap. 14022-14027.  aIn this contribution, a novel solvent system for the crystallization of asiaticoside from total triterpenoid saponins of Centella asiatica was established by utilizing the difference between the induction periods of madecassoside and asiaticoside. Asiaticoside could be separated from the mixture of asiaticoside and madecassoside by crystallization with about 80% yield and 95% purity. The mechanism behind the significantly different induction periods of asiaticoside and madecassoside in the methanol + water system is also proposed. Crystallization of asiaticoside from total triterpenoid saponins of Centella asiatica achieved a maximum yield of 60% with 70% purity. A recrystallization was carried out to obtain 76% yield with 91% purity. The optimized conditions for the crystallization of asiaticoside from total triterpenoid saponins of Centella asiatica were determined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentella asiatica 3acrystallization 3aengineering 3amethanol 3asolvents 3atriterpenoid saponins1 aZheng, Xingfang1 aLu, Xiuyang0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Sept. 10, v. 53, no. 36 p.14022-14027dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie502657h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245015500167500001900322520180200341592002802143650001702171650001902188650001202207650002402219650001902243650001102262650001102273650001502284650001602299650001602315650001302331650001302344650001002357653002302367653002302390653003402413653002702447700005402474700001502528700001602543700001602559700001702575700001502592700005702607773009702664856008502761852000902846655001202855IND60713151520221116191500.0210415e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071315152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1164662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Zehui14aThe effects of C/N (10–25) on the relationship of substrates, metabolites, and microorganisms in “inhibited steady-state” of anaerobic digestion  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N) is a key parameter that affects the performance of anaerobic digestion (AD). Recent AD research has focused on optimizing the C/N of feedstock. The so-called “inhibited steady-state” refers to a special state of ammonia inhibition of AD that often occurs at low-C/N (below 25) when degradable nitrogen-rich substrates, such as livestock manure, are used as feedstock. However, the mechanism behind the “inhibited steady-state” is still unknown. In the current study, co-digestion and recirculation were used to create a C/N gradient in the influent to explore the relationship between substrates, metabolites, and microorganisms in the “inhibited steady-state.” Data were collected at the macro, microbial, and genetic levels. Three CSTRs were successfully made run into the “inhibited steady-state” using influent C/Ns of 10–12. Digestion performance levels of R10–R12 were low and stable, transitioning from an aceticlastic methane-producing pathway to a hydrogenotrophic pathway as the C/N gradually decreased. As the abundance of the hydrogenophilic methanogens increased, the abundance of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB) also increased. The succession between populations of Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina may be used as a microbiological indicator of ammonia inhibition. Under high-C/Ns, cooperation among bacteria was high, while under low-C/Ns, competition among bacteria was high. These results clarify the processes underlying the “inhibited steady-state,” which is a condition often faced in actual large-scale biogas facilities that use degradable nitrogen-rich substrates. Moreover, practical guidelines for evaluating ammonia inhibition are provided, and strategies to alleviate ammonia suppression are developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanosaeta 3aMethanosarcina 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digestion 3aanimal manures 3abiogas 3acarbon 3afeedstocks 3ametabolites 3amethanogens 3anitrogen 3aresearch 3awater 0aCarbon to nitrogen 0aAmmonia inhibition 0aMicrobial community structure 0aInhibited steady-state1 aCai, Yafan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1624-13461 aZhang, Yue1 aZhao, Yubin1 aGao, Youhui1 aCui, Zongjun1 aHu, Yuegao1 aWang, Xiaofen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3543-10730 tWater research.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 188 p.116466-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1164663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245009900175520132300274592002801597650001101625650001201636650001001648650002001658650001401678650001101692650001201703650001301715650001901728650001401747650001501761650002001776650001901796650002001815773012301835856008001958852000902038655001202047IND60651353520221120161857.0190711e20160919xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065135352DNAL7 a10.3390/resources50300282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan den Honert, Robin C.10aImproving Decision Making about Natural Disaster Mitigation Funding in Australia—A Framework  aEconomic losses from natural disasters pose significant challenges to communities and to the insurance industry. Natural disaster mitigation aims to reduce the threat to people and assets from natural perils. Good decisions relating to hazard risk mitigation require judgments both about the scientific and financial issues involved, i.e., the efficacy of some intervention, and the ethical or value principles to adopt in allocating resources. A framework for selecting a set of mitigation options within a limited budget is developed. Project selection about natural disaster mitigation options needs to trade off benefits offered by alternative investments (e.g., fatalities and injuries avoided, potential property and infrastructure losses prevented, safety concerns of citizens, etc.) against the costs of investment. Such costs include capital and on-going operational costs, as well as intangible costs, such as the impact of the project on the visual landscape or the loss of societal cohesion in the event of the relocation of part of a community. Furthermore, dollar costs of any potential project will need to be defined within some prescribed budget and time frame. Taking all of these factors into account, this paper develops a framework for good natural hazard mitigation decision making and selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3acapital 3adeath 3adecision making 3adisasters 3aethics 3afunding 3aindustry 3ainfrastructure 3ainsurance 3alandscapes 3aoperating costs 3arisk reduction 3asocial cohesion0 tResources.g2016 Sept. 19, v. 5, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources50300283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245015700174300001600331520184000347592002802187650002002215650002302235650002402258650001602282650001902298650001702317650002202334650002302356650002102379650001802400650001102418650001402429650001902443650001502462650001902477650000902496650001102505650001402516650001302530650002202543651001002565653001502575653002402590653003302614653001902647700002202666773010702688856008402795852000902879655001202888IND60606887720221119000754.0180730e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060688772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2015.11.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWillming, Morgan M.10aDirect and indirect toxicity of the fungicide pyraclostrobin to Hyalella azteca and effects on leaf processing under realistic daily temperature regimes  ap. 435-442.  aFungicides in aquatic environments can impact non-target bacterial and fungal communities and the invertebrate detritivores responsible for the decomposition of allochthonous organic matter. Additionally, in some aquatic systems daily water temperature fluctuations may influence these processes and alter contaminant toxicity, but such temperature fluctuations are rarely examined in conjunction with contaminants. In this study, the shredding amphipod Hyalella azteca was exposed to the fungicide pyraclostrobin in three experiments. Endpoints included mortality, organism growth, and leaf processing. One experiment was conducted at a constant temperature (23 °C), a fluctuating temperature regime (18–25 °C) based on field-collected data from the S. Llano River, Texas, or an adjusted fluctuating temperature regime (20–26 °C) based on possible climate change predictions. Pyraclostrobin significantly reduced leaf shredding and increased H. azteca mortality at concentrations of 40 μg/L or greater at a constant 23 °C and decreased leaf shredding at concentrations of 15 μg/L or greater in the fluctuating temperatures. There was a significant interaction between temperature treatment and pyraclostrobin concentration on H. azteca mortality, body length, and dry mass under direct aqueous exposure conditions. In an indirect exposure scenario in which only leaf material was exposed to pyraclostrobin, H. azteca did not preferentially feed on or avoid treated leaf disks compared to controls. This study describes the influence of realistic temperature variation on fungicide toxicity to shredding invertebrates, which is important for understanding how future alterations in daily temperature regimes due to climate change may influence the assessment of ecological risk of contaminants in aquatic ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHyalella azteca 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic environment 3abody length 3aclimate change 3adetritivores 3aexposure scenario 3afungal communities 3aindirect contact 3ainvertebrates 3aleaves 3amortality 3aorganic matter 3aprediction 3apyraclostrobin 3arisk 3arivers 3ashredding 3atoxicity 3awater temperature 3aTexas 0aFungicides 0aDiurnal temperature 0aOrganic matter decomposition 0aClimate change1 aMaul, Jonathan D.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Apr., v. 211 p.435-442dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2015.11.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016300158520147200321592002801793650002701821650000801848650001301856650001601869650005001885650002201935650001201957651001001969700001901979700001601998700001602014700001802030700001702048700001402065700001802079700001302097700001802110700001702128700001802145773012102163856007402284852000902358655001202367IND60768528920221116181606.0220225e20220118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076852892DNAL7 a10.3390/v140201662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiong, Junyao 12aA Novel Motif in the 3′-UTR of PRRSV-2 Is Critical for Viral Multiplication and Contributes to Enhanced Replication Ability of Highly Pathogenic or L1 PRRSV  aHighly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) with enhanced replication capability emerged in China and has become dominant epidemic strain since 2006. Up to now, the replication-regulated genes of PRRSV have not been fully clarified. Here, by swapping the genes or elements between HP-PRRSV and classical PRRSV based on infectious clones, NSP1, NSP2, NSP7, NSP9 and 3′-UTR are found to contribute to the high replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV. Further study revealed that mutations at positions 117th or 119th in the 3′-UTR are significantly related to replication efficiency, and the nucleotide at position 120th is critical for viral rescue. The motif composed by 117–120th nucleotides was quite conservative within each lineage of PRRSV; mutations in the motif of HP-PRRSV and currently epidemic lineage 1 (L1) PRRSV showed higher synthesis ability of viral negative genomic RNA, suggesting that those mutations were beneficial for viral replication. RNA structure analysis revealed that this motif maybe involved into a pseudoknot in the 3′-UTR. The results discovered a novel motif, 117–120th nucleotide in the 3′-UTR, that is critical for replication of PRRSV-2, and mutations in the motif contribute to the enhanced replicative ability of HP-PRRSV or L1 PRRSV.

However, the delivery of drugs across the skin is an arduous task due to permeation limiting barriers. It, therefore, requires the aid of external agents or carrier systems for efficient permeation. Lipid-based vesicular systems are carriers for the transport of drugs through the stratum corneum (dermal drug delivery) and into the bloodstream for systemic action (transdermal drug delivery) overcoming the barrier properties. This review article describes the various vesicular systems reported for skin delivery of actives with relevant case studies. The vesicular systems presented here are in the order of their advent from conventional systems to the advanced lipid vesicles. The design and development of drugs in vesicular systems have brought a new dimension to the treatment of disease conditions overcoming the permeation limiting barriers, thus improving its efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3alipids 3apermeability 3atransdermal application 0aDermal 0aDrug delivery 0aEthosomes 0aLipid vesicles 0aTransdermal 0aTransfersomes1 aGhate, Vivek M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7765-36301 aDsouza, Leonna1 aLewis, Shaila A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2884-00150 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Nov., v. 195 p.111262-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1112623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245011700179300001600296520106100312592002801373650002101401650001701422650001801439650001601457650001901473650002801492650001001520650000901530650002101539650000701560650001801567650001901585650002101604650001401625650002601639650002301665650002101688650003101709650003101740650001501771650002801786650002801814650006001842650002701902650004001929650002601969650002101995650003102016700001402047700001702061700001702078700001902095700001202114700001802126700001302144773012502157856004802282852000902330655001202339IND4479746720221120134916.0121003e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447974672DNAL7 a222786742pmid7 a10.1007/s10295-012-1085-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Peng13aAn alkaline-active and alkali-stable pectate lyase from Streptomyces sp. S27 with potential in textile industry  ap. 909-915.  aA pectate lyase gene (pl-str) was cloned from Streptomyces sp. S27 and expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta. The full-length pl-str consists of 972 bp and encodes for a protein of 323 amino acids without signal peptide that belongs to family PF00544. The recombinant enzyme (r-PL-STR) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using Ni2+–NTA chromatography and showed apparent molecular mass of ~35 kDa. The pH optimum of r-PL-STR was found to be 10.0, and it exhibited >70% of the maximal activity at pH 12.0. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h without substrate, the enzyme retained more than 55% activity at pH 7.0–12.0. Compared with the commercial complex enzyme Scourzyme@301L from Novozymes, purified r-PL-STR showed similar efficacy in reducing the intrinsic viscosity of polygalacturonic acid (49.0 vs. 49.7%). When combined with cellulase and α-amylase, r-PL-STR had comparable performance in bioscouring of jute fabric (22.39 vs. 22.99%). Thus, r-PL-STR might represent a good candidate for use in alkaline industries such as textile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStreptomyces 3aalpha-amylase 3aamino acids 3achromatography 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agenes 3ajute 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apectate lyase 3asignal peptide 3atextile industry 3aviscosity 2aCellulasexmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEnzyme Stability 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrolysis 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolysaccharide-Lyasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aStreptomycesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTextile Industry 2aalpha-Amylasesxmetabolism1 aMeng, Kun1 aShi, Pengjun1 aLuo, Huiying1 aHuang, Huoqing1 aTu, Tao1 aYang, Peilong1 aYao, Bin0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.909-915dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-012-1085-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012600164520099100290592002801281650001401309650001401323650001701337650001201354650002601366650001001392650001301402650001601415650001501431650002401446650001201470650001301482650001101495653000801506653000801514653000801522653000801530653000901538653000701547653000801554653000701562653000801569653000801577653000701585653000801592653000701600653000801607653000801615653000801623653003101631653002601662653002501688653002001713700001901733700001901752700002101771773011201792856008201904852000901986655001201995IND60745895920221122004759.0210911e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074589592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2021.1046392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSon, Seung-U10aEvaluation of antitumor metastasis via immunostimulating activities of pectic polysaccharides isolated from radish leaves  aWe investigated the antimetastatic effects of polysaccharides (RWP) isolated from radish leaves by hot water extraction and ethanol precipitation. From the sugar composition analysis, RWP was estimated to be a pectic polysaccharide. Peritoneal macrophages stimulated with RWP significantly augmented the production of various cytokines. In an assay for natural killer (NK) cell activity, both intravenous (i.v.) and oral administration of RWP significantly enhanced NK cells cytotoxicity against YAC-1 lymphoma. In an experiment on lung metastasis of Colon26-M3.1 carcinoma, prophylactic i.v. and oral administration of RWP inhibited metastasis by 77.2% and 55.0%, respectively, at 1000 μg/mouse. Furthermore, pretreatment with anti-asialo GM1 for NK cells depletion partly suppressed the inhibitory effect of RWP on lung metastasis. Thus, our study results suggest that RWP has superior antimetastatic activity, and this effect is related to the activation of various immune factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinoma 3acytokines 3acytotoxicity 3aethanol 3aintravenous injection 3alungs 3alymphoma 3amacrophages 3ametastasis 3aoral administration 3apectins 3aradishes 3asugars 0aAPC 0aAra 0aCTL 0aGal 0aGalA 0aHG 0aIFN 0aIL 0aKDO 0aMHC 0aNK 0aPSK 0aRG 0aRha 0aSPF 0aTNF 0aRadish leaf polysaccharide 0aMacrophage activation 0aNK cell cytotoxicity 0aAnti-metastasis1 aPark, Ho Young1 aSuh, Hyung Joo1 aShin, Kwang-Soon0 tJournal of functional foods.g2021 Oct., v. 85 p.104639-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.1046393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002400173245005400197300001600251520121800267592002801485650001301513650001301526650001101539650001701550650001701567650001601584650002301600700002401623700002001647773009701667856005501764852000901819655001201828IND50069020020221120112353.0130905e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006902002DNAL7 a231988162pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.01014.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowman, Dale O., II10aGeneralized Radial Flow in Synthetic Flow Systems  ap. 768-774.  aTraditional analysis methods used to determine hydraulic properties from pumping tests work well in many porous media aquifers, but they often do not work in heterogeneous and fractured‐rock aquifers, producing non‐plausible and erroneous results. The generalized radial flow model developed by Barker (1988) can reveal information about heterogeneity characteristics and aquifer geometry from pumping test data by way of a flow dimension parameter. The physical meaning of non‐integer flow dimensions has long been a subject of debate and research. We focus on understanding and interpreting non‐radial flow through high permeability conduits within fractured aquifers. We develop and simulate flow within idealized non‐radial flow conduits and expand on this concept by simulating pumping in non‐fractal random fields with specific properties that mimic persistent sub‐radial flow responses. Our results demonstrate that non‐integer flow dimensions can arise from non‐fractal geometries within aquifers. We expand on these geometric concepts and successfully simulate pumping in random fields that mimic well‐test responses seen in the Culebra Dolomite above the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adolomite 3amodels 3apermeability 3aporous media 2aGroundwater 2aHydrologyxmethods1 aRoberts, Randall M.1 aHolt, Robert M.0 tGround water.g2013 Sept., v. 51, no. 5 p.768-774dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0017-467X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2012.01014.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001800156245008400174300001600258500001900274500002000293520118400313592002801497650001701525650001601542650002401558650001701582650001401599650001001613650001701623650002601640700001601666700001601682773011801698856009001816852000901906655001201915IND60734310820221121212703.0210417e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073431082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.1989.tb02408.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMURRAY, M.

The relationship between conductivity (the electrolyte concentration in solution) and time has been shown to follow an asymptotic curve, which may be represented by a first‐order equation: Cₜ–Cₒ= Cₐᵤₜₒ–Cₒ– C‐ₖₜ) where C₁ is the conductivity at time t, Cₒ is the initial conductivity, Cₐᵤₜₒis the conductivity after autoclaving and k is the first‐order rate constant (units time‐¹). The rate of electrolyte leakage (k) varies directly with the extent of tissue damage. In P. rebens a rate of 0‐4%, h‐¹ distinguished between shoots which eventually died, and shoots which remained alive. A minimum of 3 conductivity measurements (after 1 day, 5 days and after autoclaving) is required for a reliable estimate of k. This objective, quantitative method of assessing frost hardiness may therefore be used directly to estimate LT₅₀ values within a population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea rubens 3aautoclaving 3aelectrolyte leakage 3aelectrolytes 3aequations 3afrost 3afrost injury 3aquantitative analysis1 aCAPE, J.

Here, we fabricated a novel nano-hybrid hydrogel system, based-on gelatin and oxidized dextran, embedded with nano-formulation of curcumin and cerium oxide, dispersed by physical interaction within the hydrogel. The curcumin was entrapped in amphiphilic alkylated-dextran nanoparticles to enhance its bioavailability and release at the injured site while cerium oxide nanoparticles were used without any additional processing. The hydrogel was characterized for various properties and demonstrated a controlled and prolonged drug release (∼63 % in 108 h), accelerated cell migration besides providing a highly significant antioxidant and in-vivo anti-inflammatory activity (∼39 %). The preliminary study suggests that this hybrid system can significantly promote wound healing and the potential to become an ideal wound dressing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abioavailability 3acell movement 3aceric oxide 3acurcumin 3adextran 3adrugs 3agelatin 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophobicity 3ananoceria 3aoxidation 3areactive oxygen species 0aNanoparticles 0aWound healing 0aCerium oxide 0aAntioxidant 0aAmphiphilic1 aMajumder, S.1 aGupta, Kailash Chand1 aKumar, Ashok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4910-94400 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Nov., v. 195 p.111263-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1112633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011100159300002000270520117800290592002801468650001201496650002001508650001101528650002001539650002301559650002201582650001701604650001101621650001701632650002601649650001001675651002601685700002301711773012701734856007501861852000901936655001201945IND60535758820221122001204.0160805e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053575882DNAL7 a10.1021/es50435182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBishop, Gary A.14aThe Recession of 2008 and Its Impact on Light-Duty Vehicle Emissions in Three Western United States Cities  ap. 14822-14827.  aThe global economic recession of 2008–2010 severely depressed light-duty vehicle sales in the United States. On-road fleets observed with a remote vehicle exhaust sensor in 2013 at three historical sampling locations in Denver, Los Angeles, and Tulsa showed large reductions in the fleet fractions of 2009 model year vehicles of 40%, 38%, and 35%, respectively, when compared to prerecession 2007 levels with the light-duty truck category suffering the largest percentage declines. The fleet fraction for these ∼5 year old vehicles is normally reserved for vehicles more than twice their age. This resulted in a significant increase in the on-road freeway fleet age, which had been relatively stable. The fleet average age increased by two years in Denver and Los Angeles but only by one year in Tulsa, likely due to its faster economic recovery. Using fleet fractions from previous data sets, we estimated age-adjusted mean emissions increases for the 2013 fleet to be 17–29% higher for carbon monoxide, 9–14% higher for hydrocarbons, 27–30% higher for nitric oxide, and 7–16% higher for ammonia emissions than if historical fleet turnover rates had prevailed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acarbon monoxide 3acities 3adata collection 3aeconomic recession 3aeconomic recovery 3ahydrocarbons 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aparticulate emissions 3asales 3aWestern United States1 aStedman, Donald H.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Dec. 16, v. 48, no. 24 p.14822-14827dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes50435183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009900168300001800267520182000285592002802105650002802133650002202161650001702183650002602200650001002226650001302236650003702249650002002286650001402306650001302320700001602333700001802349700001302367700001902380773013102399856008202530961001302612852000902625655001202634IND60549071020221122040440.0160906e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054907102DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-02-12-0126-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTwizeyimana, M.12aA Cut-Stem Inoculation Technique to Evaluate Soybean for Resistance to Macrophomina phaseolina  ap. 1210-1215.  aCharcoal rot of soybean is caused by the fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina. Effective and reliable techniques to evaluate soybean for resistance to this fungus are needed to work toward a management scheme that would utilize host resistance. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the use of a cut-stem inoculation technique to evaluate soybean genotypes for resistance to M. phaseolina. The first experiment compared aggressiveness of M. phaseolina isolates collected from soybean on different soybean genotypes. Significant (P < 0.05) differences among the isolates and genotypes for relative area under disease progress curve (RAUDPC) were found without a significant isolate–genotype interaction. The second experiment compared 14 soybean genotypes inoculated with M. phaseolina in multiple trials conducted in two environments, the greenhouse and growth chamber. Significant (P < 0.05) differences among environments and highly significant (P < 0.001) differences among soybean genotypes for RAUDPC were found. The environment–genotype interaction was nonsignificant (P > 0.05). Soybean genotypes DT97-4290, DT98-7553, DT98-17554, and DT99-16864 had significantly (P < 0.05) lower RAUDPC than 7 of the 14 genotypes. The third experiment evaluated resistance in selected Phaseolus spp. and soybean genotypes. The range of RAUDPC for Phaseolus spp. was similar to that of soybean. The Phaseolus lunatus ‘Bush Baby Lima’ had significantly (P < 0.05) lower RAUDPC than P. vulgaris genotypes evaluated. The cut-stem inoculation technique, which has several advantages over field tests, successfully distinguished differences in aggressiveness among M. phaseolina isolates and relative differences among soybean genotypes for resistance to M. phaseolina comparable with results of field tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrophomina phaseolina 3aPhaseolus lunatus 3acharcoal rot 3afield experimentation 3afungi 3agenotype 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agrowth chambers 3apathogens 3asoybeans1 aHill, C.

However, little is known about its stability. This study reports a comprehensive investigation on the stability of BAX using spin-label ESR, CD, and ThermoFluor methods. Point mutations covering all of the nine helices of BAX were prepared. ESR study shows that BAX can be divided into two structural regions, each responding differently to the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). The N-terminal region (helices 1–3) is denatured in 6 M GdnHCl, whereas the C-terminal region (helices 4–9) is resistant to the denaturing effects. The far-UV CD spectra show an appreciable amount of helical content of BAX at high temperatures. The magnitude of the near-UV CD signal is increased with increasing temperature in either 0 or 6 M GdnHCl, indicating an enhancement of aromatic side-chain packing in the C-terminal region. Taken together with ThermoFluor results, we show that a core interior, wherein aromatic interactions are highly involved, within the C-terminal region plays an important role in stabilizing BAX against the denaturing effects. Collectively, we report a highly stable, indestructible intermediate state of BAX. Side-chain packing interactions are shown to be the major stabilizing force in determining BAX structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acytosol 3adenaturation 3aguanidines 3amitochondria 3apoint mutation 3atemperature1 aTsai, Chia-Jung1 aChiang, Yun-Wei0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Jan. 08, v. 119, no. 1 p.54-64dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp50913343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01286naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245013100178300001800309520017700327592002800504650002100532650001600553650002100569650003300590650001300623650000900636700002700645700003200672700002300704773010100727856008800828990002300916852000900939655001200948IND60098541620221117230834.0141104e20110630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009854162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrinconi, Angela F.10aEvaluation of the insulin-like growth factors (IGF) IGF-I and IGF binding protein 3 in patients at high risk for breast cancer  ap. 2753-2755.  aOur data suggest that serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 do not correlate with breast cancer development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3apatients 3arisk1 aFilassi, José Roberto1 aSoares-Júnior, José Maria1 aBaracat, Edmund C.0 tFertility and sterility.g2011 June 30, v. 95, no. 8 p.2753-2755dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2011.02.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02427naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245011400154300001800268520126100286650001601547650002101563650001701584650004101601650002401642650002601666650001901692650001301711650001401724650002201738650003201760700001801792700001501810700001801825773016101843856004002004852000902044655001202053IND4535075720221120061516.0160225e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453507572DNAL7 a10.1021/jf502540p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Feibai10aBinding of Aroma Compounds with Myofibrillar Proteins Modified by a Hydroxyl-Radical-Induced Oxidative System  ap. 9544-9552.  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the influence of oxidation-induced structural modifications of myofibrillar protein on its binding ability with aroma compounds such as 2-methyl-butanal, methional, 2-pentanone, 2-heptanone, and nonanal. A method using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was used to determine the corresponding binding ability. The binding with aroma compounds was found to be strongly affected by the oxidation levels of proteins, probably due to the varying modifications in protein structure and surface. Incubation with oxidants around or below 1 mM mainly caused the refolding of protein structure and accelerated the protein aggregation, which reduced the affinity of the aroma compounds, thus decreasing the binding ability. Nevertheless, treatment with oxidants over 2.5 mM would cause protein reaggregation and partial degradation, and thus, the subsequent modification of protein surface properties. The aggregated protein with wrinkled surfaces favored the hydrophobic interactions with aroma compounds, forming the protein-aroma compound complex, thus enhancing the resultant binding ability as evidenced by fluorescence quenching and SPME-GC/MS analysis. 3a2-heptanone 3abinding proteins 3afluorescence 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amyofibrillar proteins 3aodor compounds 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aprotein refolding 3asolid phase microextraction1 aZhao, Mouming1 aSu, Guowan1 aSun, Wiezheng0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Oct. 1, v. 62, no. 39 p.9544-9552dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf502540p  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005700164300001400221500001900235520162200254592002801876650000901904650001701913650002001930650002301950650001301973650002201986650002802008650001502036651001302051651001102064651001002075651001102085653001802096653002502114653004102139653002002180653002502200653000902225653002002234700001602254700001602270700002602286700001902312700002102331700001602352700002502368700002202393700001602415700001902431700001802450773010202468856008102570852000902651655001202660IND60677719320221122053047.0191213e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067771932DNAL7 a10.1017/S00306053170011812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWotton, S.R.10aDeveloping biodiversity indicators for African birds  ap. 62-73.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiodiversity indicators are essential for monitoring the impacts of pressures on the state of nature, determining the effectiveness of policy responses, and tracking progress towards biodiversity targets and sustainable development goals. Indicators based on trends in the abundance of birds are widely used for these purposes in Europe and have been identified as priorities for development elsewhere. To facilitate this we established bird population monitoring schemes in three African countries, based on citizen science approaches used in Europe, aiming to monitor population trends in common and widespread species. We recorded > 500 bird species from c. 450 2-km transects in Botswana, > 750 species from c. 120 transects in Uganda, and > 630 species from c. 90 transects in Kenya. Provisional Wild Bird Indices indicate a strong increase in bird populations in Botswana and a small decrease in Uganda. We also provide comparisons between trends of habitat generalists and specialists, of birds within and outside protected areas, and between Afro-Palearctic migrants and resident birds. Challenges encountered included recruiting, training and retaining volunteer surveyors, and securing long-term funding. However, we show that with technical support and modest investment (c. USD 30,000 per scheme per year), meaningful biodiversity indicators can be generated and used in African countries. Sustained resourcing for the existing schemes, and replication elsewhere, would be a cost-effective way to improve our understanding of biodiversity trends globally, and measure progress towards environmental goals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryx 3abiodiversity 3acitizen science 3acost effectiveness 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3asustainable development 3awild birds 3aBotswana 3aEurope 3aKenya 3aUganda 0aAichi Targets 0aland bird monitoring 0anational and international reporting 0apolicy relevant 0apopulation abundance 0aTRIM 0aWild Bird Index1 aEaton, M.A.1 aSheehan, D.1 aMunyekenye, F.

It is found that no significant electrochemical enhancement is evident with the use of either in situ bismuth or mercury film modified SPES compared to the bare underlying electrode substrate. In fact, the direct electrochemical reduction of the cathinone derivatives mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone; 4-MMC) and 4′-methyl-N-ethylcathinone (4-methylethcathinone; 4-MEC) is found to be possible for the first time, without heavy metal catalysis, giving rise to useful voltammetric electroanalytical signatures in model aqueous buffer solutions. This novel electroanalytical methodology is validated toward the determination of cathinone derivatives (4-MMC and 4-MEC) in three seized street samples that are independently analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) wherein excellent agreement between the two analytical protocols is found. Such an approach provides a validated laboratory tool for the quantification of synthetic cathinone derivatives and holds potential for the basis of a portable analytical sensor for the determination of synthetic cathinone derivatives in seized street samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abismuth 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aforensic sciences 3aheavy metals 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amercury 3apsychotropic agents1 aMetters, Jonathan P.1 aKhreit, Osama I.

In order to better understand the interactions between various catalysts and biomass components, individual components of biomass were isolated and pyrolyzed with different catalysts. Understanding the interactions between pyrolysis vapors and catalysts is important to create catalysts that can improve bio-oil quality and energy content in the future. In this study, cellulose, guaiacol (as a model for lignin), and Hinoki wood were pyrolyzed and catalyzed with silica, ZrO2&TiO2, and ZSM-5 with an SiO2-to-Al2O3 (SAR) ratio of 40 and 1500. GC–MS analysis was used to measure the effects of the different catalysts on the pyrolysis vapors. It was found that silica had a strong interaction with the hydroxyl groups of levoglucosan and significantly decreased sugars in both cellulose and Hinoki wood pyrolysis. ZrO2&TiO2 increased the amount of cyclopentanones and aromatics with Hinoki wood pyrolysis. The ZSM-5 catalysts also increased aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated hydrocarbons with Hinoki wood pyrolysis. Based on these results, specific reactions of the catalysts were proposed. Additionally, ZSM-5 with a SAR ratio of 1500 has very few acidic sites, so the steric effects of ZSM-5 could be isolated. These results are discussed and contrasted with ZSM-5 with a SAR ratio of 40. These results show that microporous catalysts and moderate acidity are optimal for improving bio-oil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acellulose 3aenergy content 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aguaiacol 3alignin 3amodels 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3asilica 3asugars 3avapors 3awood 0aPyrolysis 0aCatalysis 0aCellulose 0aGuaiacol 0aHinoki wood 0aZSM-5 0aSilica 0aZrO2& TiO21 aCross, Jeffrey S.1 aAkasaka, Hiroki1 aOhtake, Naoto0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2017 May, v. 125 p.178-184dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6382x0165-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2017.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01556naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009400167300001600261520065300277592002800930650002700958650001500985650001801000650001301018650001001031700001601041700002001057773012001077856004801197852000901245655001201254IND4450765420221118015524.0121003e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445076542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-010-0519-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgaonkar, B.

However, the importance of the symbioses between fine roots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in different plant functional groups to maintain soil multifunctionality (the ability to provide multiple functions and services) and microbial diversity remains unclear, especially in desert ecosystems. In this study, we conducted an ingrowth core experiment on three vegetation types, namely shrub-dominated, grass-dominated, and mixed vegetation communities, in the Mu Us Desert, northern China, to investigate the importance of fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi in shaping soil nutrient composition and microbiome. Furthermore, we detected the relationships among AMF-related inputs [extraradical AMF hyphae and glomalin-related soil protein (GRSP)], soil multifunctionality, and soil microbial diversity. We found that most of the soil properties associated with nutrient cycling and microbial community composition and diversity varied among the three vegetation types, but were not significantly different between distinct ingrowth core treatments with fine root and hyphal access. AMF-related inputs, especially the easily extractable GRSP, were the most important determinants of soil multifunctionality and microbial community diversity across the shrub and grass communities, while the changes in soil multifunctionality and microbial diversity were inconsistent with the trend of fine root biomass. Moreover, AMF-related inputs were positively correlated with soil nutrients, particularly soil organic carbon (SOC). In contrast to the minimal negative correlation between SOC and soil microbial richness, soil multifunctionality was positively correlated with SOC. These findings support the role of AMF in shaping soil multifunctionality and microbial diversity by stabilizing SOC in a desert ecosystem, regardless of the fine root accessibility of plant functional groups. Therefore, this study improved our understanding of plant-derived carbon in the soil and its effects on the induction of soil abiotic and biotic processes in resource-limited ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afine roots 3agrasses 3ahyphae 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3anutrient content 3ashrubs 3asoil ecology 3asoil nutrients 3asoil organic carbon 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aChina 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi 0aMicrobial community 0aSoil multifunctionality 0aPlant functional groups1 aBai, Yuxuan1 aShe, Weiwei1 aLiu, Liang1 aMiao, Chun1 aZhu, Guannan1 aQin, Shugao1 aZhang, Yuqing0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 Mar., v. 171 p.104323-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1043233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012400165300001600289520129200305592002801597650001501625650001101640650000901651650002001660650001501680653002201695653002701717653002701744653004301771653002401814700001301838700003501851700001601886700001801902773011601920856008502036852000902121655001202130IND60579461420221120055808.0170818e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057946142DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2017.13334332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei10aOptimization of thermal performance of the parabolic trough solar collector systems based on GA-BP neural network model  ap. 819-830.  aThe aim of this paper is to optimize the thermal performance (system output energy, thermal efficiency, and heat loss of cavity absorber) of parabolic trough solar collector (PTC) systems in order to improve its thermal performance, based on the genetic algorithm-back propagation (GA-BP) neural network model. There are a number of undefined problems, fuzzy or incomplete information and a complex thermal performance of the PTC systems. Therefore, the thermal performance prediction of the PTC systems based on GA-BP neural network model was developed. Subsequently, the metrics performances have been adopted to comprehensively understand the algorithm and evaluate the prediction accuracy. Results revealed that the GA-BP neural network model can be successfully used to predict the complex nonlinear relationship between the input variables and thermal performance of the PTC systems. The cosine effect has a great influence on the thermal performance; thereby the geometrical structure of the PTC systems was optimized. It was found that the optimized geometrical structure was beneficial to improve the thermal performance of the PTC system. In conclusion, the GA-BP neural network model has higher prediction accuracy than the other algorithm and it can be feasible and reliable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3aheat 3aneural networks 3aprediction 0aBP neural network 0aGenetic algorithm (GA) 0ageometric optimization 0aParabolic trough solar collector (PTC) 0athermal performance1 aLi, Ming1 aHassanien, Reda Hassanien Emam1 aJi, Meng en1 aFeng, Zhikang0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2017 Aug. 9, v. 14, no. 10 p.819-830dTaylor & Francisx1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2017.13334333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245014300166300001600309520100900325592002801334650002801362650002601390650001601416650002401432650002201456650001201478650000701490650001601497650001101513650000901524653000901533653000901542653000901551653000701560653000801567653001601575653003001591653002001621653001301641653001501654700001801669700001601687700001501703700001501718700001601733700001801749700001601767773013501783856008701918852000902005655001202014IND60629071220221119120355.0220214e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062907122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.2592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Fanyi10aCharacterisation comparison of polysaccharides from Dioscorea opposita Thunb. growing in sandy soil, loessial soil and continuous cropping  ap. 776-785.  aThis study compared the characterisations of polysaccharides from Chinese yam (Dioscorea opposita Thunb.) growing in sandy soil (SSCY), loessial soil (LSCY) and second-year continuous cropping (CCCY). SSCY contained the highest total polysaccharides (36.55%) and 80.19% glucose, CCCY from sandy soil obtained 24.55% polysaccharides with 43.66% glucose, whereas LSCY contained 27.54% total polysaccharides and 7.94% glucose. The results indicated that Dioscorea opposita from sandy soil may obtain higher level of glucose. CCCY increased the galacturonic acids in yams from 7.03% to 26.19%, which may have been caused by the decrease in soil pH due to continuous cropping. The starches of SSCY and CCCY from sandy soil belongs to C-type, whereas the starch of LSCY from loessial soil has the A-type pattern. The results suggested that the two types of soil and continuous cropping change the compounds and contents of yams, which provide valuable evidences for cropping management and allelopathy effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea oppositifolia 3aDioscorea polystachya 3aallelopathy 3acontinuous cropping 3agalacturonic acid 3aglucose 3apH 3asandy soils 3astarch 3ayams 0aSSCY 0aLSCY 0aCCCY 0aMW 0aWBC 0aChinese yam 0aDioscorea opposita Thunb. 0aPolysaccharides 0aStarches 0aMorphology1 aWang, Ruijiao1 aZhu, Jinhua1 aZhang, Yun1 aWang, Yong1 aHu, Weiping1 aBell, Alan E.1 aLiu, Xiuhua0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 126 p.776-785dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.12.2593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245005000212300001400262500001900276520147100295592002801766650002401794650001701818650001501835650000901850650002001859650001901879650002201898650001201920650002301932650001301955651001401968653001001982653001701992653002702009653001402036700002402050700002602074700002002100700002902120700002702149773010202176856008102278852000902359655001202368IND60677719420221120202218.0191213e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067771942DNAL7 a10.1017/S003060531700120X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Mercado, Ada1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5030-212810aIllegal trade of the Psittacidae in Venezuela  ap. 77-83.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIllegal wildlife trade is one of the major threats to Neotropical psittacids, with nearly 28% of species targeted for the illegal pet trade. We analysed the most comprehensive data set on illegal wildlife trade currently available for Venezuela, from various sources, to provide a quantitative assessment of the magnitude, scope and detectability of the trade in psittacids at the national level. We calculated a specific offer index (SO) based on the frequency of which each species was offered for sale. Forty-seven species of psittacids were traded in Venezuela during 1981–2015, of which 17 were non-native. At least 641,675 individuals were traded, with an overall extraction rate of 18,334 individuals per year (35 years of accumulated reports). Amazona ochrocephala was the most frequently detected species (SO = 3.603), with the highest extraction rate (10,544 individuals per year), followed by Eupsittula pertinax (SO = 1.357) and Amazona amazonica (SO = 1.073). Amazona barbadensis, Ara ararauna and Ara chloropterus were the fourth most frequently detected species (SO = 0.564–0.615). Eleven species were involved principally in domestic trade (> 60% of records). Our approach could be the first step in developing a national monitoring programme to inform national policy on the trade in psittacids. Patterns and numbers provided may be used to update the official list of threatened species, and could also be used in planning conservation actions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmazona barbadensis 3aAra ararauna 3aNeotropics 3aOryx 3adata collection 3adomestic trade 3aissues and policy 3aparrots 3athreatened species 3awildlife 3aVenezuela 0aBirds 0aconservation 0aillegal wildlife trade 0apet trade1 aAsmüssen, Marianne1 aRodríguez, Jon Paul,1 aMoran, Lisandro1 aCardozo-Urdaneta, Arlene1 aMorales, Lorena Isabel0 tOryx.g2020 Jan., v. 54, no. 1 p.77-83dCambridge University PresswJournal:1955x1365-30087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003060531700120X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03179naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001600146245014800162300001600310500002400326500001500350520161000365650002801975650002402003650002302027650002502050650001402075650002402089650002302113650002702136650001502163650002702178650002702205650001402232653002402246653002602270700002002296700001502316700001902331773011702350852000902467856007602476856008602552930003302638945001302671946001302684655001202697IND2332308020221118130009.0030429e200210  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233230802DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-31.5.7972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanzoni, A.10aComparative life history of Liriomyza trifolii and Liriomyza huidobrensis (Diptera: Agromyzidae) on beans: effect of temperature on development  ap. 797-803.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe influence of four constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C) on development time and survivorship of Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) and Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard) was studied in laboratory experiments. L. huidobrensis required more time for embryonic development at 25 and 30 degrees C, and less time at 15 degrees C, compared with L. trifolii; at 20 degrees C there were no differences between the two species. Larval development time for L. huidobrensis was longer than for L. trifolii at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C. At 15 degrees C no differences were detected. Pupal development of L. huidobrensis was always faster at 15, 20, and 25 degrees C than that of L. trifolii. Total preimaginal development time was quicker at 15 and 20 degrees C in L. huidobrensis than in L. trifolii; at 25 degrees C no significant differences were found. Highest survival of L. trifolii (68%) occurred at 20 degrees C, while that of L. huidobrensis (61%) occurred at 15 degrees C. At 30 degrees C no adults of L. huidobrensis emerged. The estimated lower threshold temperatures for egg, larva, pupa and total development of L. huidobrensis ranged between 7.3 and 8.1 degrees C, and they were always lower than L. trifolii thresholds, which ranged between 9.9 and 10.7 degrees C. The Logan model was used to describe the relationship between development rate and temperature. The quantification of development times presented in this study, combined with fecundity under different temperatures, could be incorporated into a phenological model that will aid in predicting population charges of leafminers. 3ainterspecific variation 3amathematical models 3aLiriomyza trifolii 3adevelopmental stages 3aheat sums 3aambient temperature 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aLiriomyza huidobrensis 3aleafminers 3abiological development 3alife cycle (organisms) 3amortality 0aspecies differences 0atemperature threshold1 aBazzocchi, G.G.1 aBurgio, G.1 aFiacconi, M.R.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2002 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.797-803dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-31.5.7973Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02669naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011500155300001800270500001900288520128900307592002801596650001501624650002401639650001501663650002001678650002801698650002501726650002001751650001901771650001901790650002101809650001301830650001701843650001601860700001701876700001601893700001801909700001501927700001701942700001501959700001701974773012501991856007402116852000902190655001202199IND60733921220221122032502.0210414e20210413xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073392122DNAL7 a10.1039/d0gc04333h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Feiyun14aThe synthesis of a UCST-type zwitterionic polymer for the efficient recycling of cellulase at room temperature  ap. 2738-2746.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn order to reduce the enzyme cost of lignocellulosic enzymatic hydrolysis, upper critical solution temperature (UCST) additives are used to recover and reuse cellulase by regulating the temperature. A sulfobetaine polymer, PSPE, showed a sensitive UCST response in buffer, and its UCST-performance was optimised by adjusting the molecular weight of the polymer. PSPE-3 (Mw = 355.1 kDa) was added to the cellulase buffer at 50 °C, and PSPE-3 and cellulase were co-precipitated by cooling to the room temperature of 25 °C. PSPE-3 and cellulase co-precipitated mainly through hydrophobic interactions via cooling. Compared with octadecyl sulfobetaine (SB3–18), PSPE-3 had a more sensitive UCST response and stronger cellulase recovery ability. Adding only 40% PSPE-3 (accounting for the mass fraction of cellulase) can save more than 50% cellulase in the enzymatic hydrolysis system of eucalyptus chips pre-treated with dilute acid (Eu-DA). However, for the Eu-DA system, adding 100% SB3–18 can only save about 30% of cellulase. In this work, efficient recycling of cellulase was achieved at room temperature by adding UCST-type PSPE. The process is green without consuming acid and alkali, and this work provides a new idea for reducing the production cost of cellulosic ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aambient temperature 3abioethanol 3acoprecipitation 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrophobicity 3alignocellulose 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3asulfobetaine 3azwitterions1 aQin, Feiyang1 aPang, Yuxia1 aLou, Hongming1 aCai, Cheng1 aLiu, Weifeng1 aQian, Yong1 aQiu, Xueqing0 tGreen chemistry.g2021 Apr. 13, v. 23, no. 7 p.2738-2746dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0gc04333h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06628naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152100001600170245012900186300001600315520443600331592002804767650001904795650001704814650002904831650002204860650001604882650002904898650002304927650000904950650001204959650001604971650003004987650002105017650002005038650001005058650001105068650002705079650002205106650002405128650001205152650002405164650001805188650001305206650001505219650001105234650001805245650000905263650001305272650001005285650001605295650001205311650001605323650002505339650001605364650002105380650002205401650002905423650002905452650002005481651001005501651001005511700001405521700002005535700001705555700001705572700001605589700001605605700001605621773010105637856008705738852000905825655001205834IND4467061520221118015641.0141112e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446706152DNAL7 a221190302pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.10.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Shuping10aAssessment of site conditions for disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes: A case study in southern China  ap. 624-631.  aNear surface disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes (LILW) requires evaluating the field conditions of the candidate site. However, assessment of the site conditions may be challenging due to the limited prior knowledge of some remote sites, and various multi-disciplinary data requirements at any given site. These situations arise in China as in the rest of the industrialized world, particularly since a regional strategy for LILW disposal has been implemented to protect humans and the environment. This paper presents a demonstration of the site assessment process through a case study focusing mainly on the geologic, hydrogeologic and geochemical characteristics of the candidate site. A joint on-site and laboratory investigation, supplemented by numerical modeling, was implemented in this assessment. Results indicate that no fault is present in the site area, although there are some minor joints and fractures, primarily showing a north–south trend. Most of the joints are filled with quartz deposits and would thus function hydraulically as impervious barriers. Investigation of local hydrologic boundaries has shown that the candidate site represents an essentially isolated hydrogeologic unit, and that little or no groundwater flow occurs across its boundaries on the north or east, or across the hilly areas to the south. Groundwater in the site area is recharged by precipitation and discharges primarily by evapo-transpiration and surface flow through a narrow outlet to the west. Groundwater flows slowly from the hilly area to the foot of the hills and discharges mainly into the inner brooks and marshes. Some groundwater circulates in deeper granite in a slower manner. The vadose zone in the site was investigated specially for their significant capability for restraining the transport of radionuclides. Results indicate that the vadose zone is up to 38m in thickness and is made up of alluvial clay soils and very highly weathered granite. The vadose zone has low saturated hydraulic conductivities on the order of 10⁻⁵cm/s and in this respect is well-suited for the disposal of LILW. The saturated formations are primarily made up of silt and moderately-to-slightly weathered granite, which exhibit even lower hydraulic conductivities, on the order of 10⁻⁶cm/s, also favorable for restraining the transport of radionuclides. Chemical analyses indicate that the groundwaters at the site are of the HCO₃–Na·Ca and HCO₃·SO₄–Na·Ca types and are weakly corrosive to concrete and steel. Geochemical analyses indicate that the rock and soil materials (particularly weathered granite) at the site contain very small fractions of colloidal particles and exhibit low Cation Exchange Capacities (CEC), and would therefore have limited capacity for sorption of radionuclides. Groundwater flow and solute transport models of the candidate site have been developed using MODFLOW and MT3DMS, incorporating the data obtained during the assessment program. Calibration was based on the available measured groundwater level fluctuations and tracer concentrations from in situ dispersion tests. The longitudinal dispersion coefficient as determined in calibration is equal to 5.0×10⁻³m²/d. Numerical sensitivity analyses indicate that the hydraulic conductivity and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient are the key parameters controlling the transport of radionuclides, while the numerical model is not sensitive to changes in the effective porosity and the specific yield. Preliminary predictions have been performed with the calibrated model both for the natural setting of the site and the graded site in which the valleys of the site are backfilled with low permeable materials. Results indicate that the proposed site grading increases the safety of the site for disposal of LILW by reducing both the groundwater level and the hydraulic gradient and that radionuclide transport would not likely be a problem or cause groundwater contamination. Although there are some problems remaining to be addressed in future work, the conclusion of the assessment is that the conditions at this site are appropriate for LILW disposal. This study provides an example of the procedures necessary in an assessment of site conditions relevant to the safe disposal of LILW. Such an assessment is crucial to the site selection process and to subsequent environmental impact assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalluvial soils 3acase studies 3acation exchange capacity 3achemical analysis 3adispersions 3aenvironmental assessment 3aevapotranspiration 3afeet 3agranite 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater flow 3ahazardous waste 3ahills 3ahumans 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 3alabeling techniques 3amarshes 3amathematical models 3aoverland flow 3aporosity 3aprediction 3aquartz 3aradionuclides 3asilt 3asorption 3asteel 3avadose zone 3avalleys 3awater table 2aGeological Phenomena 2aGroundwater 2aModels, Chemical 2aRadioactive Waste 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aWater Movements 3aChina 0aChina1 aMa, Haiyi1 aZheng, Chunmiao1 aZhu, Xiaobin1 aWang, Hua'an1 aLi, Xueshan1 aHu, Xueling1 aQin, Jianbo0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 414 p.624-631dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.10.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012300175300001600298520107000314592002801384650001501412650000901427650001401436650000901450650002901459650002401488653001801512653002801530653002101558653001701579653003601596653003801632700005701670700001801727773010001745856008701845852000901932655001201941IND60616117720221122004441.0201230e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061611772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.09.1212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyễn, Thiện,10aDiffuse reflectance spectroscopy to quantify the met-myoglobin proportion and meat oxygenation inside of pork and beef  ap. 369-376.  aThe potential of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) to quantify the met-myoglobin (met-Mb) proportion and meat oxygenation inside of pork and beef was examined. First, reflection spectra were obtained from pork (n = 52) and beef (n = 43) samples under fresh and stored conditions. Second, the DRS algorithm was applied to the reflectance spectra to calculate the met-Mb proportion and oxygenation of the meat. Lastly, a regression model was developed showing the change in the met-Mb proportion and oxygenation during met-Mb formation and degradation. A linear relationship existed between the DRS-based computed data and the known met-Mb proportion with a high correlation (R² = 0.9999) and a low error (0.86%). Measurement of the meat samples revealed a linear increment of the met-Mb proportion (R² = 0.77) and a quadratic change in the oxygenation (R² = 0.44) during the met-Mb formation process. This study demonstrated the ability of DRS to quantitatively analyze the relative content of myoglobin derivatives in both pork and beef.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abeef 3amyoglobin 3apork 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aregression analysis 0aFitting model 0aPhoton diffusion theory 0aRegression model 0aLinear model 0aMet-myoglobin formation process 0aMet-myoglobin degradation process1 aKim, Sungchul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6774-263X1 aKim, Jae Gwan0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 275 p.369-376dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.09.1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024003500115024001100150040001800161100002200179245013900201506017300340520168300513650002702196650002402223650001102247650001202258650000902270650002502279650002002304650001002324650001102334650002502345650001302370650002102383650001902404650001102423651001302434700002002447700002202467700002602489700002002515773008502535856011202620856004802732956011702780961000902897852000902906655001202915IND50073697120221118232937.0140307s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007369712DNAL7 a10113/585602hdl7 a10.1007/s10344-013-0760-52doi8 ans4223  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerentsen, Are R.10aCharacteristics of white-tailed deer visits to cattle farms: implications for disease transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBovine tuberculosis (bTB) is endemic in freeranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in MI, USA. Currently, the rates of farm visitation by deer and couse of forage resources by cattle and deer are poorly understood. To evaluate the extent deer and livestock may share forage resources, we investigated farm, yard, and cattle-use area visitation by white-tailed deer and compared visitation with common livestock management practices. We fitted 25 female white-tailed deer near the bTB-infected zone in Michigan’s Lower Peninsula with global positioning system collars. Livestock management practices associated with farm visitation included presence of confined feeding pastures, number of cattle water sources, and the number of cattle pastures. Fewer farm visits occurred at night than during the day. A higher proportion of nighttime visits occurred between midnight and sunrise. Visitation to yards and cattle-use areas were similar: a higher proportion of visits occurred at night, and a higher proportion of nighttime visits occurred between midnight and sunrise. Multiple visits during the same day were common. Visitation increased through spring and peaked during the fawning season. Results suggest that mitigation and control efforts to guard against potential transmission of bTB should include the season and time of day during which deer visitation occurs. Furthermore, specific livestock management practices may contribute to farm visitation by deer. Deer visiting multiple farms may contribute to local area spread of bTB. Focusing risk mitigation efforts on individual deer that aremost likely to visit farms may reduce potential bTB transmission. 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3abovine tuberculosis 3acattle 3acollars 3adeer 3adisease transmission 3afarming systems 3afarms 3aforage 3afree range husbandry 3apastures 3arange management 3arisk reduction 3aspring 3aMichigan1 aMiller, Ryan S.1 aMisiewicz, Regina1 aMalmberg, Jennifer L.1 aDunbar, Mike R.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2013, dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/585603Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-013-0760-5  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10344-013-0760-5.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245006000178300001600238500000900254520126700263592002801530650002501558650002801583650001401611700001801625773012001643852000901763856009801772655001201870IND8406957020221118020515.0191122e198405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND840695702DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1984.0011183X002400030040x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, G.

The plant (designated CH-I) had tiny, white, beaded nodules and only 2 cm of topgrowth. With the addition of N this plant was grown to maturity and self-pollinated. S₁ plants were inoculated with 11 different Rhizobium trifolii strains in replicated experiments, all resulting in an ineffective symbiosis. No segregation for effectiveness occurred in the S₁ or S₂ generations of the CH-I line. Crosses were made between normal crimson clover lines and S₁ lines of CH-I. F₁ populations were nodulated effectively with R. trifolii strain 162K13. The Fz generation segregated for symbiotic effectiveness when nodulated with strain 162K13. F₂ populations from two crosses showed a good fit to a 3:1 ratio of normal to ineffective nodulation. Results indicate that non-strain-specific ineffective nodulation of crimson clover is controlled by a single recessive gene pair (rt₁ ᵣₜ₂) with possible modifiers. Plants with this trait should be useful as non-Nj fixing controls in ¹⁵N isotope dilution experiments and to study individual steps in N₂ fixation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrifolium incarnatum 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3asymbiosis1 aKnight, W.

A common entity in Boxers and the related English bulldog, the disease is characterized by fatty or fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium, ventricular arrhythmias, and the potential for syncope or sudden death. In some individuals, concomitant left ventricular involvement results in systolic dysfunction and a progression to congestive heart failure. The clinical and pathological characteristics of ARVC share many similarities in dogs and humans, and Boxers serve as an important spontaneous model of the disease. Although multiple mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARVC, the disease is ultimately considered to be a disorder of the desmosome. Multiple causal genetic mutations have been identified in people, and over 50% of affected humans have an identifiable mutation in desmosomal proteins. To date, only a single genetic mutation has been associated with ARVC in Boxer dogs. Other as-yet-undiscovered genetic mutations and epigenetic modifiers of the disease are likely. Treatment of ARVC in dogs is focused on controlling ventricular arrhythmias and associated clinical signs. This article will review the pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ARVC in the dog.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnglish bulldog 3acardiomyopathy 3adeath 3adogs 3aepigenetics 3aheart failure 3amodels 3amutation 3amyocardium 3apathogenesis 3apathophysiology 3apeople 3aprognosis 3asyncope 0aCanine 0aBoxer 0aArrhythmia 0aRight ventricle1 aDos Santos, L.0 tJournal of veterinary cardiology.g2022 Apr., v. 40 p.156-169dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000118x1760-27347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvc.2021.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100003100158245013100189300001400320520134600334592002801680650002501708650001301733650001101746650001301757650002001770650002001790650001101810650001001821650001001831650001201841650001001853650001601863650001001879650002401889650001101913650001101924650001001935650001001945653000901955653001401964653002101978653001101999653001802010700004202028700003002070700002402100700003102124700004602155700001702201700003102218773009602249856009302345852000902438655001202447IND60585363120221122114130.0190318e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058536312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParanzini, Cristiane Sella10aFeasibility of semen collection in red-winged tinamou (Rhynchotus rufescens) by manual stimulation and sazonality implications  ap. 36-40.  aThis study aimed to report in detail, the technique and challenges of cloacal massage, to collect and evaluate semen from red-winged tinamou (Rhynchotus rufescens) keep in captivity, performed by only one technician. Sixty-four semen collection attempts, from 16 adult males, during breeding season and 16 attempts form these same 16 males in non-breeding season, were performed. Prior to collection, all animals were conditioned to cloacal massage for 6 weeks and the ejaculates were succeed with viable spermatozoa and then, evaluated for feces, urine and mucus contamination, volume, concentration, sperm vigor, motility, morphological defects and acrosome integrity. Semen collection success rate was 63% in breeding season and 2 (5%) samples were discarded by grade 5 contamination. Only 3 ejaculates from 16 tinamou were obtained in non-breeding season. Sperm concentration and acrosome integrity was higher (p = 0.00) in breeding season, and the percentage of total sperm morphological defects, were high in both in breeding and out breeding season. Overall, we concluded that the red-winged tinamou breeding season, is linked to photoperiod (spring and summer), and at this period time, semen can be obtained by cloacal massage collection satisfactorily, allowing its use in reproduction biotechnologies and sperm cryopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhynchotus rufescens 3aacrosome 3aadults 3abreeding 3abreeding season 3acaptive animals 3acloaca 3afeces 3amales 3amassage 3amucus 3aphotoperiod 3asemen 3asperm concentration 3aspring 3asummer 3aurine 3avigor 0aBird 0aTinamidae 0aSemen collection 0aSeason 0aSperm quality1 aCorreia, Luiz Eduardo Cruz dos Santos1 ade Camargo, Laiza Sartori1 aSilva, Kelry Mayara1 ade França, Tatyana Mendes1 aSilva, Josineudson Augusto de Vasconcelos1 aVeiga, Nabor1 ade Souza, Fabiana Ferreira0 tTheriogenology.g2018 Feb., v. 107 p.36-40dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2017.10.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245009200172300001600264520111400280592002801394650002001422650001901442650002401461650002201485650002401507650002901531650001701560653001501577653001901592653001901611653002101630653001901651653002401670700002301694700002501717773011601742856008501858852000901943655001201952IND60579461620221120092154.0170818e20170809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057946162DNAL7 a10.1080/15435075.2017.13346602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaddari, Mohamed10aEvaluation of energy savings by using high efficiency motors in a thermal power station  ap. 839-844.  aThis paper presents potential energy savings by installing high-efficiency motors instead of existing ones and their impact on greenhouse gases emissions reductions. This research study of the energy efficiency of electric motors has been performed in a typical thermal power plant. In the literature, the focus has been mainly on separate and away electric motors from operating facilities. The important advantage of this paper over other studies is that it uses the actual motors’ efficiency in the evaluation. The gains both in terms of electrical energy savings and in terms of financial economy by using high-efficiency motors have been discussed. As a result, the energy saving can be expected as 12.6% at the operating rate. This excellent result also reduces greenhouse gas emission by 1,423 tons every year. The analysis of the data provided an overview on energy losses often generated by the degradation and rewinding of electrical motors. This study represents very encouraging results that will help energy managers of industrial plants to become more involved in energy efficiency strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric motors 3aelectric power 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3afinancial economics 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apower plants 0aEfficiency 0aelectric motor 0aenergy savings 0agreenhouse gases 0apayback period 0athermal power plant1 aEl Mouden, Mahmoud1 aHajjaji, Abdelowahed0 tInternational journal of green energy.g2017 Aug. 9, v. 14, no. 10 p.839-844dTaylor & Francisx1543-50837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15435075.2017.13346603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010100167520129800268592002801566650001201594650002401606650002001630650003201650650001501682650001301697650001901710650002201729650004301751650000901794650001701803650003701820653003201857653002201889653002501911653000901936653000901945653000901954700001601963700001701979700002001996700001502016700001302031773010502044856008502149852000902234655001202243IND60758184520221118224501.0220103e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075818452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1043252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jichen10aArbuscular mycorrhiza fungi increase soil denitrifier abundance relating to vegetation community  aDenitrification by microorganisms in soil regulates ecosystem nitrogen availability and cycling. Although arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi (AMF) are best known as the key connectors between plant and microorganisms in below-ground soil, however, less knowledge is available about the interactive effects of AMF and vegetation community traits on soil denitrifiers. In this study, we manipulated experimental pots with or without AMF inoculation (AMF+ and AMF− treatments) under three plant richness levels and 27 different plant community compositions. Our results provided evidence that inoculation of AMF significantly increased the abundances of nirS-, nirK- and nosZ-type denitrifiers as revealed by quantitative PCR (qPCR), which inferred a positive role of AMF in N-cycling microorganisms. Plant community traits, including richness, community composition, biomass and species, were less important in influencing the abundances of soil denitrifiers, and no significant interactive effect was detected between AMF inoculation and plant richness or plant community compositions, indicating a weak direct relationship between plants and soil denitrifiers. Our study provided comprehensive insights into the roles of AMF-plant associate bio-system in driving the variation of soil denitrifiers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aecosystems 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aplant communities 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil 3asoil ecology 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 0aArbuscular mycorrhiza fungi 0aSoil denitrifiers 0aVegetation community 0aNirS 0aNirK 0aNosZ1 aWang, Jiang1 aHe, Ji-Zheng1 aJing, Zhongwang1 aXu, Yongli1 aGe, Yuan0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 Mar., v. 171 p.104325-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1043253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013200157300001600289520210900305592002802414650001502442650000802457650001702465650001002482650001902492650001402511650001102525650002002536650001602556650001902572700002502591700002502616773011802641856007502759852000902834655001202843IND60559465520221118054401.0161216e20150108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055946552DNAL7 a10.1021/jp509631b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFauser, Heiko10aSurface Adsorption of Oppositely Charged C14TAB-PAMPS Mixtures at the Air/Water Interface and the Impact on Foam Film Stability  ap. 348-358.  aWe have studied the oppositely charged polyelectrolyte/surfactant mixture of poly(acrylamidomethylpropanesulfonate) sodium salt (PAMPS) and tetradecyl trimethylammonium bromide (C₁₄TAB) using a combination of neutron reflectivity and ellipsometry measurements. The interfacial composition was determined using three different analysis methods involving the two techniques for the first time. The bulk surfactant concentration was fixed at a modest value while the bulk polyelectrolyte concentration was varied over a wide range. We reveal complex changes in the surface adsorption behavior. Mixtures with low bulk PAMPS concentrations result in the components interacting synergistically in charge neutral layers at the air/water interface. At the bulk composition where PAMPS and C₁₄TAB are mixed in an equimolar charge ratio in the bulk, we observe a dramatic drop in the surfactant surface excess to leave a large excess of polyelectrolyte at the interface, which we infer to have loops in its interfacial structure. Further increase of the bulk PAMPS concentration leads to a more pronounced depletion of material from the surface. Mixtures containing a large excess of PAMPS in the bulk showed enhanced adsorption, which is attributed to the large increase in total ionic strength of the system and screening of the surfactant headgroup charges. The data are compared to our former results on PAMPS/C₁₄TAB mixtures [Kristen et al. J. Phys. Chem. B, 2009, 23, 7986]. A peak in the surface tension is rationalized in terms of the changing surface adsorption and, unlike in more concentrated systems, is unrelated to bulk precipitation. Also, a comparison between the determined interfacial composition with zeta potential and foam film stability data shows that the highest film stability occurs when there is enhanced synergistic adsorption of both components at the interface due to charge screening when the total ionic strength of the system is highest. The additional contribution to the foam stability of the negatively charged polyelectrolyte within the film bulk is also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aair 3aelectrolytes 3afoams 3aionic strength 3ascreening 3asodium 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3azeta potential1 avon Klitzing, Regine1 aCampbell, Richard A.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2015 Jan. 08, v. 119, no. 1 p.348-358dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp509631b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02484naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008000172300001400252520118200266592002801448650002201476650001301498650001401511650001301525650001601538650002201554650002001576650001201596650001101608650001601619650001601635651001501651653002101666653004201687653002301729653001701752653001401769653001601783700001701799773013101816856008201947852000902029655001202038IND60547174920221117002807.0190606e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054717492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wsj.2014.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Fakharany, Zeinab10aAssessment of New Esna barrage impacts on groundwater and proposed measures  ap. 65-73.  aNile valley quaternary aquifer is in direct hydraulic interaction with Nile River, canals and drains. Therefore, implementation of new Esna barrage leads to enhancement of seepage flow from Nile River toward adjacent agricultural lands, impedance of drainage conditions and increase in the shallow groundwater levels beneath buildings in urban areas. Therefore, Esna city was selected as the study area to assess the impact of the barrage effect on groundwater aquifer and to propose mitigation measures. The most powerful method for studying the problem is developing a groundwater model based on monitored groundwater levels and simulating the effect of the proposed measures. Results indicated that Nile River in reaches upstream the barrage feeds the aquifer. Then, a model is used to test the effect of the mitigation measures on the surrounding settlements. Results also indicated that using cut off drains with depth of 2.5m is the most effective and safe solution, in terms of direct impact on the buildings without need for operation cost – only maintenance cost will be needed. Also, implementing a sewage network in the city as a long-term solution is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aaquifers 3abuildings 3adrainage 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3aoperating costs 3aseepage 3asewage 3aurban areas 3awater table 3aNile River 0aGroundwater rise 0aSurface water/groundwater interaction 0aNumerical modeling 0aEsna barrage 0aEsna city 0aUpper Egypt1 aFekry, Akram0 tWater Science.g2014 Oct., v. 28, no. 1 p.65-73dElsevier B.V.aNational Water Research CenterwJournal:23327x1110-49297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsj.2014.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03359naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006900150245014200219300001800361500001400379520157600393592002801969650000801997650002402005650002002029650002802049650001502077650001302092650001402105650001502119650001502134650001102149650001402160650001202174650001302186650001102199650001502210650002002225650001902245650001602264653001302280700002302293700002102316700002102337700005702358773034402415856008502759852000902844655001202853IND60702655420221116192849.0210212e20201127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070265542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoutoukidis, Dimitrios A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1955-723410aObesity, self-reported symptom severity, and quality of life in people with atrial fibrillation: A community-based cross-sectional survey  ap. 2221-2229.  aNAL-light  aIntentional weight loss may reduce symptom severity of atrial fibrillation (AF) in relatively young AF patients with overweight. We examined whether symptom severity and quality of life (QoL) are associated with weight status in the general population with AF.Patients with electrocardiogram-confirmed AF completed validated questionnaires: the EuroQol 5 Dimensions QoL questionnaire and the Toronto Atrial Fibrillation Severity Scale (AFSS). The AFSS assessed the AF burden scoring on AF-related symptoms and the total AF burden measured as a combination of duration, frequency, and severity of an irregular heartbeat. Generalized liner models examined the association of body mass index (BMI) with AF severity and QoL adjusting for confounders. Between 2018 and 2019, 882 of 1901 (46%) mailed questionnaires were returned completed. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 74 (10) years old and a BMI of 27.4 (5.6) kg/m². Sixteen percent reported having never experienced an irregular heartbeat. A 5 kg/m² higher BMI was associated with a 0.65 (95%CI: 0.25 to 1.06) higher symptom score, where 3 points represent a clinically relevant change in state. A 5 kg/m² higher BMI was associated with a −1.61 (95%CI: −2.72 to −0.50) lower QoL score. The coefficient of the total AF burden for a 5 kg/m² higher BMI was 0.17 (95% CI: −0.01 to 0.68).BMI was positively associated with symptoms and negatively associated with one of the two measures of QoL, but not with the total AF burden. However, the strength of association was small and not clinically meaningful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3aatrial fibrillation 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adimensions 3aduration 3afrequency 3aheart rate 3ametabolism 3amodels 3anutrition 3aobesity 3apatients 3apeople 3apopulation 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3aweight loss 0aSymptoms1 aJones, Nicholas R.1 aTaylor, Clare J.1 aCasadei, Barbara1 aAveyard, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1802-42170 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2020 Nov. 27, v. 30, no. 12 p.2221-2229dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011200155300001800267500002000285520101100305592002801316650002201344650001401366650001801380650001401398650001701412650001501429650001901444650002101463650002901484650002101513650001101534650001101545650001701556650001401573650001501587650001201602650001501614700002001629700001901649700002201668700001601690700001601706700001501722700001201737773013501749856007401884852000901958655001201967IND60572116620221118012050.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057211662DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.132382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Wenjia10aEnzymatic preparation of immunomodulatory hydrolysates from defatted wheat germ (Triticum Vulgare) globulin  ap. 2556-2566.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDefatted wheat germ globulin (DWGG) was hydrolysed using the enzymes alcalase, neutrase, papain, pepsin or trypsin to improve the immunomodulatory effects of the protein. The degree of hydrolysis (DH), molecular weight distribution, hydrophobicity, secondary structures and immunomodulatory activities were determined. The DH of hydrolysate using alcalase or neutrase was higher (P < 0.05) than that of hydrolysate prepared by other proteases. Alcalase hydrolysate (AH) had the strongest (P < 0.05) immunomodulatory activity with respect to lymphocyte proliferation, phagocytosis of neutral red and secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines. The molecular weight of AH ranged between 300 and 1450 Da and was composed of α‐helix and β‐turns. AH also showed the highest hydrophobic value (P < 0.05). The DH and hydrophobicity appear to be related to immunomodulatory activities. The hydrolysate prepared by the alcalase treatment on DWGG may be used as an immune supplement by the food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3acytokines 3afood industry 3aglobulins 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunomodulators 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amolecular weight 3apapain 3apepsin 3aphagocytosis 3asecretion 3asubtilisin 3atrypsin 3awheat germ1 aZhang, Mengmeng1 aSun, Chongzhen1 aBrennan, Margaret1 aLi, Huixian1 aWang, Guang1 aLai, Furao1 aWu, Hui0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2016 Dec., v. 51, no. 12 p.2556-2566dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.132383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245011800174300002000292520179400312592002802106650001302134650002102147650001502168650001202183650001202195700002602207700002302233700002302256700002102279700002002300773011302320856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60558463620170413000000.0161115e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055846362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b034532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeixeira, Carlos A.10aRenewable Solid Electrodes in Microfluidics: Recovering the Electrochemical Activity without Treating the Surface  ap. 11199-11206.  aThe contamination, passivation, or fouling of the detection electrodes is a serious problem undermining the analytical performance of electroanalytical devices. The methods to regenerate the electrochemical activity of the solid electrodes involve mechanical, physical, or chemical surface treatments that usually add operational time, complexity, chemicals, and further instrumental requirements to the analysis. In this paper, we describe for the first time a reproducible method for renewing solid electrodes whenever their morphology or composition are nonspecifically changed without any surface treatment. These renewable electrodes are the closest analogue to the mercury drop electrodes. Our approach was applied in microfluidics, where the downsides related to nonspecific modifications of the electrode are more critical. The renewal consisted in manually sliding metal-coated microwires across a channel with the sample. For this purpose, the chip was composed of a single piece of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with three parallel channels interconnected to one perpendicular and top channel. The microwires were inserted in each one of the parallel channels acting as working, counter, and pseudoreference electrodes for voltammetry. This assembly allowed the renewal of all the three electrodes by simply pulling the microwires. The absence of any interfaces in the chips and the elastomeric nature of the PDMS allowed us to pull the microwires without the occurrence of leakages for the electrode channels even at harsh flow rates of up to 40.0 mL min–¹. We expect this paper can assist the researchers to develop new microfluidic platforms that eliminate any steps of electrode cleaning, representing a powerful alternative for precise and robust analyses to real samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afouling 3amercury1 aGiordano, Gabriela

Within the same age group, the mRNA expression of CD68 was always highest, followed by that of CD3ε, CD79α, IgG and IgA. Moreover, CD68, CD3, CD79α, IgA and IgG positive cells were all located in the testicular interstitial tissues of juvenile and adult yaks. In the same age group, the frequency of CD68 positive macrophages was higher than that of CD3 positive T lymphocytes, which was followed by that of CD79α positive B lymphocytes and IgA and IgG positive plasmocytes. No significant difference was observed between the B lymphocyte and plasmocyte frequencies in yak testes. Furthermore, CD68, CD3ε, CD79α, IgA and IgG mRNA expression levels and the frequencies of CD68, CD3, CD79α, IgA and IgG positive cells increased from juveniles to adults. Similarly, the frequencies of CD68, CD3, CD79α, IgA and IgG positive cells also increased with age. These results suggest that in the yak testis, the immune defence system against pathogens might primarily comprise macrophages and T lymphocytes in the testicular interstitial tissue. Moreover, the testicular immune environment may mature and expand to a fully functional state in adult yaks. The low frequencies of B lymphocyte and plasmocyte in yaks, differing from those in rodents and humans, might be related to the fact that yaks live in low‐oxygen plateaus.  aPublisher supplied data  a32002241cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20JR5RA004cGansu Youth Science and Technology Fund Project  aGSAU‐RCZX201703cScientific Research Start‐up Funds for Openly‐Recruited Doctors, Gansu Agricultural University  aGSAU‐STS1730cSheng Tongsheng Innovation Funds, Gansu Agricultural University  aGSAU‐XKJS2018064cSpecial funds for discipline construction, Gansu Agricultural University 3aB-lymphocytes 3aadults 3agene expression 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ajuveniles 3amacrophages 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areproduction 3atestes 3ayaks1 aCui, Yan1 aYu, Sijiu1 aHe, Junfeng1 aPan, Yangyang1 aBai, Zhanchun0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2021 Sept., v. 56, no. 9 p.1192-1199dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.139863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002000163245009700183300001600280520111100296536011401407592002801521650001001549650001301559650001401572650000901586650002401595650002101619650001801640650001001658650001701668650001301685650001201698650003101710650005401741650002801795650000901823650001101832650005501843650004501898650004301943653002601986653000902012653003802021653000902059700002302068700001802091700002302109700002502132700002402157773013202181852000902313856008102322655001202403IND4460702620221121235519.0181016e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446070262DNAL7 a219083362pmid7 a10.1177/10406387114079012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachida, Yukino10aCutaneous invasive micropapillary carcinoma of probable apocrine sweat gland origin in a cat  ap. 840-844.  aAn invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMC) occurred in the buccal skin of an 18-year-old female cat. Histologically, the tumor had a honeycomb pattern characterized by clusters of neoplastic epithelial cells that were surrounded by empty clear spaces and lined with fibrocollagenous stroma. On immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were positive for cytokeratin (clone CAM5.2; pancytokeratin, clone AE1/AE3) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) but negative for cytokeratin 14, vimentin, S100, smooth muscle actin, and p63. The CEA-positive staining reaction was present along the outermost rim of the neoplastic cell clusters consistent with an “inside-out” immunoreactivity pattern. Examination of the tumor cells by electron microscopy revealed microvilli on the outermost rim of neoplastic cells that were directed toward the surrounding vacant space. Based on histomorphological characteristics, the neoplasm was defined as an IMC of “pure-type.” The location site and immunohistochemical features suggest the tumor was most likely derived from the apocrine sweat glands in the buccal skin.  aThe author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactin 3aantigens 3acarcinoma 3acats 3aelectron microscopy 3aepithelial cells 3asmooth muscle 3asweat 3asweat glands 3avimentin 2aAnimals 2aApocrine Glandsxpathology 2aCarcinomaxclassificationxpathologyxveterinary. 2aCat Diseasesxpathology 2aCats 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxphysiology 2aNeoplasm Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSkin Neoplasmsxpathologyxveterinary. 0aApocrine sweat glands 0acats 0ainvasive micropapillary carcinoma 0askin1 aYoshimura, Hisashi1 aNakahira, Rei1 aMichishita, Masaki1 aOhkusu-Tsukada, Kozo1 aTakahashi, Kimimasa0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 23, no. 4 p.840-844dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387114079013Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02679naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007700157300002000234520133800254592002801592650003701620650002401657650002501681650001301706650001801719650002401737650001901761650001901780650001901799650001801818650000901836650002701845650001101872650002701883650001201910650001601922700001301938700001401951700001301965700001701978773014301995856007402138852000902212655001202221IND60671126220221118023024.0191002e20150609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067112622DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ta02672e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilionis, A.10aLiquid repellent nanocomposites obtained from one-step water-based spray  ap. 12880-12889.  aSignificant research efforts have been directed towards the development of novel superhydrophobic and superoleophobic coatings. However, it is still highly challenging to develop facile and environmentally friendly methods that lead to surfaces and coatings with efficient liquid repellency. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time, a one-step water-based spray method on heated metallic substrates for the preparation of water and oil repellent polymer nanocomposite coatings by using hydrophilic silica nanoparticles. These environmentally-friendly coatings exhibit static contact angles exceeding 150° and roll off angles less than 5° for both water and oil and can also successfully repel a wide variety of other liquids. The influence of the chemical composition and the surface texture on the wetting properties are discussed based on measurements from white light interferometry, electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. When the substrates were treated with an adhesive primer, the wear abrasion resistance of the coatings was enhanced. The effect of silica nanoparticle dispersion in the coatings on wear abrasion is also investigated. Certain nanocomposites were found to exhibit good abrasion resistance by retaining their water repellency for up to 60 abrasion cycles under 20.5 kPa applied pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabrasion resistance 3achemical composition 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3aelectron microscopy 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ainterferometry 3ananoparticles 3aoils 3apolymer nanocomposites 3asilica 3asustainable technology 3atexture 3awhite light1 aDang, K.1 aPrato, M.1 aLoth, E.1 aBayer, I.

To investigate the impact of the pig carcass incident on microbial water quality, 178 river water samples were collected from the upper Huangpu River from March 2013 to March 2014. Samples were concentrated by calcium carbonate flocculation and examined for host-adapted Cryptosporidium and Enterocytozoon bieneusi by ploymerase chain reaction (PCR). Positive PCR products were sequenced to determine Cryptosporidium species and E. bieneusi genotypes. A total of 67 (37.6%) and 56 (31.5%) samples were PCR-positive for Cryptosporidium and E. bieneusi, respectively. The occurrence rates of Cryptosporidium and E. bieneusi in March 2013 (83.3%; 41.7%) and May 2013 (73.5%; 44.1%) were significantly higher than rates in later sampling times. Among the 13 Cryptosporidium species/genotypes identified, C. andersoni and C. suis were the most common species, being found in 38 and 27 samples, respectively. Seventeen E. bieneusi genotypes were found, belonging to 11 established genotypes (EbpC, EbpA, D, CS-8, PtEb IX, Peru 8, Peru 11, PigEBITS4, EbpB, G, O) and six new ones (RWSH1 to RWSH6), most of which belonged to pig-adapted Groups 1d and 1e. EbpC was the most common genotype, being found in 37 samples. The distribution of Cryptosporidium species and E. bieneusi genotypes suggest that dead pigs contributed significantly to Cryptosporidium and E. bieneusi contamination in the Huangpu River. Although most Cryptosporidium species found in river water were not major human pathogens, the majority of E. bieneusi genotypes detected were endemic in China. Data from this study should be useful in the development of strategies in addressing future contamination events in drinking water supplies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCryptosporidium 3aEnterocytozoon bieneusi 3aanimal pathogens 3acalcium carbonate 3acarcass disposal 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3aflocculation 3agenotype 3ahuman diseases 3apig carcasses 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ariver water 3arivers 3asampling 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aChina1 aFeng, Yaoyu1 aHuang, Chengchen1 aXiao, Lihua0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2014 Dec. 16, v. 48, no. 24 p.14219-14227dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes504464t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245018300162300001800345500002000363520099300383592002801376650002801404650002801432650002201460650001601482650002001498650001801518650001701536650002101553650001501574650003301589650001501622650001401637650001301651650001801664700002501682700002901707700003101736700002401767773013501791856007401926852000902000655001202009IND60572116720221118011943.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057211672DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.132492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaewiad, Kanyanat10aOptimisation of bambara groundnut water extract and skim milk composition as cryoprotectant for increasing cell viability of Lactobacillus spp. using response surface methodology  ap. 2630-2639.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFour legume water extracts, that is bambara groundnut, soya bean, red kidney bean and black bean as well as skim milk, were examined for their effectiveness in protecting Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus fermentum SK5 during the freeze‐drying and storage. Bambara groundnut water extract (BGWE) showed promising cryoprotective activity that was comparable to skim milk. BGWE and skim milk at 2–10% w/v and 5–20% w/v individually produced survival rates for both strains of 87–88%. To further optimise the synergistic cryoprotective medium, response surface methodology was employed. The optimal combination was 4.93% w/v BGWE and 11.68% w/v skim milk for L. rhamnosus GG and 5.17% w/v BGWE and 11.36% w/v skim milk for L. fermentum SK5 with survival rates of 95.17% and 94.36%, respectively. The storage life of freeze‐dried cells of both probiotics at 4 °C and 30 °C for 6 months was markedly improved when they were produced with these optimal combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus fermentum 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aVigna subterranea 3ablack beans 3acryoprotectants 3afreeze drying 3akidney beans 3amilk composition 3aprobiotics 3aresponse surface methodology 3ashelf life 3askim milk 3asoybeans 3asurvival rate1 aKaewnopparat, Nattha1 aFaroongsarng, Damrongsak1 aWungsintaweekul, Juraithip1 aKaewnopparat, Sanae0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2016 Dec., v. 51, no. 12 p.2630-2639dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.132493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03917naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006600150245013300216300001800349500001400367520169100381592002802072650001902100650001402119650002802133650002802161650001702189650002302206650003102229650000802260650001502268650001102283650004302294650001402337650001202351650002402363650001102387650001002398651001602408653002802424653003202452653003302484653003002517653000902547653000802556653000802564653001202572653000702584653000802591653000802599653000802607653000802615653000802623700002302631700002002654700002402674700006102698700005802759773034402817856008503161852000903246655001203255IND60702655620221116192910.0210212e20201127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070265562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2020.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaiman, Elisabeth H.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8948-786014aThe role of insulin resistance in the relation of visceral, abdominal subcutaneous and total body fat to cardiovascular function  ap. 2230-2241.  aNAL-light  aThe separate cardiovascular effects of type 2 diabetes and adiposity remain to be examined. This study aimed to investigate the role of insulin resistance in the relations of visceral (VAT), abdominal subcutaneous (aSAT) adipose tissue and total body fat (TBF) to cardiovascular remodeling.In this cross-sectional analysis of the population-based Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study, 914 middle-aged individuals (46% men) were included. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging. Standardized linear regression coefficients (95%CI) were calculated, adjusted for potential confounding factors. All fat depots and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), separate from VAT and TBF, were associated with lower mitral early and late peak filling rate ratios (E/A): −0.04 (−0.09;0.01) per SD (54 cm²) VAT; −0.05 (−0.10;0.00) per SD (94 cm²) aSAT; −0.09 (−0.16;-0.02) per SD (8%) TBF; −0.11 (−0.17;-0.05) per 10-fold increase in HOMA-IR, whereas VAT and TBF were differently associated with left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume: −8.9 (−11.7;-6.1) mL per SD VAT; +5.4 (1.1;9.7) mL per SD TBF. After adding HOMA-IR to the model to evaluate the mediating role of insulin resistance, change in E/A was −0.02 (−0.07;0.04) per SD VAT; −0.03 (−0.08;0.02) per SD aSAT; −0.06 (−0.13;0.01) per SD TBF, and change in LV end-diastolic volume was −7.0 (−9.7;-4.3) mL per SD VAT. In women, adiposity but not HOMA-IR was related to higher aortic arch pulse wave velocity.Insulin resistance was associated with reduced diastolic function, separately from VAT and TBF, and partly mediated the associations between adiposity depots and lower diastolic function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aadiposity 3acardiovascular diseases 3across-sectional studies 3aepidemiology 3ainsulin resistance 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amen 3ametabolism 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aregression analysis 3avolume 3awomen 3aNetherlands 0aVisceral adipose tissue 0aSubcutaneous adipose tissue 0aLeft ventricular dysfunction 0aDiabetic cardiomyopathies 0aaSAT 0aBMI 0aE/A 0aHOMA-IR 0aLV 0aMRI 0aNEO 0aPWV 0aTBF 0aVAT1 ade Mutsert, Renée1 aWidya, Ralph L.1 aRosendaal, Frits R.1 aJukema, J.

During the synthesis and utilization of these chemical products, their residues unavoidably emerged in environments to severely threaten human’s health. It is thus urgent to exploit effective technology for readily removing the organic pollutants with high selectivity and good reusability. As one of the most promising approaches, molecular imprinting technology (MIT) employs a chemically synthetic route to construct artificial recognition sites in highly-crosslinked matrix with complementary cavity and functional groups to target species, which have been attracting more and more interest for environmental remediation, such as the selective adsorption/separation and improved catalytic degradation of pollutants. In this review, MIT is first introduced briefly to understand their preparing process, recognition mechanism and common imprinted systems. Then, their specific binding affinities are demonstrated for selectively adsorbing and removing target molecules with a large capacity. Furthermore, the innovative utilization of MIT in catalytic eradication of pollutants is comprehensively overviewed to emphasize their enhanced efficiency and improved performances, which are classified by the used catalytically-active nanocrystals and imprinted systems. After summarizing recent advances in these fields, some limitations are discussed and possible suggestions are given to guide the future exploitation on MIT for environmental protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3ahumans 3aindustrialization 3ananocrystals 3aremediation 3aurbanization 0aMolecular imprinting 0aSelective adsorption 0aPhotocatalytic eradication 0aOrganic pollutants 0aEnvironmental remediation 0aNanomaterials1 aPan, Jia Hong1 aLi, Zibiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0591-53280 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 265 p.129077-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01271naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245006300164300001800227520043000245592002800675650003100703650002200734650001700756700001700773773012700790856007900917852000900996655001201005IND60302153120221120232308.0150704e20131220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030215312DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12454502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Wit, Julien10aConstraining Exoplanet Mass from Transmission Spectroscopy  ap. 1473-1477.  aWeighing Up Exoplanets The mass of a planet is important to know, but it is difficult to determine for an exoplanet.

This study reports on the effectiveness of a biofilter cover design at oxidizing CH₄ produced by dairy effluent ponds. Three substrates, a volcanic pumice soil, a garden-waste compost, and a mixture of the two, were tested as media for the biofilters. All substrates were suspended as 5 cm covers overlying simulated dairy effluent ponds. Methane fluxes supplied to the filters were commensurate with emission rates from typical dairy effluent ponds. All substrates oxidized more than 95% of the CH₄ influx (13.9 g CH₄ m–³ h–¹) after two months and continued to display high oxidation rates for the remaining one month of the trial. The volcanic soil biofilters exhibited the highest oxidation rates (99% removal). When the influx CH₄ dose was doubled for a month, CH₄ removal rates remained >90% for all substrates (maximum = 98%, for the volcanic soil), suggesting that biofilters have a high capacity to respond to increases in CH₄ loads. Nitrous oxide emissions from the biofilters were negligible (maximum = 19.9 mg N₂O m–³ h–¹) compared with CH₄ oxidation rates, particularly from the volcanic soil that had a much lower microbial-N (75 mg kg–¹) content than the compost-based filters (>240 mg kg–¹). The high and sustained CH₄ oxidation rates observed in this laboratory study indicate that a biofilter cover design is a potentially efficient method to mitigate CH₄ emissions from dairy effluent ponds. The design should now be tested under field conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilters 3abiofiltration 3abiogas 3acomposts 3aenergy recovery 3agarden residues 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amethane 3amethane production 3amethanotrophs 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidation 3aponds 3apumice 3avolcanic soils1 aDeslippe, Julie1 aTate, K.

Under the optimal culture condition, the production of mycelia and IPS reached 17.19 and 2.86gl⁻¹, respectively in a 15l stirred tank bioreactor, which were about twice than that of the basal medium. Furthermore, the ethanol extract of mycelia (EEM) and IPS had a direct antiproliferative effect on human gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901 and MKN-45 in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, human normal gastric cell line GES-1 was less susceptible to EEM and IPS. These results suggest that F. fomentarius may represent a promising novel approach for gastric cancer intervention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFomes fomentarius 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3aculture media 3adose response 3aethanol 3ahumans 3amedicinal fungi 3amycelium 3anutrient requirements 3apolysaccharides 3astomach neoplasms1 aZhao, Zhao1 aLi, Yongquan0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 May 6, v. 85, no. 2 p.369-375dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.02.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005300151245010000204300001300304520132800317592002801645650002001673650001101693650002201704650002001726650001401746650002101760650002501781650001401806650001501820650000901835650000901844650001301853650002201866650001201888650002301900651002001923653002001943653001501963653001201978653002201990653001402012653002102026700001902047700001402066700002002080773009602100856008502196852000902281655001202290IND60547423820221119093039.0160903e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054742382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.06.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJolma, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3490-749012aA software system for assessing the spatially distributed ecological risk posed by oil shipping  ap. 1-11.  aA maritime accident involving an oil tanker may lead to large scale mortality or reductions in populations of coastal species due to oil. The ecological value at stake is the biota on the coast, which are neither uniformly nor randomly distributed. We used an existing oil spill simulation model, an observation database of threatened species, and a valuation method and developed a software system for assessing the spatially distributed ecological risk posed by oil shipping. The approach links a tanker accident model to a set of oil spill simulations and further to a spatial ecological value data set. The tanker accident model is a Bayesian network and thus we present a case of using a Bayesian network in geographic analysis. A case in the Gulf of Finland is used for illustration of the methodology. The method requires and builds on an extensive data collection and generation effort and modeling. The main difference of our work to earlier works on using a Bayesian network in geospatial setting is that in our case the Bayesian network was used to compute the probabilities of spatial scenarios directly in a global sense while in earlier works Bayesian networks have been used for each location separately to obtain global results. The result was a software system that was used by a distributed research team.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3acoasts 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3adatabases 3aecological value 3aenvironmental models 3amortality 3aoil spills 3aoils 3arisk 3ashipping 3asimulation models 3atankers 3athreatened species 3aGulf of Finland 0aRisk assessment 0aGeospatial 0aEcology 0aMaritime accident 0aOil spill 0aBayesian network1 aLehikoinen, A.1 aHelle, I.1 aVenesjärvi, R.0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2014 Nov., v. 61 p.1-11dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245009700169300001800266500001100284520112700295592002801422650002201450650002201472650002001494650002101514650003001535700002101565700002801586700002601614700002301640700001801663700002201681700001901703700005901722773012501781856008301906852000901989655001201998IND60757078420221123003555.0220221e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075707842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-06812-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Paolis, Elisa10aTumor BRCA testing in ovarian cancer and EQA scheme: our experience of a critical evaluation  ap. 8203-8209.  aReview  aNext generation sequencing (NGS) is a widespread molecular biology method integrated into clinical practice to detect genetic variants, for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The scheduled external quality assessments (EQA) is integral part of clinical molecular laboratory quality assurance. The EQA provides an efficient system to compare analytic test performances among different laboratories, which is essential to evaluate consistency of molecular test. EQA failures demands targeted corrective action plans. In this context, the complexity of the NGS techniques requires careful and continuous quality control procedures. We report a tumor BRCA1/2 (tBRCA) testing benchmark discrepancy provided by the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network in our laboratory during a round of EQA for somatic mutation testing of BRCA genes in relation to ovarian cancer. The critical analysis emerging from the tBRCA EQA is presented. We underline that harmonization processes are still required for the EQA in the molecular biology field, especially if applied to the evaluation of methods characterized by high complexity.  aPublisher supplied data 3amolecular biology 3aovarian neoplasms 3aquality control 3asomatic mutation 3atumor suppressor proteins1 aConcolino, Paola1 aOnori, Maria Elisabetta1 aSantonocito, Concetta1 aMarchetti, Claudia1 aFagotti, Anna1 aScambia, Giovanni1 aUrbani, Andrea1 aMinucci, Angelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0833-43340 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 Dec., v. 48, no. 12 p.8203-8209dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06812-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245008600154300001800240500002000258520119700278592002801475650003001503650001801533650002501551650002201576650001301598650001101611650001001622650001001632650002201642650001401664650001201678650001301690650002701703650002201730650001101752650002701763650001401790700001601804700002101820700001601841773011901857856007301976852000902049655001202058IND60572034220221121045925.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057203422DNAL7 a10.1111/jph.125272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Xueyin10aVdSho1 Regulates Growth, Oxidant Adaptation and Virulence in Verticillium dahliae  ap. 1064-1074.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVerticillium dahliae infection leads to Verticillium wilt in cotton and other dicotyledon crops. To reduce the loss of economic crops, more attention has been focused on the key genes involved in pathogenicity of this soil‐borne plant fungal pathogen. Sho1 encodes a conserved tetraspan transmembrane protein which is a key element of the two upstream branches of the HOG‐MAPK pathway in fungi. Sho1 is required for full virulence in a wide variety of pathogenic fungi. In this study, sho1 mutant in V. dahliae (designated ΔVdsho1) was generated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens‐mediated transformation. ΔVdsho1 strain was highly sensitive to menadione (at concentration of 120 μm) and hydrogen peroxide (at concentration of 250 μm), displayed delayed spore germination and reduced spore production compared with the wild type and the complemented strains. During infection of host cotton plants, ΔVdsho1 exhibited impaired ability of root attachment and invasive growth. Results from the present work suggest that VdSho1 controls external sensing, virulence and multiple growth‐related traits in V. dahliae and might serve as a potential target for control of Verticillium wilt.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aMagnoliopsida 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aVerticillium wilt 3abranches 3acotton 3acrops 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amenadione 3amutants 3aoxidants 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aspore germination 3aspores 3atransmembrane proteins 3avirulence1 aZhou, Shuai1 aShang, Xiaoguang1 aWang, Xinyu0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2016 Dec., v. 164, no. 11-12 p.1064-1074dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.125273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02254naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014200167300001600309520106500325592002801390650001501418650001501433650002601448650001001474650001701484650002401501650001101525650001301536650002301549650001601572650001901588650001601607700001401623700001701637700001401654773009401668856008501762852000901847655001201856IND60087839520221120060140.0141102e20110506xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008783952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasiliu, S.10aAdsorption of cefotaxime sodium salt on polymer coated ion exchange resin microparticles: Kinetics, equilibrium and thermodynamic studies  ap. 376-387.  aMicroparticles with complex architectures based on the polyelectrolyte complexes between an acrylic ion exchange resin and two polysaccharides: gellan and xanthan gum were prepared and used for the adsorption of antibiotic in order to obtain a new drug delivery systems. Batch adsorption studies have been carried out to determine the effect of the contact time, temperature and the initial concentration of drug solution on the adsorption behavior. The Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin–Radushkevich adsorption isotherms were used to model this behavior. The kinetics were fitted with the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Elovich and intraparticle diffusion models. The best results were achieved with pseudo-second order kinetic model. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔG, ΔH, ΔS) were also calculated and the values indicate that the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous. The results showed that the microparticles with complex structures have a higher adsorption capacity, making it suitable for use in drug delivery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acefotaxime 3adrug delivery systems 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aion exchange resins 3amodels 3apolymers 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3axanthan gum1 aBunia, I.1 aRacovita, S.1 aNeagu, V.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 May 6, v. 85, no. 2 p.376-387dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245015700169520190600326592002802232650001602260650001402276650001102290650001302301650001502314650001102329650002302340650001602363650002202379650002402401653002202425653002002447653002302467653002602490653002502516700001202541700001702553700001602570700001302586700001702599700001302616700001702629773011902646856008802765852000902853655001202862IND60781365120221120150934.0221004e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078136512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1568292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Xingyu10aQuantifying the spatial pattern of urban heat islands and the associated cooling effect of blue–green landscapes using multisource remote sensing data  aSurface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are a global concern. Although their spatial pattern and the cooling effect of blue-green landscapes have been documented, exploring more accurate and quantitative results is still necessary. For Hangzhou, we combined nighttime light (NTL) data with LST images to investigate the spatial morphology of SUHIs and analyze the cooling effect of blue–green landscapes. The radiative transfer equation (RTE) method was used to derive the land surface temperature (LST). Then, based on the unique feature of Luojia1-01 NTL data, the concentric zone model (CZM) was proposed to depict the urban spatial structure. The CZM was applied to construct a number of equal-area concentric belts along the urban-rural gradient to determine the SUHI range and the corresponding blue–green landscape cooling effects. Finally, local Moran's I indices were adopted to identify the cold-hot spots of the SUHI and the relationship with land use. The minimum, average and maximum LSTs were 21.81 °C, 32.79 °C and 44.79 °C, respectively. Additionally, 59.16 % of the study area was affected by the SUHI, and the mean LST inside the SUHI was 36.4 °C, clearly higher than that of the rural area. The SUHI hotpots were clustered in regions with intensive human activities, forming archipelagos. Due to the different blue–green landscape densities, the cooling capacity had spatial heterogeneity in different urban rural belts (URBs), and the cooling capacity of URB₁₆ was approximately 71 times that of URB₁. The cooling efficiency increased with blue–green landscape density in general; hence, blue–green landscape density thresholds of 40 % and 70 % were recommended in the urban planning of different urban function zones. Relating the pattern of NTL data to LST images provide meaningful insight into the spatial pattern of SUHIs and the optimization of urban planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3aequations 3ahumans 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aradiative transfer 3arural areas 3aspatial variation 3asurface temperature 0aUrban heat island 0aSpatial pattern 0aCooling efficiency 0aConcentric zone modes 0aNighttime light data1 aHe, Tao1 aXu, Liuchang1 aTong, Cheng1 aYe, Yang1 aLiu, Hongjiu1 aXu, Dayu1 aZheng, Xinyu0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 843 p.156829-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1568293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245009400179520219500273592002802468650001102496650000802507650001802515650002602533650001302559650001302572650001202585650002002597650001202617650001502629650001002644650001102654650001702665650001402682650002202696651001002718653003302728653002302761653002202784653001002806653002502816653002602841700003102867700003002898700002202928700002102950700003302971700002003004773010703024856008703131852000903218655001203227IND60686697120221120130245.0200427e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068669712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1173762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalley, Christopher S.10aMicroenvironmental modelling of personal fine particulate matter exposure in Accra, Ghana  aThe health burden from exposure to fine particulate matter (PM₂.₅) is disproportionately concentrated in low- and middle-income countries. To evaluate strategies to reduce PM₂.₅ exposure, the contribution of different sources, both indoor and outdoor, to overall personal PM₂.₅ exposure needs to be identified. Despite this, exposure to PM₂.₅ from indoor and outdoor origin are most often considered separately. This work presents the first application of a microenvironmental modelling approach in a sub-Saharan African city (Accra, Ghana) to estimate personal PM₂.₅ exposures to population groups disaggregated by gender and age and identify the key factors determining these exposures. Time-activity profiles for each population group were combined with PM₂.₅ concentrations estimated for three home microenvironments using a dynamic microenvironmental model, INDAIR, and for work, school and transport microenvironments using a steady-state model to estimate personal PM₂.₅ exposures. In Accra, cooking using charcoal, compared to liquified petroleum gas (LPG), was estimated to result in substantially higher home PM₂.₅ concentrations, and higher personal PM₂.₅ exposure for the female adult and child population groups, compared with the male population groups. In households cooking using charcoal, more than 60% of total personal PM₂.₅ exposure was estimated to be due to residential cooking for the child and female population groups, which reduces to less than 10% when LPG was used for cooking, with the remaining contribution from PM₂.₅ of outdoor origin. The key parameters to which personal PM₂.₅ exposure estimates are sensitive are the air exchange rate between indoor and outdoors, the kitchen volume, and charcoal emission rates. This study therefore informs on the additional data collection and measurements that could substantially enhance the parameterisation of micro-environmental models for application in low- and middle-income countries where a limited number of studies have been conducted, and improve their utility in assessing strategies to reduce personal air pollution exposure of different population groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aair 3aair pollution 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acharcoal 3achildren 3acooking 3adata collection 3afemales 3ahouseholds 3amales 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apetroleum 3apollution control 3aGhana 0aMicroenvironmental modelling 0aParticulate matter 0aPersonal exposure 0aAccra 0aIndoor air pollution 0aOutdoor air pollution1 aAshmore, M.

However, information on intestinal microbiota, especially for large wild carnivores, is insufficient. In the present study, the bacterial community in the feces of snow leopards (Uncia uncia) was described based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A total of 339 near-full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences representing 46 non-redundant bacterial phylotypes (operational taxonomical units, OTUs) were identified in fecal samples from four healthy snow leopards. Four different bacterial phyla were identified: Firmicutes (56.5 %), Actinobacteria (17.5 %), Bacteroidetes (13 %), and Proteobacteria (13 %). The phylum Actinobacteria was the most abundant lineage, with 40.4 % of all identified clones, but Clostridiales, with 50 % of all OTUs, was the most diverse bacterial order. The order Clostridiales was affiliated with four families: Clostridiaceae I, Lachnospiraceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. Lachnospiraceae was the most diverse family with 17 OTUs identified. These findings were basically consistent with previous reports on the bacterial diversity in feces from other mammals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aClostridiaceae 3aPanthera uncia 3aPeptostreptococcaceae 3aProteobacteria 3abacterial communities 3acarnivores 3aclones 3adigestive system 3afeces 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amammals 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylotype 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis1 aLiu, Guangshuai1 aChen, Lei1 aSha, Weilai0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2015 June, v. 65, no. 2 p.703-711dSpringer-Verlagx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-014-0909-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02074naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245012700180300001600307520075800323592002801081650003101109650002301140650001301163650001801176650001301194650001601207650000901223650004301232650001201275650002901287650002601316700002201342700002401364700001801388700002001406700002201426700001701448773009701465856008101562852000901643655001201652IND60133486220221118004348.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013348622DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-014-0910-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores-Valdez, Mario Alberto10aOverexpression of DosR in Mycobacterium tuberculosis does not affect aerobic replication in vitro or in murine macrophages  ap. 713-720.  aMycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv, constitutively expressing a second copy of the transcriptional regulator DosR (Rv3133c) under control of the hsp60 promoter, was compared to wild-type M. tuberculosis for in vitro expression of the target genes of the DosR dormancy regulon, for its in vitro growth characteristics in liquid 7H9 culture medium, and for its capacity to replicate in murine macrophages.

We present an approach for predicting N2O emissions based on a statistical random-effects model: the N2O emission response to applied nitrogen fertilizer is described by an exponential function, the parameters of which are assumed to vary randomly between locations. One of the advantages of this model is that its parameters are easily adjusted to one or several location-specific N2O measurements. The adjusted model can then be used to predict N2O emissions for nitrogen fertilizer doses other than those applied at the considered location. We evaluated the accuracy of model prediction, with real and simulated data. The use of location-specific rather than average predictions reduced prediction errors in most cases. Location-specific predictions could be used to estimate background emission in on-farm studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural soils 3aanthropogenic activities 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrous oxide 3aprediction 0aNitrous oxide 0aExperimental design 0aRandom-effects model 0aBayesian model 0aNitrogen fertilization 0aModel error1 aLoyce, Chantal1 aMakowski, David0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2014 Nov., v. 61 p.12-18dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245009400159300001600253500001500269520102600284592002801310650001201338650001201350650002401362650001301386650001301399650001901412650001301431650001301444650000901457650002001466650001501486650002001501653001101521700001701532773009601549856007101645852000901716655001201725IND60518809120221119031400.0160419e198804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051880912DNAL7 a10.2307/19404322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizutani, Hiroshi10aNitrogen and Carbon Isotope Ratios in Seabird Rookeries and their Ecological Implications  ap. 340-349.  a2019-12-06  aVarious samples around gull and penguin rookeries were examined for nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios. The results showed that input of organic nitrogen from avain breeding activity, followed by its aerobic decomposition in soil and by volatilization of the resultant ammonia, strongly dominated nitrogen flow in both rookeries. Plants, animals, and soils in the rookeries appeared dependent on the nitrogen thus provided. In the penguin rookery, soil organic carbon was also derived from breeding activity. A large input of organic carbon by gulls, however, appeared to have quickly escape from the gull rookery through respiration. It had little effect on the soil organic carbon; the main source of organic carbon there seemed to have come from higher plants. Major pathways of material flow in the seabird rookeries were deduced from the isotopic data. Study of stable isotopes should enable us to draw similar pictures for other ecosystems; it is particularly useful in places where frequent visits are impractical.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aLaridae 3asoil organic carbon 3apenguins 3anitrogen 3avolatilization 3abreeding 3aseabirds 3asoil 3aplants (botany) 3aecosystems 3astable isotopes 0acarbon1 aWada, Eitaro0 tEcology.g1988 Apr., v. 69, no. 2 p.340-349dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19404323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245020200168300001600370520165000386592002802036650002602064650001002090650001602100650003602116650001202152650002302164650001902187650001502206650001902221650001802240650002502258650001902283650001302302650001202315650001202327650001902339650001002358650001102368650001702379650001602396650001502412700002102427700003002448700002402478773009702502856008102599852000902680655001202689IND60133486320221118004424.0150520e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013348632DNAL7 a10.1007/s13213-014-0912-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumariya, Rashmi10aGradual pediocin PA-1 resistance in Enterococcus faecalis confers cross-protection to diverse pore-forming cationic antimicrobial peptides displaying changes in cell wall and mannose PTS expression  ap. 721-732.  aDue to innate and acquired resistance in Enterococcus faecalis against most antibiotics, identification of new alternatives has increased interest in diverse populations of potent cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) for treatment and natural food biopreservation. The CAMPs, after crossing the cell wall to the periplasmic space, kill their target strain by forming pores in the cell membrane. However, reports of resistance against these CAMPs necessitated the understanding of step(s) interfered with while acquiring this resistance, for designing effective CAMP analogs. In this direction, we selected stable and gradual dose-dependent pediocin PA-1 single exposure resistant (Pedʳ) mutants of E. faecalis, which conferred cross-protection to diverse CAMPs, viz., HNP-1, nisin and alamethicin but not to polymyxin B, lysozyme and vancomycin. With these Pedʳmutants of E. faecalis there was: a gradual neutralization in cell wall surface charge involving D-alanylation of wall teichoic acids (WTA) and lipoteichoic acids (LTA), increase in cell-surface hydrophobicity, increased cell aggregation and biofilm formation and ultra-structural changes in the cell wall, and a reduction of periplasmic space. In addition, a gradual decrease in expression of mannose PTS two (mpt) operon was also observed with distinct changes in growth rate achieving the same biomass production during the stationary phase. These results show that resistance to these CAMPs is not due to mpt directly acting as a docking molecule but due to changes in the cell wall, which increased the permeability barrier to CAMPs diffusion to reach the periplasmic space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aacids 3aalamethicin 3aantimicrobial cationic peptides 3abiofilm 3abiomass production 3acell membranes 3acell walls 3across immunity 3adose response 3afood biopreservation 3ahydrophobicity 3alysozyme 3amannose 3amutants 3aneutralization 3anisin 3aoperon 3apermeability 3apolymyxin B 3avancomycin1 aSood, Shiv Kumar1 aRajput, Yudhishthir Singh1 aGarsa, Anita Kumari0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2015 June, v. 65, no. 2 p.721-732dSpringer-Verlagx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-014-0912-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094024004300140040001800183100002700201245013800228500001400366506007600380506003100456520155700487592002802044596006902072596008302141596007002224596004502294596003102339506003702370650001902407650002202426650002702448650001202475650001202487650001002499650001602509650001202525650001202537650002202549650001302571650000902584650000902593650001302602700001702615700001702632700001902649700002002668700001702688773009102705856009002796852000902886655001202895IND60718483420221207110935.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071848342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290862chorus7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenavides, Bolaños J.10aCadmium phytoextraction by Helianthus annuus (sunflower), Brassica napus cv Wichita (rapeseed), and Chyrsopogon zizanioides (vetiver)  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe use of phytoextraction plant species to accumulate soil metals into harvestable plant parts is a method used for managing soils with high cadmium (Cd). We evaluated three Cd accumulating species recently recommended for such use in cacao farms where Cd removal is needed to maintain markets: Helianthus annuus (sunflower), Brassica napus (rapeseed), and Chyrsopogon zizanioides (vetiver). Plants were grown in two greenhouse pot experiments with different Cd-spiked growth media: (sand plus perlite) and a natural soil. Plant total Cd and Cd uptake in shoot biomass of all species, across both experiments, increased linearly with increasing amounts of added Cd. Rapeseed had the highest plant total Cd and sunflower had the highest Cd uptake in shoot biomass. The highest application of Cd corresponded to the highest plant total Cd and shoot biomass Cd uptake, regardless of species. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) for each species increased in a curvilinear manner with added Cd, with maximum BCF values for plants grown in the sand and perlite matrix at 2.5 mg kg⁻¹ added Cd and in the natural soil at 5.0 mg kg⁻¹ added Cd. We conclude that the Cd uptake (shoot biomass only) capability of the three species examined is greatest for sunflower given its increased uptake with Cd additions, its BCF value > 1, and lack of observed visual Cd toxicity symptoms, fungus and insect damage. Although these species had BCF >1, the potential annual removal of Cd would have been too small to support a meaningful phytoextraction practice.  aPublisher supplied data  cForeign Agricultural Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009170  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cPennsylvania State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008321  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cBarry Community Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica napus 3aHelianthus annuus 3abioaccumulation factor 3abiomass 3acadmium 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3ainsects 3aperlite 3aphytoaccumulation 3arapeseed 3asand 3asoil 3atoxicity1 aDrohan, P.J.1 aSpargo, J.T.1 aMaximova, S.N.1 aGuiltinan, M.J.1 aMiller, D.A.0 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 265 p.129086-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01309naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245006700158300002000225520032300245592002800568650002100596650002700617650002300644650002300667650001300690650001300703650001300716700001800729700001700747773013600764856007400900852000900974655001200983IND60659675520221120213543.0190823e20121017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065967552DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc35738k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Ming-Jie10aEnabling Wittig reaction on site-specific protein modification  ap. 11079-11081.  aAn efficient aqueous Wittig reaction was enabled on protein bioconjugation for the first time.

Of these, 23 bacterial isolates capable of inhibiting Phytophthora capsici growth were selected. Among the antagonistic bacteria, one strain, IBFCBF‐1 showed the strongest antagonistic activity, and was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens based on the results of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, physiological and biochemical testing, and morphological characteristics. When tested with a dual‐culture method and with laboratory greenhouse studies, the strain IBFCBF‐1 was found to be a potential biocontrol agent for controlling the plant pathogen, P. capsici. Moreover, it showed high efficiency and broad‐spectrum antifungal properties in vitro. Under greenhouse conditions, IBFCBF‐1 could significantly promote the growth of pepper seedlings, and was able to solubilize phosphate, and produce indole acetic acid (IAA) and ammonia. This study clearly demonstrated that IBFCBF‐1 is a potential candidate exhibiting phytophthora blight‐suppressive and plant growth‐promoting effects on pepper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aPhytophthora capsici 3aammonia 3aantifungal properties 3abacteria 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3ablight 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouse production 3agrowth promotion 3aindole acetic acid 3apepper 3aphosphates 3aplant pathogens 3arhizosphere 3aribosomal RNA 3aseedlings 3asequence analysis 3asoil1 aLi, Jilie1 aShen, Airong1 aTan, Shiyong1 aYan, Zhun1 aYu, Yongting1 aXue, Zhaodong1 aTan, Taimeng1 aZeng, Liangbin0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2016 Dec., v. 164, no. 11-12 p.1012-1021dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.125223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01362naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010100160300002000261520030100281592002800582650001500610650001900625650002700644650002300671650002600694650001100720650002200731650001300753700001900766700002000785773013600805856007400941852000901015655001201024IND60659675620221120213532.0190823e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065967562DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc35739a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotani, Ryosuke10aGate adsorption of CO₂ on a flexible one-dimensional copper-based coordination polymer crystal  ap. 11316-11318.  aA flexible one-dimensional copper-based coordination polymer (CP) crystal was synthesized and the crystal structure was solved.

The typical habitat (Old Zumbro River Wetlands) is a large area of riparian forest with open shallow wetlands containing emergent vegetation, whereas the highly disturbed area (Weaver Bottoms) is a large shallow wetland that was previously vegetated but at the time of this study was mostly open water. Between 15 April 1999 and 1 April 2000, we used radiotelemetry to determine the distance and rate of movements of 35 adult turtles (23 females, 12 males). We used ArcView GIS to examine movements, activity areas, and home ranges of 16 females and 8 males with the most complete records. During the activity season, males made more and shorter-distance movements and had more activity areas (mean = 3.13, standard error = 0.40) than did females (mean = 1.75, standard error = 0.19), although females made longer overland movements typically associated with nesting. Mean home range estimates, calculated using the minimum convex polygon, bivariate normal density kernel, and poly-buff methods, averaged 91.59 ha (standard error = 29.95) for males and 46.0 ha (standard error = 7.40) for females. Poly-buff home ranges of adults in Old Zumbro River Wetlands were significantly smaller than in Weaver Bottoms. Average home ranges of adults at Old Zumbro River Wetlands were typical of Blanding's turtles and home ranges reported at other locations across their range, whereas the average home ranges of adults at Weaver Bottoms were approximately 7 times larger than that found in Old Zumbro River Wetlands and larger than reported for any other population of Blanding's turtles. The large home ranges at Weaver Bottoms were associated with expanses of open water and fragmented vegetated areas, which suggests that the maintenance of or even an increase in emergent vegetation in the Weaver Bottoms is important for the long-term stability of the Blanding's turtle population at the Weaver Dunes area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmydoidea blandingii 3aadults 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3aradio telemetry 3ariparian forests 3arivers 3awetlands 3aMinnesota 0aChelonian 0aEmydidae 0adisturbed habitat 0amovement 0aradiotelemetry1 aCongdon, Justin D.1 aMcConville, David R.1 aLang, Jeffrey W.0 tChelonian conservation and biology.g2020 June 30, v. 19, no. 1 p.58-66dChelonian Research Foundation and Turtle ConservancywJournal:19714x1943-39567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2744/CCB-1396.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245012300186300001800309520131600327592002801643650001601671650001201687650001001699650002601709650001201735650001001747650001901757650004401776650001201820650001101832650003501843650001101878650000901889650002301898650004001921650003901961650001402000650002902014650004002043650002402083700001902107700002202126700001902148773011202167856004802279852000902327655001202336IND50070009620221118222110.0131020e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007000962DNAL7 a237493292pmid7 a10.1007/s00359-013-0832-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanzaki, Ryohei10aInsect–machine hybrid system for understanding and evaluating sensory-motor control by sex pheromone in Bombyx mori   ap. 1037-1052.  aTo elucidate the dynamic information processing in a brain underlying adaptive behavior, it is necessary to understand the behavior and corresponding neural activities. This requires animals which have clear relationships between behavior and corresponding neural activities. Insects are precisely such animals and one of the adaptive behaviors of insects is high-accuracy odor source orientation. The most direct way to know the relationships between neural activity and behavior is by recording neural activities in a brain from freely behaving insects. There is also a method to give stimuli mimicking the natural environment to tethered insects allowing insects to walk or fly at the same position. In addition to these methods an ‘insect–machine hybrid system’ is proposed, which is another experimental system meeting the conditions necessary for approaching the dynamic processing in the brain of insects for generating adaptive behavior. This insect–machine hybrid system is an experimental system which has a mobile robot as its body. The robot is controlled by the insect through its behavior or the neural activities recorded from the brain. As we can arbitrarily control the motor output of the robot, we can intervene at the relationship between the insect and the environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aanimals 3abrain 3aenvironmental factors 3ainsects 3aodors 3asex pheromones 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxdrug effects 2aAnimals 2aBombyx 2aBrainxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aModels, Biological 2aMovementxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aNeuronsxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOdorants. 2aPheromonesxpharmacology 2aRoboticsxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aSystems Integration1 aMinegishi, Ryo1 aNamiki, Shigehiro1 aAndo, Noriyasu0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2013 Nov., v. 199, no. 11 p.1037-1052dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-013-0832-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245010300174300001800277520095500295592002801250650002901278650001701307650001001324650002101334650002201355650001301377650001001390650001101400650001501411650001901426650002201445650001301467650001301480651000901493700002201502700002301524773012501547856008301672852000901755655001201764IND60757079220221122162424.0220221e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075707922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-021-06746-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhorasanian, Reihaneh10aGenetic study of a patient with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome in Iran: a case report  ap. 8239-8243.  aBACKGROUND: Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by Autonomic nervous system dysregulation caused by mutations in the PHOX2B gene. Here we introduce the first genetic analysis of a one-month-old CCHS baby girl in Iran. METHODS AND RESULTS: Genetic analysis of the PHOX2B gene was performed by Sanger sequencing and interpreted using the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guideline. The results showed a heterozygous duplication in exon 3, causing a polyalanine repeat expansion mutation to 27 repeats in thePHOX2B gene (20/27 genotype).The patient’s parents did not demonstrate this mutation on genetic studies. CONCLUSIONS: According to the ACMG guideline, the mutation is pathogenic, and it was a denovo mutation in the family. The genetic study can help the family for prenatal diagnosis or pre-implantation diagnosis if the parents have gonadal mosaicism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautonomic nervous system 3acase studies 3aexons 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic disorders 3agenomics 3agirls 3agonads 3aguidelines 3aheterozygosity 3amolecular biology 3amutation 3apatients 3aIran1 aMojbafan, Marzieh1 aKhosravi, Nastaran0 tMolecular biology reports.g2021 Dec., v. 48, no. 12 p.8239-8243dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl5510x0301-48517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-021-06746-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03271naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245016400169500001400333520163300347592002801980650002102008650004402029650002602073650002002099650000902119650001102128650001502139650001502154650001402169650002102183650002902204650003002233650001902263650001602282650001502298650002802313650001102341653001802352653002602370653002802396700001702424700001502441700001702456700001802473700001802491700001602509700001402525773009102539856009002630852000902720655001202729IND60718483720221122180948.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071848372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Juan10aDifferential regulation and the underlying mechanisms of clay minerals to Escherichia coli under the stress of polymyxin B: Comparing halloysite with kaolinite  aNAL-light  aThe reuse of polymyxin B (PMB) has attracted extensive attention. Although the resistance mechanism to PMB is clear, there are few reports on the regulation mechanisms and effects of clay minerals on bacteria induced by PMB. The focus of this study is to investigate the multidrug resistance, cell morphology and physiological modification of Escherichia coli (E. coli) exposed to PMB in the presence and absence of clay minerals. To be specific, E. coli was cultured serially for 15 days in the increasing concentration of PMB, with or without halloysite or kaolinite. The potential influence mechanisms of halloysite and kaolinite on E. coli was analyzed by proteomics, antibiotic resistance testing, confocal laser scanning microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared. The results showed that kaolinite could obviously promote the growth of bacteria. Moreover, compared with halloysite, kaolinite could stimulate the overexpression of PMB resistance-related proteins ArnA, ArnB and EptA in E. coli exposed to PMB, and promote the synthesis of peptidoglycan and activate glycolysis pathway to produce energy. In contrast, halloysite was able to regulate the production of low molecular weight thiols by E. coli to prevent bacteria from producing excessive reactive oxygen species, activate the oxidative phosphorylation pathway to supply energy for bacterial life activities, and reduce multidrug resistance of E. coli in a variety of ways. These findings are essential for exploring the impacts of clay minerals on the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant strains in the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantibiotic resistance 3acell structures 3aclay 3aenergy 3aglycolysis 3ahalloysite 3akaolinite 3amolecular weight 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3apeptidoglycans 3apolymyxin B 3aproteomics 3areactive oxygen species 3athiols 0aClay minerals 0aMulti-drug resistance 0aDifferential regulation1 aWu, Pingxiao1 aWang, Fang1 aNiu, Wenchao1 aAhmed, Zubair1 aChen, Meiqing1 aLu, Guining1 aDang, Zhi0 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 265 p.129095-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04085naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013800170520201700308592002802325650001602353650001302369650002102382650001202403650002602415650001102441650001202452650002002464650002202484650001302506650000902519650001502528650001402543650003102557650001702588650001702605650001902622650000902641650001402650650001902664650001402683650001102697650001902708650001702727650001302744650001302757650001102770650002302781650001202804650001602816650001302832650002502845650002102870651001002891653002102901653002502922653001902947653001902966653001602985700001703001700001303018700001603031700001803047700001703065700002103082700002103103773010703124856008703231852000903318655001203327IND60686697720221120120722.0200427e20200415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068669772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1173832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shui-Ping10aChemical nature of PM2.5 and PM10 in the coastal urban Xiamen, China: Insights into the impacts of shipping emissions and health risk  aWith objective of estimating the impact of ship emissions on ambient PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ levels and human health at a coastal urban site in Xiamen Island, a one year long sampling campaign was carried out from January 2017 to January 2018. Samples were subject to chemical analysis for various chemical components including water-soluble inorganic ions, carbonaceous species, and elements. The annual average PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀ mass concentrations were, respectively, 32.8 ± 18.9 μg m⁻³ and 54.5 ± 29.6 μg m⁻³. The highest seasonal average concentrations were found in winter-spring and the lowest in summer due to the seasonal monsoon and gas-particle conversion. The rapid accumulation of vehicle exhaust and the stable existence of NH₄NO₃ in the ground layer within the urban area contributed to the incremental PM. Sulfate, nitrate, ammonium and organic carbon in PM₂.₅ have decreased since 2011–2013, while elemental carbon increased significantly. This suggests that the motor vehicle and/or ship emissions contributions to PM₂.₅ have increased relative to coal combustion over the past five years. The temporal variations of PM and its associated components during the BRICS summit control period further confirmed the important role of traffic related emissions in PM mass. Primary particulates resolved by PMF analysis plus secondary sulfate derived from secondary sulfate formation were estimated to account for 7.56% and 8.31% of PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀, respectively. Selected heavy metals (As, Cd, Ni, V, Mn, hexavalent Cr, Ba and Pb) originating from ship emissions contributed 64.4% for PM₂.₅ and 53.2% for PM₁₀ of the total non-cancer risk. Carcinogenic risk (lifetime cancer risk) for ship emissions associated with these hazard metals accounted for 50.6% for PM₂.₅ and 44.5% for PM₁₀. Therefore, control measures applied to the ship emissions can benefit the local air quality improvement and reduce health burden to people around the port.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrate 3aarsenic 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abarium 3acadmium 3acarcinogenicity 3achemical analysis 3achromium 3acoal 3acombustion 3aemissions 3ahealth effects assessments 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ainorganic ions 3alead 3amanganese 3amonsoon season 3aneoplasms 3anickel 3aorganic carbon 3aparticulates 3ashipping 3asulfates 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3avanadium 3avehicles (equipment) 3awater solubility 3aChina 0aChemical species 0aSource apportionment 0aTrace elements 0aShip emissions 0aHealth risk1 aCai, Mei-Jun1 aXu, Chao1 aZhang, Ning1 aZhou, Jia-Bin1 aYan, Jin-Pei1 aSchwab, James J.1 aYuan, Chung-Shin0 tAtmospheric environment.g2020 Apr. 15, v. 227 p.117383-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2020.1173833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01548naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245013100162300002000293520035300313592002800666650001900694650002700713650002300740650001300763650001900776650001900795650001800814650001100832650001600843700002900859700002100888700002000909700002600929773013600955856007401091852000901165655001201174IND60659675920221120200930.0190823e20121029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065967592DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc35750j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbellán, Gonzalo10aGraphene as a carbon source effects the nanometallurgy of nickel in Ni,Mn layered double hydroxide–graphene oxide composites  ap. 11416-11418.  aThermal treatment of the hybrid material formed by the spontaneous precipitation of graphene oxide and Ni,Mn layered double hydroxide leads to the segregation of nickel metal nanoparticles (Ni NPs) and the decomposition of graphene to CO₂.

In the olfactory system of the moth Manduca sexta, the response properties of different types of antennal olfactory receptor cells are known. Likewise, a subset of antennal lobe glomeruli has been functionally characterized and the olfactory tuning of their innervating neurons identified. This provides a unique opportunity to determine functional interactions between glomeruli of known input, specifically, (1) glomeruli processing plant odors and (2) glomeruli activated by antennal stimulation with pheromone components of conspecific females. Several studies describe reciprocal inhibitory effects between different types of pheromone-responsive projection neurons suggesting lateral inhibitory interactions between pheromone component-selective glomerular neural circuits. Furthermore, antennal lobe projection neurons that respond to host plant volatiles and innervate single, ordinary glomeruli are inhibited during antennal stimulation with the female’s sex pheromone. The studies demonstrate the existence of lateral inhibitory effects in response to behaviorally significant odorant stimuli and irrespective of glomerular location in the antennal lobe. Inhibitory interactions are present within and between olfactory subsystems (pheromonal and non-pheromonal subsystems), potentially to enhance contrast and strengthen odorant discrimination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aManduca sexta 3aantennal lobe 3afemales 3ahost plants 3amoths 3aneurons 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3asex pheromones 2aAnimals 2aArthropod Antennaexanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aInsecta. 2aNerve Netxphysiology 2aOlfactory Pathwaysxphysiology 2aOlfactory Receptor Neuronsxphysiology 2aSignal Transduction 2aSmellxphysiology1 aShields, Vonnie D.

This tutorial review begins by providing a brief introduction to nanostructured materials, followed by an overview of the wealth of nanoscale fabrication and analysis tools available for their development. This background serves as the basis for a discussion of early breakthroughs and recent key developments in the endeavour to develop nanostructured materials as smart interfaces for fundamental cellular studies, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The review covers three major aspects of nanostructured interfaces – nanotopographical control, dynamic behaviour and intracellular manipulation and sensing – where efforts are continuously being made to further understand cell function and provide new ways to control cell behaviour. A critical reflection of the current status and future challenges are discussed as a conclusion to the review.  aPublisher supplied data 3amedicine 3ananomaterials 3asmart materials 3atissue engineering0 tChemical Society reviews.g2013 Nov. 18, v. 42, no. 24 p.9207-9218dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cs60198f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03320naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245011800176520169300294592002801987650001902015650001202034650002202046650003302068650001002101650000802111650001902119650001602138651001602154651001002170651001102180651001002191651002002201651002602221653001502247653001202262653002402274653001502298653001502313700002002328700002402348700002602372700002202398700001702420700002202437700003302459700001802492700002102510700002002531773011802551856008802669852000902757655001202766IND60762937220221122050128.0220509e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076293722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1039222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarchetti, Lorenzo14aThe Artinskian Warming Event: an Euramerican change in climate and the terrestrial biota during the early Permian  aOne of the most significant climate changes in the history of Earth happened during the late Palaeozoic, with the melting of the Gondwanan ice sheets and a progressive warming that profoundly changed the composition of the global terrestrial biota. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies on mid-late Cisuralian central Pangaea (present-day Europe and North Africa). We have comprehensively revised the well-constrained tetrapod ichnofauna, macroflora, and microflora from the late Cisuralian of the Southern Alps and compared it to other Cisuralian assemblages from Europe and North Africa. The results show a dramatic increase in both diversity and relative abundance of drought-tolerant forms during the Artinskian, at about 287 Ma. This biotic replacement is sudden, conspicuous, widespread and time-equivalent to the biotic replacement observed at the low palaeolatitudes of western Pangaea (present-day western USA) and to a major increase of pCO₂ and Na₂O values in Euramerican successions. This is possibly related to the eruption of the Tarim Large Igneous Province of NW China and Panjal Traps of NW India that may have caused the final melting of the Gondwanan ice sheets. Consequently, this substantial faunal and floral change is probably driven by a global climatic event (Artinskian Warming Event, AWE) that increased temperature and aridity at the low palaeolatitudes of Pangaea, enhancing the apparent abundance and diversity of drought-tolerant taxa. Further studies are needed to better constrain the timing of this event and verify its full extent, in both the continental and marine realms, as well as to investigate its relationship with contemporary eruptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtinskian age 3aclimate 3adrought tolerance 3adry environmental conditions 3afauna 3aice 3amicroorganisms 3atemperature 3aAlps region 3aChina 3aEurope 3aIndia 3aNorthern Africa 3aWestern United States 0aCisuralian 0aPangaea 0aTetrapod ichnofauna 0aMacroflora 0aMicroflora1 aForte, Giuseppa1 aKustatscher, Evelyn1 aDiMichele, William A.1 aLucas, Spencer G.1 aRoghi, Guido1 aJuncal, Manuel A.1 aHartkopf-Fröder, Christoph,1 aKrainer, Karl1 aMorelli, Corrado1 aRonchi, Ausonio0 tEarth-science reviews.g2022 Mar., v. 226 p.103922-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:11685x0012-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2022.1039223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245020900172300001400381520127600395592002801671650001601699650001601715650001201731650001701743650001301760650003401773650001301807650001801820650002501838650002601863650000901889650002501898650001201923650001401935651001101949653001801960653002501978653001702003653004002020653002602060700002202086700002002108700002102128773010902149856008502258961001202343852000902355655001202364IND50064238620221122113201.0190411e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006423862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2013.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer, A.

The behaviors of such groups are shaped by their diverse motivations and circumstances. Segmenting heterogeneous target groups into more homogeneous subgroups may improve the chances of successfully identifying policy strategies to influence their behavior. Findings from a multimethod study of nonindustrial private forest owners in eastern Oregon suggest four unique subgroups of owners with different fuel management motivations and suitabilities for policy tools: commodity managers could benefit from market-based incentives; amenity managers could benefit from capacity building programs paired with symbolic campaigns; recreational managers could benefit from public incentives provided through consultants or contractors who can help plan the work; and passive managers may benefit from opportunities to respond to the policy strategies designed for the other groupings until more information can be gathered. Incorporating qualitative analysis of interview data with statistical analysis of survey data improved understanding of the groupings and appropriate policy strategies for them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsultants 3acontractors 3aforests 3afuel loading 3amanagers 3anonindustrial private forests 3aplanning 3apublic policy 3aqualitative analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3awildfires 3aOregon 0aPolicy design 0aPolicy target groups 0aSegmentation 0aNonindustrial private forest owners 0aFuel reduction policy1 aKline, Jeffrey D.1 aCharnley, Susan1 aOlsen, Christine0 tForest policy and economics.g2013 Mar., v. 28 p.69-78dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2013.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01588naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245019300159300002000352520035800372592002800730650002000758650002700778650002300805650003400828650001600862650003100878700001800909700001700927700001900944700001600963700001500979700001400994773013501008856007401143852000901217655001201226IND60659676120221120222739.0190823e20121003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065967612DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc35754b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Shaohang10aD–π–A–π–D type benzothiadiazole–triphenylamine based small molecules containing cyano on the π-bridge for solution-processed organic solar cells with high open-circuit voltage  ap. 10627-10629.  aTwo novel D–π–A–π–D structured small molecules composed of benzothiadiazole and triphenylamine were designed and synthesized.

Hyaluronic acid, an extracellular matrix component promotes the growth and proliferation of most cells. The high water affinity of hyaluronic acid (HA) adversely affects its application in the field of tissue engineering. A copolymer of hyaluronic acid and poly(2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate), [poly(HEMA)] appeared as a good choice for the synthesis of a natural-synthetic polymer hybrid matrix with the synergistic properties of both the polymers like water stability and biocompatibility. The copolymer films were stable in water at both acidic and neutral pH in contrast to that of virgin HA films. Grafting significantly alters the mechanical properties of hyaluronic acid. The HA-g-poly(HEMA) is found to be non-cytotoxic to mammalian cells. Further, the polymer was analysed for supporting alveolar cell adhesion and growth and were found suitable for supporting multiple cell types with specific culture requirements. Thus, grafting with poly(HEMA) is a suitable method for the fabrication of stable, cytocompatible natural-synthetic polymer hybrid matrices for varied biomedical applications such as tissue engineering, wound dressings, drug delivery and so forth.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatibility 3acell adhesion 3acomposite polymers 3adrugs 3aextracellular matrix 3ahyaluronic acid 3alungs 3amammals 3amechanical properties 3apH 3atissue engineering1 aNandkumar, A.

We used ¹⁴C-labelled anionic (4-n-dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt, ‘¹⁴C-DS⁻’), cationic (4-n-dodecylbenzyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, ‘¹⁴C-DA⁺‘) and non-ionic (4-n-dodecylphenol, ‘¹⁴C-DP’) organic chemicals. The sediment was subjected to particle size fractionation. For each particle fraction and test compound, water-sediment systems were prepared and incubated for 14 days. Across all particle fractions, higher amounts of applied radioactivity (AR) of ¹⁴C-DS⁻ (in sand 60.1%, in silt 45.1%, in clay 57.0%) and of ¹⁴C-DP (sand: 31.8%, silt: 24.4%, clay: 29.2%) were mineralised compared to ¹⁴C-DA⁺ (sand: 5.1% AR, silt: 3.5% AR, clay: 2.4% AR). The highest bioavailability was observed for ¹⁴C-DS⁻ followed by ¹⁴C-DP and ¹⁴C-DA⁺ across all particle fractions. Formation of non-extractable residues (NER) of ¹⁴C-DS⁻ did not substantially differ between the particle fractions, whereas NER formation of ¹⁴C-DA⁺ was higher in the clay fraction (24.3% AR) than in silt (15.9% AR) and sand (8.4% AR). The same trend was observed for ¹⁴C-DP. We showed that differently sized particle fractions have an influence on the fate of ionic chemicals in water-sediment systems and conclude that this should be considered when simulation studies in soils and sediments with different textural compositions are performed. Since a positive charge of organic chemicals tends to form higher portions of NER in the clay fraction of sediments, these NER should be further investigated in terms of their nature and types of binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium chloride 3abioavailability 3aclay 3aclay fraction 3afractionation 3aguidelines 3aparticle size 3aradioactivity 3asand 3asilt 3asodium 0aOECD 308 0aWater-sediment system 0aIonic chemicals 0aMinerali 0as 0aation 0aNon-extractable residues1 aSimeoni, Andrea1 aSchäffer, Andreas,0 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 265 p.129105-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1291053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007900160300001600239520154200255592002801797650004401825650000801869650002401877650002501901650001901926650002001945650001301965650001501978650002201993650002202015650001102037650001602048650001802064650001402082650001102096650001002107650001502117650002102132700001902153700002102172700002302193773013702216856007302353852000902426655001202435IND60534697920221118032427.0160803e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053469792DNAL7 a10.1021/es303561n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchiorlin, Milko10aOxidation Mechanisms of CF2Br2 and CH2Br2 Induced by Air Nonthermal Plasma  ap. 542-548.  aOxidation mechanisms in air nonthermal plasma (NTP) at room temperature and atmospheric pressure were investigated in a corona reactor energized by +dc, −dc, or +pulsed high voltage.. The two bromomethanes CF₂Br₂ and CH₂Br₂ were chosen as model organic pollutants because of their very different reactivities with OH radicals. Thus, they served as useful mechanistic probes: they respond differently to the presence of humidity in the air and give different products. By FT-IR analysis of the postdischarge gas the following products were detected and quantified: CO₂ and CO in the case of CH₂Br₂, CO₂ and F₂C═O in the case of CF₂Br₂. F₂C═O is a long-lived oxidation intermediate due to its low reactivity with atmospheric radicals. It is however removed from the NTP processed gas by passage through a water scrubber resulting in hydrolysis to CO₂ and HF. Other noncarbon containing products of the discharge were also monitored by FT-IR analysis, including HNO₃ and N₂O. Ozone, an important product of air NTP, was never detected in experiments with CF₂Br₂ and CH₂Br₂ because of the highly efficient ozone depleting cycles catalyzed by BrOx species formed from the bromomethanes. It is concluded that, regardless of the type of corona applied, CF₂Br₂ reacts in air NTP via a common intermediate, the CF₂Br radical. The possible reactions leading to this radical are discussed, including, for −dc activation, charge exchange with O₂–, a species detected by APCI mass spectrometry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aair 3aambient temperature 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3ahumidity 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3anitric acid 3anitrous oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aozone 3apollutants 3asuperoxide anion1 aMarotta, Ester1 aDal Molin, Marta1 aParadisi, Cristina0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 Jan. 02, v. 47, no. 1 p.542-548dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es303561n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245012500176300001400301520136300315592002801678650002601706650002501732650001501757650001701772650002801789650001001817650001001827650001301837650003001850650001701880650001901897650001401916650001901930650002801949650001501977650001801992650001402010650003002024650000902054650001702063653005402080653000902134653002802143653001702171653002602188700001402214700001702228700001802245700001802263773015302281856008302434852000902517655001202526IND60541479620221121220628.0190318e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054147962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2014.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndargie, Mebeaselassie10aDevelopment of a GFP-expressing Ustilaginoidea virens strain to study fungal invasion and colonization in rice spikelets  ap. 16-24.  aThe fungal pathogen Ustilaginoidea virens is now widespread in most rice producing areas of the world and attacks the seed spikes of rice, causing sterility, reduced seed weight and accumulation of mycotoxins. The lack of appropriate data relating to the mechanisms of infection leaves a gap within the pathosystem, forcing the search for new methodologies for monitoring the disease. Here, we developed an efficient A. tumefaciens mediated transformation system for rice false smut disease. In addition, infection patterns were explored in rice using the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) transformed U. virens. ATMT uses both the Hygromycin B resistance (hph) gene and green fluorescent protein as the selection agents. The T-DNA integration into the fungal genome was assessed by PCR. Expression of the gfp gene did not affect the pathogenicity of the U. virens transformants. U. virens pathogenicity was examined on the floral structures using a fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence microscopy allowed in vivo imaging of this pathogen during infection of rice spikelets. These studies will allow us to develop strategies to determine the mechanisms of U. virens–rice interaction in greater detail and to apply functional genomics for the characterization of involved genes at the molecular level either by insertional mutagenesis or gene knock-out.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUstilaginoidea virens 3adisease surveillance 3afalse smut 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3afungi 3agenes 3agenomics 3agreen fluorescent protein 3ahygromycin B 3aimage analysis 3ainfection 3ainflorescences 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3amycotoxins 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arice 3atransfer DNA 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation 0aEGFP 0aInsertional mutagenesis 0aOryza sativa 0aUstilaginoidea virens1 aLi, Luoye1 aFeng, Aiqing1 aZhu, Xiaoyuan1 aLi, Jianxiong0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Mar., v. 97 p.16-24dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2014.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03498naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245006000162300001800222500002000240520177500260592002802035650001202063650001902075650001502094650001202109650002402121650001502145650001602160651001902176700002202195700002302217700002402240700002402264700002302288700002002311700002102331700002802352700002002380700002302400700002402423700001902447700002202466700002302488700002302511700003102534700002502565700002602590700001902616700001702635700003202652700001902684700001802703773009302721856007302814852000902887655001202896IND60585104020221118011403.0171102e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058510402DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.042032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuggitt, Andrew J.10aConducting robust ecological analyses with climate data  ap. 1533-1541.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough the number of studies discerning the impact of climate change on ecological systems continues to increase, there has been relatively little sharing of the lessons learnt when accumulating this evidence. At a recent workshop entitled ‘Using climate data in ecological research’ held at the UK Met Office, ecologists and climate scientists came together to discuss the robust analysis of climate data in ecology. The discussions identified three common pitfalls encountered by ecologists: 1) selection of inappropriate spatial resolutions for analysis; 2) improper use of publically available data or code; and 3) insufficient representation of the uncertainties behind the adopted approach. Here, we discuss how these pitfalls can be avoided, before suggesting ways that both ecology and climate science can move forward. Our main recommendation is that ecologists and climate scientists collaborate more closely, on grant proposals and scientific publications, and informally through online media and workshops. More sharing of data and code (e.g. via online repositories), lessons and guidance would help to reconcile differing approaches to the robust handling of data. We call on ecologists to think critically about which aspects of the climate are relevant to their study system, and to acknowledge and actively explore uncertainty in all types of climate data. And we call on climate scientists to make simple estimates of uncertainty available to the wider research community. Through steps such as these, we will improve our ability to robustly attribute observed ecological changes to climate or other factors, while providing the sort of influential, comprehensive analyses that efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change so urgently require.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecologists 3aecology 3ameteorological data 3ascientists 3auncertainty 3aUnited Kingdom1 aPlatts, Philip J.1 aBarata, Izabela M.1 aBennie, Jonathan J.1 aBurgess, Malcolm D.1 aBystriakova, Nadia1 aDuffield, Simon1 aEwing, Steven R.1 aGillingham, Phillipa K.1 aHarper, Anna B.1 aHartley, Andrew J.1 aHemming, Deborah L.1 aMaclean, Ilya,1 aMaltby, Katherine1 aMarshall, Harry H.1 aMorecroft, Mike D.1 aPearce‐Higgins, James W.1 aPearce‐Kelly, Paul1 aPhillimore, Albert B.1 aPrice, Jeff T.1 aPyke, Ayesha1 aStewart, J.

Therefore, effective hemostatic wound dressings are essential to save lives. Here we show that, calcium functioned carboxymethylated cotton fabric (MCF-Ca) conveniently prepared by carboxymethylation of cotton fabrics followed by treatment with calcium chloride solution could serve as an effective hemostatic wound dressing. The calcium content of MCF-Ca was determined as 18.11 ± 0.44 mg/g, and the calcium ions were released into a saline solution, a process that reached near-equilibrium within about 2 min. The biocompatible MCF-Ca promoted hemostasis via forming complexes with blood cells, and it showed lower blood clotting index as well as shorter blood clotting time comparing with unmodified CF in vitro. In addition, MCF-Ca exhibited better hemostatic efficiency than CF in vivo, resulting in much shorter hemostasis time and less blood loss in rat liver injury model and femoral artery animal model. In conclusion, MCF-Ca shows good potential to be used as wound dressing for patients with uncontrolled or massive hemorrhage.  aPublisher supplied data  a2232020G-04cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2018YFC1801502cNational Key R & D Program of China  aCUSF-DH-D-2020066cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Graduate Student Innovation Fund of Donghua University  a81900604cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aanimal models 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acellulose 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3adeath 3ahemorrhage 3ahemostasis 3ahumans 3aliver 3arats 3asodium chloride1 aZhou, Peiwen1 aXiao, Dongdong1 aLiu, Yujun1 aZhong, Yi1 aWang, Bijia1 aZhang, Linping1 aChen, Zhize1 aSui, Xiaofeng1 aFeng, Xueling1 aXu, Hong1 aMao, Zhiping0 tCellulose.g2020 Nov., v. 27, no. 17 p.10139-10149dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-03479-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245005800169300001800227520125400245592002801499650001301527650001001540650001201550650001001562650001001572650001901582650002101601650001201622653001501634653001401649653000901663653000801672700005701680700002101737700002501758773012301783856008201906852000901988655001201997IND60532989020221120125937.0160728e20140418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053298902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.03.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernandez, Paula10aNew insights into the location and form of sclerostin  ap. 1108-1113.  aSclerostin is widely reported to be a monomeric osteocyte specific protein. In this study we have investigated whether sclerostin is produced in different forms and in which cell and tissue types they are produced.We have demonstrated that recombinant sclerostin is composed of monomers and dimers, and that these, and other forms, notably 46 and 70kDa forms, are found widely throughout the musculo-skeletal system. We have shown that ‘dimeric’ sclerostin is highly resistant to reduction, implying the presence of highly stable, non-reducible covalent bonds. We have also demonstrated that the form of sclerostin is not associated with the mineralisation state of the tissue or cell. Sclerostin was secreted by bone explants as high molecular weight forms that were reducible to the dimeric form. This dimeric form was detected in sera and in non-skeletal soft tissues specifically kidney, live, heart and lung.We therefore hypothesise: (a) sclerostin exists in multiple forms not associated with the mineralised state of the cell/tissue and (b) circulating sclerostin is dimeric, as is the sclerostin found in non-musculoskeletal soft tissues. These observations may have significant implications for the therapeutic modulation of sclerostin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexplants 3aheart 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amineralization 3amolecular weight 3atissues 0aSclerostin 0aCartilage 0aBone 0aWnt1 aWhitty, Ciara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3697-13301 aJohn Wardale, R.1 aHenson, Frances M.D.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2014 Apr. 18, v. 446 p.1108-1113dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.03.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01670naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245011500158300001600273520032900289592002800618650002200646650001400668650001300682650002000695650001800715650002500733650001400758650002500772700001700797700002000814700002300834700002000857700001800877700002400895700001500919700002200934700001900956700002100975700002100996773011601017852000901133856008201142655001201224IND4378868720221119162115.0190314e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437886872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-004-0645-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jie14aThe effect of strain, growth stage, and cultivating condition of Ganoderma lucidum on 5α-reductase inhibition  ap. 189-192.  aThe inhibitory effects of 102 methanol extracts of 40 mycelia, 9 culture fluids, and 53 fruiting bodies of 40 strains of Ganoderma lucidum on 5α-reductase were investigated.

Challenging policy goals have been set to protect resources, species, communities and habitats, yet ecologists often have sparse data on interactions occurring in the system to assess policy outcomes. This paper presents a technique, loosely based on Bayesian Belief Networks, to create simple models which 1) predict whether individual species within a community will decline or increase in population size, 2) encapsulate uncertainty in the predictions in an intuitive manner and 3) require limited knowledge of the ecosystem and functional parameters required to model it. We develop our model for a UK rocky shore community, to utilise existing knowledge of species interactions for model validation purposes. However, we also test the role of expert opinion, without full scientific knowledge of species interactions, by asking non-UK based marine scientists to derive parameters for the model (non-UK scientists are not familiar with the exact communities being described and will need to extrapolate from existing knowledge in a similar manner to model a poorly studied system). We find these differ little from the parameters derived by ourselves and make little difference to the final model predictions. We also test our model against simple experimental manipulations, and find that the most important changes in community structure as a result of manipulations correspond well to the model predictions with both our, and non-UK expert parameterisation. The simplicity of the model, nature of the outputs, and the user-friendly interface makes it potentially suitable for policy, conservation and management work on multispecies interactions in a wide range of marine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aecologists 3aexpert opinion 3ahabitats 3aissues and policy 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3ascientists 3auncertainty 3aUnited Kingdom 0aRocky shore 0aPredictive model 0aSparse data 0aMarine management 0aFisheries 0aBayesian belief network 0aConservation1 aWilliams, Rachel L.1 aHerbert, Roger J.H.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2015 Dec., v. 118 p.88-96dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2015.04.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245014300161300001600304520122300320592002801543650001801571650001401589650001601603650001901619650002001638650002001658650002101678650001101699650002501710650000901735650001901744650001301763650001701776653001001793653004001803653001801843653001801861700001501879700001701894700001801911700001201929700001901941700005401960773014602014856008302160852000902243655001202252IND60533149320221119202020.0181120e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053314932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.1152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Mi10aTargeting of the deubiquitinase USP9X attenuates B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell survival and overcomes glucocorticoid resistance  ap. 333-339.  aAlthough previous studies attributed a pro-survival role to USP9X in human cancer, how USP9X affects B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains unclear. Here, we found that USP9X is overexpressed in B-ALL cell lines and human patients. We investigated the role of USP9X in B-ALL and found that USP9X knockdown significantly reduced leukemic cell growth and increased spontaneous apoptosis, thereby improving survival in immunodeficient mice. These effects are partially mediated by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, as we found that USP9X-knockdown leukemic cells displayed MCL1 down-regulation, with decreased BCL-2/BCL-XL levels and increased BAX levels. In addition, we demonstrated that USP9X inhibition negatively regulates mTORC1 activity toward its substrate S6K1. Clinically, USP9X inhibition sensitized glucocorticoid-resistant ALL cells to prednisolone; this observation reveals a potential avenue for improving the treatment of drug-resistant relapses. Collectively, our findings suggest that the combination of USP9X targeting and glucocorticoids treatment has attractive utility in B-ALL. This approach represents a potential strategy for promising combination therapies for lymphoid malignancies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aapoptosis 3acell growth 3acell viability 3adrug resistance 3aglucocorticoids 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3alymphocytic leukemia 3amice 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aprednisolone 0aUSP9X 0aB-Cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 0aCell survival 0aGC-Resistance1 aWang, Ting1 aLai, Huiling1 aZhao, Xuejiao1 aYu, Qin1 aZhou, Jianfeng1 aYang, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2785-64290 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Apr. 03, v. 459, no. 2 p.333-339dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.1153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245006300158300001400221500002000235520116100255592002801416650001201444650002301456650002101479650001201500650001001512650001701522651001401539700002301553700002201576700002401598773009401622856007301716852000901789655001201798IND60523594920221116170707.0160623e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052359492DNAL7 a10.1890/10-0794.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorado, Jimena10aRareness and specialization in plant–pollinator networks  ap. 19-25.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost rare species appear to be specialists in plant–pollinator networks. This observation could result either from real ecological processes or from sampling artifacts. Several methods have been proposed to overcome these artifacts, but they have the limitation of being based on visitation data, causing interactions involving rare visitor species to remain undersampled. We propose the analysis of food composition in bee trap nests to assess the reliability of network specialization estimates. We compared data from a plant–pollinator network in the Monte Desert of Villavicencio Nature Reserve, Argentina, sampled by visit observation, and data from trap nests sampled at the same time and location. Our study shows that trap nest sampling was good for estimating rare species degree. The rare species in the networks appear to be more specialized than they really are, and the bias in the estimation of the species degree increases with the rareness. The low species degree of these rare species in the visitation networks results from insufficient sampling of the rare interactions, which could have important consequences for network structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApoidea 3aconservation areas 3afood composition 3anesting 3anests 3arare species 3aArgentina1 aVázquez, Diego P.1 aStevani, Erica L.1 aChacoff, Natacha P.0 tEcology.g2011 Jan., v. 92, no. 1 p.19-25dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-0794.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009100155520165300246592002801899650001601927650001001943650001201953650001801965650001901983650001502002650002302017650001102040650003002051650001902081650001102100651001902111651001902130700001402149700001502163700001802178700001402196773012902210856007502339852000902414655001202423IND60756182520221121225630.0211111e20211101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075618252DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132144022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhi 10aSouthwestern Atlantic Ocean Fronts Detected from Satellite-Derived SST and Chlorophyll  aThe Southern Ocean front (SOF) is an important factor that affects the heat exchange and material transport of the Southern Ocean. In the past two decades, with the advancements in satellite remote-sensing technology, the study of the spatio-temporal variability of the Southern Ocean front has become a new hot topic. Nevertheless, the southwestern Atlantic, as an important part of the Southern Ocean, is poorly studied in this regard. Based on the 16-year (2004–2019) high-resolution satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST) and 13-year (2007–2019) observations of chlorophyll (CHL), this study detected and analyzed the position and seasonal variation of the SOF in the southwestern Atlantic using a gradient-based frontal detection method. According to the experimental results, the thermal front (derived from the SST data) disappeared in winter due to the spatially uniform surface cooling, whereas the ocean color front (derived from the CHL data) existed without remarkable spatio-temporal changes. Furthermore, the exact position and seasonal variation of the SOF in the southwestern Atlantic are determined by comparing the paths of the two fronts. Since the formation of the Kuroshio front in the East China Sea (ECS) is similar to the SOF in the southwestern Atlantic, the seasonal distributions of the two fronts were compared. Apart from that, the Kuroshio thermal fronts were mostly distributed in winter and less in summer, while the Southern Ocean thermal fronts showed the opposite. These results indicated that the ocean current properties significantly influence the spatio-temporal variability of the front.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3acooling 3aheat transfer 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3awater currents 3awinter 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aEast China Sea1 aChen, Ge 1 aHan, Yong 1 aMa, Chunyong 1 aLv, Ming 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 01, v. 13, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132144023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009700163300001400260520145200274592002801726650001801754650002301772650001701795650000901812650002001821650001401841650001901855650003301874650000901907650002101916650001401937650004701951650003801998650002902036651001102065651001002076653000902086653000802095653000902103653000902112653001002121653001402131653002402145653001802169653001502187700001902202700002002221773015302241856008302394852000902477655001202486IND60541479920221120112538.0190318e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054147992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2014.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwarna, J.10aCharacterization of Talinum triangulare (Jacq.) Willd. germplasm using molecular descriptors  ap. 59-68.  aTalinum triangulare is a medicinal herb known to have originated from tropical Africa and is now widely cultivated in the humid tropical countries. The characterization of plant germplasm using molecular descriptors aids in describing the genotypic traits of the plant T. triangulare. Ten different accessions of T. triangulare were collected from nine districts of Tamil Nadu. High quality genomic DNA was isolated from the different samples, checked for purity and quantified. The DNA samples were subjected to PCR amplification using RAPD markers and by DNA barcoding technique. RAPD fingerprints were generated for the 10 different accessions of T. triangulare for the first time. Ten random decamer primers resulted in 73.08% of polymorphism by producing a total of 78 fragments, of which, 57 bands were determined as polymorphic loci. Phylogenetic relationship and intra-specific variation among the samples were established by constructing a dendrogram based on Jaccard's coefficient. DNA barcoding studies included the amplification of chloroplast large subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL), trnH-psbA intergenic spacer (trnH-psbA), maturase K (matK) and nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS). The amplicons were gel eluted, sequenced and checked for homology by using the BLAST tool. However, no variation was detected among the samples after sequencing, proving that the accessions were identical at the genetic level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aTalinum fruticosum 3achloroplasts 3agels 3agenetic markers 3agermplasm 3aintergenic DNA 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aloci 3amedicinal plants 3aphylogeny 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atranscription (genetics) 3aAfrica 3aIndia 0aDMRT 0aITS 0aRAPD 0aSPSS 0aUPGMA 0aWaterleaf 0aRAPD fingerprinting 0aDNA barcoding 0aDendrogram1 aRavindhran, R.1 aLokeswari, T.S.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Mar., v. 97 p.59-68dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2014.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03633naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007300167300001800240520178100258592002802039650001202067650001702079650002602096650002102122650002402143650002002167650003302187650001602220650002402236653000902260653000802269653000802277653000702285653000902292653000702301653000902308653000802317653000902325653000702334653000802341653003302349653002302382653001002405653001802415700006302433700002202496700005802518700005202576700001702628700006502645700001902710700001502729700002002744700002002764700002302784773009802807856008102905852000902986655001202995IND60551141920221120161015.0161017e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055114192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2014.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurukawa, Yukio10aIntrinsic Disorder Mediates Cooperative Signal Transduction in STIM1  ap. 2082-2097.  aIntrinsically disordered domains have been reported to play important roles in signal transduction networks by introducing cooperativity into protein–protein interactions. Unlike intrinsically disordered domains that become ordered upon binding, the EF-SAM domain in the stromal interaction molecule (STIM) 1 is distinct in that it is ordered in the monomeric state and partially unfolded in its oligomeric state, with the population of the two states depending on the local Ca2+ concentration. The oligomerization of STIM1, which triggers extracellular Ca2+ influx, exhibits cooperativity with respect to the local endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentration. Although the physiological importance of the oligomerization reaction is well established, the mechanism of the observed cooperativity is not known. Here, we examine the response of the STIM1 EF-SAM domain to changes in Ca2+ concentration using mathematical modeling based on in vitro experiments. We find that the EF-SAM domain partially unfolds and dimerizes cooperatively with respect to Ca2+ concentration, with Hill coefficients and half-maximal activation concentrations very close to the values observed in vivo for STIM1 redistribution and extracellular Ca2+ influx. Our mathematical model of the dimerization reaction agrees quantitatively with our analytical ultracentrifugation-based measurements and previously published free energies of unfolding. A simple interpretation of these results is that Ca2+ loss effectively acts as a denaturant, enabling cooperative dimerization and robust signal transduction. We present a structural model of the Ca2+-unbound EF-SAM domain that is consistent with a wide range of evidence, including resistance to proteolytic cleavage of the putative dimerization portion.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adimerization 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ain vitro studies 3amathematical models 3aoligomerization 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteolysis 3asignal transduction 0aSTIM 0aIDD 0aPPI 0aER 0aSOCE 0aPM 0aCRAC 0aAUC 0aHSQC 0aMD 0aDMD 0astore-operated calcium entry 0aintrinsic disorder 0aSTIM1 0acooperativity1 aTeraguchi, Shunsuke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5104-02271 aIkegami, Takahisa1 aDagliyan, Onur1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1825-10111 aJin, Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9156-61891 aHall, Damien1 aDokholyan, Nikolay V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8225-40251 aNamba, Keiichi1 aAkira, S.,1 aKurosaki, Tomo,1 aBaba, Yoshihiro1 aStandley, Daron M.0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2014 May 15, v. 426 p.2082-2097dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001500142245015000157520183700307592002802144650001302172650002302185650001102208650002202219650000902241650001302250650001302263650002002276650001602296650002002312651001002332700001702342773011802359856007702477852000902554655001202563IND60790993720221123013512.0220826e20220809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079099372DNAL7 a10.3390/land110812782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiang 13aAn Analysis on the Determining Factors of Farmers’ Land-Scale Management: Empirical Analysis Based on the Micro-Perspective of Farmers in China  aIn the context of continuous improvement in China’s land system, the development of the rural economy is insufficient, and the growth of farmers’ income lacks sustainable momentum. The development of the internet and agricultural socialization services has had a huge impact on farmers’ land-scale management. In particular, the proliferation of internet technology in rural areas could affect farmers’ use of agricultural socialization services and increase farmers’ willingness to operate their land on a large scale. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the impact of the internet and agricultural socialization services on farmers’ land-scale management decisions. This study constructs a probit model using the cross-sectional data of the nationally representative CFPS2018, and empirically tests the influencing factors of farmers’ land-scale management decisions and the mechanism of heterogeneity. The research results show that, first, the popularity of the internet significantly promoted farmers’ decisions towards land rented-out, but has no significant impact on land rented-in; second, agricultural socialization services are significantly negatively correlated with farmers’ decisions towards land rented-out, but the internet may moderate this inhibitory effect and has an incentive effect on farmers’ land rented-in; third, the results of heterogeneity analysis show that the impact of the internet and agricultural socialization services on farmers’ land-scale management decisions vary with income levels and regions. Therefore, the policy direction should focus on making “internet + agriculture” and agricultural socialization services benefit all farmers, to more effectively improve the efficiency of rural land use and promote the optimal allocation of rural resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aempirical research 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3aland 3aland use 3amomentum 3aprobit analysis 3arural areas 3arural economics 3aChina1 aLee, Hyukku 0 tLand.g2022 Aug. 09, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110812783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03646naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245017100168300001800339520197800357592002802335596001202363650002202375650002502397650002002422650001602442650001602458650001602474650001202490650001802502650001502520650001202535650000902547650001802556650002002574650002302594650002602617650001002643650001602653650001802669650001102687650002102698650001602719653001302735653001102748653001602759653001602775653002402791700001902815700002302834773012802857856008602985852000903071655001203080IND60761340820221123040821.0220709e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076134082DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2021.19387162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhavi, Saeed10aEstimation of digestible sulphur amino acids requirements for growth performance and immune responses to Newcastle disease and avian influenza vaccination in broilers  ap. 1002-1014.  aThis study was conducted to determine the effects of grower diet (d11-24) digestible sulphur amino acids (SAAs) levels on performance traits, blood metabolites, and immune responses to Newcastle disease (ND) and avian influenza (AI) vaccination in the broiler chickens. Additionally, digestible SAAs requirements were determined based on nutrient dose-response data. A total of 360, 11‐day‐old male Ross-308 broiler chicks were randomly allocated to six dietary treatments, graded levels of supplementary DL-methionine (+0.7 g/kg), but cystine (0.29%) was equal across groups, lead to levels of 0.59, 0.66, 0.73, 0.8, 0.87, and 0.94% dietary digestible SAAs, with six replicates and ten birds each. All birds were vaccinated with inactivated H9N2/ND and live-ND on days 5 and 11, respectively. Increasing dietary digestible SAAs level improved live body weight (LBW), weight gain (WG), feed efficiency (FE) with linear trends, and improved carcass yield, relative breast weight (RBW), and immune responses with quadratic trends. On day 24, a quadratic increase in blood serum albumin concentration was concomitant with decreasing triglyceride, whole cholesterol, low‐density-lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine, and alkaline phosphatase concentration with increasing dietary digestible SAAs levels. Based on broken‐line regression models, the LBW, WG, FE, RBW, and immunity against ND and AI vaccination were optimised when dietary digestible SAAs levels were 0.73, 0.69, 0.78, 0.86, 0.73, and 0.72%, respectively. It is concluded, the digestible SAAs requirements of broilers vary according to what production parameter is taken considered for optimisation. The best grower diet digestible SAAs concentration achieved 0.86% for support performance, breast yield, and immune function.HighlightsThe present data highlight that a better breast meat yield could be obtained by supplementing DL-Met, which raised dietary digestible sulphur amino acids level to 0.86%.  aPublisher supplied data  a3/50173 3aNewcastle disease 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aavian influenza 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3abreast meat 3abreasts 3acarcass yield 3acreatinine 3acystine 3adiet 3adose response 3afeed conversion 3agrowth performance 3ainfluenza vaccination 3amales 3ametabolites 3aserum albumin 3asulfur 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight gain 0aBroilers 0aimmune 0aperformance 0arequirement 0asulphur amino acids1 aZarghi, Heydar1 aGolian, Abolghasem0 tItalian journal of animal science.g2021 Jan. 1, v. 20, no. 1 p.1002-1014dTaylor & FranciswJournal:11638x1828-051X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1828051X.2021.19387163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245014300182300001400325520096400339592002801303650001801331650001901349650002501368650001101393650001101404650001501415650000901430650003101439650000901470650001101479650000701490650000901497650002701506650001401533650002001547650000901567653003701576653001901613653001501632653001801647653001801665653000901683700002801692700002501720700002101745773011601766856008801882852000901970655001201979IND60540165720221123043434.0190318e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054016572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.07.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Orte, Manoela Romanó10aSimulation of the potential effects of CO2 leakage from carbon capture and storage activities on the mobilization and speciation of metals  ap. 59-67.  aOne of the main risks associated with carbon capture and storage (CCS) activities is the leakage of the stored CO2, which can result in several effects on the ecosystem. Laboratory-scale experiments were performed to provide data on the possible effects of CO2 leakage from CCS on the mobility of metals previously trapped in sediments. Metal-contaminated sediments were collected and submitted to acidification by means of CO2 injection using different pH treatments. The test lasted 10days, and samples were collected at the beginning and at the end of the experiment for metal analysis. The results revealed increases in the mobility of metals such as Co, Cu, Fe, Pb and Zn due to pH decreases. Geochemical modeling demonstrated that acidification influenced the speciation of the metals, increasing the concentrations of their free forms. These data suggest the possible sediment contamination consequences of accidental CO2 leakage during CCS activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3acobalt 3acopper 3aecosystems 3airon 3alaboratory experimentation 3alead 3amodels 3apH 3arisk 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3awater pollution 3azinc 0aCarbon capture and storage (CCS) 0aMetal mobility 0aSpeciation 0aContamination 0aAcidification 0aRisk1 aSarmiento, Aguasanta M.1 aDelValls, T. Ángel1 aRiba, Inmaculada0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 86, no. 1-2 p.59-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.07.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03214naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009900165300001600264520190500280592002802185650002502213650002402238650002002262650001302282650002502295650001402320650002502334650002102359650000902380650001102389650001402400650002002414650002102434650001202455650001202467650001402479650002002493650001102513650002102524700002502545773009602570856008102666852000902747655001202756IND60438886320221122230342.0151024e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043888632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-005-1468-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnaus, Martin10aCharacterisation of carbohydrate-binding sites in developmental stages of Myxobolus cerebralis  ap. 505-514.  aGlycans and lectins (carbohydrate-binding molecules) form a mutual recognition system, which enables parasitic organisms to attach themselves to the host cells and/or take part in the migration of their developmental stages into the target tissue. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterise the potential binding activity of glycoconjugates in different developmental stages of Myxobolus cerebralis, the causative agent of whirling disease in salmonids. The binding patterns of 13 biotinylated neoglycoconjugates were histochemically examined in thin-sections of infected rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and oligochaetes (Tubifex tubifex), as well as isolated waterborne triactinomyxon spores. A distinct structure-selective and developmental stage-regulated expression of certain classes of carbohydrate binding was observed. In triactinomyxon spores, the expression of carbohydrate binding activity for α-l-Fuc-BSA-biotin, α-d-GalNAc-BSA-biotin, β-d-GlcNAc-BSA-biotin, Lac-BSA-biotin and ASF-biotin was up-regulated in the polar capsules; the shell valves showed no activity. In the gut of T. tubifex, polar capsules of the parasite showed strong positive reaction only for β-d-GlcNAc-BSA-biotin. In fish cartilage, polar capsules were negative, but the spore shell valves showed a broad range of carbohydrate binding activity. No activity was detected for either α6- or α3-linked N-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid to galactose. An adhesion assay was performed on GlycoWell®-plates and Myxobolus spores were found to specifically adhere to matrices containing residues of lactose, fucose, galactose, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. This is the first study to identify lectin activity in a myxozoan parasite; activity that is likely to play a role in the recognition systems involved in host specificity and the processes of spore attachment and invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyxobolus cerebralis 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aTubifex tubifex 3aadhesion 3acarbohydrate binding 3acartilage 3adevelopmental stages 3adigestive system 3afish 3afucose 3agalactose 3aglycoconjugates 3ahost specificity 3alactose 3alectins 3aparasites 3apolysaccharides 3aspores 3awhirling disease1 aEl-Matbouli, Mansour0 tParasitology research.g2005 Dec., v. 97, no. 6 p.505-514dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-005-1468-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008600167300001600253520107800269592002801347650002701375650001601402650001601418650001601434650002501450650001601475650001901491650001501510650001301525650002301538650002101561650001401582650002001596650001301616650001001629650001001639651001101649653001001660653000601670653002501676653001601701653002401717700002801741700003001769700002601799700002601825773015501851856008302006852000902089655001202098IND60541480020221120205424.0190318e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054148002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2015.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoriano, Diana10aAnalysis of nitrogen seed reserves of ten tree species of the tropical dry forest  ap. 149-153.  aNitrogen is a component of many seed reserve compounds, which play a remarkable role during germination and have great value for predators. A predefined coefficient factor is used to determine the protein concentration from the seed nitrogen concentration. However, this calculation may not reflect the variety of nitrogen compounds present in seeds and their ecological role. Understanding how the seed nitrogen content is distributed between amino acids and proteins will help explain how nitrogen compounds are involved in seed metabolism. We studied the heat-stable protein and total amino acid concentrations in ten tree species in a tropical dry forest in northwest Mexico. The seed nitrogen concentrations formed a continuum in the studied species. The total amino acid concentration was positively correlated with the nitrogen concentration. During germination, a differential decrease in the nitrogen, total amino acid, and heat-stable protein contents was detected among the species. Functional diversity in the partitioning of nitrogen inside seeds is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3acorrelation 3adry forests 3afunctional diversity 3agermination 3aheat stability 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3anitrogen compounds 3anitrogen content 3apredators 3aprotein content 3aproteins 3aseeds 3atrees 3aMexico 0aSeeds 0aN 0aHeat-stable proteins 0aAmino acids 0aTropical dry forest1 aAlvarado-López, Sandra1 aZúñiga-Sánchez, Esther1 aOrozco Segovia, Alma,1 aGamboa-deBuen, Alicia0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Mar., v. 97 p.149-153dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2015.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245015000167300001800317500002000335520172900355592002802084650002102112650001302133650001202146650002302158650001202181650002302193650002302216650001702239650001002256650002002266650001702286651001202303651002902315700002302344700001802367773009302385856007302478852000902551655001202560IND60585104620221118011411.0171102e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058510462DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.039842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacGregor, Hannah E.

Functional changes in morphology, physiology and life‐history following introduction show that organisms can adapt both fast and efficiently. It remains unclear, however, if female reproductive characters and male sexually selected behaviour show the same adaptive potential. Furthermore, the invasion success and evolutionary trajectory of non‐native species might often depend on the ability of the sexes to coordinate shifts in characters associated with reproductive strategy. The common wall lizard, Podarcis muralis, has been repeatedly introduced from southern Europe to England over the past 80 years. Lizards in England experience a cool, seasonal climate that effectively restricts recruitment to the first clutch of the season, whereas in their native range up to three clutches per season recruit. As a consequence, both females and males in non‐native populations should benefit from reducing or even eliminating their reproductive investment in second clutches. Using a combination of field data and experiments, we show that non‐native females produce relatively larger and heavier first seasonal clutches and smaller and lighter second seasonal clutches compared to native females. In contrast, non‐native and native males do not differ in their territorial and sexual behaviour later in the season. An adaptive shift in male seasonal reproductive investment may be constrained because males use breeding females as cues for sexual behaviour. If this is so, we expect a general pattern across climatic regimes whereby female reproductive investment evolves first, with responses in males lagging behind.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodarcis muralis 3abreeding 3aclimate 3acolonizing ability 3afemales 3agender differences 3aintroduced species 3alife history 3amales 3asexual behavior 3awall lizards 3aEngland 3aSouthern European region1 aWhile, Geoffrey M.1 aUller, Tobias0 tOikos.g2017 Nov., v. 126, no. 11 p.1564-1574dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.039843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245015500162300001600317520141000333592002801743650001401771650001501785650001201800650001901812650001401831650001001845650002001855650001001875650001601885650001801901650001501919650001301934650001501947650001401962650001701976653002901993653001902022653002302041653001402064653002502078653000702103653001002110653000702120653000802127700001702135700001502152700002002167700001902187700001802206700001902224700001902243700001502262700001202277700001302289700001802302773012102320856008202441852000902523655001202532IND60533149720221119201929.0160728e20150410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053314972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Ya-Di10aProspective validation of DACH2 as a novel biomarker for prediction of metastasis and prognosis in muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder  ap. 416-423.  aMetastasis is the main cause of death from muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), and the metastatic potential of tumors is often unpredictable. The role of Dachshund homolog 2 gene (DACH2) in tumorigenesis remains unexplored. We aimed to investigate whether DACH2 can be used as a biomarker to predict metastasis and prognosis of muscle-invasive UCB in a sequential training and validation fashion. For the training set (n = 40), compared with UCB patients without lymph node (LN) metastasis, both DACH2 protein and mRNA expression were greatly increased in case-matched patients with LN metastasis. For the independent validation set (n = 243), patients with primary UCB that did not express DACH2 had a longer metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS) than did those with tumors expressing DACH2 (5-year MFS: 88% [95% CI 80–96] versus 19% [95% CI 7–31], p < 0.001; 5-year OS: 93% [95% CI 87–99] versus 37% [95% CI 23–51], p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis of DACH2 status showed hazard ratios of 7.34 (95% CI 3.15-11.87, p < 0.001) for MFS and 3.96 (95% CI 2.04-7.16, p < 0.001) for OS which were much higher than hazard ratios associated with other independent risk factors. Collectively, DACH2 is an independent prognostic marker that can be used at initial diagnosis of UCB to identify patients who have a high potential to develop metastasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDachshund 3abiomarkers 3abladder 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3adeath 3agene expression 3agenes 3alymph nodes 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3apatients 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3arisk factors 0aDachshund homolog 2 gene 0aBladder cancer 0aRadical cystectomy 0aPrognosis 0aImmunohistochemistry 0aCI 0aDACH2 0aLN 0aUCB1 aLuo, Zi-Huan1 aYang, Ming1 aRuan, Xing-Xing1 aLiu, Shao-Yuan1 aWu, Zhen-Quan1 aDeng, Wei-Ming1 aShao, Chun-Kui1 aSu, Zu-Lan1 aHe, Dan1 aGao, Xin1 aLi, Liao-Yuan0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2015 Apr. 10, v. 459 p.416-423dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2015.02.1193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03482naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011100160300001800271500002000289520231100309592002802620650002402648650001302672650001502685650001102700650002202711650001402733650002502747650001502772650002302787650002202810650001202832650001302844700002502857700002702882773009302909856007303002852000903075655001203084IND60585104720221118011353.0171102e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058510472DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.041262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacobson, Bailey10aPhenotype‐dependent selection underlies patterns of sorting across habitats: the case of stream‐fishes  ap. 1660-1671.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpatial and temporal heterogeneity within landscapes influences the distribution and phenotypic diversity of individuals both within and across populations. Phenotype–habitat correlations arise either through phenotypes within an environment altering through the process of natural selection or plasticity, or phenotypes remaining constant but individuals altering their distribution across environments. The mechanisms of non‐random movement and phenotype‐dependent habitat choice may account for associations within highly heterogeneous systems, such as streams, where local adaptation may be negated, plasticity too costly and movement is particularly important. Despite growing attention, however, few empirical tests have yet to be conducted. Here we provide a test of phenotype‐dependent habitat choice and ask: 1) if individuals collected from a single habitat type continue to select original habitat; 2) if decisions are phenotype‐dependent and functionally related to habitat requirements; and 3) if phenotypic‐sorting continues despite increasing population density. To do so we both conducted experimental trials manipulating the density of four stream‐fish species collected from either a single riffle or pool and developed a game‐theoretical model exploring the influence of individuals’ growth rate, sampling and competitive abilities as well as interference on distribution across two habitats as a function of density. Our experimental trials show individuals selecting original versus alternative habitats differed in their morphologies, that morphologies were functionally related to habitat‐type swimming demands, and that phenotypic‐sorting remained significant (although decreased) as density increased. According to our model this only occurs when phenotypes have contrasting habitat preferences and only one phenotype disperses (i.e. selects alternatives) in response to density pressures. This supports our explanation that empirical habitat selection was due to a combination of collecting a fraction of mobile individuals with different habitat preferences and the exclusion of individuals via scramble competition at increased densities. Phenotype‐dependent habitat choice can thereby account for observed patterns of natural stream‐fish distribution.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anatural selection 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aplasticity 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3astreams 3aswimming1 aDubois, Frédérique1 aPeres‐Neto, Pedro R.0 tOikos.g2017 Nov., v. 126, no. 11 p.1660-1671dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.041263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03093naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245012600178500002200304520141900326592002801745650003701773650001301810650001501823650001501838650002801853650001101881650001101892650001301903650001901916650001301935650003201948650000901980650001501989650001302004650001202017650001102029650000902040650001602049653002202065653001602087700002302103700001702126700001702143700001602160700001402176700002102190700002502211700002102236700002302257700002002280700002302300773008002323856009102403852000902494655001202503IND60656079820221122014818.0190809e20190729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065607982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1193992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDreger, Nathan Z.10aZwitterionic amino acid-based Poly(ester urea)s suppress adhesion formation in a rat intra-abdominal cecal abrasion model  aPre-press version  aHernia repair outcomes have improved with more robust material options for surgeons and optimized surgical techniques.

Herein, amino acid-based poly(ester urea)s (PEUs) with varied amount of an allyl ether side chains were modified post polymerization modification with the zwitterionic sulfnate group (3-((3-((3-mercaptopropanoyl)oxy)propyl) dimethylammonio)propane-1-sulfonate) to promote anti-adhesive properties. These alloc-PEUs were processed using roll-to-roll fabrication methods to afford films that were amenable to surface functionalization via a zwitterion-thiol. Functional group availability on the surface was confirmed via fluorescence microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements. Zwitterionic treated PEUs exhibited reduced fibrinogen adsorption in vitro when compared to unfunctionalized control polymer. A rat intrabdominal cecal abrasion adhesion model was used to assess the extent and tenacity of adhesion formation in the presence of the PEUs. The 10% alloc-PEU zwitterion functionalized material was found to reduce the extent and tenacity of adhesions when compared to adhesion controls and the unfunctionalized PEU controls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3afibrinogen 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahernia 3amodels 3amoieties 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3arats 3asulfonates 3asurgeons 3asurgery 3athiols 3aurea 3azwitterions 0aPoly(ester urea)s 0aSoft-tissue1 aZander, Zachary K.1 aHsu, Yen-Hao1 aLuong, Derek1 aChen, Peiru1 aLe, Nancy1 aParsell, Trenton1 aSøndergaard, Clause1 aDunbar, Misha L.1 aKoewler, Nathan J.1 aSuckow, Mark A.1 aBecker, Matthew L.0 tBiomaterials.g2019 July 29, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2019.1193993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009200166300001600258500001500274520139900289592002801688650002201716650000901738650001401747650001401761650002401775650001101799650001001810653001401820653002801834700002201862700001901884773011601903852000902019856008202028655001202110IND4378871620221119162024.0190314e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437887162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-004-0680-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Song-yung,14aThe amount of wooden material in a closed room and its effect on the reverberation time  ap. 474-479.  a2019-12-05  aOptimal sound-absorbing materials are vital for desirable room acoustics. The effect of wood used for interior wall decoration on the acoustical environment is explored in a controlled room by changing the amount of wall wooden materials. The effect on the interior reverberation time (RT) is reported in this work. The experiment was conducted in a relatively small concrete brick house (approximate dimensions 4.6 × 3.2 × 4.2 m). Results showed that room shape and the arrangement of wooden wall decoration materials were important factors affecting the RT at different receiving positions. As the amount of wall decorating wood materials increased, the interior RT in the house decreased linearly; however, the RT at low frequencies diverged. After the analysis of covariance, all frequency variables were adjusted to the same level and a general regressive formula was developed as RT = C − 0.005 DR. Where RT is the reverberation time (s), DR is the amount of interior wood materials used (%), and the C values were constants that ranged from 0.888 to 1.606 and varied according to the different octave bands. Furthermore, it was found that the increasing influential effect with the DR showed diminishing marginal utility. This means that the influence of DR on RT was not linear, and, therefore, the marginal utility should be considered in order to use wooden panels economically.  aPublisher supplied data 3awood-based panels 3awood 3aequations 3afrequency 3aacoustic properties 3asounds 3awalls 0aacoustics 0acomposite wood products1 aChang, Feng-Cheng1 aLin, Far-Ching0 tJournal of wood science.g2005 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.474-479dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-004-0680-93Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03020naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013400169300001800303520127400321536027301595592002801868596001401896596001401910650001401924650001601938650001101954650002401965650001401989650001202003650002702015653001402042653003002056653002102086653003302107653002702140653001602167700001702183700002002200700001702220700001602237700001502253700001602268700001902284773012802303856008602431852000902517655001202526IND60761341420221123040903.0220709e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076134142DNAL7 a10.1080/1828051X.2021.19430142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Jiangyong10aCorrelation among serum biochemical indices and slaughter traits, texture characteristics and water-holding capacity of Tan sheep  ap. 1781-1790.  aThis study was conducted to determine the correlation among serum biochemical indices, slaughter traits, texture characteristics and water-holding capacity in Tan sheep. Eighty Tan sheep aged 4–6 months were selected. Blood samples were collected from live animals to analyse serum biochemical indices. The slaughter traits, texture characteristics and water-holding capacity of meat were assessed after slaughter. There were highly significant correlations (p<.01) and high linear regression R values among serum biochemical indices, slaughter traits, meat texture characteristics and water-holding capacity in Tan sheep. Therefore, this study has demonstrated that the meat qualities of Tan mutton may be evaluated by the serum biochemical indices of live Tan sheep.HighlightsThis study was conducted to determine the correlation among serum biochemical indices, slaughter traits, texture characteristics and water-holding capacity in Tan sheep.

To accomplish this, it is essential to examine the ecology of introduced species in native populations. We examined organization patterns, spatial structure, and competitive abilities of ground-dwelling ants in different habitats of a protected area in east-central Argentina, where several highly invasive ant species naturally coexist, to determine whether all they are ecologically dominant in their native range as in their introduced range. We sampled ant communities at Otamendi Nature Reserve and found 49 ant species co-occurred with moderate separation among habitats, including five species that are global invaders; but only Solenopsis richteri (the most numerically dominant) and Linepithema humile (the best mass recruiter) were ecologically co-dominant along with another three non-invasive species in locally rich assemblages. Their co-occurrence was apparently facilitated by both niche and competitive differences. However, we found no evidence for discovery-dominance trade-offs, and ant diversity and spatial segregation suggested that competition only plays a secondary role in structuring assemblages in arboreal habitats. Despite L. humile and S. richteri were ecologically co-dominant, their hegemony was lower in the reserve than in their introduced range likely due to biotic resistance. The other invasive ants (Wasmannia auropunctata, Brachymyrmex patagonicus, and Nylanderia fulva) were not dominant. It is possible that their establishment, persistence, and high prevalence in anthropic habitats in native and introduced populations to be attributed to their better physiologic adaptations to disturbed habitats rather than to their superior competitive abilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachymyrmex 3aLinepithema humile 3aNylanderia fulva 3aSolenopsis richteri 3aWasmannia auropunctata 3aconservation areas 3aecological invasion 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3asocial insects 3aArgentina1 aCabrera, Sonia1 aBriano, Juan0 tInsectes sociaux.g2016 Aug., v. 63, no. 3 p.407-419dSpringer International Publishingx0020-18127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00040-016-0481-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245005300207300001300260520228400273592002802557650001202585650001102597650001102608650001202619650001402631650002002645650001902665650001402684650001902698650001702717650001102734651001302745653002002758653001702778653002002795653002002815653001802835653001302853700005602866700005602922773008902978856008703067852000903154655001203163IND60547013320221121032241.0160903e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054701332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2015.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCostas, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4005-077X10aWhy do we decide to live with risk at the coast?  ap. 1-11.  aCoastal communities have been repeatedly threatened by the ephemeral character of the coast. Morphological changes derived from climate events and sea level oscillations forced the relocation of coastal communities over the past, but never prevented the occupation of this fragile source of wealth. Moreover, the socio-economic impact of high energy events is dramatically increasing due to the growing occupation of the coast, raising the need for rethinking the way disaster risk reduction measures are implemented to ensure effectiveness and acceptance.To illustrate this conflict (occupation versus risk), we explore risk perception in a population located in a fragile segment of the southern coast of Portugal, Praia de Faro, in order to identify the factors shaping risk perception and to understand the reasons behind the occupation of risky coastal areas. The selected community consists of two different populations (a fishermen community and a tourism-related community) sharing the risk associated with storm impacts and coastal retreat. For that, we examine the socio-economic and environmental frameworks and run a set of in depth interviews to provide a frame for understanding the culture of risk in a system with multiple stakeholders and planned measures of relocation.Interviews in Praia de Faro suggest that citizens using the beach as their first residence have voluntarily accepted to live with risk in the beach in exchange for a series of related benefits that they find to largely exceed expected personal damages. Risk perception analysis found that the community is aware about the hazards impacting the area, but they are not worried or prepared to face likely levels of risk derived from the impact of storms estimated by experts. Characteristics of risk perception seem shaped by place attachment, underestimation of impact probability and lessons learnt, and inherent cultural aspects. In addition, it seems clear that imposed measures of relocation are contributing to reduce residents risk perception in an attempt to ensure their permanence in the area in a frame of institutional distrust and absence of genuine communication. Alternative measures to relocation can only exist if responsibilities in risk mitigation are reconsidered and shared.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acoasts 3aenergy 3aexperts 3afishermen 3arisk perception 3arisk reduction 3asea level 3asocioeconomics 3astakeholders 3astorms 3aPortugal 0aRisk perception 0aStakeholders 0aCoastal erosion 0aCoastal hazards 0aPraia de Faro 0aPortugal1 aFerreira, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9975-00361 aMartinez, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0642-65900 tOcean & coastal management.g2015 Dec., v. 118 p.1-11dElsevier Ltdx0964-56917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2015.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014200157520126200299592002801561650005201589650001901641650001401660650002001674650001901694650001401713650001101727650003001738650001401768650001501782651001101797651001801808651001501826700001601841700001801857700001401875700001601889700002101905700001801926700001801944773012901962856007502091852000902166655001202175IND60756183320221121225720.0211111e20211102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075618332DNAL7 a10.3390/rs132144062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Yufeng 10aPotential Temporal and Spatial Trends of Oceanographic Conditions with the Bloom of Ulva Prolifera in the West of the Southern Yellow Sea  aBased on National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (NOAA/AVHRR) remote sensing and Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) wind field data from 2007 to 2019, oceanographic conditions are analysed, respectively, in the Source Area (SA) and Typical Bloom Area (TBA) of Ulva prolifera (U. prolifera) in the west of the Southern Yellow Sea (SYS) using Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC) and Wind Speed over the years. The results indicate that the annual maximum SST Difference (SSTD) between U. prolifera SA and TBA is strongly consistent with the intensity of U. prolifera, and a high SST Warming Rate (WR) from May to July may constrain the U. prolifera blooms. The Taiwan Warm Current (TWC), crossing Yangtze River Estuary northward from March to April, leads to SST increasing in the SA and becomes a key trigger for the growth of U. prolifera in the early period. The amount of U. prolifera may decrease in the early period because of the lower light intensity with high SSC and turbidity in SA. The summer monsoon is one of determinants for the spread of U. prolifera, and the distribution of U. prolifera reaches its highest point with a higher mean wind speed in the TBA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 3aUlva prolifera 3aestuaries 3alight intensity 3amonsoon season 3asediments 3asummer 3asurface water temperature 3aturbidity 3awind speed 3aTaiwan 3aYangtze River 3aYellow Sea1 aDing, Dong 1 aLi, Guangxue 1 aLiu, Xue 1 aLiang, Jun 1 aWang, Xiangdong 1 aLiu, Shidong 1 aShi, Jinghao 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Nov. 02, v. 13, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs132144063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011400210300001800324500001900342520113300361592002801494596005801522650001201580650001401592650001901606650001401625650001901639650001701658650001901675650001301694700001701707700003301724700005801757773011201815856008301927852000902010655001202019IND60718770720221122170108.0210220e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071877072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-020-03476-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetzger, Christoph1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1582-830510aAgglomeration of cellulose nanocrystals: the effect of secondary sulfates and their use in product separation  ap. 9839-9851.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was aimed at the development of a better understanding of the agglomeration behavior of sulfated cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) in the presence of sulfates with monovalent (NH₄⁺, K⁺, Na⁺) and divalent (Ca²⁺) cations, and to demonstrate their potential in simple and efficient product separation. Protonated CNCs were counterion-exchanged and their ionic strength was increased by adding sulfates of the respective cation to trigger agglomeration. The critical concentrations of agglomeration (CAC) and peptization (CPC) were determined. We found that the agglomeration behavior of CNCs could be attributed to matching affinities between the cations and the sulfate half-ester groups on the CNC surfaces. Based on these findings, a facile and efficient downstream process was designed to separate CNCs from neutralized reactant solutions using CAC and CPC. This method provides colloidally stable CNCs at high yield provided by centrifugation. When salt concentrations in the product are maintained below the CAC, as prepared CNCs from neutralized reactant solutions might be used in hydrogels and emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data  a03XP196cBundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 3acalcium 3acellulose 3acentrifugation 3ahydrogels 3aionic strength 3ananocrystals 3aneutralization 3asulfates1 aAuber, David1 aDähnhardt-Pfeiffer, Stephan1 aBriesen, Heiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7725-59070 tCellulose.g2020 Nov., v. 27, no. 17 p.9839-9851dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-03476-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02053naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245009100213300001800304500001900322500001100341520095000352592002801302650002801330650001401358650001101372650001801383650001501401700001501416700002401431700002201455700002201477773011201499856008301611852000901694655001201703IND60718770820221122201958.0210220e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071877082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-020-03456-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCañas-Gutiérrez, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2118-419010aBacterial cellulose: a biomaterial with high potential in dental and oral applications  ap. 9737-9754.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aBacterial cellulose has great potential as a biomaterial for dental and oral applications. It has been used mainly in dental pulp tissue regeneration, periodontal regeneration, and dressing of surgical wounds of the oral mucosa. In addition, bacterial cellulose has been explored in dental root canal treatment to remove the total residue and dry the canal. This review describes some bacterial cellulose studies focused on these applications, as well as advantages, disadvantages and some important results in both in vitro and in vivo evaluations, based on the physiological and structural components of the particular tissue. Furthermore, this work describes the properties and advantages of bacterial cellulose in dental and oral applications compared with other biomaterials.

Raman spectra of the samples were recorded before and after the heat treatments, and spectral changes in the range from 1000 cm⁻¹ to 1800 cm⁻¹ were evaluated using the difference spectrum method. For both wood species, the Raman band intensity at 1655–1660 cm⁻¹ due mainly to the C=C and C=O groups in lignin clearly decreased with increasing heat-treatment temperature (HTT). The spectral change was thought to reflect the progress of condensation reactions of lignin molecules during the heat treatment. Moreover, the decrease in band intensity was considerably facilitated by the presence of water in the cell wall, suggesting that the condensation is closely related to the softening of lignin. From the spectral changes in the wavenumber region of 1200–1500 cm⁻¹, it was considered that wood constituents are partially decomposed at the higher HTT.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater content 3awood 3aLarix kaempferi 3aFagus crenata 3aheat treatment 3atemperature 3alignin 3achemical reactions 3aspectral analysis 3aRaman spectroscopy1 aIijima, Yasuo1 aDoi, Shuichi0 tJournal of wood science.g2005 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.498-506dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-004-0691-63Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03261naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012500168300001600293520140800309592002801717650002501745650001201770650001201782650002101794650001101815650001401826650001201840650001801852650001401870650001601884650000901900650001101909650002201920650001401942650002001956650001401976650001301990650001702003650001402020650001002034650001002044650001102054650001002065650001302075650000902088653001202097653002102109653002502130653000902155653001002164700001902174700002102193700002202214700001802236700002102254700002302275700002302298700001902321773015502340856008302495852000902578655001202587IND60541480720221120205555.0190318e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054148072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2015.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHédiji, Hédia10aImpact of long-term cadmium exposure on mineral content of Solanum lycopersicum plants: Consequences on fruit production  ap. 176-181.  aIn young tomato plants, modifications in mineral composition by short-term cadmium (Cd) treatments have been extensively examined. However, long-term Cd treatments have been fewly investigated, and little information about Cd-stress in fruiting plants is available. In the present work, we examined the changes in mineral nutrients of roots, stems, leaves, flowers, seeds and fruit pericarp of tomato plants submitted to a long-term Cd stress. After a 90-day culture period in hydroponic contaminated environment (0, 20 and 100μM CdCl2), fruit production was affected by increasing external Cd levels, with the absence of fruit set at 100μM Cd. Meanwhile, Cd altered the plant mineral contents with an element- and organ-dependent response. At 20μM, Cd triggered a significant increase in Ca content in roots, mature leaves, flowers and developing fruits. However, at 100μM Cd, Ca content was reduced in shoots, and enhanced in roots. Cd stress reduced Zn and Cu contents in shoots and increased them in roots. High Cd level led to a significant decrease in K and Mg content in all plant organs. Furthermore, Fe concentration was reduced in roots, stems and leaves but increased in flowers, seeds and red ripe fruits. Our results suggest that tomato plants acclimatize during long-term exposure to 20μM Cd, while 100μM Cd results in drastic nutritional perturbations leading to fruit set abortion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achronic exposure 3acopper 3aflowering 3aflowers 3afruit growing 3afruit set 3ahydroponics 3airon 3aleaves 3along term effects 3amagnesium 3amineral content 3anutrients 3apericarp 3aplant organs 3apotassium 3aroots 3aseeds 3ashoots 3astems 3atomatoes 3azinc 0aCadmium 0aMineral elements 0aSolanum lycopersicum 0aSeed 0aFruit1 aDjebali, Wahbi1 aBelkadhi, Aïcha1 aCabasson, Cécile1 aMoing, Annick1 aRolin, Dominique1 aBrouquisse, Renaud1 aGallusci, Philippe1 aChaïbi, Wided0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Mar., v. 97 p.176-181dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2015.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02459naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245017700162520148000339592002801819650001001847650001101857650002201868650000901890650001101899650001701910651001001927700001601937773011801953856007702071852000902148655001202157IND60790994720221123013517.0220826e20220810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079099472DNAL7 a10.3390/land110812862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yongxun 10aProtecting Traditional Agricultural Landscapes by Promoting Industrial Integration Development: Practices from Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (IAHS) Sites in China  aTraditional agricultural landscapes (TAL) have a long history. They have received significant attention due to concerns regarding their multiple functions and scarcity. Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (IAHS), designated by the FAO or some countries, are typical TAL that are facing conservation problems. This study takes IAHS as an example and examines the pathway and coordinating mechanism that industrial integration development (IID) uses to promote TAL conservation using available literature reviews and field surveys in IAHS sites. The findings suggest that the main pathways protecting IAHS, depending on IID, include increasing product price by IAHS branding, diversifying farmers’ income by developing special resources, and employing more seasonal surplus laborers by extending local industrial chains. Building a fair and reasonable benefit coordination mechanism among stakeholders in IID is crucial to prompt IAHS conservation. It rests on accurately identifying key stakeholders in IAHS conservation, selecting industrial organization modes that are suitable to an IAHS site, and introducing beneficial distribution mechanisms that can encourage farmers to stay on the farm. The case studies show that diversifying income channels and increasing income with industrial development are the main forces driving farmers to protect IAHS. The IID based on IAHS resources and the win-win benefit distribution principle are key to sustainable conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarms 3aincome 3aindustrialization 3aland 3aprices 3astakeholders 3aChina1 aLi, Xiande 0 tLand.g2022 Aug. 10, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land110812863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02301naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012100162300001600283520109500299592002801394650003101422650003301453650001201486650001101498650001401509650001101523650001501534650002301549650002101572650001401593650001701607650001601624650001701640700001701657700001601674700001501690773009601705856008101801852000901882655001201891IND60438887120221122234853.0151024e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043888712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-005-1484-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, S.

Analysis of the extracts and excretory-secretory (ES) products of A. cantonensis larvae and adult stages on gelatin substrate zymography demonstrated the presence of distinct gelatinolytic enzymes. In worm extracts, inhibitor studies showed that the metalloproteinases revealed in L₁ (23 kDa), L₃ (66, 42 and 30 kDa), young adult worm (72 and 94 kDa) and adult worm (72 and 94 kDa). In ES products, the L₁ revealed one low (42 kDa) and two high (105 and 94 kDa) molecular weight proteolytic bands that degraded gelatin in substrate gels. The L₃ revealed three low (66, 50, and 30 kDa) and one high (105 kDa) molecular weight proteolytic bands. Inhibitor studies confirmed that the 105 and 94 proteolytic bands of the L₁, and the 50 and 30 kDa proteolytic bands of the L₃ classification were metalloproteinases. These metalloproteinases secreted in the infective larvae may be associated with the parasite dissemination or pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParastrongylus cantonensis 3aexcretory-secretory products 3agelatin 3ahumans 3aingestion 3alarvae 3ameningitis 3ametalloproteinases 3amolecular weight 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3aproteolysis 3ayoung adults1 aJiang, S.

The incorporation of microstructures can effectively change the contact area and increase the sensitivity of E-skin materials to some extent, but usually require expensive micromachining methods. In this work, cellulose was dissolved in a NaOH/urea aqueous solution and compounded with carbon nanotubes (CNT) to prepare regenerated cellulose (RC) -CNT composite films. Then the microstructure was introduced onto the surface of RC-CNT composite films, and assembled the composite films into an E-skin sensing device. The results indicated that the RC-CNT composite films possessed good flexibility, high tensile strength (61.6 MPa) and strain (17.7%), favorable sensing performance, and good response performance. In addition, in vitro toxicity experiments indicated that the composite films exhibited no cytotoxicity. Therefore, the flexible sensor based on RC-CNT composite films has potential applications in wearable personal health monitoring and tactile sensitive information collection.  aPublisher supplied data  a21704079cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51703177cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020IB030cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aPQETGP2019007cKey laboratory of Processing and Quality Evaluation Technology of Green Plastics of China National Light Industry council 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3acellulose 3acytotoxicity 3aelectronic equipment 3amicrostructure 3atensile strength 3aurea1 aXu, Haiyu1 aHe, Xianqing1 aHu, Yang1 aZhu, Enwen1 aGao, Yujiao1 aLiu, Dongning1 aShi, Zhuqun1 aLi, Jing1 aYang, Quanling1 aXiong, Chuanxi0 tCellulose.g2020 Nov., v. 27, no. 17 p.10199-10211dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-020-03496-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016000169300001600329520113100345592002801476650002301504650002701527650002501554650000801579650001301587650001201600650001901612650001801631650002001649650001501669650001301684650001501697650002101712650002501733650001501758653001501773653002301788653001901811653001901830653001101849700001801860700002601878700002101904700006101925773008201986856008402068852000902152655001202161IND60545141420221121113331.0160901e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054514142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArbib, Zouhayr10aCapability of different microalgae species for phytoremediation processes: Wastewater tertiary treatment, CO2 bio-fixation and low cost biofuels production  ap. 465-474.  aScenedesmus obliquus, Chlorella vulgaris, Chlorella kessleri and a natural Bloom were cultivated in batch experiments, under controlled conditions, in urban wastewater (WW) and synthetic wastewater (SW) under 5% CO2 in air, with the object of estimating their capacity for nutrient removal, carbon dioxide biofixation, and generation of valuable biomass.

Mice treated with L. casei orally or intraperitoneally were inoculated 7 days later with an infectious dose of B. microti. Mice treated with lactobacilli showed significant reduction in the percentage of parasitized erythrocytes (PPE) compared to untreated mice. When mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with L. casei 3 or 0 days before challenge with B. microti, the PPE was significantly lower compared to untreated mice and there were no differences between treated mice and mice immune to B. microti infection. When mice treated with live or dead L. casei were compared to mice inoculated with Freund Complete Adjuvant before a B. microti infection, a significant reduction of PPE was observed. These results show the protective effect of L. casei administered to mice against a B. microti infection and suggest that it might act by stimulating the innate immune system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia microti 3aLactobacillus casei 3aProtozoa 3aadjuvants 3ababesiosis 3aerythrocytes 3ainnate immunity 3amice 3aoral administration 3aparasitism 3aprotective effect1 aGómez, M.B.1 aAguilar, B.R.1 aIxta, O.1 aMartinez, F.,1 aMosqueda, J.0 tParasitology research.g2005 Dec., v. 97, no. 6 p.472-477dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-005-1475-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03787naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245006800164300001800232500002000250500001500270520213400285592002802419650002202447650001502469650002702484650002302511650001502534650001902549650002002568650001402588650002502602650001502627650002502642650002102667650002202688650001102710650000802721650001502729650001502744650001902759650001302778650001302791650001202804650001302816650002302829651001102852653001702863700003302880700001802913700003002931700002302961700002002984773009903004856007303103852000903176655001203185IND60523596020221116170525.0160623e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052359602DNAL7 a10.1890/10-2007.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilner, Alexander M.10aEvolution of a stream ecosystem in recently deglaciated terrain  ap. 1924-1935.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-06  aClimate change and associated glacial recession create new stream habitat that leads to the assembly of new riverine communities through primary succession. However, there are still very few studies of the patterns and processes of community assembly during primary succession for stream ecosystems. We illustrate the rapidity with which biotic communities can colonize and establish in recently formed streams by examining Stonefly Creek in Glacier Bay, Alaska (USA), which began to emerge from a remnant glacial ice mass between 1976 and 1979. By 2002, 57 macroinvertebrate and 27 microcrustacea species had become established. Within 10 years of the stream's formation, pink salmon and Dolly Varden charr colonized, followed by other fish species, including juvenile red and silver salmon, Coast Range sculpin, and sticklebacks. Stable‐isotope analyses indicate that marine‐derived nitrogen from the decay of salmon carcasses was substantially assimilated within the aquatic food web by 2004. The findings from Stonefly Creek are compared with those from a long‐term study of a similarly formed but older stream (12 km to the northeast) to examine possible similarities in macroinvertebrate community and biological trait composition between streams at similar stages of development. Macroinvertebrate community assembly appears to have been initially strongly deterministic owing to low water temperature associated with remnant ice masses. In contrast, microcrustacean community assembly appears to have been more stochastic. However, as stream age and water temperature increased, macroinvertebrate colonization was also more stochastic, and taxonomic similarity between Stonefly Creek and a stream at the same stage of development was <50%. However the most abundant taxa were similar, and functional diversity of the two communities was almost identical. Tolerance is suggested as the major mechanism of community assembly. The rapidity with which salmonids and invertebrate communities have become established across an entire watershed has implications for the conservation of biodiversity in freshwater habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic food webs 3aglaciation 3aOncorhynchus gorbuscha 3aprimary succession 3awatersheds 3aGasterosteidae 3astable isotopes 3ajuveniles 3afunctional diversity 3abiocenosis 3aOncorhynchus kisutch 3aCottus aleuticus 3awater temperature 3asalmon 3aice 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3aclimate change 3anitrogen 3aglaciers 3astreams 3ahabitats 3amacroinvertebrates 3aAlaska 0abiodiversity1 aRobertson, A.

The SBR was intermittently fed with FQs, at concentrations of 9 and 32 μM. No evidence of FQ biodegradation was observed but the pharmaceutical compounds adsorbed to the aerobic granular sludge, being gradually released into the medium in successive cycles after stopping the FQ feeding.Overall COD removal was not affected during the shock loadings. Activity of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and nitrite oxidizing bacteria did not seem to be inhibited by the presence of FQs (maximum of 0.03 and 0.01 mM for ammonium and nitrite in the effluent, respectively). However, during the FQs feeding, nitrate accumulation up to 1.7 mM was observed at the effluent suggesting that denitrification was inhibited. The activity of phosphate accumulating organisms was affected, as indicated by the decrease of P removal capacity during the aerobic phase. Exposure to the FQs also promoted disintegration of the granules leading to an increase of the effluent solid content, nevertheless the solid content at the bioreactor effluent returned to normal levels within ca. 1 month after removing the FQs in the feed allowing recovery of the bedvolume. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed a dynamic bacterial community with gradual changes due to FQs exposure. Bacterial isolates retrieved from the granules predominantly belonged to α- and γ-branch of the Proteobacteria phylum.The capacity of the system to return to its initial conditions after withdrawal of the FQ compounds in the inlet stream, reinforced its robustness to deal with wastewaters containing organic pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProteobacteria 3aammonia 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3abioreactors 3achemical oxygen demand 3aciprofloxacin 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3adenitrification 3adrugs 3agranules 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anorfloxacin 3aofloxacin 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3asludge 3awastewater 0aAerobic granular sludge 0aFluoroquinolones 0aNutrients removal 0aMicrobial community1 aMaia, Alexandra S.1 aMesquita, Raquel B.R.1 aRangel, António O.S.S.1 avan Loosdrecht, Mark C.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0658-47751 aTiritan, Maria Elizabeth1 aCastro, Paula M.L.0 tWater research.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 50 p.101-113dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.10.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03096naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245007300168300001600241520171800257592002801975596002302003596002802026650001902054650002202073650001402095650001402109650002002123650004202143650001702185650002602202650001502228650001402243650002502257651001102282700002202293700003102315700002602346700002202372700002402394700002302418773010602441856008202547852000902629655001202638IND60537147920221121025707.0210925e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053714792DNAL7 a10.1007/s00248-016-0785-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPylro, Victor S.10aBMPOS: a Flexible and User-Friendly Tool Sets for Microbiome Studies  ap. 443-447.  aRecent advances in science and technology are leading to a revision and re-orientation of methodologies, addressing old and current issues under a new perspective. Advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) are allowing comparative analysis of the abundance and diversity of whole microbial communities, generating a large amount of data and findings at a systems level. The current limitation for biologists has been the increasing demand for computational power and training required for processing of NGS data. Here, we describe the deployment of the Brazilian Microbiome Project Operating System (BMPOS), a flexible and user-friendly Linux distribution dedicated to microbiome studies. The Brazilian Microbiome Project (BMP) has developed data analyses pipelines for metagenomic studies (phylogenetic marker genes), conducted using the two main high-throughput sequencing platforms (Ion Torrent and Illumina MiSeq). The BMPOS is freely available and possesses the entire requirement of bioinformatics packages and databases to perform all the pipelines suggested by the BMP team. The BMPOS may be used as a bootable live USB stick or installed in any computer with at least 1 GHz CPU and 512 MB RAM, independent of the operating system previously installed. The BMPOS has proved to be effective for sequences processing, sequences clustering, alignment, taxonomic annotation, statistical analysis, and plotting of metagenomic data. The BMPOS has been used during several metagenomic analyses courses, being valuable as a tool for training, and an excellent starting point to anyone interested in performing metagenomic studies.

Low MW alginates are attractive for in vivo tissue scaffolds where degradation and clearance from the body are desirable, whereas higher MW alginates are amenable for topical use as wound coverage because of its better mechanical properties. We use polyethylene oxide (PEO) as a carrier material to aid in electrospinning, and relate the solution properties, including entanglement concentration, relaxation time, conductivity, and surface tension, to their ability to be electrospun. In addition, we examine an FDA-approved, nonionic surfactant as a route to enhancing the alginate–PEO ratio (>80:20), and less toxic alternative to Triton X-100 surfactant. Finally, alginate-only nanofibers that are also water-insoluble are obtained by crosslinking the electrospun fibers with calcium and subsequently removing the PEO and surfactants by soaking the nanofibers in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3acalcium 3acrosslinking 3amechanical properties 3amolecular weight 3ananofibers 3anonionic surfactants 3aoctoxynol 3asoaking 3asurface tension 3atissue scaffolds 3atoxicity1 aKrebs, Melissa D.1 aSaquing, Carl D.1 aJeong, Sung In1 aShearer, Kimberly L.1 aAlsberg, E.q(Eben),1 aKhan, Saad A.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Apr. 22, v. 85, no. 1 p.111-119dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02140naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245008900163300001400252500002000266520112500286592002801411650001401439650002201453650001301475650001401488650002001502650001401522700002501536700002901561700002301590773010101613856007901714852000901793655001201802IND60572032220221121072420.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057203222DNAL7 a10.1111/1442-1984.121162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBolin, Jay F.10aIsotopic evidence of partial mycoheterotrophy in Burmannia coelestis (Burmanniaceae)  ap. 74-80.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Burmanniaceae contain several lineages of achlorophyllous mycoheterotrophic plants that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Here we investigate the isotopic profile of a green and potentially mycoheterotrophic plant in situ, Burmannia coelestis, and associated reference plants. We generated δ ¹³C and δ ¹⁵N stable isotope profiles for five populations of B. coelestis. Burmannia coelestis was significantly enriched in ¹³C relative to surrounding C₃ reference plants and significantly depleted in ¹³C relative to C₄ reference plants. No significant differences were detected in ¹⁵N enrichment between B. coelestis and reference plants. The isotopic profiles measured are suggestive of partial mycoheterotrophy in B. coelestis. Within the genus Burmannia transitions to full mycoheterotrophy have occurred numerous times, suggesting that some green Burmannia species are likely to be partially mycoheterotrophic but in many conditions this mode of nutrition may only be detectable using natural abundance stable isotopic methods, such as when associated with C₄ mycorrhizal plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurmannia 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3astable isotopes 3asymbiosis1 aTennakoon, Kushan U.1 aMajid, Mohamed Bin Abdul1 aCameron, Duncan D.0 tPlant species biology.g2017 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.74-80dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0913-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1442-1984.121163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012700172500001400299520162200313592002801935650002301963650001901986650001502005650002102020650001602041650001602057650002002073650001802093650002302111650002002134650001502154650001502169650001702184650001402201650001302215650002002228653000902248653001802257700001502275700001302290700001402303773009102317856009002408852000902498655001202507IND60718481020221122113414.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071848102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Xiaohan10aAcute exposure of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) induces immune signal regulation and ferroptosis in oryzias melastigma  aNAL-light  aThe plasticizer di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is becoming increasingly abundant throughout the global environment as plastic pollution becomes highly severe, especially in the ocean. The adverse effects of DEHP have garnered increasing concern as they are recognized as endocrine disruptors. However, information on the effects of DEHP in marine organisms remains limited. In this study, acute toxic effects on marine medaka (Oryzias melastigma) following DEHP exposure were investigated. Transcriptome analysis was performed on the livers of medaka exposed to DEHP for 6 and 24 h. Results showed that 1595 genes were affected in all the analyzed specimens, and several genes expressed variably according to sex. Some pathways associated with immunity, metabolism, and endocrine system were significantly enriched, with the complement system appearing to be the most affected immune pathway. Pathway enrichment indicated that, under acute DEHP exposure, the immune response of females tended to be more sensitive than that of males. In addition, ferroptosis occurred in response to DEHP exposure, which resulted in an enrichment of the ferroptosis pathway along with iron overload, an increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) content, and a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels. These results indicate that a form of cell death characterized by iron-dependence occurred following DEHP exposure, but the underlying mechanism requires further analysis. This study implies that DEHP can alter some molecular regulation patterns within a short period and induce cell death through ferroptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryzias melastigma 3aacute exposure 3acomplement 3aendocrine system 3aferroptosis 3aglutathione 3aimmune response 3airon overload 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3aphthalates 3aplasticizers 3apollution 3atoxicity 3atranscriptomics 0aDEHP 0aTranscriptome1 aZeb, Rabia1 aWei, Hui1 aCai, Ling0 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 265 p.129053-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005100149245011500200300001300315506010400328506007600432520116900508592002801677506003701705650002101742650001501763650002301778650001601801650001501817650001701832650003501849650001801884650001501902650001501917650001301932650001901945650001101964650001901975653001901994653002402013653003002037653001702067653002102084700001702105700002302122700002402145700005902169773009902228856008402327852000902411655001202420IND60686694620221207103310.0220531e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068669462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2020.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Hai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1223-281313aAn optimized methanol assimilation pathway relying on promiscuous formaldehyde-condensing aldolases in E. coli  ap. 1-13.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEngineering biotechnological microorganisms to use methanol as a feedstock for bioproduction is a major goal for the synthetic metabolism community. Here, we aim to redesign the natural serine cycle for implementation in E. coli. We propose the homoserine cycle, relying on two promiscuous formaldehyde aldolase reactions, as a superior pathway design. The homoserine cycle is expected to outperform the serine cycle and its variants with respect to biomass yield, thermodynamic favorability, and integration with host endogenous metabolism. Even as compared to the RuMP cycle, the most efficient naturally occurring methanol assimilation route, the homoserine cycle is expected to support higher yields of a wide array of products. We test the in vivo feasibility of the homoserine cycle by constructing several E. coli gene deletion strains whose growth is coupled to the activity of different pathway segments. Using this approach, we demonstrate that all required promiscuous enzymes are active enough to enable growth of the auxotrophic strains. Our findings thus identify a novel metabolic solution that opens the way to an optimized methylotrophic platform.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aauxotrophs 3abiomass production 3aengineering 3afeedstocks 3aformaldehyde 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3agene deletion 3ahomoserine 3ametabolism 3amethanol 3amicroorganisms 3aserine 3athermodynamics 0aPathway design 0aPromiscuous enzymes 0aFormaldehyde assimilation 0aSerine cycle 0aGrowth selection1 aHöper, Rune1 aDodenhöft, Moritz1 aMarlière, Philippe1 aBar-Even, Arren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1039-43280 tMetabolic engineering.g2020 July, v. 60 p.1-13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12015x1096-71767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2020.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245014000167300001400307500002000321520166000341592002802001650001102029650002602040650001302066650001502079650002002094650001302114650001902127650002102146650001002167650002002177650001602197651001702213651002502230700002002255700001802275700001902293773011102312856007902423852000902502655001202511IND60572032320221121072425.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057203232DNAL7 a10.1111/1442-1984.121272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl‐Keblawy, Ali10aEffects of maternal salinity on salt tolerance during germination of Suaeda aegyptiaca, a facultative halophyte in the Arab Gulf desert  ap. 45-53.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSuaeda aegyptiaca is a facultative halophyte found in saline and non‐saline habitats of the Arab Gulf desert, which produces small‐sized undispersible seeds. The interactive effects of maternal salinity and other environmental conditions, such as salinity, light and temperatures, that are prevailing during seed germination have received little attention for a facultative halophyte. This study tested the effects of maternal salinity on salt tolerance during seed germination of S. aegyptiaca under different light and temperature regimes. Seeds collected from both saline and non‐saline habitats of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were germinated in 0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mM NaCl, and incubated at 15/25°C, 20/30°C and 25/35°C in both 12‐h light/12‐h dark regimes and continuous darkness. Generally, seeds of the non‐saline habitat were 56% heavier and attained greater germination at the lower temperatures than seeds of the saline habitat. Seeds of the saline habitat germinated better in saline solutions at higher temperatures and in light. Germination was faster for seeds of the saline habitat than for seeds of non‐saline habitats. Germination recovery after transfer to distilled water was significantly greater for seeds from the non‐saline habitat, compared with seeds from saline habitats. Recovery was greater at lower and/or moderate temperatures, compared with at higher temperatures. Germination was significantly faster during recovery, compared with in the saline solutions. The study indicates that the maternal effect of salinity was confounded with the seed‐size effect and it cannot be conclusively confirmed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuaeda 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3ahalophytes 3amaternal effect 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3aPersian Gulf 3aUnited Arab Emirates1 aGairola, Sanjay1 aBhatt, Arvind1 aMahmoud, Tamer0 tPlant species biology.g2017 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.45-53dJohn Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltdx0913-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1442-1984.121273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245014000205300001600345520184000361592002802201650002002229650001302249650001902262650001102281650002302292650001002315650001102325650000902336650002402345650001502369650002302384650002002407650002702427650001502454651001002469653002002479653002002499653002602519653002302545653002702568700001702595700001302612700005802625700001702683700005302700700001502753700006002768700005802828773012002886856008603006852000903092655001203101IND60644091220221119051734.0200210e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064409122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Yu-Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8647-253X10aEvapotranspiration and its dominant controls along an elevation gradient in the Qinghai Lake watershed, northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau  ap. 257-268.  aEvapotranspiration (ET) and its dominant controls show obvious elevational pattern on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, due to heterogeneous environmental conditions regulated by altitude. To understand better how and why ET varies at different altitudes in the Qinghai Lake watershed, this study measured and retrieved soil moisture, solar radiation, and ET data between 3300 m and 4700 m, and further investigated the influence of water and energy conditions on ET. Results showed that, the mean annual terrestrial ET was 343 and 360 mm in this watershed in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The higher ET mainly appeared in the midstream of Shaliu River and on the southern region of Qinghai Lake, while the sand land on the east of Qinghai Lake and the bare rock in the northwest of the watershed had the lowest values. The ET increased firstly and then decreased with the increase of altitude, and its peak value appeared at 3600–3700 m. The dominant controls for ET switched from water conditions to energy conditions with the increase of elevation. The maximum limited fraction [(predicted value – actual value)/predicted value × 100] of ET by water condition (soil moisture content) achieved 11.2% and 10.1% at 3300–3350 m in 2014 and 2015, and the corresponding mean area-weighted values were 7.3% and 5.4% at 3300–3650 m, respectively. The maximum limited fraction of ET by energy condition (shortwave radiation and air temperature) achieved 24.4% and 29.8% at 4650–4700 m in 2014 and 2015, and the corresponding mean area-weighted values were 10.8% and 11.9% at 3650–4700 m, respectively. Overall, the energy conditions were more influential factors limiting the ET in the entire watershed, and this conclusion is critical for the management of regional terrestrial ecosystem with future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3aclimate change 3aenergy 3aevapotranspiration 3alakes 3arivers 3asand 3ashortwave radiation 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3asolar radiation 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aSolar radiation 0aAir temperature 0aSoil moisture content 0aEvapotranspiration 0aQinghai Lake watershed1 aLi, Xiao-Yan1 aLiu, Lei1 aYang, Xiao-Fan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7030-75161 aWu, Xiu-Chen1 aWang, Pei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3801-84391 aLin, Henry1 aZhang, Guang-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3801-84391 aMiao, Chi-Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6413-70200 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 Aug., v. 575 p.257-268dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01626naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245006200167300001800229520077100247592002801018650001301046650001901059650002201078650001301100700002001113773012701133856007901260852000901339655001201348IND60302152120221121050039.0150704e20131220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030215212DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12396862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAndrew, Patrick10aOpen Learning at a Distance: Lessons for Struggling MOOCs  ap. 1450-1451.  aFree education is changing how people think about learning online.

However, learning at scale, at a distance, is not a new phenomenon. Seeing MOOCs narrowly as a technology that expands access to in-classroom teaching can miss opportunities.

S.10aNitrogen Release Characteristics of Isobutylidene Diurea and its Effectiveness as a Source of N for Flue-Cured Tobacco  ap. 434-438.  aepub  aLeaching in coarse-textured soils contributes to inefficient N utilization by flue-cured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). Slow-release N materials reduce N leaching but those with rate of release dependent on biological degraduation have not been successful in furnishing the high proportion of total N required by tobacco during early growth. The objectives of this study were to investigate the release characteristics of isobutylidene diurea (IBDU), with N-release characteristics dependent primarily upon the effects of particle size on chemical dissolution rather than the effects of environmental variation on biological activity, in laboratory and greenhouse studies and to evaluate it as a source of N for flue-cured tobacco in the field. Urea, NaNO₃, and four particle sizes of IBDU (1.05, 0.75, 0.55, and 0.40 mm) were applied at rates of 200 and 400 mg N per kg of soil to a Norfolk sandy loam (Typic paleudult) in lysimeters and subjected to leaching at 10 intervals over a 109-day period. All applied N from NaNO₃ and 60% from urea were removed by the first leaching (0 days) at both rates of application. Only 5% of the applied N from IBDU was removed in the first leaching. At the 200 mg N application rate, 50 to 60% of applied N from the 1.05 to 025 mm IBDU particle sizes were removed after 10 leachings (109 days) but only four leachings (32 days) were required to remove equal amounts from the 0.40 mm particle size. At the 400 mg N application rate, 10 leachings were required for 55 to 60% removal of applied N from all particle sizes. The effects of particle size on the ability of IBDU to release N fast enough for maximum growth, but not so fast as to be subject to leaching, were evaluated in a greenhouse with two successive. crops of corn (Zea mays L.) grown under leached and non-leached conditions. IBDU particle sizes of 1.05, 0.55, and 0.40 mm were applied to Norfolk soil in pots at rates of 214, 321, and 428 mg per 5 kg of soil. Dry matter for the first crop was not affected by particle size, but it was greatest for the 1.05 mm IBDU in the second crop. Within a particle size, dry matter was not altered by lezching but total N uptake was greatest from 0.40 mm IBDU. This suggests that N release from 0.40 mm IBDU was rapid enough to support maximum growth but was not so rapid as to be subject to leaching under imposed conditions. In a field experiment on Norfolk soil, I BDU particle sizes of 1.05 and 0.40 nun were compared with NaNO₃ and urea as N sources for flue-cured tobacco. Materials were banded at 67 kg N/ha: (a) days after planting, (b) as a split application of a single source 12 and 26 days after planting, and (c) as a split application of one source at 12 days after planting and NaNO₃ at 26 days after planting. NaNO~ gave the highest yield of cured leaves when applied 12 days after planting, followed by urea, 0.4 mm IBDU, and 1.05 mm IBDU, respectively. Yields from both IBDU materials were improved when one-half of the total N was applied 2 weeks later as NaNO₃. Chemical composition of cured leaf varied little with treatment but urea gave higher levels of N and total alkaloids and lower sugars than the other materials. IBDU was effective in preventing loss of N by leaching in laboratory and greenhouse studies. As with other slow-release N sources, however, it was inferior to water-soluble N sources for flue-cured tobacco in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aPaleudults 3aZea mays 3aalkaloids 3abioactive properties 3acoarse-textured soils 3acorn 3acrops 3aenvironmental factors 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3aflue-cured tobacco 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aisobutylidene diurea 3aleaching 3aleaves 3alysimeters 3anitrogen 3aparticle size 3aplanting 3asandy loam soils 3asodium nitrate 3asoil texture 3asplit application 3asugars 3atotal nitrogen 3aurea 3awater solubility1 aLilly, J.

Additionally, the effects of these nanomaterials on the mortality and swimming behaviour of the nauplius larvae (nauplii) of the same organism were determined after 24 and 48 h. The data indicate that nCB is more effective as a potential antisettlement agent than single-layer GO; moreover, nCB did not show any adverse effects on the larvae. The swimming behaviour of II stage nauplii of A. amphitrite exposed to a suspension of nCB was inhibited only at very high nCB concentrations (≥0.5 mg/mL). Single-layer GO, on the contrary, showed lower antisettlement effects and was more active in altering the survival and inhibiting the swimming behaviour of the nauplii. An indication of the toxic or non-toxic mechanisms of the antisettlement properties of both of these nanomaterials is provided by the reversibility of the antisettlement activity. In conclusion, we propose nCB as an innovative antifouling nanomaterial that shows low toxicity towards the model organism (crustaceans) used in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBalanus amphitrite 3achemistry 3agraphene 3amortality 3ananomaterials 3anauplii 3aswimming 3atoxicity 0aAmphibalanus amphitrite 0aantifouling 0ananotoxicity 0ananomaterials 0anano carbon black 0asingle-layer graphene oxide1 aSepčič, Kristina1 aPiazza, Veronica1 aGambardella, Chiara1 aGaraventa, Francesca1 aDrobne, Damjana1 aFaimali, Marco0 tChemistry in ecology.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 29, no. 7 p.643-652dTaylor & Francisx1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2013.8175633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245008500212300001800297520163400315592002801949596003901977650002302016650001602039650001302055650001402068650002002082650001202102650001102114650001802125650003502143650002002178650001502198650002002213650000902233700006502242700001802307700005402325773013002379856008302509852000902592655001202601IND60757076420221121020134.0220818e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075707642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-021-02589-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRathnayake, I.

The free metal content of each medium was also determined using Visual MINTEQ version 3.1 to compare the bioassays. Four microalgal isolates were identified as Desmodesmus sp-I, Desmodesmus sp-II, Coelastrella sp., and Chlorella vulgaris. The present work demonstrated that the microalgal media components have a profound effect on the bioavailability of the metals in the media, so that the bioassay results may vary depending on the growth medium used in the experiments. Furthermore, the free metal contents in each media varied depending on the concentrations of metals added. The tolerance of microalgae evaluated as 50% effective concentration (EC₅₀) of metals differed significantly (p < 0.05) depending on the growth medium used and also varied between the species of the same genus. Desmodesmus sp-I showed high sensitivity to Cd (EC₅₀ 0.220 ± 0.011 mg L⁻¹) and Zn (EC₅₀ 0.464 ± 0.065 mg L⁻¹), whereas Desmodesmus sp-II showed high sensitivity to Cu (EC₅₀ 0.098 ± 0.002 mg L⁻¹) when grown in Test Medium 1 (TM1). The Chlorella vulgaris strain was found to be the most resistant microalga among the four isolates tested in this study. This study has significant implications for the risk assessment of these metals using algal bioassays.  aPublisher supplied data  aUPScUniversity of South Australia 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aDesmodesmus 3aalgology 3abioassays 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acopper 3aculture media 3amedian effective concentration 3ametal tolerance 3amicroalgae 3arisk assessment 3azinc1 aMegharaj, Mallavarapu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6230-518X1 aBeer, Michael1 aNaidu, R.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5529-86900 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 Dec., v. 33, no. 6 p.3683-3695dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02589-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03319naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245007800160300001600238520228000254592002802534650001402562650001402576650002602590650001002616650001002626650001702636650001402653650001402667650001402681650000902695650001902704650002202723700002402745773009602769856007102865852000902936655001202945IND60518807220221119031327.0160419e198802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051880722DNAL7 a10.2307/19431672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolbrook, Sally J.14aThe Combined Effects of Predation Risk and Food Reward on Patch Selection  ap. 125-134.  aExperiments were performed to examine the effects of predation risk on selection of food patches by a mobile forager, young black surfperch (Embiotoca jacksoni). The goals were to investigate (1) how predation risk affected relative selectivity among patches that differed in density of food, and (2) whether the forager's response depended on how variations in food level and predation risk were encountered. In the experiments, density of food (crustaceans on algae) was manipulated among spatially uniform patches of a foliose alga. Safety of the forager was varied by manipulating the presence in patches of kelp bass (Paralabrax clathratus), a principal predator of young surfperch. Patch choice was determined for an array of situations where food and risk were varied separately and together in space and time. The response of foragers to variations in food level and risk depended upon the specific manner in which the factors were encountered. When patches with a high food level contained a predator, foragers shunned the risky food—rich areas for safe food—poor patches. When food was equal between safe and risky patches, the degree to which patches with a predator were avoided remained constant over a range of absolute food densities. By constrast, selectivity between patches of differet food densities was dampened when all available patches contained a predator. Finally, predators enhanced relative selectivity for food—rich areas when foragers had simultaneous access to the complete combination of variation in rish and food level. Heightened selectivity in the presence of predators resulted from two hierarchical responses: foragers always took less risk to feed in the food—poor patch, and, when the difference in comparable value of available food patches was sufficiently great, they took more risk to eat where the density of food was higher. Overall, these results indicate that juvenile black surfperch possess an array of responses to food and predators, which together may act to minimize the sublethal effect of predators on feeding at a minimal increase in probability of death. Such plasticity may be a general characteristic of foragers that experience variation in food and risk at several spatial scales and temporal combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aEmbiotoca 3aParalabrax clathratus 3aalgae 3adeath 3afood choices 3ajuveniles 3apredation 3apredators 3arisk 3aspace and time 3asublethal effects1 aSchmitt, Russell J.0 tEcology.g1988 Feb., v. 69, no. 1 p.125-134dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19431673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100007300139245007400212300001600286500001400302500002000316520157500336592002801911596007401939596007702013596006002090596004602150596006102196596009302257650000802350650001602358650001602374650001402390650001202404650001302416650001602429650002002445650003102465650001302496650001002509650000902519650001602528650001902544650001902563650002502582650001002607650002602617650001502643700006602658773012402724856007302848852000902921655001202930IND60700558520221123021726.0200701e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070055852DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.131012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez‐García, Jaime F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1516-034110aShedding light on the chromatin changes that modulate shade responses  ap. 407-417.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPerception of vegetation proximity or plant shade informs of potential competition for resources by the neighboring vegetation. As vegetation proximity impacts on both light quantity and quality, perception of this cue by plant photoreceptors reprograms development to result in responses that allow plants to compete with the neighboring vegetation. Developmental reprogramming involves massive and rapid changes in gene expression, with the concerted action of photoreceptors and downstream transcription factors. Changes in gene expression can be modulated by epigenetic processes that alter chromatin compaction, influencing the accessibility and binding of transcription factors to regulatory elements in the DNA. However, little is known about the epigenetic regulation of plant responses to the proximity of other plants. In this manuscript, we review what is known about plant shade effects on chromatin changes at the cytological level, that is, changes in nuclear morphology and high order chromatin density. We address which are the specific histone post‐transcriptional modifications that have been associated with changes in shade‐regulated gene expression, such as histone acetylation and histone methylation. Furthermore, we explore the possible mechanisms that integrate shade signaling components and chromatin remodelers to settle epigenetic marks at specific loci. This review aims to be a starting point to understand how a specific environmental cue, plant shade, integrates with chromatin dynamics to implement the proper acclimation responses.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017‐SGR710cAgència de Gestió d'Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca  aMarie Skłodowska‐Curie grant agreement No 797473cEuropean Commission  aCA16212cEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology  aCERCA ProgrammecGeneralitat de Catalunya  aBIO2017‐85316‐RcMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación  a“Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of ExcellencecMinisterio de Ciencia e Innovación 3aDNA 3aacclimation 3aacetylation 3achromatin 3adensity 3adynamics 3aepigenetics 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahistones 3alight 3aloci 3amethylation 3aphotoreceptors 3aplant response 3aregulatory sequences 3ashade 3atranscription factors 3avegetation1 aMoreno‐Romero, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7352-15070 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 July, v. 169, no. 3 p.407-417dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245016000170520137800330592002801708650002201736650002301758650002701781650001901808650001801827650001601845650001401861650001101875650001501886650001801901650003101919650002501950650003301975650002002008651001002028653004502038653003402083653001902117653001802136653002902154700001702183700001502200700001102215700001802226700001302244700001702257773011902274856008802393852000902481655001202490IND60781363420221120181038.0220824e20221010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078136342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1568062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, BingJun10aSpatial distribution and risk assessment of 11 organophosphate flame retardants in soils from different regions of agricultural farmlands in mainland China  aThe occurrence and distribution of organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) in nationwide farmland soils of mainland China are rarely measured. The current study was the first to collect 325 farmland soil samples from 109 cities throughout mainland China. Ten organophosphate esters (OPEs), including alkyl-OPEs, Cl-OPEs, and aryl-OPEs, together with an organophosphate intermediates (TPPO), were determined. The results indicated that ΣOPFRs ranged from 2.41 ng/g to 35.8 ng/g dry weight (dw), and ΣOPFRs in northeastern and southern China were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in northwestern and central China. Alkyl-OPEs and Cl-OPEs served as the main components of OPEs, and the novel aryl-OPEs showed the highest detection frequency (> 92 %). Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to identify the different sources of OPEs, in which atmospheric deposition, irrigation, or direct release of plastic mulch acted as the main input routes in farmland soils. The potential risks of OPFRs were assessed through soil ingestion exposure and ecotoxicological impacts. Our results showed that direct exposure to farmland soils had no high risks to the human body and ecological environments. This study provides new evidence for further understanding the spatial distributions and contamination status of OPFRs in farmland soils throughout mainland China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3aatmospheric deposition 3adirect contact 3aecotoxicology 3aenvironment 3ageophagia 3ahumans 3airrigation 3aoral exposure 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aplastic film mulches 3aprincipal component analysis 3arisk assessment 3aChina 0aOrganophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) 0aOrganophosphate esters (OPEs) 0aFarmland soils 0aDistributions 0aExposure risk assessment1 aChen, LiYuan1 aLi, Yujun,1 aYu, Lu1 aZhang, JiaoDi1 aTAO, Shu1 aLiu, Wenxin,0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Oct. 10, v. 842 p.156806-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1568063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245015300165300001400318500002000332520175100352592002802103650002302131650001202154650002002166650001702186650001502203650002202218650001502240650001502255650002302270650002202293650002102315650001202336650002702348650000902375650001402384650001902398650001002417650001902427700001902446700001702465700002502482700002002507700002302527773010102550856007902651852000902730655001202739IND60572032720221121072457.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057203272DNAL7 a10.1111/1442-1984.121212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSetsuko, Suzuki10aGenetic variation of pantropical Terminalia catappa plants with sea‐drifted seeds in the Bonin Islands: suggestions for transplantation guidelines  ap. 13-24.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Bonin Islands are endowed with endemic species. However, these species are at risk of extinction because of the exuberance of invasive alien plants. Therefore, native plant species should be revegetated after eradicating alien plants. We investigated the genetic variation of Terminalia catappa populations in the Bonin Islands by using nuclear (n) microsatellites (simple sequence repeats [SSRs]) and chloroplast (cp) DNA. No significant differences were observed in the genetic diversity of nSSRs among 22 populations. However, recent bottlenecks were detected in three populations on the Chichijima Island group. nSSR variation and cpDNA haplotypes suggested the presence of two genetically distinct groups in the Mukojima and Chichijima Island groups and the Hahajima Island group. A similar genetic structure was observed in plants and animals in the Bonin Islands. Populations on the three islands, which were separated from other islands in each island group when the water depth was 50‐m lower than the present level, were dominated by unique nSSRs clusters, suggesting that historical changes in island connections during the Pleistocene era affected genetic substructuring. These results suggested that different factors contributed to the genetic structure of T. catappa on different geographic scales. At the whole‐island level, the genetic structure was determined by long‐distance seed dispersal by ocean currents. At the island‐group level, the genetic structure was determined by historical changes in island connections caused by changes in the sea level due to glacial–interglacial transition. These findings would help in establishing transplantation zone borders for revegetating T. catappa on the Bonin Islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTerminalia catappa 3aanimals 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplasts 3aextinction 3agenetic variation 3aguidelines 3ahaplotypes 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arisk 3asea level 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3awater currents1 aOhtani, Masato1 aSugai, Kyoko1 aNagamitsu, Teruyoshi1 aKato, Hidetoshi1 aYoshimaru, Hiroshi0 tPlant species biology.g2017 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.13-24dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0913-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1442-1984.121213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012500166300001600291520098500307592002801292650002201320650001201342650001901354650003801373650001301411650000901424650002101433650002601454650002001480650001301500650001401513650001801527700002301545700002101568700002001589773013501609856008101744852000901825655001201834IND60133484120221118004415.0151027e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013348412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-015-2645-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoan, Chi Diem10aEvaluating the Oil-Gelling Properties of Natural Waxes in Rice Bran Oil: Rheological, Thermal, and Microstructural Study  ap. 801-811.  aThe main objective of this research was to enhance the understanding of the oil-structuring properties of natural waxes. A number of natural food-grade waxes were evaluated for their oil-gelling properties using a combination of techniques, including rheology, differential scanning calorimetry, and polarized light microscopy. Based on the rheological measurements (oscillatory, flow, and thixotropic behavior), we found that rice bran wax, carnauba Brazilian wax and fruit wax showed weak gelling behavior in rice bran oil (prepared at concentrations as high as 5 % w/w), exhibiting relative low elastic moduli that displayed a high frequency dependency. On the contrary, carnauba wild wax, berry wax, candelilla wax, beeswax, and sunflower wax were efficient oleogelators forming strong gels at concentration of <2 % w/w. We attempt to explain these observed differences in gelling behavior by crystal morphology, network formation, and the final amount of crystalline phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3abeeswax 3acandelilla wax 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agelation 3agels 3alight microscopy 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolarized light 3arheology 3arice bran 3arice bran oil1 aVan de Walle, Davy1 aDewettinck, Koen1 aPatel, Ashok R.0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2015 June, v. 92, no. 6 p.801-811dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-015-2645-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01933naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001300167245007500180300001600255500000900271520092200280592002801202650001801230650002401248650001301272650001601285650001001301650001201311650001501323650001301338700001701351773012101368852000901489856009701498655001201595991562594170742620221119143725.0191122e197805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891020292DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1978.00021962007000030019x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, S.12aA Procedure for Determining Numbers of Experimental and Sampling Units  ap. 441-444.  aepub  aResearchers often sample experimental units to measure certain characteristics, for example, percent protein in grain or percent sucrose in plant roots. Thus, in planning such experiments, one of the first questions encountered is how many samples and replications should be used. A procedure is suggested for using the non-central F distribution to determine the number of replications and samples needed per experimental unit. The method requires the specification of the treatment effects to be detected, the probability of type I and type II errors, and an estimate of population variance. Sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) trials, employing sampling for sucrose content of roots, are used to illustrate the procedure in completely randomized, randomized complete blocks, latin square, and split-plot designs. It is shown that fewer samples and/or replications are required when orthogonal comparisons can be defined.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris 3aexperimental design 3aplanning 3aprobability 3aroots 3asucrose 3asugar beet 3avariance1 aHills, F.

At these sites, 44% of the males and 25% of the females resident in one year returned in one or more subsequent years. There were more nests built, eggs laid, eggs hatched, and young fledged in territories of returning males in this polygynous species than in territories of males that did not return in subsequent years (P < .04). For females that returned, the number of eggs hatched, young fledged, young fledged on last nest attempt, and young fledged per egg laid were higher than for females that did not return (P < .02). Discriminant function analysis and data from 1982—1984 were used to predict correctly the return behavior of 30 to 42 individuals (sexes combined) in 1985, based on their reproductive success (RS) in 1984 (P < .01). Using data on RS and return rate for all years, the best single—variable model for males based on the number of young fledged from each territory classified correctly 59 of 85 individuals (69%) as returning or not (P < .005). The best single—variable model for females based on the number of yound fledged on their last nest attempt classified correctly 61 of 86 individuals (71%; P < .005). Using all data for 1982—1985, sex—specific models that included only whether an individual fledged one or more young classified correctly the same proportion as the best single—variable models above. However, among males that fledged one or more young, those that returned had fledged significantly more young the previous year than those that did not return (P < 0.5). Not all individuals that failed to return were dead, because five individuals that did not return to our study sites were captured in a subsequent year at another site. We concluded that male and female Bobolinks used information on their breeding success in one year to influence their choice of breeding site in the next year.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding sites 3adata analysis 3adiscriminant analysis 3aeggs 3afemales 3amales 3amodels 3anests 3apolygyny 3areproductive success 3aNew York1 aBollinger, Eric K.0 tEcology.g1988 Feb., v. 69, no. 1 p.96-103dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19431643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02603naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245006900160300001800229500001900247520163100266592002801897650001701925650001601942650001801958650001301976650001501989650001602004650001602020700002402036773013402060856007402194852000902268655001202277IND60661426520221119203542.0190829e20140127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066142652DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cs60171d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNienhaus, Karin10aFluorescent proteins for live-cell imaging with super-resolution  ap. 1088-1106.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFluorescent proteins (FPs) from the GFP family have become indispensable as marker tools for imaging live cells, tissues and entire organisms. A wide variety of these proteins have been isolated from natural sources and engineered to optimize their properties as genetically encoded markers. Here we review recent developments in this field. A special focus is placed on photoactivatable FPs, for which the fluorescence emission can be controlled by light irradiation at specific wavelengths. They enable regional optical marking in pulse-chase experiments on live cells and tissues, and they are essential marker tools for live-cell optical imaging with super-resolution. Photoconvertible FPs, which can be activated irreversibly via a photo-induced chemical reaction that either turns on their emission or changes their emission wavelength, are excellent markers for localization-based super-resolution microscopy (e.g., PALM). Patterned illumination microscopy (e.g., RESOLFT), however, requires markers that can be reversibly photoactivated many times. Photoswitchable FPs can be toggled repeatedly between a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent state by means of a light-induced chromophore isomerization coupled to a protonation reaction. We discuss the mechanistic origins of the effect and illustrate how photoswitchable FPs are employed in RESOLFT imaging. For this purpose, special FP variants with low switching fatigue have been introduced in recent years. Despite nearly two decades of FP engineering by many laboratories, there is still room for further improvement of these important markers for live cell imaging.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluorescence 3airradiation 3aisomerization 3alighting 3amicroscopy 3aprotonation 3awavelengths1 aUlrich Nienhaus, G.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2014 Jan. 27, v. 43, no. 4 p.1088-1106dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cs60171d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03583naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245010800176500001400284520191200298592002802210650001302238650001702251650001602268650001202284650001502296650001102311650002702322650002002349650002802369650003402397650002702431650001302458650000902471650002302480650002602503650001102529650001902540650002502559650001802584653003902602653002802641653001502669653002802684653001402712653002402726700005702750700001302807700001902820773009102839856009002930852000903020655001203029IND60718481520221122113402.0210108e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071848152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Chao-Chin10aLong-term operation of bio-catalyzed cathodes within continuous flow membrane-less microbial fuel cells  aNAL-light  aMicroorganisms were observed to facilitate cathodic oxygen reduction and enhance cathode performance of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, the long-term activity and stability of bio-catalyzed cathode needs to be explored. This study evaluated the long-term performance of bio-catalyzed cathode and iron(II) phthalocyanine (FePc)-catalyzed cathode MFCs through effluent water quality, electricity production and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis under different scenarios, including conventional wastewater treatment and energy harvesting using a power management system (PMS). During the continuous operation, both systems demonstrated high chemical oxygen demand and ammonium removal, but bio-catalyzed cathode MFCs could achieve significantly better total nitrogen removal than FePc-catalyzed cathode MFCs. The FePc-coated cathode showed constant cathode potential during the entire operation period, but the biocathode showed varied but step-wise increased cathode potential to achieve more than 500 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode, likely due to the gradual enrichment of biocathode biofilm. EIS analysis revealed that biocathode had higher ohmic resistance than bare carbon felt cathode but the microbial biofilm could largely decrease polarization resistance of cathode material. Microbial community analysis has shown the presence of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria in the bio-catalyzed cathode biofilm. When connecting PMS, both bio-catalyzed cathode and FePc-catalyzed cathode MFCs successfully charged a capacitor, but the bio-catalyzed cathode MFC voltage significantly dropped to less than 100 mV after charging for 91 h, and gradually recovered when disconnecting PMS. This study has demonstrated the potential application of oxygen reduction bio-catalyzed cathode MFCs for continuous wastewater treatment and energy harvesting for long period of time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3abiocatalysis 3abiocathodes 3abiofilm 3acapacitors 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenitrification 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectricity generation 3ahydrogen 3airon 3amanagement systems 3amicrobial communities 3aoxygen 3atotal nitrogen 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 0aMembrane-less microbial fuel cells 0aIron(II) phthalocyanine 0aBiocathode 0aPower management system 0aImpedance 0aMicrobial community1 aLi, Shiue-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3883-60871 aHu, Anyi1 aYu, Chang-Ping0 tChemosphere.g2021 Mar., v. 266 p.129059-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02519naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013300163300001600296520129900312592002801611650001901639650002301658650001801681650001101699650002101710650002101731650001501752650001501767650001601782651001201798651002001810700002001830700002001850700002001870700002501890773012201915856007502037852000902112655001202121IND60534695520170606000000.0160803e20130102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053469552DNAL7 a10.1021/es302475v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanhatalo, Jarno P.10aProbabilistic Ecosystem Model for Predicting the Nutrient Concentrations in the Gulf of Finland under Diverse Management Actions  ap. 334-341.  aMany countries define legislative targets for the ecological status of aquatic ecosystems. Fulfilling these legally binding targets requires often large scale and expensive management actions. The expected benefits from alternative actions are commonly compared with deterministic ecosystem models. However, from a practical management point of view the uncertainty in model predictions and the probability to achieve the targets are as essential as the point estimates provided by the deterministic models. For this reason, we extend a deterministic ecosystem model into a probabilistic form. We use the model for predicting the probability to achieve the targets set by EU’s Water Framework Directive (WFD) in Finnish coastal waters in the Gulf of Finland, one of the most eutrophicated areas of the Baltic Sea, under alternative management scenarios. Our results show that the probability to reach the WFD objectives for total phosphorus is generally less than or equal to 0.51 in all areas. However, for total nitrogen the probability varies substantially as it is practically zero in the western areas but almost 0.80 or higher in the eastern areas. It seems that especially with phosphorus, international co-operation is needed in order for Finland to fulfill the objectives of the WFD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acoastal water 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3auncertainty 3aFinland 3aGulf of Finland1 aTuomi, Laura M.1 aInkala, Arto T.1 aHelle, S.

Here, metal-free modified g-C₃N₄ was prepared and used to inactivate two typical bacteria (namely, Gram-positive E. coli and Gram-negative S. aureus) in water under visible light from a comparative perspective. These two bacteria could be inactivated in the presence of modified g-C₃N₄ within 6 h of visible light, but their inactivation kinetics were quite different. E. coli were inactivated slowly in the early disinfection stage and rapidly in the later disinfection stage, whereas S. aureus were inactivated steadily during the entire disinfection process. Moreover, the impacts of important water parameters (pH, salt, temperature, and water matrix) on photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli and S. aureus were also distinct. In addition, scavenger experiments indicated that superoxide radicals played the most important role in E. coli inactivation, while both superoxide and hydroxyl radicals were important for S. aureus inactivation. Quantitative changes in fatty acids, potassium ions, proteins and DNA of the bacterial suspensions suggested that the higher resistance of E. coli in the early inactivation stage could be originated from the difference in the phospholipid repair system in cell membrane structures. This study can provide new insights into research and development of a safe and effective disinfection technology for drinking water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3adisinfection 3alight 3apH 3aphospholipids 3aphotocatalysis 3apotassium 3aresearch and development 3atemperature 0aMetal-free modified carbon nitride 0aWater quality impact 0aInactivation mechanism1 aSu, Ziying1 aLi, Yi1 aZhang, Chi0 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 265 p.129060-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1290603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245014500179300001600324520176800340592002802108650002302136650001902159650001802178650001802196650002202214650001002236650002102246650005002267650001102317650001702328650002402345650002302369650002602392650002502418653000802443653002402451653001902475653001502494653001202509653001202521700002602533700002302559700002802582700002802610773010502638856008602743852000902829655001202838IND60644091720221119051939.0200210e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064409172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunar, Andrés Mauricio10aAssessing the large-scale variation of heat budget in poorly gauged watershed-shallow lake system using a novel integrated modeling approach  ap. 244-256.  aAssessment of large-scale temperature dynamics and heat fluxes in shallow lakes requires comprehensive modeling capabilities to simulate water interactions, the processes related to the heat budget, and their driving forces. In this study, we investigated the spatial and temporal variations in water-surface temperature (WST) and surface heat fluxes for the period between January 2001 and December 2010 in Lake Mirim, a large (surface area ca. 4000 km²) shallow lake on the Brazil-Uruguay border. The aquatic ecosystem was examined using in-situ WST measurements, MODIS land surface temperature (M*D11A1 LST) products, and a coupling between a large-scale hydrologic model (MGB-IPH) and a hydrodynamic/water quality model (IPH-ECO). The WST values estimated by the hydrodynamic model were consistent with measured in-situ data and MODIS-derived WST, using both daytime and nighttime time series (R² = 0.88; Bias = 1.45 °C; RMSE = 2.16 °C; ENS = 0.77). Our findings also revealed that the dominant heat fluxes in the lake are the atmospheric longwave radiation (annual mean = 303.38 W m⁻²), water longwave radiation (annual mean = 336.01 W m⁻²), and the latent heat flux (annual mean = 51.14 W m⁻²). Additionally, the heat flux from the river inflows contribute minimally to the overall seasonal heat budget in the lake, being the Cebollati river the main contributor (annual average = 4.63 W m⁻²). Coupled large-scale hydrological and hydrodynamic models will benefit future modeling efforts by providing an effective management tool to study the effect of case scenarios (e.g., climate change) on temperature dynamics, heat fluxes, and physical and ecological processes in these ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aclimate change 3aheat transfer 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrologic models 3alakes 3alatent heat flux 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3arivers 3asurface area 3asurface temperature 3atemporal variation 3aterrestrial radiation 3atime series analysis 0aWST 0aSurface heat budget 0aRemote sensing 0aLake Mirim 0aMBG-IPH 0aIPH-ECO1 aCavalcanti, J.

A two-day nitrogen-starved cells (-N2) were able to accumulate the maximum amount of lipid (39.93 ± 0.44%) without affecting the biomass yield (2.15 ± 0.04 g L⁻¹). During nitrogen (-N) and phosphorus (-P) starvation, photosynthetically fixed carbon pool was diverted to lipid biosynthesis. Pearson’s correlation analysis suggested that stress-induced lipid accumulation is associated with an increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. The ROS fluorescence intensity was highest in -N2 cultures (17,051.49 ± 93.15 a.u.), suggesting highly oxidative stress-tolerant cells. A high degree of fatty acid saturation was obtained under nitrogen starvation as compared to other culture conditions. Biodiesel properties such as cetane number, saponification number, and iodine value improved under nitrogen starvation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetradesmus 3aalgology 3abiodiesel 3abiomass production 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon sinks 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3afluorescence 3aiodine value 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3areactive oxygen species 3asaponification number 3astarvation1 aBera, Sounak1 aMohanty, Kaustubha1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9810-95620 tJournal of applied phycology.g2021 Dec., v. 33, no. 6 p.3617-3635dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870059x0921-89717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-021-02614-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245005600158300001600214500001400230500002000244520111300264592002801377650002201405650001601427650001801443650001701461650001501478650001201493650002601505650002101531650002101552650001801573650002101591650001001612650001101622650001001633650002201643650002301665650001401688650001901702773012401721856007301845852000901918655001201927IND60700559020221122223258.0200701e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070055902DNAL7 a10.1111/ppl.131042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarré, Eva M.14aThe brown clock: circadian rhythms in stramenopiles  ap. 430-441.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aCircadian clocks allow organisms to anticipate environmental changes associated with the diurnal light/dark cycle. Circadian oscillators have been described in plants and green algae, cyanobacteria, animals and fungi, however, little is known about the circadian clocks of photosynthetic eukaryotes outside the green lineage. Stramenopiles are a diverse group of secondary endosymbionts whose plastid originated from a red alga. Photosynthetic stramenopiles, which include diatoms and brown algae, play key roles in biogeochemical cycles and are important components of marine ecosystems. Genome annotation efforts indicated the presence of a novel type of oscillator in these organisms and the first circadian clock component in a stramenopile has been recently discovered. This review summarizes the phenotypic characterization of circadian rhythms in stramenopiles and current efforts to determine the mechanisms of this ‘brown clock’. The elucidation of this brown clock will enable a deeper understanding of the role of self‐sustained oscillations in the adaptation to life in marine environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aChlorophyta 3aCyanobacteria 3aPhaeophyceae 3aRhodophyta 3aanimals 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acircadian clocks 3acircadian rhythm 3aendosymbionts 3aeukaryotic cells 3afungi 3agenome 3alight 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine environment 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2020 July, v. 169, no. 3 p.430-441dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl52817x0031-93177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppl.131043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010300167300001500270520127700285592002801562650004401590650002201634650001201656650001601668650001101684650002201695650001401717650003301731650002101764650001401785650001901799650004401818650001701862650001301879650002001892650002201912650003701934700002701971700002001998700002102018773009502039856008502134852000902219655001202228IND60087838420221120162200.0141102e20110422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008783842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.01.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Huihua10aPreparation and characterization of sorbitol modified nanoclay with high amylose bionanocomposites  ap. 97-104.  aWe investigate the influence of sorbitol and natural Na⁺-montmorillonite (nanoclay) loading on the characteristic of high amylose nanocomposites and the distribution of nanoclay after extrusion processing. The innovative aspect is the modification of the nanoclay using the sorbitol plasticizer, and as shown in the XRD results, good intercalated/exfoliated morphology had been achieved in all nanocomposites. The expansion of nanoclay gallery relates to sorbitol loading and nanoclay concentration. Evidence of newly formed hydrogen bonds, due to plasticizer and nanoclay interaction, and also the ternary interaction among starch/sorbitol/nanoclay were taken from peaks associated with –OH stretching located at 3300cm⁻¹ and 999cm⁻¹ from the FTIR spectra. Further, ¹³C NMR spectra demonstrated that the sorbitol mobility was significantly lowered with 1% nanoclay and overall, sorbitol mobility was lower than that of starch chains. TEM directly supported the presence of exfoliated and intercalated/exfoliated morphologies. Furthermore, calorimetric analysis revealed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) decreased with increasing sorbitol content and the presence of nanoclay improved the thermal stability and crystallinity of corresponding samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aamylose 3acalorimetry 3acarbon 3acrystal structure 3aextrusion 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananoclays 3ananocomposites 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplasticizers 3asorbitol 3astable isotopes 3athermal stability 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aChaudhary, Deeptangshu1 aYusa, Shin-ichi1 aTadé, Moses O.,0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Apr. 22, v. 85, no. 1 p.97-104dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.01.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01802naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010100171300001600272520077500288592002801063650002201091650001301113650001901126650001101145650001601156650002401172650001401196650001001210650001701220700002701237773011001264856008101374852000901455655001201464IND60574384820221122225453.0170726e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057438482DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255160700762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal’nikova, E.

The data on population dynamics and the degree of parasite infestation in pupae of the pine looper Bupalus piniarius L. and fir looper Ectropis (=Boarmia) bistortata Gz are used to verify the model. The results of field studies apparently are in good agreement with the model of highly inertial regulation in the “phytophage–entomophage” system. The model that is proposed explains the decisive roles of different factors (entomophages, predators, or diseases) in the population dynamics of phytophages under different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBupalus piniarius 3aEctropis 3aforest insects 3amodels 3aparasitoses 3apopulation dynamics 3apredators 3apupae 3areproduction1 aSukhovol’skii, V.

Gabapentin may have advantages over other analgesics because of its broad therapeutic range with limited adverse effects and wide availability as an oral formulation. This study determined the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin in Caribbean flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber ruber) after a single-dose oral administration of either 15 mg/kg (n = 6) or 25 mg/kg (n = 6). Plasma gabapentin concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using noncompartmental methods. Respectively for the 15 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg dose, mean peak plasma concentration (Cₘₐₓ) was (mean ± pseudo SD) 13.23 ± 1.47 and 24.48 ± 5.81 μg/ml; mean time to peak plasma concentration (Tₘₐₓ) was 0.50 ± 0.24 and 0.56 ± 0.28 hr; mean area under the curve (AUC) was 76.0 ± 26.3 and 114.7 ± 27.5 hr·μg/ml; and mean terminal half-life (T₁/₂) was 3.39 ± 0.90 and 4.46 ± 1.12 hr. Based on the results of this study, gabapentin dosed at 25 mg/kg orally in most Caribbean flamingos is likely to maintain plasma concentrations above the therapeutic range established for humans for approximately 12 hr.  aPublisher supplied data 3apain 3ahumans 3apharmacokinetics 3aPhoenicopterus ruber 3amass spectrometry 3aanalgesics 3aoral administration 3aliquid chromatography 3aadverse effects 3aanticonvulsants 3ahalf life 3aCaribbean 0aCaribbean flamingo 0aPhoenicopterus ruber ruber 0adrug therapy 0aAnalgesia 0agabapentin 0aavian1 aCarpenter, James W.1 aMagnin, Geraldine C.1 aKuKanich, Butch0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2018 Sept., v. 49, no. 3 p.609-616dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2017-0245.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245020000168300001100368520197700379592002802356650002802384650002502412650001202437650001402449650001202463650002402475650001602499650002802515650001602543650001202559650001602571650001402587650002102601650001602622650001902638650001402657650001902671650001302690700002102703700001902724700002002743700002102763700002102784773013202805856008202937852000903019655001203028IND60765708020221117034648.0220318e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076570802DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437220101982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSergienko, O. V.10aMutation of the ARA7/AtRabF2b Gene, That Increases the Content of the Ara7 Protein Regulating Endocytic Trafficking Pathways, Improves Salt Tolerance of the Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh Plants  ap. 11.  aThe relationship between the endocytosis, ion homeostasis, and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana was studied using mutant plants with the insertion in the ARA7/AtRabF (AT4G19640) gene, encoding a small Rab5 GTPase that represents one of the key regulators of the vesicular transport. This mutation is characterized by an increased expression of the AtARA7 protein. A 14-nucleotide deletion in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and the loss of the first three nucleotides at the 5'-end of mRNA were revealed in the mutant allele. Though these sequence changes slightly decreased the relative level of ARA7 transcripts in leaves of mutant plants under normal conditions, an increased content of the corresponding ARA7 protein in leaves was observed. This, in turn, resulted in significant phenotypic changes in plants grown on a NaCl-containing growth media. Electron microscopy studies revealed some changes on ultrastructural level in the root cells of mutant plants. The most significant differences between the mutant and wild-type (WT) plants included the presence of electron dense deposits on the tonoplast and increase in (a) the degree of vacuolization and vesiculation of the cytosol, (b) the content of fusing microvacuoles, and (c) the content of multivesicular bodies and autophagic structures that indicated changes in the endocytosis pathway and the vacuole formation dynamics. At the whole plant level, the mutant phenotype was characterized by a positive response of mutant plants to a long-term salt stress compared to WT plants. Mutant plants also had an increased mass of roots and leaves, heightened content of K⁺, and decreased average content of Na⁺. This indicates that mutants developed a higher degree of salt tolerance when compared to WT plants. Mutation-induced changes in the cell ultrastructure probably reflect perturbations in vesicular transport and autophagy resulting in changes in ion homeostasis and salt tolerance of plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5' untranslated regions 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aalleles 3aautophagy 3acytosol 3aelectron microscopy 3aendocytosis 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahomeostasis 3amutants 3anucleotides 3aphenotype 3aplant physiology 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3atonoplast 3aultrastructure 3avacuoles1 aKhalilova, L.

We investigated the impact of the spatial heterogeneity on soil properties and plant communities caused by the hummocks on the Tibetan Plateau. The results indicated alpine hummocks created higher plant diversity and soil fertile island patterns under Kobresia Genus communities. Vegetation height, cover, above-ground and underground biomass, species richness and diversity at the top of well-developed hummocks were the significantly higher than those in the inter-hummocks and surrounding flat ground. The soil organic carbon content in surface soil layer (0-50 cm) at the hummock top was 154.6% and 172.3% higher than those in inter-hummock area and the flat ground, respectively. From the developing to well-developed stage, K. littledalei became the dominant population at hummock top instead of K. humilis, and fertile islands gradually formed with higher soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, lower soil moisture and wider soil temperature variation. RDA analysis further indicated the interactions of plant community succession and soil fertile island could create positive feedbacks to nutrient-rich patches.  aPublisher supplied data  aKFJ-STS-QYZD-075cThe Science & Technology Service Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences  aXDA20020401cThe Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a41201096cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41573070cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aSDS-QN-1308cState Key Laboratory of Scientific and Engineering Computing (CN) 3aKobresia 3abelowground biomass 3anutrient content 3aplant communities 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3aspatial variation 3aspecies richness 3atotal nitrogen 3avegetation 3aChina1 aWei, Da1 aYan, Yan1 aWu, Jianbo1 aWang, Xiaodan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1923-59050 tWetlands.g2020 Oct., v. 40, no. 5 p.1217-1227dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-020-01275-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009000167300001800257520079200275592002801067650001101095650002501106650001701131650001201148650001101160650003201171650001301203650001001216650001701226650002101243653002501264653002301289653001701312700001701329700001701346700001701363773011101380856005101491852000901542655001201551IND50075927320221122033720.0140410e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007592732DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2012.7253962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cunli12aA new cytotoxic steroidal saponin from the rhizomes and roots of Smilax scobinicaulis  ap. 1255-1260.  aA phytochemical investigation of the EtOH extract from the rhizomes and roots of Smilax scobinicaulis resulted in the isolation of a new isospirostanol-type steroidal saponin, namely (25 R)-5α-spirostan-3β,6β-diol 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4)-[α-L-arabinopyranosyl-(1 → 6)]-β-D-glucopyranoside (1), along with four known steroidal saponins (2–5).

Methyl bromide (MBr) was an effective preplanting soil broad‐spectrum biocide, but its use has been banned due to its role in depleting the ozone layer. As a result, sustainable alternative methods for controlling soilborne pathogens and pests are needed. Nitrous oxide (N₂O) emissions are of concern in crop production due to the role of N₂O as a greenhouse gas. Agricultural lands are known sources for emission of N₂O into the atmosphere. Emissions are related to many environmental factors as well as fertilization and fumigation practices. This study evaluated the influence of different alternatives to MBr on N₂O emissions throughout a tomato production season in two locations representative of southern and northern Florida. We evaluated eight soil management practices, including (a) untreated controls; (b) chemical soil fumigation; (c) anaerobic soil disinfestation using molasses (M) + composted poultry litter and (d and e) M + composted yard waste (CYW, at two rates); (f) Soil Symphony Amendment (SSA), a commercially available mix of microbes and nutrients; (g) CYW alone; and (h) CYW + SSA. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured throughout the cropping season. Emissions were highest on the day of planting (Day 21), ranging from 213 to 1,878 μg m–² h–¹, likely due to the release of N₂O that had accumulated under the totally impermeable film when it was punctured for planting. However, statistical significance varied between sites. Estimated cumulative emissions of N₂O throughout the production season ranged from 1.3 to 4.8 kg N₂O–N ha–¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocides 3adisinfestation 3aenvironmental quality 3agreenhouse gases 3ahorticulture 3amethyl bromide 3amolasses 3anitrous oxide 3aozonosphere 3aplasticulture 3apoultry manure 3araised beds 3asoil 3asoil fumigation 3atomatoes 3ayard wastes 3aFlorida1 aDi Gioia, Francesco1 aPaudel, Bodh1 aZhao, Xin1 aHong, Jason1 aPisani, Cristina1 aRosskopf, Erin1 aWilson, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0006-55280 tJournal of environmental quality.g2022 Mar., v. 51, no. 2 p.162-180dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.203243Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03819naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245015100204506007600355520174900431592002802180506003702208650001302245650002002258650001902278650002102297650002402318650001302342650000902355650001502364650002802379650002402407650001602431650002202447650001302469650002202482650002002504650001402524650001702538650001402555650000902569650001202578650001602590650001302606650001102619650002802630650002002658650001902678650001702697650001802714700002202732700002102754700002202775700001802797700002802815700002202843700001802865700001402883700001802897773012002915856007703035852000903112655001203121IND60677095220221207091812.0191122e20191107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067709522DNAL7 a10.3390/plants81104802doi7 aPMC69183382pmcid7 a317033262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiamat, Bushra 10aCalcium-Enriched Animal Manure Alleviates the Adverse Effects of Salt Stress on Growth, Physiology and Nutrients Homeostasis of <i>Zea mays L.</i>  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSoil salinity and sodicity are among the main problems for optimum crop production in areas where rainfall is not enough for leaching of salts out of the rooting zone. Application of organic and Ca-based amendments have the potential to increase crop yield and productivity under saline&ndash;alkaline soil environments. Based on this hypothesis, the present study was conducted to evaluate the potential of compost, Ca-based fertilizer industry waste (Ca-FW), and Ca-fortified compost (Ca-FC) to increase growth and yield of maize under saline&ndash;sodic soil conditions. Saline&ndash;sodic soil conditions with electrical conductivity (EC) levels (1.6, 5, and 10 dS m&minus;1) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) = 15, were developed by spiking soil with a solution containing NaCl, Na<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>, MgSO<inf>4</inf>, and CaCl<inf>2</inf>. Results showed that soil salinity and sodicity significantly reduced plant growth, yield, physiological, and nutrient uptake parameters. However, the application of Ca-FC caused a remarkable increase in the studied parameters of maize at EC levels of 1.6, 5, and 10 dS m&minus;1 as compared to the control. In addition, Ca-FC caused the maximum decrease in Na+/K+ ratio in shoot up to 85.1%, 71.79%, and 70.37% at EC levels of 1.6, 5, and 10 dS m&minus;1, respectively as compared to the control treatment. Moreover, nutrient uptake (NPK) was also significantly increased with the application of Ca-FC under normal as well as saline&ndash;sodic soil conditions. It is thus inferred that the application of Ca-FC could be an effective amendment to enhance growth, yield, physiology, and nutrient uptake in maize under saline&ndash;sodic soil conditions constituting the novelty of this work.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aadverse effects 3aanimal manures 3acalcium chloride 3acalcium fertilizers 3acomposts 3acorn 3acrop yield 3aelectrical conductivity 3afertilizer industry 3ahomeostasis 3aindustrial wastes 3aleaching 3amagnesium sulfate 3anutrient uptake 3anutrients 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3arain 3arooting 3asalt stress 3asodicity 3asodium 3asodium adsorption ratio 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3asoil quality 3asoil salinity1 aNaveed, Muhammad 1 aAhmad, Zulfiqar 1 aYaseen, Muhammad 1 aDitta, Allah 1 aMuṣṭafá, ʻAdnān,1 aRafique, Munazza 1 aBibi, Riffat 1 aSun, Nan 1 aXu, Minggang 0 tPlants.g2019 Nov. 07, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants81104803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100002200159245015400181300001600335520172000351592002802071650002302099650001102122650002002133650002002153650001402173650001202187650001002199650001502209650001602224650001402240650001702254650000902271650002202280650002302302650001702325650001602342650002002358650001102378653001602389653001202405653002102417653001702438653002302455653001502478700002502493700002202518700001802540700001502558773015602573856007502729852000902804655001202813IND60613667520221122052039.0180914e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061366752DNAL7 a10.1638/2017-0247.12doi4 azamd-49-03-22  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheldon, Julie D.10aReproductive hormone patterns in male and female cownose rays (rhinoptera bonasus) in an aquarium setting and correlation to ultrasonographic staging  ap. 638-647.  aReproductive management of cownose rays (Rhinoptera bonasus) under professional care plays an important role in conservation of the species, but hormone and ultrasonographic analyses of their 12-mo reproductive cycle have not been documented previously. Plasma reproductive hormone concentrations (17B-estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione) were measured monthly via radioimmunoassay for 1 yr in an aquarium-managed population of adult females (n = 15) and males (n = 5). Ultrasounds of the uterus were performed each month at the time of sample collection to identify gestation stage (0–5) based on a previously developed in-house staging system. Stages were correlated to hormone concentrations to track progression through pregnancy. Thirteen females were reproductively active, and each produced one pup in March–June, similar to timing for free-ranging populations. Female estradiol increased steadily throughout gestation from stages 0 to 5, while progesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione were increased only in early gestation (stages 1 and 2). Unlike month of year, gestation stage strongly predicted hormone concentration, but specific values to predict parturition date were not identified. Male testosterone and progesterone were higher in March–June (mating season) than July–January, while estradiol and androstenedione did not exhibit a seasonal pattern. Aquarium-managed cownose rays have similar reproductive patterns to what is reported in wild populations. Ultrasonographic monitoring with serial hormone analysis and accurate mating records will provide the most useful information for managing a reproductive population of cownose rays in an aquarium setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhinoptera bonasus 3aadults 3aandrostenedione 3abreeding season 3aestradiol 3afemales 3amales 3amonitoring 3aparturition 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone 3apups 3aradioimmunoassays 3aseasonal variation 3atestosterone 3aultrasonics 3aultrasonography 3auterus 0aCownose ray 0ahormone 0aradioimmunoassay 0areproduction 0aRhinoptera bonasus 0aultrasound1 aAllender, Matthew C.1 aGeorge, Robert H.1 aBulman, Frank1 aAbney, Kim0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2018 Sept., v. 49, no. 3 p.638-647dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2017-0247.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007900169300001600248520188700264592002802151650002302179650002302202650001702225650001802242650001402260650001302274650002602287650001402313650002502327650002502352651001102377700002202388773011002410856008102520852000902601655001202610IND60574385020221122225455.0170726e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057438502DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255160700522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarukshina, G. G.10aPopulation structure of common juniper in the Cis-Urals and Southern Urals  ap. 863-872.  aThe population structure of common juniper (Juniperus communis L.) growing in the Cis-Urals and Southern Urals has been studied using 17 morphological traits of generative and vegetative organs. A multivariate analysis of ten coenopopulations has recognized three phenotypically different local populations: Cis-Ural, forest Cis-Ural forest-steppe, and Southern Ural mountain populations. The Cis-Ural forest population is strictly associated with lowland pine forests of the northwestern part of the Bashkir Cis-Urals. The Cis-Ural forest-steppe population is located in the northwestern part of the Bashkir Cis-Urals and the southeastern part of the Udmurt Cis-Urals. The Southern Ural mountain population is located in the central part of the Southern Urals and is associated mainly with mountain pine and dark coniferous forests. The last population is divided into forest and forest-edge subpopulations; the first one is represented by typical undergrowth locations, whereas the second is associated with open steppelike slopes and forest edges. In general, based on morphological traits of generative organs, the revealed local subpopulations hold an intermediate position between the Eastern European and Siberian populations of common juniper. Based on the morphological traits of vegetative organs, Cis-Ural populations are considered related to the populations of the European part of Russia, whereas the mountain Southern Ural population resemble Siberian populations. Concerning morphological traits of generative organs, the intrapopulation phenotypic diversity of common juniper is higher for mountain habitats; in the case of vegetative organs, the maximum diversity is observed for lowland habitats. The character of phenotypic differentiation determines the need to conserve the gene pool of common juniper of the Cis-Urals and southern Urals on a population basis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuniperus communis 3aconiferous forests 3aedge effects 3aforest steppe 3agene pool 3ahabitats 3amultivariate analysis 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation structure 3aRussia1 aPutenikhin, V.

The area and yield data on all 66 tree species recorded in the SFI offer the opportunity to obtain the wood specific gravity values U (m³ ha–¹) for all these tree species. The conversion coefficients of yield to leaf phytomass per unit area (t m–³) and the projected specific leaf areas (SLAs) (cm² g–¹) are used to estimate the LAI. The obtained LAI values are similar to the average ground and remote-sensing estimates (the given review for July includes eighteen literature sources). The highest LAI values can be observed in the middle taiga subzone in the European part of Russia and in the Angara River regions. The LAI estimates may be used to compute the productivity of the forest ecosystems at different scales of analysis and to extrapolate the calibrated data acquired with remote control techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest inventory 3aforest management 3aforests 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3aphytomass 3aremote control 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3aspecific gravity 3ataiga 3atrees 3awood 3aRussia1 aZukert, N.

A common anti-predator defense strategy that increases immediate survival is autotomy—the voluntary release of body parts. This type of morphological damage is considered to impose future costs for reproduction and fitness. We tested an alternative hypothesis that animals are robust (able to withstand and overcome perturbations) to this type of damage and do not experience any fitness costs in reproductive contexts. We explored the effects of experimental leg loss on the reproductive behavior of one species of Neotropical Prionostemma harvestmen. These arachnids undergo autotomy frequently, do not regenerate legs, and their courtship and mating necessitate the use of legs. We assessed the effect of losing different types of legs (locomotor or sensory) on courtship behavior and mating success in males. We found no differences in the mating success or in any measured aspect of reproductive behavior between eight-legged males and males that experienced loss of legs of any type. Additionally, we found that morphological traits related to body size did not predict mating success. Overall, our experimental findings support the null hypothesis that harvestmen are robust to the consequences of morphological damage and natural selection favors strategies that increase robustness. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In order to survive encounters with predators, animals have evolved many defensive strategies. Some of those behaviors, however, can come with a cost to their overall body condition. For example, some animals can voluntarily lose body parts (tails, legs, etc.) to escape. This process can then affect many aspects of an animal’s life, including reproduction. In a group of harvestmen (daddy long-legs) from Costa Rica, we tested the hypothesis that males are robust to the potential consequences of losing legs, and will not experience costs. We found that males that lost either legs used for locomotion or for sensory perception reproduced in the same way as animals with all of their legs. Consequently, we demonstrate that these arachnids are able to withstand the loss of legs with no effects on reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data  a1556421cNational Science Foundation  a1348corganization for tropical studies  aMargaret C.

Antibacterial effects of crude extracts from P. oceanica were evaluated against: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aPosidonia oceanica 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantibacterial properties 3abeta-sitosterol 3achloroform 3aleaves 3alinoleic acid 3amass spectrometry 3amicroorganisms 3aseagrasses 0aPosidonia oceanica 0achemical investigation 0aposidozinol 0aantibacterial effects1 aSalem, Abdelkader Ben1 aAshour, Mohamed L.1 aCheriaa, Jihène1 aGraziano, Guella1 aMighri, Zine0 tNatural product research.g2013 July 1, v. 27, no. 14 p.1265-1270dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2012.725401  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006300140245011600203300001600319500002000335520172200355592002802077650002602105650002102131650003602152650001902188650002802207650002602235650001602261650001602277650001502293650001402308650002102322650001702343650001602360700002502376700005902401700005802460700002302518700006102541700002402602773013102626856007502757852000902832655001202841IND60777615820221118043859.0220518e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077761582DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.203252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSevostianova, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8053-503410aEstablishing three warm‐season turfgrasses with tailored water: I. Growth, cover, and nitrate leaching losses  ap. 228-237.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough treated effluent is being increasingly used to irrigate mature turfgrass, information on its use to establish grass is limited. Greenhouse experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2017 to examine establishment and nitrate leaching from three warm‐season grasses: buffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Natt.) Eng.] ‘SWI 2000’, inland saltgrass [Distichlis spicata (L.) Greene], and bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] ‘Princess77’. All grasses were grown with tailored (tertiary treated effluent with 15 mg L–¹ of NO₃–N) water. Grasses were established from seed in a loamy sand and irrigated with either tailored or potable water plus granular Ca(NO₃)₂ fertilizer. Leachate collected at 10‐ and 30‐cm depths was analyzed for NO₃–N and electrical conductivity. Overall, establishment was faster and coverage was greater in 2015 than in 2017, but neither differed between irrigation treatments when grasses were analyzed separately. At the end of both establishment periods, bermudagrass and buffalograss coverage was generally greater than that of inland saltgrass. In 2017, bermudagrass irrigated with tailored water resulted in greater coverage than buffalograss or inland saltgrass. In 2015, nitrate concentrations were greater in leachate collected from bermudagrass and inland saltgrass irrigated with tailored water than from grasses irrigated with potable water. Nitrate concentrations in leachate were generally lower in 2017, reaching a maximum value of 65.3 mg L–¹ when averaged over all treatment combinations, and did not differ between treatments. Our data suggest that the three grasses studied can be successfully established from seed using tailored waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBouteloua dactyloides 3aCynodon dactylon 3aDistichlis spicata var. stricta 3adrinking water 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental quality 3afertilizers 3agreenhouses 3airrigation 3aleachates 3aloamy sand soils 3aturf grasses 3awarm season1 aVelasco‐Cruz, Ciro1 aLeinauer, Bernd1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3700-20051 aSerena, Matteo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5334-60381 aSallenave, Rossana1 aHorvath, Isabelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0183-20391 aSkerker, Jenny Beth0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2022 Mar., v. 51, no. 2 p.228-237dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.203253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015400167300001000321520181900331592002802150650001002178650001602188650001402204650001702218650002002235650001302255650001602268650001702284650002102301650002002322650001802342650001902360650001402379650001102393773013002404856008202534852000902616655001202625IND60765708320221117035447.0220318e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076570832DNAL7 a10.1134/S10214437220100342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBulychev, A. A.10aDetection of Cell-to-Cell Transport with Chlorophyll Microfluorometry: Selectivity of Metabolite Passage and Sensitivity to Sodium and Potassium Ions  ap. 5.  aPulse-amplitude-modulated chlorophyll microfluorometry was used to quantify the permeation of photometabolites across the plasmodesmata in characean algae. The method is based on cyclosis-mediated sensitivity of chlorophyll fluorescence in Chara australis R. Br. internodes to illumination of a remote cell area. The application of a local light (LL) pulse to one internode in combination with measurement of fluorescence changes in the neighbor internode provided the means to assess connectivity between two adjoining internodal cells. The cytoplasmic flow seems to contain two types of photometabolites that produce opposite changes in chlorophyll fluorescence. The cytoplasm irradiated by LL pulse is enriched with reducing equivalents that produce a transient increase in F ' fluorescence owing to plastoquinone/QA reduction; these metabolites were found to pass freely across the plasmodesmata. At high background irradiance, the “irradiated” cytoplasm contains an additional component that strongly quenches the maximal ([Formula: see text]) fluorescence; this component did not permeate across the transnodal barrier. Thus, the plasmodesmata behaved like a selective filter that allowed penetration of reducing metabolites and restricted the passage of photoproducts accumulated under excessive light. The transnodal passage of permeable metabolites was further examined at various concentrations of NaCl and KCl in the medium. Both solutes inhibited the plasmodesmal conductivity but the inhibitory effect of KCl under short-term exposures was stronger than that of NaCl. In addition, the intracellular signaling was substantially suppressed upon the increase of KCl content in the medium. A possible relation between the plasma-membrane K⁺ transporters and photosystem II operation is considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChara 3achlorophyll 3acytoplasm 3afluorescence 3alight intensity 3alighting 3ametabolites 3apermeability 3aplant physiology 3aplasma membrane 3aplasmodesmata 3aplastoquinones 3apotassium 3asodium0 tRussian journal of plant physiology.g2022 Feb., v. 69, no. 1 p.5-5dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl3870074x1021-44377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10214437220100343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245013500209300001800344506007600362520171500438592002802153506003702181650001002218650001102228650001302239650001202252650000902264650001002273650001502283700002202298700002302320700002202343700002102365773017302386856007902559852000902638655001202647IND60178737620221207135822.0150604e20140121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017873762DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13156241112doi7 aPMC39031912pmcid7 a243957852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchier, Lindsey A.10aHigh-resolution lesion-mapping strategy links a hot spot in rat insular cortex with impaired expression of taste aversion learning  ap. 1162-1167.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGustatory cortex (GC), an assemblage of taste-responsive neurons in insular cortex, is widely regarded as integral to conditioned taste aversion (CTA) retention, a link that has been primarily established using lesion approaches in rats. In contrast to this prevailing view, we found that even the most complete bilateral damage to GC produced by ibotenic acid was insufficient to disrupt postsurgical expression of a presurgical CTA; nor were such lesions sufficient to disrupt postsurgical acquisition and initial expression of a second CTA. However, some rats with lesions were significantly impaired on these tests. Further examination of all conditioned rats with lesions, regardless of the lesion topography, revealed a significant positive association between damage in the posterior portion of GC and especially within adjacent posterior regions of insular cortex. Accordingly, we developed a high-resolution lesion-mapping program that permitted the overlay of the individual lesion maps from rats with CTA impairments to produce a groupwise aggregate lesion map. Comparison of this map with one derived from the unimpaired counterparts indicated a specific lesion “hot spot” associated with CTA deficits that included the most posterior end of GC and overlying granular layer and encompassed an area provisionally referred to in the literature as visceral cortex. Thus, the detailed mapping of the lesion in behaviorally defined subgroups of rats allowed us to exploit the variability in performance to uncloak an important potential component of the functional topography of insular cortex; such an approach could have general applicability to other brain structure–function endeavors as well.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abrain 3acortex 3alearning 3aneurons 3arats 3ataste 3atopography1 aHashimoto, Kōji,1 aBales, Michelle B.1 aBlonde, Ginger D.1 aSpector, Alan C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Jan. 21, v. 111, no. 3 p.1162-1167dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13156241113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009900171300001800270500001900288520127600307592002801583650002001611650001601631650001501647650001201662650002901674650001601703650001101719650001301730650002001743650001501763650001101778650002301789650001301812650002001825650000901845650001101854650002001865650001201885650001901897650001301916650001601929651001601945700001701961700002001978700001901998700002402017700002002041700002102061773010802082856008202190852000902272655001202281IND60714690020221118023332.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071469002DNAL7 a10.1007/s13157-020-01278-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirzajani, Alireza10aDiet Survey and Trophic Position of Macrobrachium nipponense in the Food Web of Anzali Wetland  ap. 1229-1239.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe oriental river shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense), an exotic species, has been well adapted and dispersed in Iranian freshwater ecosystems. The feeding ecology and trophic level of this species in the Anzali Wetland, southwestern Caspian Sea, was investigated by both a traditional method and the carbon and nitrogen stable isotope technique. The highest feeding index (FI) was seen in mollusca at 35.9%, followed by detritus at 31.3%. While no significant differences were observed in the preference of food items among different seasons. A Bayesian mixing model was used to estimate the contributions of the stomach contents to the isotopic signature of M. nipponense. According to mixing model results, M. nipponense obtain food from gastropod, fish, shrimp (as cannibalism), insecta, other crustacea, aquatic plants, worms, zooplankton, and unrecognizable content (as detritus) with 30.6%, 16.8%, 12.7%, 5.2%, 4.3%, 3.5%, 0.6%, 0.3%, and 25.9%, respectively. M. nipponense showed a high δ¹⁵N and its trophic level (TL = 3.38) was at the top of the Anzali Wetland food web, close to commercially important fish species such as pike, Esox Lucius. Being at this trophic level, this shrimp is expected to possess high nutritional quality for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aEsox lucius 3aGastropoda 3aInsecta 3aMacrobrachium nipponense 3acannibalism 3acarbon 3adetritus 3adietary surveys 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3aintroduced species 3anitrogen 3anutritive value 3apike 3ashrimp 3astable isotopes 3astomach 3atrophic levels 3awetlands 3azooplankton 3aCaspian Sea1 aGhane, Ahmad1 aBagheri, Siamak1 aAbbasi, Keyvan1 aSayadrahim, Mostafa1 aSalahi, Morteza1 aLavajoo, Fatemeh0 tWetlands.g2020 Oct., v. 40, no. 5 p.1229-1239dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl57834x0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-020-01278-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01413naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007100167300001800238520043500256592002800691650002400719650001100743650001300754653000800767653001200775653002400787700001200811700001700823700001700840700001700857700001800874773011100892856005101003852000901054655001201063IND50075927620221122015412.0140410e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007592762DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2012.7300452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Zheng10aTwo new dammarane-type saponins from leaves of Panax quinquefolium  ap. 1271-1276.  aTwo new saponins were isolated from the leaves of Panax quinquefolium and their structures were elucidated as 3β, 6α, 20S-trihydroxy-12β, 23R-epoxydammar-24-ene 6-O-[α-L-rhamnosyl(1 → 2)-β-D-glucopyranosyl]-20-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (1) and 3β, 20S-dihydroxy-12β, 23R-epoxydammar-24-ene 3-O-[β-D-glucopyranosyl(1 → 2)-β-D-glucopyranosyl]-20-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (2) on the basis of physicochemical evidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanax quinquefolius 3aleaves 3asaponins 0aNMR 0asaponin 0aPanax quinquefolium1 aLv, Jia1 aZhou, Zhixun1 aLi, Yingying1 aDou, Deqiang1 aZhao, Jinming0 tNatural product research.g2013 July 1, v. 27, no. 14 p.1271-1276dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2012.730045  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006000144245015100204300002000355520179300375592002802168650001502196650001402211650001702225650001702242650001002259650001502269650002402284650001102308650001302319650000702332650001702339650001302356650001402369653001702383653003202400653002602432653001902458653003202477700001802509700002302527700005502550700005402605700006402659700001902723700002002742700002402762700001902786700006202805700002302867773014202890856007903032852000903111655001203120IND60756779720221119172125.0211117e20211103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075677972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c130022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadreldin, Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2405-139310aEarly Transition-Metal-Based Binary Oxide/Nitride for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution from Saline Water in Different pH Environments  ap. 53702-53716.  aUsing abundant seawater can reduce reliance on freshwater resources for hydrogen production from electrocatalytic water splitting. However, seawater has detrimental effects on the stability and activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts under different pH conditions. In this work, we report the synthesis of binary metallic core–sheath nitride@oxynitride electrocatalysts [Ni(ETM)]ᵟ⁺–[O–N]ᵟ⁻, where ETM is an early transition metal V or Cr. Using NiVN on a nickel foam (NF) substrate, we demonstrate an HER overpotential as low as 32 mV at −10 mA cm–² in saline water (0.6 M NaCl). The results represent an advancement in saline water HER performance of earth-abundant electrocatalysts, especially under near-neutral pH range (i.e., pH 6–8). Doping ETMs in nickel oxynitrides accelerates the typically rate-determining H₂O dissociation step for HER and suppresses chloride deactivation of the catalyst in neutral-pH saline water. Heterointerface synergism occurs through H₂O adsorption and dissociation at interfacial oxide character, while adsorbed H* proceeds via Heyrovsky or Tafel step on the nitride character. This electrocatalyst showed stable performance under a constant current density of −50 mA cm–² for 50 h followed by additional 50 h at −100 mA cm–² in a neutral saline electrolyte (1 M PB + 0.6 M NaCl). Contrarily, under the same conditions, Pt/C@NF exhibited significantly low performance after a mere 4 h at −50 mA cm–². The low Tafel slope of 25 mV dec–¹ indicated that the reaction is Tafel limited, unlike commercial Pt/C, which is Heyrovsky limited. We close by discussing general principles concerning surface charge delocalization for the design of HER electrocatalysts in pH saline environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3adissociation 3aelectrolytes 3afoams 3afreshwater 3ahydrogen production 3anickel 3anitrides 3apH 3asaline water 3aseawater 3asynergism 0aseawater HER 0ahydrogen evolution reaction 0achloride deactivation 0aneutral pH HER 0aenhanced water dissociation1 aNabeeh, Ahmed1 aGhouri, Zafar Khan1 aAbed, Jehad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1387-27401 aWang, Ning1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2589-68811 aWubulikasimu, Yiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4664-91231 aYoussef, Karim1 aKumar, Dharmesh1 aStodolny, Maciej K.1 aElsaid, Khaled1 aSargent, Edward H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0396-64951 aAbdel-Wahab, Ahmed0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 03, v. 13, no. 45 p.53702-53716dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c130023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245013800153300001600291520095000307592002801257650002201285650002201307650001201329650001901341650001001360650002201370650001301392650001401405650002701419650002701446650001801473653001101491653002001502653001501522700001701537700001801554700001901572773013101591856007101722852000901793655001201802IND60706354620221119081341.0200807e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070635462DNAL7 a10.18805/LR-4882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsare, A.T.10aIdentification of New Sources of Rust Resistance in Cowpea (Vigna Unguiculata L. Walp) Germplasm Using Simple Sequence Repeat Markers  ap. 158-189.  aThe demand for resistance cowpea to rust infection has currently increased due to considerable yield losses caused by the fungal pathogen. The study assessed available cowpea genotypes for rust resistance using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Out of 100 cowpea genotypes screened, 97% showed the presence of the markers whilst 3% showed absence of the markers. Among the cowpea were 72% resistance, 16% moderate resistance and 9% low resistance to rust. The markers revealed a mean high allele frequency (0.86) and low gene diversity (0.24) and polymorphism information content (0.21) among the cowpea genotypes. The markers co-inherited with a mean regression value greater than 0.1. There was no clear pattern of clustering among the cowpea genotypes. The cowpea genotypes with rust resistance traits could serve as good sources of germplasm for cultivation or resilient genes with rust target in breeding programmes to improve the crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna unguiculata 3abreeding programs 3acowpeas 3agene frequency 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3arust diseases 0aCowpea 0aRust resistance 0aSSR marker1 aMensah, T.A.1 aTagoe, S.M.A.1 aAsante, D.K.A.0 tLegume research.g2020 Apr., v. 43, no. 2 p.158-189dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:1999x0976-05717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-4883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011200165300001600277500001500293520139500308592002801703650001501731650002701746650001501773650001701788650001801805650002001823650001201843650001701855650002101872650001801893651001101911653001501922700001701937700001801954700002101972700002001993773011002013856008102123852000902204655001202213IND60574385520221122225244.0170726e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057438552DNAL7 a10.1134/S19954255160700402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErshov, D.

Numerical characteristics such as the areas of the forest and other terrestral ecosystems; the number of forest plots; their average areas in a federal region; the disturbed forest land areas over the past 5 years; the proportions of the coniferous, deciduous, and mixed forests; and the total number of ecosystem types found in the federal region are calculated for each federal region in the Russian Federation within the CFD. The dominant landscape type is defined using a regular grid whose cell size matches the size of the average basal area of the forest plot on the vegetation map. The areas of the forest, agricultural, grassland, and agro-forest landscapes within each grid cell are estimated. The dominant landscape areas are assessed for each federal region; the analysis reveals that, on average, a quarter of all land areas in the district are occupied by agroforest landscapes. A logical sequence of research activities has been presented to assess the indicators of biodiversity in the forest and other terrestrial ecosystems and their functions and services.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasslands 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3alandscapes 3aagroforestry 3amixed forests 3avegetation maps 3aLandsat 3abiodiversity 3astand basal area 3aforest damage 3aRussia 0abasal area1 aIsaev, A.

Macrophages were also exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) which provided exogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS). Receptor for AGEs (RAGE) was over-expressed by a vector. Specific siRNA silencing TLR4 and inhibitor TAK-242 were used to pre-treat the macrophages. Intracellular ROS was determined by DCFH-DA. Immunofluorescence staining was used to evaluate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) which is the marker of M1 macrophage phenotype. Real-time PCR was used to assess the mRNA expression level of TLR4 and RAGE. Protein expression levels of cytoplasmic RAGE, TLR4, nuclear signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and phosphorylation levels of cytoplasmic STAT1 were evaluated by Western blotting. ELISA was used to measure concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL6), IL12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α in supernatant of cell culture medium of macrophages.AGEs significantly elevated intracellular ROS generation, expression levels of iNOS, cytoplasmic RAGE, TLR4, nuclear STAT1, phosphorylation levels of cytoplasmic STAT1, as well as IL6, IL12 and TNFα contents in a concentration-dependent manner. TLR4 silencing and inhibitor pre-treatment reduced expression levels of cytoplasmic RAGE, TLR4, phosphorylation of STAT1 and nuclear STAT1 in AGEs-exposed macrophages without affecting RAGE expression and intracellular ROS production levels. RAGE over-expression elevated both ROS and TLR4 expression levels in macrophages. TLR4 expression elevation was also found in H₂O₂-treat macrophages.AGEs induced macrophage polarization toward M1 via activating RAGE/ROS/TLR4/STAT1 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 4 3acell culture 3aculture media 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglycation 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aresearch 0aMacrophage polarization 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aSignal transducers and activators of transcription 11 aMa, Yanpeng1 aCui, Qianwei1 aXu, Jing1 aTang, Zhiguo1 aWang, Yuan1 aHe, Chunhui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1068-99861 aWang, Xi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Oct. 22, v. 531, no. 4 p.602-608dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011000161300002000271520141000291592002801701650002101729650001401750650001301764650001601777650001301793650001801806650001701824650001101841650001901852650001601871653002401887653001701911653002601928653002101954653001401975700001801989700005402007700005502061700005402116700005802170700001602228773014202244856007802386852000902464655001202473IND60619471020221120024823.0181102e20181009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061947102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b086582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Fayin10aChemical Decoration of Perovskites by Nickel Oxide Doping for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells  ap. 36841-36850.  aCrystal engineering of CH₃NH₃PbI₃–ₓClₓ perovskite films through modification by decoration with p-type semiconductor materials was proposed as an efficient method for obtaining good-quality crystalline films. A simple method is demonstrated to improve the quality of perovskite films by adding nickel oxide (NiOₓ) nanoparticles into the precursor solution. The addition of NiOₓ brings about high-quality crystals and convenient photo-generated charge transport with reduced defect density owing to efficient control of the preferred nucleation and crystal growth. The sufficient contact between CH₃NH₃PbI₃–ₓClₓ–NiOₓ and the electron-transport layer can contribute to photo-generated carrier lifetime and transport through the optimized interface. Moreover, it is demonstrated that a strong chemical bonding interaction between MAPbI₃–ₓClₓ and NiOₓ could protect perovskite materials from oxygen and humidity corrosion, showing remarkable stability holding ∼81% of the initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 50 days. The device with the best PCE of 19.34% is achieved because of the improved short-circuit current from 22.23 to 23.01 mA cm–² and fill factor from 68.97 to 75.06%. The results certify that this p-type charge transport material decoration method for the optimization of perovskite films is an efficient way to optimize the performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical bonding 3acorrosion 3acrystals 3aengineering 3ahumidity 3ananoparticles 3anickel oxide 3aoxygen 3asemiconductors 3asolar cells 0achemical decoration 0anickel oxide 0aperovskite solar cell 0achemical bonding 0astability1 aGuang, Shanyi1 aYe, Meidan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5477-66891 aXu, Kaibing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2315-73561 aGuo, Wenxi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0791-90231 aLiu, Xiangyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5280-55781 aXu, Hongyao0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Oct. 09, v. 10, no. 43 p.36841-36850dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b086583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245010200211300001100313506007600324520155500400592002801955506003701983650001002020650001702030650001302047650001002060650000902070650001402079650001402093650001602107651002802123651001102151651002802162700002202190700001902212700001902231700002102250700001802271700002302289773009502312856008102407852000902488655001202497IND60574385620221207121411.0170726e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057438562DNAL7 a10.1186/s12917-017-0968-92doi7 aPMC53013462pmcid7 a281833132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKreizinger, Zsuzsa10aComparison of virulence of Francisella tularensis ssp. holarctica genotypes B.12 and B.FTNF002-00  ap. 46.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Two main genetic groups (B.12 and B.FTNF002-00) of Francisella tularensis ssp. holarctica are endemic in Europe. The B.FTNF002-00 group proved to be dominant in Western European countries, while strains of the B.12 group were isolated mainly in Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. The clinical course of tularemia in the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) also shows distinct patterns according to the geographical area. Acute course of the disease is observed in hares in Western European countries, while signs of sub-acute or chronic infection are more frequently detected in the eastern part of the continent. The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is any difference in the virulence of the strains belonging to the B.FTNF002-00 and B.12 genetic clades. RESULTS: Experimental infection of Fischer 344 rats was performed by intra-peritoneal injection of three dilutions of a Hungarian (B.12 genotype) and an Italian (B.FTNF002-00 genotype) F. tularensis ssp. holarctica strain. Moderate difference was observed in the virulence of the two genotypes. Significant differences were observed in total weight loss values and scores of clinical signs between the two genotypes with more rats succumbing to tularemia in groups infected with the B.FTNF002-00 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the experimental infection are consistent with previous clinical observations and pathological studies suggesting that F. tularensis ssp. holarctica genotype B.FTNF002-00 has higher pathogenic potential than the B.12 genotype.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLepus 3aacute course 3agenotype 3ahares 3arats 3atularemia 3avirulence 3aweight loss 3aEastern European region 3aEurope 3aWestern European region1 aErdélyi, Károly1 aFelde, Orsolya1 aFabbi, Massimo1 aSulyok, Kinga M.1 aMagyar, Tibor1 aGyuranecz, Miklós0 tBMC veterinary research.g2016 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.46-46dBioMed Centralx1746-61487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-0968-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008400167300002000251500001100271520113900282592002801421596005901449596006201508650002301570650001901593650002401612650001401636650001301650650001901663700001501682700002001697773015401717856008301871852000901954655001201963IND60765708820221117034810.0220319e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076570882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-18033-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Bei-Xuan10aSimulation of transportation infrastructures resilience: a comprehensive review  ap. 12965-12983.  aReview  aDespite the increasing simulation methods used by the research of transportation infrastructure resilience in the past decade, a comprehensive review of these simulation methods is lacking. Thus, this paper conducted an in-depth review of the major simulation methods adopted by the existing transportation infrastructure resilience literature, which are Monte Carlo simulation, network-based simulation, numerical simulation, and agent-based modeling and simulation. The four simulation methods were reviewed from three perspectives, namely purposes of simulation, data demands, and modeling approaches. Finally, based on the review results, this paper proposed three directions for that the research may go towards in the future. This paper contributes to the current body of knowledge by reviewing the simulation methods adopted by the research of transportation infrastructure resilience.

T9SS consists of a trans-periplasmic core complex, the outer membrane translocon complex and the cell-surface complex attached on the outer membrane. PorM is a major component of the trans-periplasmic core complex and is believed to connect the outer membrane component with the inner membrane component. Recent structural studies have revealed that the periplasmic region of GldM, a PorM homolog of a gliding bacterium, consist of four domains and forms a dimer with a straight rod shape. However, only fragment structures are known for PorM. Moreover, one of the PorM fragment structure shows a kink. Here we show the structure of the entire structure of the periplasmic region of PorM (PorMp) at 3.7 Å resolution. PorMp is made up of four domains and forms a unique dimeric structure with an asymmetric, kinked-rod shape. The structure and the following mutational analysis revealed that R204 stabilizes the kink between the D1 and D2 domains and is essential for gingipains secretion, suggesting that the kinked structure of PorM is important for the functional T9SS formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorphyromonas gingivalis 3abacteria 3agingipain 3amutational analysis 3apathogens 3aperiodontal diseases 3aresearch 3asecretion 3avirulence 0aT9SS 0aCrystal structure 0aPorM1 aOkada, Kodai1 aNakayama, Koji1 aImada, Katsumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1342-88850 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Oct. 29, v. 532, no. 1 p.114-119dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.08.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245007500198300001600273500002000289520133900309592002801648650001601676650002401692650002001716650002601736650001001762650002601772650004301798650001501841651000901856700001601865700006301881700006201944700005502006773013102061856007502192961001302267852000902280655001202289IND60777616120221118043852.0220518e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077761612DNAL7 a10.1002/jeq2.203202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaefer, Abby1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9506-886510aComparison of microbial communities in replicated woodchip bioreactors  ap. 205-215.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDenitrification in woodchip bioreactors is a microbial process, but the effects of variations in bioreactors operation on microbial community structure are not well understood. Here, our goals were to understand hydraulic retention time (HRT) as a factor that influences woodchip bioreactor microbial community variation and structure in replicated field bioreactors and to evaluate relationships between microbial community membership and marker genes for denitrification. We used a combination of quantitative polymerase chain reaction of nirS, nirK, nosZI, and nosZII and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the microbial communities of nine pilot‐scale woodchip bioreactors located at Iowa State University. Our results showed dynamic microbial communities but with persistent taxa between two sampling years and three HRTs. Similarities between functional gene copy numbers across sampling year and HRT indicate that the potential for denitrification is conserved despite differences in the microbial communities. These results are evidence that there are specific and persistent taxa within replicated bioreactors. Woodchip bioreactor microbial community membership is recommended to be the focus of future studies to better understand the relationship between microbial community functions and bioreactor management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3acommunity structure 3adenitrification 3aenvironmental quality 3agenes 3amicrobial communities 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3awood chips 3aIowa1 aLee, Jaejin1 aSoupir, Michelle L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3449-11461 aMoorman, Thomas B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7409-06091 aHowe, Adina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7705-343X0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2022 Mar., v. 51, no. 2 p.205-215dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jeq2.203203Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012500169300001600294520122900310592002801539650002101567650001801588650002001606650001001626650001101636650000901647650001401656650001301670650002201683650002601705650003101731653002001762653001601782653002801798653002401826700002101850700002301871700001601894700002201910700001901932700001801951773012101969856008202090852000902172655001202181IND60560209120221119164116.0170720e20170129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056020912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.12.1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrázda, Václav14aThe structure formed by inverted repeats in p53 response elements determines the transactivation activity of p53 protein  ap. 516-521.  aThe TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and p53 protein plays a crucial role in gene expression and cancer protection. Its role is manifested by interactions with other proteins and DNA. p53 is a transcription factor that binds to DNA response elements (REs). Due to the palindromic nature of the consensus binding site, several p53-REs have the potential to form cruciform structures. However, the influence of cruciform formation on the activity of p53-REs has not been evaluated. Therefore, we prepared sets of p53-REs with identical theoretical binding affinity in their linear state, but different probabilities to form extra helical structures, for in vitro and in vivo analyses. Then we evaluated the presence of cruciform structures when inserted into plasmid DNA and employed a yeast-based assay to measure transactivation potential of these p53-REs cloned at a chromosomal locus in isogenic strains. We show that transactivation in vivo correlated more with relative propensity of an RE to form cruciforms than to its predicted in vitro DNA binding affinity for wild type p53. Structural features of p53-REs could therefore be an important determinant of p53 transactivation function.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3abinding sites 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahumans 3aloci 3aneoplasms 3aplasmids 3aresponse elements 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation 0aInverted repeat 0ap53 protein 0aProtein-DNA interaction 0aCruciform structure1 aČechová, Jana,1 aBattistin, Michele1 aCoufal, Jan1 aJagelská, Eva B.1 aRaimondi, Ivan1 aInga, Alberto0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Jan. 29, v. 483 p.516-521dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.12.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04818naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245018500172300001400357520314800371592002803519650001303547650001603560650002503576650002103601650001803622650001203640650001303652650001203665650002503677650001503702650001203717650002103729650001903750650002603769650002803795650000903823650001303832650001803845650001403863653001503877653001703892653001803909653004203927653004303969653001504012700002404027700001904051773011104070856008604181852000904267655001204276IND50070668120221118102810.0190408e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007066812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2013.08.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolatoğlu, Kaan10aPhytotoxic, DPPH scavenging, insecticidal activities and essential oil composition of Achillea vermicularis, A. teretifolia and proposed chemotypes of A. biebersteinii (Asteraceae)  ap. 35-45.  aPrevious reports on folk medicinal uses and insecticidal activity of the genus Achillea prompted us to investigate selected Achillea species in our ongoing biological activity screening of Asteraceae family. Three Achillea species A. biebersteinii Afan. (collected from two different locations), A. vermicularis Trin. and A. teretifolia Willd. essential oils were investigated for their phytotoxic, DPPH scavenging and insecticidal activities against Sitophilus granarius as well as their chemical compositions. Seventy compounds were identified in A. biebersteinii oil from Mt. Ararat sample representing 91.9% of the oil; sixty one compounds were identified in the oil from Mt. Dumluca sample representing 90.1% of the oil. Main components of the first sample from Mt. Ararat were 1,8-cineole 30.6%; piperitone 28.9%; camphor 11.7% and second sample from Mt. Dumluca were 1,8-cineole 31.1%; camphor 14.4%; α-thujone 12.9%; p-cymene 4.6%; β-thujone 3.4%; borneol 3.4%. Essential oil of A. vermicularis from Turkey was investigated for the first time and 61 components were identified representing 92.2% of the oil. Main components of the oil were 1,8-cineole 29.2%, camphor 25.8%, borneol 5.2%, piperitone 4.5% and camphene 3.8%. Fifty seven compounds were identified representing 76.6% of A. teretifolia oil. Main components of the oil were 1,8-cineole 15.9%, borneol 8.1%, camphor 7.0%, T-cadinol 5.9%, trans-nerolidol 5.1%, terpinen-4-ol 5.0% and caryophyllene oxide 3.9%. All of the tested oils showed low fumigant toxicity to Lemna minor, highest activity was observed for the A. biebersteinii collected from Mt. Ararat (29.95±1.30%) when compared with other samples.DPPH scavenging activities of the oils were investigated at various concentrations and incubation time. Highest DPPH scavenging activity was observed for A. teretifolia (89.92±0.49%) oil at 20mg/mL concentration when 60min. incubation time was employed. When compared with positive control α-tocopherol (96.59±0.90%) at same conditions A. teretifolia and A. vermicularis essential oil showed considerable DPPH scavenging activity. All of the essential oils tested showed high insectidal contact toxicity against S. granarius. Highest contact toxicity was observed for A. biebersteinii collected from Mt. Ararat (100.00±0.00%) at 0.2μL/mL concentration when compared with the other oil samples. However tested essential oils showed low insecticidal fumigant toxicity against S. granarius. Highest fumigant toxicity was observed for A. biebersteinii collected from Mt. Ararat (36.64±0.12%) when compared with other samples. Additionally variation in the essential oil composition of both A. biebersteinii samples and previously reported literature was observed and chemotypes were proposed according to agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis. Similarly variation of A. teretifolia essential oil in present work and previous literature was observed. This is the first report on the essential oil composition of A. vermicularis from Turkey. The phytotoxic, DPPH scavenging and insecticidal activities of these species look promising as potential biopesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchillea 3aLemna minor 3aSitophilus granarius 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abiopesticides 3aborneol 3acamphene 3acamphor 3achemical composition 3achemotypes 3acineole 3acluster analysis 3aessential oils 3afumigant insecticides 3ainsecticidal properties 3aoils 3ap-cymene 3aphytotoxicity 3ascreening 0aAsteraceae 0aAchillea sp. 0aEssential oil 0aSitophilus granarius contact toxicity 0aSitophilus granarius fumigant toxicity 0aChemotypes1 aKarakoç, Ömer Cem1 aGören, Nezhun0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Nov., v. 51 p.35-45dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2013.08.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03385naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245014400203506007600347520180900423592002802232506003702260650000802297650001902305650001502324650001802339650002402357650002002381650002502401650003102426650002902457650001202486650002602498650001102524650001502535650001902550650000902569650001502578650002902593650002602622650001802648700001902666773012002685856007702805852000902882655001202891IND60677095820221207091541.0191122e20191023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067709582DNAL7 a10.3390/plants81104412doi7 aPMC69181882pmcid7 a316527962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Chai-Ling 10aGenome-Wide Computational Identification of Biologically Significant Cis-Regulatory Elements and Associated Transcription Factors from Rice  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and cis-acting regulatory elements (CREs) provide crucial information on the regulation of gene expression. The determination of TF-binding sites and CREs experimentally is costly and time intensive. An in silico identification and annotation of TFs, and the prediction of CREs from rice are made possible by the availability of whole genome sequence and transcriptome data. In this study, we tested the applicability of two algorithms developed for other model systems for the identification of biologically significant CREs of co-expressed genes from rice. CREs were identified from the DNA sequences located upstream from the transcription start sites, untranslated regions (UTRs), and introns, and downstream from the translational stop codons of co-expressed genes. The biologically significance of each CRE was determined by correlating their absence and presence in each gene with that gene&rsquo;s expression profile using a meta-database constructed from 50 rice microarray data sets. The reliability of these methods in the predictions of CREs and their corresponding TFs was supported by previous wet lab experimental data and a literature review. New CREs corresponding to abiotic stresses, biotic stresses, specific tissues, and developmental stages were identified from rice, revealing new pieces of information for future experimental testing. The effectiveness of some&mdash;but not all&mdash;CREs was found to be affected by copy number, position, and orientation. The corresponding TFs that were most likely correlated with each CRE were also identified. These findings not only contribute to the prioritization of candidates for further analysis, the information also contributes to the understanding of the gene regulatory network.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aabiotic stress 3aalgorithms 3abiotic stress 3acomputer simulation 3adata collection 3adevelopmental stages 3agene expression regulation 3agene regulatory networks 3aintrons 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprioritization 3arice 3astop codon 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome1 aGeisler, Matt 0 tPlants.g2019 Oct. 23, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants81104413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245015800153300001600311520108400327592002801411650002201439650002401461650002501485650002301510650001501533650001201548650001301560650002401573650002301597650001001620650001701630650001301647650001601660650001101676650001101687650002001698651001201718653001701730653002801747653002001775700002001795700001601815700001501831773013101846856007101977852000902048655001202057IND60706355020221119081258.0200807e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070635502DNAL7 a10.18805/LR-4702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoang, L.H.10aPhysiological and phytochemical responses of red amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor L.) and green amaranth (Amaranthus dubius L.) to different salinity levels  ap. 206-211.  aThe physiological and phytochemical responses of red amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor L.) and green amaranth (Amaranthus dubius L.) to different salinity levels were determined in two experiments conducted in Vietnam. Both experiments were performed in a net house involving pot experiments arranged in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Two genotypes of amaranth were grown in garden soil, saline soil, 50% garden soil: 50% saline soil and 25, 50 and 100 mM NaCl. Salinization was imposed at 7, 14 and 21 days after transplanting. Results indicated that salt stress decreased growth parameters and biomass production in all treatments except for 25 mM NaCl. Na+ and Cl-content accumulated in both shoot and root, however, root had greater NaCl content than shoot. Total phenolics, total flavonoid content and antioxidant activity increased with increasing salinity levels from 25 mM to 50 mM NaCl; however, at 100 mM NaCl, all these parameters decreased. These results showed that red amaranth was more tolerant to salinity stress than green amaranth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus dubius 3aAmaranthus tricolor 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomass production 3aflavonoids 3agardens 3agenotype 3ahorticultural soils 3aphenolic compounds 3aroots 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3ashoots 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3aVietnam 0aNaCl content 0aTotal flavonoid content 0aTotal phenolics1 aGuzman, C.C.

Since river contamination from human activities can affect the safety of this food, fish consumption can cause exposure to potentially toxic elements for humans. The aim of this study, therefore, was to assess arsenic, cadmium, lead, copper and chromium contents by atomic absorption spectrometry in Pangasius fillet produced in the provinces of Dong Thap and Can Tho (Vietnam) and exported to Brazil. RESULTS: The limits of detection were: arsenic 0.5443 µg kg⁻¹, cadmium 0.0040 mg kg⁻¹, chromium 0.0004 mg kg⁻¹, copper 0.0037 mg kg⁻¹ and lead 0.0284 mg kg⁻¹. Analysis of 20 samples showed results below the limit of detection for arsenic, chromium and lead, while copper average concentration was 0.0234 mg kg⁻¹. Cadmium average concentration was 0.0547 mg kg⁻¹, with no significant difference between the two regions studied. CONCLUSION: The samples of Pangasius had no detectable concentrations of arsenic, chromium, copper and lead, and do not represent a hazard to public health. However, cadmium analysis revealed non‐compliant samples, demonstrating the importance of monitoring the quality of imported Pangasius fish.   aPublisher supplied data 3aPangasius 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adetection limit 3afillets 3afish 3afish consumption 3afood safety 3ahumans 3alead 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3arivers 3atoxic substances 3aBrazil 3aVietnam1 aVitali, Luciano1 aPloêncio, Leandro AS1 aSantos, Jacson N1 aDaguer, Heitor0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2016 July, v. 96, no. 9 p.3109-3113dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.74863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013500209300001600344520179100360592002802151596007302179650001402252650002902266650001502295650001102310650002102321650001102342650001802353650001802371650001702389650002002406700002102426700002002447700002202467700001902489700001702508700002002525700002302545700006302568700002102631773011202652856008302764852000902847655001202856IND60762818520221118193226.0220422e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076281852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-021-01572-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaves, Raquel S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7118-146510aAssessment of Water Quality Parameters and their Seasonal Behaviour in a Portuguese Water Supply System: a 6-year Monitoring Study  ap. 111-127.  aWater quality monitoring is a fundamental tool in the management of freshwater resources. The purpose of monitoring is to provide meaningful quality data for local action planning and catchment-wide decision making. The assessment of water quality is crucial to guarantee the efficient operation of the Water Treatment Plants (WTPs), promoting health conditions and contributing for a more sustainable urban water cycle. In accordance, the objective of this study was to evaluate key target chemical and microbiological water quality parameters, some of them already monitored within Portuguese/EU legal framework and others still not regulated, but with environmental and human heath relevance. A local monitoring database model, using a 6-year period (from 2014 to 2019) of water quality data, regarding water samples collected on representative sampling locations covering the freshwater abstraction sites, conventional WTPs and distribution network was assessed. This work provides new knowledge regarding occurrence and seasonal behaviour for both microbiological and chemical water quality parameters, essential to understand/manage the water supply system. Additionally, relationships between the target variables were also assessed. Particularly, strong correlations were identified between TOC and THMs formation at distribution network (r = 0.69; p ≤ 0.001); nitrates were the water quality parameter that revealed the best correlation between surface water source and treated water (r = 0.81; p ≤ 0.001), suggesting that treatment yield/performance is dependent on surface water load. The local and continuous monitoring of water systems are crucial to implement new approaches to guarantee the best quality of drinking water throughout the supply system.  aPublisher supplied data  agrant PDE/BDE/114582/2016cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia 3adatabases 3aenvironmental management 3afreshwater 3ahumans 3ahydrologic cycle 3amodels 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater treatment1 aSalvador, Daniel1 aNogueira, Paulo1 aSantos, Miguel M.1 aAprisco, Paula1 aNeto, Célia1 aCardoso, Vitor,1 aBenoliel, Maria J.1 aRodrigues, João E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8621-54101 aCarneiro, Rui N.0 tEnvironmental management.g2022 Jan., v. 69, no. 1 p.111-127dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-021-01572-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013600175300001800311520067500329592002801004650003001032650001401062650001201076650001901088650001101107650003701118700002101155700001801176700002201194700001701216700001701233700002401250773009301274856008501367852000901452655001201461IND60098400720221118112639.0141104e20120921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009840072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.febslet.2012.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsukamoto, Shuntaro10aOxygen partial pressure modulates 67-kDa laminin receptor expression, leading to altered activity of the green tea polyphenol, EGCG  ap. 3441-3447.  a(−)-Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) exhibits anti-tumor activity mediated via the 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR). In this study, we found that 67LR protein levels are reduced by exposure to low O₂ levels (5%), without affecting the expression of HIF-1α. We also found that EGCG-induced anti-cancer activity is abrogated under low O₂ levels (5%) in various cancer cells. Notably, treatment with the proteasome inhibitor, prevented down-regulation of 67LR and restored sensitivity to EGCG under 5% O₂. In summary, 67LR expression is highly sensitive to O₂ partial pressure, and the activity of EGCG can be regulated in cancer cells by O₂ partial pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3agreen tea 3alaminin 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxygen 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex1 aYamashita, Shuya1 aKim, Yoon Hee1 aKumazoe, Motofumi1 aHuang, Yuhui1 aYamada, Koji1 aTachibana, Hirofumi0 tFEBS letters.g2012 Sept. 21, v. 586, no. 19 p.3441-3447dElsevier B.V.x0014-57937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.febslet.2012.07.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024001800123040001800141100002500159245015000184300001600334520154900350592002801899650002201927650001601949650001901965650001101984650001301995650001302008650001402021650001502035650001402050650002802064650001402092650001402106650001302120650004202133650002702175650003102202650002002233650002402253653003002277653001302307653001402320653001402334653001002348653001302358700002602371700002002397773015602417856007502573852000902648655001202657IND60613668220221121035003.0180914e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061366822DNAL7 a10.1638/2018-0077.12doi4 azamd-49-03-24  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarouche, Cédric B.10aAbsence of acute toxicity of a single intramuscular injection of meloxicam in goldfish (carassius auratus auratus): a randomized controlled trial  ap. 617-622.  aMeloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with preferential cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory activity. It is frequently used in veterinary medicine, including in fish species. The efficacy and safety of meloxicam, however, has not yet been reported in adult fish. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acute toxicity of a single intramuscular injection of meloxicam in goldfish (Carassius auratus auratus). Following 3 wk of acclimation, 32 goldfish were randomly assigned to two groups of 16 individuals. Fish from the treatment group received a single intramuscular injection of 5 mg/kg meloxicam, while the fish from the control group received a single intramuscular injection of a 0.9% sodium chloride solution using a similar volume (1 ml/kg). No external lesions, mortality, or modifications in behavior or position in the water column were noted during the following 72 hr. Three days after the initial injection, all fish were euthanized by immersion in a solution of tricaine methanesulfonate. Complete postmortem and histologic evaluations were performed for each fish. Hemorrhage and muscular necrosis were observed at the site of injection in fish from both groups. Multiple granulomas of undetermined etiology were detected in numerous organs from fish of both groups. No statistically significant differences were detected in regard to the lesions observed in these two groups. This study demonstrates that a single intramuscular injection of meloxicam at a dosage of 5 mg/kg does not cause acute toxicity in goldfish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius auratus 3aacclimation 3aacute toxicity 3aadults 3aetiology 3agoldfish 3agranuloma 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3aintramuscular injection 3ameloxicam 3amortality 3anecrosis 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3aprostaglandin synthase 3arandomized clinical trials 3asodium chloride 3aveterinary medicine 0aCarassius auratus auratus 0agoldfish 0ainjection 0ameloxicam 0aNSAID 0atoxicity1 aLimoges, Marie-Josée1 aLair, Stéphane0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2018 Sept., v. 49, no. 3 p.617-622dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2018-0077.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03457naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012500174506011700299506007600416520184100492592002802333506003702361650002002398650001902418650001102437650001902448650001802467650001202485650001002497650001702507650003102524650001902555650001002574653001802584653002602602653003102628653002002659653001602679653001702695700001402712700001702726700001902743773011802762856008602880852000902966655001202975IND60777204820221207144750.0220726e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077720482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1150632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCodina-Pascual, N.10aWeed suppression capacity of camelina (Camelina sativa) against winter weeds: The example of corn-poppy (Papaver rhoeas)  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCrop rotation is one of the most relevant tools for Integrated Weed Management (IWM). In semiarid Mediterranean areas, the crop rotation is limited by climatic conditions. Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz) is an interesting option to introduce due to its tolerance to cold and drought and because of its short life cycle, which allows a flexible management for weed control. In this study, the capacity of camelina to reduce the growth and seed rain of corn poppy (Papaver rhoeas L.) was studied. The experiment was carried out at the University of Lleida during three seasons (2018–19, 2019–20 and 2020–21). In each season, three camelina varieties (GP204, Sonny and Joelle) and barley were sown on two sowing dates (SD) (between November and February) in 1.5 m wide × 10 m long plots with three replications. Three 0.5 × 0.5 m² quadrates were established, where five P. rhoeas plants from a natural population were allowed to grow in each SD. Additionally, every season in March, weed surveys were performed to observe the effect of the SD in the weed flora. Results show that delaying the SD effectively controlled winter weeds, including P. rhoeas, which could not establish in the second SD plots. The growth of P. rhoeas in the first SD was reduced similarly in the presence of the crops in 2018–19, but camelina competed better against it in 2020–21, while barley competed better in 2019–20. Due to the short life cycle of camelina and its earlier harvest date, the potential seed production of P. rhoeas was reduced by 34% in 2018–19, 52% in 2019–20% and 70% in 2020–21, while this reduction was of 23% in 2018–19% and 56% in 2020–21 in barley. The capacity of camelina to reduce the presence of corn poppy and its seed production in semiarid conditions should be considered as a tool for IWM.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCamelina sativa 3aPapaver rhoeas 3abarley 3acold tolerance 3acrop rotation 3adrought 3aflora 3aharvest date 3aintegrated weed management 3aseed dispersal 3aweeds 0aCrop rotation 0aCrop-weed competition 0aIntegrated weed management 0aSeed production 0aSowing date 0aWinter weeds1 aTorra, J.1 aBaraibar, B.1 aRoyo-Esnal, A.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 184 p.115063-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2022.1150633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03054naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012100164300001400285520158200299592002801881650004701909650001101956650001101967650002001978650001501998650001102013650000902024650001902033650001502052650002202067650001302089650001502102651002202117653001802139653001902157653000902176653002702185653001302212700005602225700006002281700002602341700001802367773009702385856008102482852000902563655001202572IND60563189420221120173931.0170719e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056318942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolcher, Jan10aComparing surface-soil moisture from the SMOS mission and the ORCHIDEE land-surface model over the Iberian Peninsula  ap. 69-81.  aThe aim of this study is to compare the surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieved from ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission (SMOS) with the output of the ORCHIDEE (ORganising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic EcosystEm) land surface model forced with two distinct atmospheric data sets for the period 2010 to 2012. The comparison methodology is first established over the REMEDHUS (Red de Estaciones de MEDición de la Humedad def Suelo) soil moisture measurement network, a 30 by 40km catchment located in the central part of the Duero basin, then extended to the whole Iberian Peninsula (IP). The temporal correlation between the in-situ, remotely sensed and modelled SSM are satisfactory (r>0.8). The correlation between remotely sensed and modelled SSM also holds when computed over the IP. Still, by using spectral analysis techniques, important disagreements in the effective inertia of the corresponding moisture reservoir are found. This is reflected in the spatial correlation over the IP between SMOS and ORCHIDEE SSM estimates, which is poor (ρ~0.3). A single value decomposition (SVD) analysis of rainfall and SSM shows that the co-varying patterns of these variables are in reasonable agreement between both products. Moreover the first three SVD soil moisture patterns explain over 80% of the SSM variance simulated by the model while the explained fraction is only 52% of the remotely sensed values. These results suggest that the rainfall-driven soil moisture variability may not account for the poor spatial correlation between SMOS and ORCHIDEE products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite 3abasins 3acarbon 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3amodels 3arain 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3aspectral analysis 3avariance 3awatersheds 3aIberian Peninsula 0aSoil moisture 0aRemote sensing 0aSMOS 0aLand-surface modelling 0aORCHIDEE1 aPiles, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1169-30981 aGelati, Emiliano1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8972-85611 aBarella-Ortiz, Anaïs1 aTello, Marivi0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 174 p.69-81dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014600160300001800306520126600324592002801590650002101618650002201639650002001661650002201681650000901703650001601712650001401728650001701742650001101759650001501770650001901785650001701804650001301821650001501834650001501849650001101864700002301875700002001898773011201918856007502030852000902105655001202114IND60529504020221120185014.0160717e20130903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052950402DNAL7 a10.1021/ac401513j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChow, Cheuk Fai,10aDesign and Synthesis of Heterobimetallic Ru(II)–Ln(III) Complexes as Chemodosimetric Ensembles for the Detection of Biogenic Amine Odorants  ap. 8246-8253.  aThe detection of neutral biogenic amines plays a crucial role in food safety. Three new heterobimetallic Ru(II)–Ln(III) donor-acceptor complexes, KPrRu, KNdRu, and KSmRu, K{[Ru⁽ᴵᴵ⁾(ᵗBubpy)(CN)₄]₂–Ln⁽ᴵᴵᴵ⁾(H₂O)₄} (where ᵗBubpy = 4,4′-di-tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine), have been synthesized and characterized. Their photophysical and X-ray crystallographic data were reported in this study. These complexes were found to be selective for biogenic amine vapors, such as histamine, putrescine, and spermidine, with a detection limit down to the ppb level. The sensitivities of these complexes to the amines were recorded as ∼log K = 3.6–5.0. Submicron rods of the complexes, with a nanoscale diameter and microscale length, were obtained through a simple precipitation process. Free-standing polymeric films with different degrees of porosity were fabricated by blending the submicron rods with polystyrene polymer. The polymer with the highest level of porosity exhibited the strongest luminescence enhancement after amine exposure. Real time monitoring of gaseous biogenic amines was applied to real fish samples (Atlantic mackerel) by studying the spectrofluorimetric responses of the Ru(II)–Ln(III) blended polymer film.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScomber scombrus 3aX-ray diffraction 3adetection limit 3afilms (materials) 3afish 3afood safety 3ahistamine 3aluminescence 3amixing 3amonitoring 3aodor compounds 3apolystyrenes 3aporosity 3aputrescine 3aspermidine 3avapors1 aLam, Michael

In inflamed tissues, overproduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) rapidly react with the endogenous NO, reducing its bioavailability. Here, we developed a controllable NO-releasing redox injectable hydrogel (NO-RIG) formed by the electrostatic crosslinking between the polyion complex flower-type micelles composing of functional polymers to scavenge overproduced ROS and regulate the local NO expression level simultaneously. After the intracardiac injection to mice, NO-RIG converted to gel via physiological temperature-responsive character, distributed homogeneously, and retained in the myocardial tissue for more than 10 d. Treatment with NO-RIG remarkably decreased the infarction size and improved the heart function after myocardial infarction when compared to control injectable hydrogels, such as a simple NO-releasing or ROS-scavenging injectable gels. We found that NO-RIG treatment significantly enhanced the angiogenesis and new blood vessels formation in mice through the regulation of the NO sustained release and redox equilibrium. NO-RIG presents high potential in preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abioavailability 3ablood vessels 3acrosslinking 3ahalf life 3aheart 3ahydrogels 3ainfarction 3amice 3amicelles 3amyocardial infarction 3anitric oxide 3apolymers 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics 3atissues 0aRedox injectable hydrogel 0aNitric oxide delivery 0aReactive oxygen species 0aPolyion complex micelle 0aMyocardial infarction1 aBui, Thang Quoc1 aTomita, Tsutomu1 aSakamoto, Hiroaki1 aHiramatsu, Yuji1 aNagasaki, Yukio0 tBiomaterials.g2018 June, v. 167 p.143-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03914naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245013800171300002000309520205900329592002802388650001302416650002202429650002102451650001702472650001102489650001902500653002502519653001402544653001302558653003302571653004202604653003202646700006402678700006302742700002802805700006302833700002702896700002702923700006502950700006103015700006303076700006303139773014203202856007903344852000903423655001203432IND60756780320221119160551.0211117e20211104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075678032DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c137592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshraf Gandomi, Yasser10aSynthesis and Characterization of Lithium-Conducting Composite Polymer–Ceramic Membranes for Use in Nonaqueous Redox Flow Batteries  ap. 53746-53757.  aRedox flow batteries (RFBs) are a burgeoning electrochemical platform for long-duration energy storage, but present embodiments are too expensive for broad adoption. Nonaqueous redox flow batteries (NAqRFBs) seek to reduce system costs by leveraging the large electrochemical stability window of organic solvents (>3 V) to operate at high cell voltages and to facilitate the use of redox couples that are incompatible with aqueous electrolytes. However, a key challenge for emerging nonaqueous chemistries is the lack of membranes/separators with suitable combinations of selectivity, conductivity, and stability. Single-ion conducting ceramics, integrated into a flexible polymer matrix, may offer a pathway to attain performance attributes needed for enabling competitive nonaqueous systems. Here, we explore composite polymer-inorganic binder-filler membranes for lithium-based NAqRFBs, investigating two different ceramic compounds with NASICON-type (NASICON: sodium (Na) superionic conductor) crystal structure, Li₁.₃Al₀.₃Ti₁.₇(PO₄)₃ (LATP) and Li₁.₄Al₀.₄Ge₀.₂Ti₁.₄(PO₄)₃ (LAGTP), each blended with a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) polymeric matrix. We characterize the physicochemical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized membranes as a function of processing conditions and formulation using a range of microscopic and electrochemical techniques. Importantly, the electrochemical stability window of the as-prepared membranes lies between 2.2–4.5 V vs Li/Li⁺. We then integrate select composite membranes into a single electrolyte flow cell configuration and perform polarization measurements with different redox electrolyte compositions. We find that mechanically robust, chemically stable LATP/PVDF composites can support >40 mA cm–² at 400 mV cell overpotential, but further improvements are needed in selectivity. Overall, the insights gained through this work begin to establish the foundational knowledge needed to advance composite polymer-inorganic membranes/separators for NAqRFBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aceramics 3acrystal structure 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3asodium 3athermoplastics 0aredox flow batteries 0aseparator 0amembrane 0alithium superionic conductor 0acomposite polymer−ceramic membranes 0anonaqueous electrochemistry1 aKrasnikova, Irina V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5256-50921 aAkhmetov, Nikita O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9579-68381 aOvsyannikov, Nikolay A.1 aPogosova, Mariam A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4441-83721 aMatteucci, Nicholas J.1 aMallia, Christopher T.1 aNeyhouse, Bertrand J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6747-81971 aFenton, Alexis M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2195-94081 aBrushett, Fikile R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7361-66371 aStevenson, Keith J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1082-28710 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 04, v. 13, no. 45 p.53746-53757dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c137593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02700naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001600295520128000311592002801591650002201619650002001641650002101661650001001682650001801692650002301710650003201733650002801765650001001793653001501803653001301818653000801831653003101839700001301870700001701883700001801900700001601918700001601934700001501950700001301965700001201978700001601990773012102006856008202127852000902209655001202218IND60560209620221119164120.0170720e20170129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056020962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.12.1262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xihong10aDiurnal variations in polyunsaturated fatty acid contents and expression of genes involved in their de novo synthesis in pigs  ap. 430-434.  aThe daily variations in circulating fatty acid (FA) contents and lipid metabolism have been well documented. However, whether long chain polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) contents and expression of genes involved in their de novo synthesis exhibit daily rhythms are yet unknown. We conducted the present study to investigate the daily variations in PUFA contents in plasma and liver of pigs. Moreover, diurnal expression of genes encode fatty acid desaturases and elongases, which are key enzymes catalyzed de novo synthesis of long chain PUFA, were also explored. The results showed that long chain PUFA contents in plasma and liver both exhibited diurnal rhythms. Diurnal variations were also observed in mRNA expression of FASD1 (Delta 5-desaturase), FASD2 (Delta 6-desaturase), ELOVL5 (fatty acid elongase 5) and ELOVL2 in liver, with an unexpectedly high level at night. Moreover, our results showed a similarity between the diurnal patterns of FASD1, FASD2, ELOVL2, ELOVL5 and Period 2. These results indicated a high activity of the desaturase-elongase pathway at night in pigs. These findings have important physiological and pathophysiological implications, since long chain PUFA are essential for cell function and closely involved in the development of metabolic syndrome.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiurnal variation 3agene expression 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic syndrome 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3aswine 0aDesaturase 0aElongase 0aPig 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acid1 aWan, Dan1 aZhang, Yumei1 aZhang, Yiming1 aLong, Cimin1 aChen, Shuai1 aHe, Liuqin1 aTan, Bie1 aWu, Xin1 aYin, Yulong0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Jan. 29, v. 483 p.430-434dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.12.1263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245009400162300001600256520195100272592002802223650001802251650002302269650001702292650001102309650001402320650001702334650001502351650002202366650001902388650000902407650002002416650002502436650002502461651001002486653002402496653002802520653004002548653001902588653002502607700001402632700001702646700001502663700001802678773009902696856008102795852000902876655001202885IND60563189720221120163342.0170719e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056318972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Jian10aSpatiotemporal patterns of remotely sensed PM2.5 concentration in China from 1999 to 2011  ap. 109-121.  aAir pollution in the form of fine particulate matter, or PM2.5, can decrease human life expectancy and increase the overall mortality rate. Based on a time series of remotely sensed PM2.5 concentrations, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of this crucial pollutant in China from 1999 to 2011 using trend analysis and standard deviation ellipse analysis, and carried out a health risk assessment of human exposure to PM2.5. The results showed that PM2.5 concentrations increased significantly from 1999 to 2011 in China, especially in the central and eastern parts of the country. The proportion of areas with PM2.5 concentrations higher than 35μg/m3 increased year by year, and the areas with PM2.5 concentrations lower than the annual primary standard of 15μg/m3 decreased continuously. The areas most polluted by PM2.5 were south of Hebei, north of Henan and west of Shandong provinces, with changes in the overall spatial distribution of the pollutant occurring faster along a south–north axis than along an east–west axis, and also faster along an east–south axis than along a west–north axis. Based on the PM2.5 concentrations in China from 1999 to 2011, a two-tier standard (level-I and level-II) was proposed for delineated areas to assist in nationwide air pollution control. It was also found that the proportion of the population exposed to PM2.5 concentrations greater than 35μg/m3 increased year by year, and increased faster than the proportion of population exposed to PM2.5 concentrations in the range 15–35μg/m3. The health risk in the central and eastern areas of the country was the highest. Based on these results, PM2.5 pollution poses an increasingly serious risk to human health across China and there is an immediate need to implement its regional control. In addition, more attention should be paid at the national scale in terms of pollution risk, rather than focusing narrowly on a city scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aat-risk population 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3amortality 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3apollution control 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3astatistical analysis 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aPM2.5 concentration 0aSpatiotemporal patterns 0aStandard deviation ellipse analysis 0aZoning control 0aHealth risk exposure1 aChen, Sha1 aLü, Huiling1 aLiu, Yanxu1 aWu, Jiansheng0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 174 p.109-121dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005600144245013400200300002000334520116700354592002801521650002201549650001701571650001401588650001101602650001301613650002201626650001401648650002201662650001301684650001701697650003701714650002201751650003701773653001901810653002101829653001801850653001301868653002601881653001301907700001101920700001201931700001401943700001901957700005801976700005702034773014202091856007802233852000902311655001202320IND60619471820221120024955.0181102e20181008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061947182DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.8b102992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lu-Lu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2277-392010aPolydopamine-Derived Nitrogen-Doped Carbon-Covered Na₃V₂(PO₄)₂F₃ Cathode Material for High-Performance Na-Ion Batteries  ap. 36851-36859.  aNitrogen-doped carbon-covered Na₃V₂(PO₄)₂F₃ (NVPF/C-PDPA) composites have been successfully prepared by self-polymerization of dopamine on the NVPF surface and subsequent sintering. The X-ray diffraction results show that the NVPF/C-PDPA has good crystallinity and introducing dopamine does not affect the lattice structure of NVPF. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, high-angle annular dark-field images, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analyses reveal that the NVPF/C-PDPA particles are covered by a complete and uniform covering layer, which is effective at preventing corrosion of NVPF in the electrolyte to greatly increase cycling stability. Furthermore, N-doping into the carbon layer can produce additional active sites to improve the capacity especially the rate capacity. Such a NVPF/C-PDPA electrode delivers a remarkable rate capacity (98.0 mA h g–¹ at 10 C) and superior cycle performance (∼95.8% capacity retention at 10 C after 800 cycles). We believe that this work may be beneficial for accelerating the development of high-performance electrode materials and the commercialization of Na-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acathodes 3acommercialization 3acorrosion 3acrystal structure 3adopamine 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amaterials science 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aNa-ion battery 0acathode material 0aNa3V2(PO4)2F3 0adopamine 0anitrogen-doped carbon 0acovering1 aMa, Di1 aLi, Tao1 aLiu, Jing1 aDing, Xiao-Kai1 aHuang, Yun-Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3852-70381 aYang, Xue-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5626-701X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2018 Oct. 08, v. 10, no. 43 p.36851-36859dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.8b102993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012500157300001800282520141400300592002801714650002101742650002801763650002001791650001801811650001801829650001201847650001801859700002001877700001801897700001701915700002101932700001501953700001701968700001901985700002002004700001602024773011202040856007502152852000902227655001202236IND60529504420221120184825.0160717e20130903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052950442DNAL7 a10.1021/ac401581u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Ying Wei,10aBAD-Lectins: Boronic Acid-Decorated Lectins with Enhanced Binding Affinity for the Selective Enrichment of Glycoproteins  ap. 8268-8276.  aThe weak and variable binding affinities exhibited by lectin–carbohydrate interactions have often compromised the practical utility of lectin in capturing glycoproteins for glycoproteomic applications. We report here the development and applications of a new type of hybrid biomaterial, namely a boronic acid-decorated lectin (BAD-lectin), for efficient bifunctional glycoprotein labeling and enrichment. Our binding studies showed an enhanced affinity by BAD-lectin, likely to be mediated via the formation of boronate ester linkages between the lectin and glycan subsequent to the initial recognition process and thus preserving its glycan-specificity. Moreover, when attached to magnetic nanoparticles (BAD-lectin@MNPs), 2 to 60-fold improvement on detection sensitivity and enrichment efficiency for specific glycoproteins was observed over the independent use of either lectin or BA. Tested at the level of whole cell lysates for glycoproteomic applications, three different types of BAD-lectin@MNPs exhibited excellent specificities with only 6% overlapping among the 295 N-linked glycopeptides identified. As many as 236 N-linked glycopeptides (80%) were uniquely identified by one of the BAD-lectin@MNPs. These results indicated that the enhanced glycan-selective recognition and binding affinity of BAD-lectin@MNPs will facilitate a complementary identification of the under-explored glycoproteome.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3abiocompatible materials 3adetection limit 3aglycopeptides 3aglycoproteins 3alectins 3ananoparticles1 aChien, Chih-Wei1 aLin, Po-Chiao1 aHuang, Li-De1 aChen, Chang-Yang1 aWu, Sz-Wei1 aHan, Chia-Li1 aKhoo, Kay-Hooi1 aLin, Chun-Cheng1 aChen, Yu-Ju0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2013 Sept. 03, v. 85, no. 17 p.8268-8276dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac401581u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02583naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008100165300001600246520143800262592002801700650002001728650001301748650002101761650001801782650001501800650000901815650002401824653002301848653001801871653001001889653002401899653002101923700002101944700001701965773012401982856008202106852000902188655001202197IND60081492420221119105844.0200513e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008149242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-013-0434-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkita, Hiromi10aEffect of climate and structure on the progression of wooden check dam decay  ap. 450-460.  aTo gain better understanding of rates of decay of wooden check dams with different structures under different climate conditions, several dams of this type were examined under different environmental conditions over a 3 to 5-year period post-construction. Because a linear relationship was found between the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of pilodyn penetration depth, mean penetration depth was taken as the indicator of deterioration, and relationships with check dam structural features and climate data recorded by AMEDAS were investigated. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that temperature, climate index (CI) computed from rain days, warmth index computed from daily and annual mean air temperature, and altitude were the climate variables with the most effect on the rate of decay. With regard to dam structural features, factors such as specific discharge rate, water through width, dam length, and dam height had the most effect. Accordingly, in an effort to summarize the effects of climatic conditions and structural features, CI, altitude, and dam height were extracted as the most significant explanatory variables, and a formula for prediction of μ was obtained for each factor for up to 5 years post construction. The results showed that by taking into consideration regional conditions and calculating CI values from AMEDAS data, it is possible to predict the extent of decay of wooden check dams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3aclimatic factors 3alinear models 3aprediction 3arain 3aregression analysis 0aClimate conditions 0aClimate index 0aDecay 0aStructural features 0aWooden check dam1 aKitahara, Hikaru1 aOno, Hiroshi0 tJournal of forest research.g2014 Oct. 1, v. 19, no. 5 p.450-460dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-013-0434-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245007700155300001600232520136900248592002801617650002501645650001801670650002301688650002301711650001401734650002201748650001601770650001201786650001301798650001601811650002101827650001701848650001701865650002001882650001401902650001001916650001101926650002001937650001301957653001601970653001201986653001201998700001902010700002402029700001502053700001402068700002002082700001902102773013102121856007102252852000902323655001202332IND60706355920221119081358.0200807e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070635592DNAL7 a10.18805/LR-4692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiladinov, Z.10aPriming seed mitigates the effects of saline stress in soybean seedlings  ap. 263-267.  aSeed germination and seedling growth are the most sensitive plant stages towards salinity. Various techniques can improve emergence and stand formation under salt conditions. Seeds priming is one of the most frequently used technique. Seed priming could develop different defence mechanisms of seeds against salinity stress. This experiment aims to examine the seed priming into potassium nitrate-KNO₃ (1%), ascorbic acid - ASA (100mgl⁻¹) and potassium chloride-KCl (1%) solutions, that may reduce harmful effects of salinity stress. Salinity was imposed by treatment of seeds with different concentrations of NaCl [0 (control), 50, 100, 200m MNaCl]. All data were analysed statistically by three-way ANOVA. Individual testing of probability was carried out using Tukey's method p ≧ 0.05 and p ≧ 0.01. Correlation dependence was determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Test results demonstrated positive effect of seed priming. This was showed by improved soybean seed quality and increased seed germination rate. The intensity of lipid peroxidation, free proline concentration and Na+ was decreased, while K⁺ in seedlings increased due to priming treatment. Priming of seeds into ASA solution resulted in increased vitamin C concentration, while priming into KNO₃ and MCl solutions reduced the content of vitamin C in soybean seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aascorbic acid 3adefense mechanisms 3alipid peroxidation 3apotassium 3apotassium nitrate 3aprobability 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3aseed priming 3aseed quality 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3asoybeans 0aGermination 0aPriming 0aSoybean1 aMaksimovic, I.1 aTubic, S.

E354-E363.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPericentriolar material (PCM) recruitment to centrioles forms a key step in centrosome biogenesis. Deregulation of this process leads to centrosome aberrations causing disorders, one of which is autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH), a neurodevelopmental disorder where brain size is reduced. During PCM recruitment, the conserved centrosomal protein Sas-4/CPAP/MCPH6, known to play a role in centriole formation, acts as a scaffold for cytoplasmic PCM complexes to bind and then tethers them to centrioles to form functional centrosomes. To understand Sas-4’s tethering role, we determined the crystal structure of its T complex protein 10 (TCP) domain displaying a solvent-exposed single-layer of β-sheets fold. This unique feature of the TCP domain suggests that it could provide an “extended surface-like” platform to tether the Sas-4–PCM scaffold to a centriole. Functional studies in Drosophila , human cells, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells were used to test this hypothesis, where point mutations within the 9–10th β-strands (β9–10 mutants including a MCPH-associated mutation) perturbed PCM tethering while allowing Sas-4/CPAP to scaffold cytoplasmic PCM complexes. Specifically, the Sas-4 β9–10 mutants displayed perturbed interactions with Ana2, a centrosome duplication factor, and Bld-10, a centriole microtubule-binding protein, suggesting a role for the β9–10 surface in mediating protein–protein interactions for efficient Sas-4–PCM scaffold centriole tethering. Hence, we provide possible insights into how centrosomal protein defects result in human MCPH and how Sas-4 proteins act as a vehicle to tether PCM complexes to centrioles independent of its well-known role in centriole duplication.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3abiogenesis 3abrain 3acentrioles 3acrystal structure 3ahumans 3amutants 3apoint mutation 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins 3astem cells1 aGooi, Li Ming1 aWason, Arpit1 aGabriel, Elke1 aMehrjardi, Narges Zare1 aYang, Qian1 aZhang, Xingrun1 aDebec, Alain1 aBasiri, Marcus L.1 aAvidor-Reiss, Tomer1 aPozniakovsky, Andrei1 aPoser, Ina1 aŠarić, Tomo1 aHyman, Anthony A.1 aLi, Haitao1 aGopalakrishnan, Jay0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Jan. 21, v. 111, no. 3 p.E354-E363dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13175351113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001300197245013700210300001600347506007600363520164600439592002802085506003702113650001602150650002602166650001402192650001502206650001902221650002602240650001102266650001502277650002602292650002102318650001802339650001302357650001602370650002402386650003302410653002702443653002102470653001802491653000802509653004702517700001302564700001402577700001602591700001902607700001802626700002002644700001702664700001702681700001502698773009302713856009102806852000902897655001202906IND60593010020221207091901.0190502e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059301002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0252doi7 aPMC58897382pmcid7 a295710492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Fan10aLanthanide-doped nanoparticles conjugated with an anti-CD33 antibody and a p53-activating peptide for acute myeloid leukemia therapy  ap. 132-142.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRoughly one third of all human cancers are attributable to the functional inhibition of the tumor suppressor protein p53 by its two negative regulators MDM2 and MDMX, making dual-specificity peptide antagonists of MDM2 and MDMX highly attractive drug candidates for anticancer therapy. Two pharmacological barriers, however, remain a major obstacle to the development of peptide therapeutics: susceptibility to proteolytic degradation in vivo and inability to traverse the cell membrane. Here we report the design of a fluorescent lanthanide oxyfluoride nanoparticle (LONp)-based multifunctional peptide drug delivery system for potential treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that commonly harbors wild type p53, high levels of MDM2 and/or MDMX, and an overexpressed cell surface receptor, CD33. We conjugated to LONp via metal-thiolate bonds a dodecameric peptide antagonist of both MDM2 and MDMX, termed PMI, and a CD33-targeted, humanized monoclonal antibody to allow for AML-specific intracellular delivery of a stabilized PMI. The resultant nanoparticle antiCD33-LONp-PMI, while nontoxic to normal cells, induced apoptosis of AML cell lines and primary leukemic cells isolated from AML patients by antagonizing MDM2 and/or MDMX to activate the p53 pathway. Fluorescent antiCD33-LONp-PMI also enabled real-time visualization of a series of apoptotic events in AML cells, proving a useful tool for possible disease tracking and treatment response monitoring. Our studies shed light on the development of antiCD33-LONp-PMI as a novel class of antitumor agents, which, if further validated, may help targeted molecular therapy of AML.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantagonists 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3acell membranes 3adrug delivery systems 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amyeloid leukemia 3ananoparticles 3apatients 3aproteolysis 3arare earth elements 3atumor suppressor protein p53 0aAcute myeloid leukemia 0aPeptide delivery 0aCD33 antibody 0ap53 0aLanthanide-doped theranostic nanoparticles1 aYan, Jin1 aMa, Bohan1 aLi, Shichao1 aShao, Yongping1 aHe, Pengcheng1 aZhang, Wanggang1 aHe, Wangxiao1 aMa, Peter X.1 aLu, Wuyuan0 tBiomaterials.g2018 June, v. 167 p.132-142dElsevier LtdwJournal:11782x0142-96127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147242061500208245013900823300001800962520166100980592002802641596005102669650001302720650001702733650001002750650002702760650001302787650002402800650001502824650001702839651001202856700001902868700001902887773012902906856008203035852000903117655001203126IND60609048120221119162845.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060904812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-018-1745-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTamayo-Mas, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2029-140X10aImpact de la complexité du modèle et de l’intégration de données multi-échelles sur l'évaluation des paramètres hydrogéologiques dans un aquifère à double porosité Impacto de la complejidad del modelo y de la integración de datos de múltiples escalas en la estimación de los parámetros hidrogeológicos en un acuífero de doble porosidad 模型复杂性及多尺度数据综合对估算双重孔隙介质含水层水文地质参数的影响 Impacto da complexidade do modelo e integração de dados de multiescala na estimativa dos parâmetros hidrogreológicos em aquífero de porosidade dual10aImpact of model complexity and multi-scale data integration on the estimation of hydrogeological parameters in a dual-porosity aquifer  ap. 1917-1933.  aThis study investigates the impact of model complexity and multi-scale prior hydrogeological data on the interpretation of pumping test data in a dual-porosity aquifer (the Chalk aquifer in England, UK). In order to characterize the hydrogeological properties, different approaches ranging from a traditional analytical solution (Theis approach) to more sophisticated numerical models with automatically calibrated input parameters are applied. Comparisons of results from the different approaches show that neither traditional analytical solutions nor a numerical model assuming a homogenous and isotropic aquifer can adequately explain the observed drawdowns. A better reproduction of the observed drawdowns in all seven monitoring locations is instead achieved when medium and local-scale prior information about the vertical hydraulic conductivity (K) distribution is used to constrain the model calibration process. In particular, the integration of medium-scale vertical K variations based on flowmeter measurements lead to an improvement in the goodness-of-fit of the simulated drawdowns of about 30%. Further improvements (up to 70%) were observed when a simple upscaling approach was used to integrate small-scale K data to constrain the automatic calibration process of the numerical model. Although the analysis focuses on a specific case study, these results provide insights about the representativeness of the estimates of hydrogeological properties based on different interpretations of pumping test data, and promote the integration of multi-scale data for the characterization of heterogeneous aquifers in complex hydrogeological settings.  aPublisher supplied data  aNEE5413ScNatural Environment Research Council 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3achalk 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aisotropy 3amathematical models 3amonitoring 3areproduction 3aEngland1 aBianchi, Marco1 aMansour, Majdi0 tHydrogeology journal.g2018 Sept., v. 26, no. 6 p.1917-1933dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-1745-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03792naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245017900203520208500382592002802467650001502495650001502510650001102525650002002536650001502556650001902571650001102590650001402601650001802615650001702633650001302650650001402663650001302677650001702690650001402707650002502721650001602746653001502762653002702777653004102804653003002845653002502875700001102900700001502911700001802926700001802944700001502962700001902977700001602996700001303012773010703025856008503132852000903217655001203226IND60758301620221121014441.0220314e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075830162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2021.1124302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3182-890610aLow consumption and portable technology for dithionite detection based on potassium ferricyanide differential spectrophotometry method in related advanced oxidation processes  aCarbon neutrality has been received more attention and emerged in wastewater treatment processes. Due to the development of treating technologies with the rising of new-emerging pollutants, the coupled chemical processes also should remain current for the goal of carbon-neutral operation. Among of those updated strategies, several advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) based on dithionite (DTN, S₂O₄²⁻), a common water treatment agent, have been established for refractory organic contaminations removal. However, in terms of DTN detection, the traditional formol-titration method has several application limits including the low detection sensitivity and high consumption of formaldehyde. In this study, compared with traditional method, a low energy consumption technology has been developed based on the potassium ferricyanide with the carbon consumption decreasing by about 5 times. Moreover, detection limit of DTN (mmol/L level) also was lower than the titration method. The method was established based on the fact that every 1 mol of DTN can react with 2 mol [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻ under alkaline condition. According to that potassium ferricyanide (K₃ [Fe(CN)₆]) has the maximum absorption at 419 nm wavelength, a fitting equation based on the linear relationship between the absorbance variation of K₃ [Fe(CN)₆] and DTN amount in the ranges of 0–30 μmol with the detection limit of 0.6 μmol was established with the determination coefficient of 0.99935. It was found that there was no obvious influence of the ubiquitous foreign species with the amount lower than 6 mM, 4 mM, 6 mM, 4 mM and 1 mg/L for Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻, NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻ and NOM, respectively. Moreover, methanol and tert-butanol were employed to verify the influence of the presence of organic matters on the determination of DTN and no impact was observed in this study. The proposed method provides a new way for DTN detection with stable and countable performance in the related AOPs with the low electric energy and carbon source consumption and high detection efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3adetection limit 3adithionite 3aelectric power 3aenergy 3aequations 3aferricyanides 3aformaldehyde 3amethanol 3aoxidation 3aresearch 3aspectroscopy 3atitration 3awastewater treatment 3awavelengths 0aDithionite 0aPotassium ferricyanide 0aLow consumption detection technology 0aSpectrophotometric method 0aAbsorbance variation1 aLi, Ji1 aFu, Caixia1 aWang, Zhuoyue1 aWang, Zhihong1 aWang, Qiao1 aZhang, Xiaolei1 aZhou, Yuxin1 aDu, Xing0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 205 p.112430-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.1124303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002700140245012100167500001900288520138300307592002801690650001801718650001801736650002101754650001901775650000901794650001701803650001701820650001401837650002201851650001501873650001701888650001701905700002701922700002501949700002801974700002702002700002902029700002402058700002202082700002502104773012202129856007402251852000902325655001202334IND60735235820221117053534.0210423e20210329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073523582DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130411142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazzutti, Fernanda  S.10aBreast Cancer Survivors Undergoing Endocrine Therapy Have a Worrying Risk Factor Profile for Cardiovascular Diseases  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe increased risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in breast cancer survivors has been widely discussed in the literature and occurs due to the cardiotoxicity of antineoplastic treatments, and also to the common risk factors between these diseases. Thus, the objective of our study was to evaluate, prospectively, the number of risk factors (NRF) for CVDs in women during endocrine therapy, and to associate the NRF with C reactive protein (CRP) and phase angle (PhA). The following risk factors for CVD were evaluated at three times: anthracycline chemotherapy, radiotherapy, comorbidities, inadequate diet, overweight, abdominal adiposity, alcoholism, smoking, physical inactivity and altered lipid profile. There was inadequacy in the most components of the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index—Revised and inadequate consumption of various types of fats and fibers. Most women in this study presented excessive abdominal fat and overweight, but these parameters have not changed over time (p < 0.005). Moreover, a high frequency of systemic arterial hypertension and physical inactivity was observed. The average NRF for CVDs was above ten, at the three evaluation times. Women with higher NRF had higher levels of CRP (p = 0.003), a predictor of cardiovascular risk, however, there was no significance with PhA (p = 0.256). Thus, intervention is needed to improve lifestyle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal fat 3aalcohol abuse 3abreast neoplasms 3acardiotoxicity 3adiet 3adrug therapy 3ahypertension 3alifestyle 3alipid composition 3aoverweight 3aradiotherapy 3arisk factors1 aCustódio, Isis  D.

We present the evidence that eating disorders and obesity can be managed or prevented using the same interventions in the pediatric age. In the presence of obesity in the pediatric age, disordered eating behaviors are highly prevalent, increasing the risk of developing eating disorders. The most frequently observed in subjects with obesity are bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorders, both of which are characterized by abnormal eating or weight-control behaviors. Various are the mechanisms overlying the interaction including environmental and individual ones, and different are the approaches to reduce the consequences. Evidence-based treatments for obesity and eating disorders in childhood include as first line approaches weight loss with nutritional management and lifestyle modification via behavioral psychotherapy, as well as treatment of psychiatric comorbidities if those are not a consequence of the eating disorder. Drugs and bariatric surgery need to be used in extreme cases. Future research is necessary for early detection of risk factors for prevention, more precise elucidation of the mechanisms that underpin these problems and, finally, in the cases requiring therapeutic intervention, to provide tailored and timely treatment. Collective efforts between the fields are crucial for reducing the factors of health disparity and improving public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3abariatric surgery 3abulimia nervosa 3achildhood 3alifestyle 3aobesity 3apsychotherapy 3aweight control 3aweight loss1 aErdine, Serap 1 aSuurorg, Lagle 1 aJankauskienė, Augustina 1 aLurbe, Empar 0 tNutrients.g2021 Nov. 29, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131243213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001600260520119200276592002801468650004001496650001601536650001701552650002001569650001201589650001601601650001001617650001501627650001601642650002701658650001401685700002001699700001601719773011101735856008201846852000901928655001201937IND60768656420221119225133.0220226e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076865642DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-009-0341-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShih, Chun-Ching10aAmeliorative effects of Vaccaria segetalis extract on osteopenia in ovariectomized rats  ap. 386-392.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine the ameliorative effects of a crude extract of Vaccaria segetalis (Neck.) Garcke (Caryophyllaceae) (VSE) on osteopenia in ovariectomized (OVX) rats over 12 weeks. Rats were divided into the sham and OVX groups. The OVX rats were allowed to lose bone for 6 weeks. At 6 weeks post-OVX, the OVX rats were divided into four groups treated with water, 17β-estradiol (30 μg/kg, daily subcutaneous injection), or VSE (0.5 or 1.0 g/kg, daily, orally) for 6 weeks. In OVX rats, the increases of serum total cholesterol were significantly decreased by VSE or 17β-estradiol treatment. There were decreases in bone density and calcium content, including the left femur and the fourth lumbar vertebra, when compared with the sham control rats. Treatment with 17β-estradiol or VSE ameliorated these changes induced by OVX. In addition, ovariectomy increased urinary deoxypyridinoline (DPD) amounts (P < 0.001). The increases were suppressed by 17β-estradiol and 0.5 or 1.0 g/kg VSE (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.01, respectively). Our results demonstrated that VSE ameliorates ovariectomy-induced osteopenia by inhibition of bone resorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccaria hispanica subsp. hispanica 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone resorption 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3afemur 3aosteopenia 3aovariectomy 3asubcutaneous injection 3avertebrae1 aLin, Cheng-Hsiu1 aLin, Wei-Li0 tNatural medicines.g2009 Oct., v. 63, no. 4 p.386-392dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-009-0341-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245013100175300001600306520128100322592002801603650002101631650002401652650001801676650001201694650001001706650001501716650001301731650001301744650000901757650001501766650001801781650001701799700001901816700002101835773008401856856009001940852000902030655001202039IND60090287620221120051629.0141102e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009028762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2010.09.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKido, Yuichiro12aA gene transfection for rat mesenchymal stromal cells in biodegradable gelatin scaffolds containing cationized polysaccharides  ap. 919-925.  aThe objective of this study was to design three-dimensional scaffolds of bone marrow-derived stem cells capable of their gene transfection and evaluate the transfection extent.

The spermine–pullulan was mixed with a luciferase plasmid DNA to prepare their polyion complex. The scaffolds were treated with succinylated gelatin (suc-gel) at different concentrations, treated in different methods of freeze-drying and dehydrothermal treatment, and placed in the aqueous of complexes to prepare various scaffolds containing the complex. When the stem cells were seeded into the scaffolds to evaluate the gene transfection of cells, the level of plasmid DNA transfection depended on the method of complex containing scaffolds preparation. The complexes were released with time from the scaffolds although the release profile depended on the type of scaffolds. The order of gene transfection for the stem cells in the scaffolds was in good accordance with that of plasmid DNA released.

The present study aims at (i) investigating the bioaccumulation performance for 12 elements in one-year-old lobes of Flavoparmelia caperata and Xanthoria parietina (i.e. the two lichen native biomonitors most used in the peri-Mediterranean regions) collected side-by-side on the same trees at 17 sampling sites. Both species were characterized morphologically and by X-ray diffraction analysis to evaluate specific thallus area and oxalate content, respectively. Results show that Ca and chalcophile elements (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) were more concentrated in F. caperata, lithophile and siderophile elements (Cr, Fe, and Ti) in X. parietina, whereas Al, Li, Mn, and Ni were accumulated in similar amounts. The outstanding content of Ca-oxalate deposits in F. caperata underlies the higher content of Ca, Cd and Pb observed in this species. On the contrary, the micro-anatomy of the upper cortex of X. parietina, which is more porous than in F. caperata, allows a higher transfer of litophile and siderophile elements. The adoption of interspecific calibration factors for biomonitoring purposes is thoroughly discussed, and the choice of using a single native species made by the most recent guidelines for biomonitoring airborne elements with lichens is fully supported.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aXanthoria 3aallopatry 3abioaccumulation 3acalcium oxalate 3acortex 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aindicator species 3aindigenous species 3alichens 3athallus 0aBiomonitoring 0aFlavoparmelia caperata 0aLichen substances 0aOxalates 0aXanthoria parietina1 aAdami, Gianpiero1 aPrincivalle, Francesco1 aTretiach, Mauro0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 782 p.146360-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1463603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245010300168300001600271520120500287592002801492650001701520650002501537650001901562650001901581650001801600650003101618650001101649650001901660650001101679650002301690650001901713650001201732650001701744650002401761650005201785650001501837650002901852650002601881653002401907653001101931653001001942653001701952653001701969700001801986700001802004700001902022700001902041700002002060700001902080773011002099856007902209852000902288655001202297IND60565344120221120044218.0170321e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056534412DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2016.38332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRivera-Piza, Adriana10aProtocatechuic Acid Enhances Osteogenesis, but Inhibits Adipogenesis in C3H10T1/2 and 3T3-L1 Cells  ap. 309-319.  aAbnormal activation of adipogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and preadipocyte cells is associated with human metabolic disorders, such as osteoporosis and obesity. This study investigated the biological effects of protocatechuic acid (PCA) on the modulation of osteogenesis and adipogenesis in cultured cells. PCA stimulation of MSCs significantly increased intracellular mineralization during osteogenesis, but reduced lipid accumulation in both MSCs and 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells during adipogenesis. Reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analyses showed a dose-dependent upregulation of proosteogenic runt-related transcription factor 2 due to induction of β-catenin. PCA reduced the expression of proadipogenic transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, and suppressed its promotor activity. These results suggest PCA exerts stimulatory effects on the osteogenesis of MSCs and inhibitory effects on the adipogenesis of MSCs and 3T3-L1 cells. PCA may contribute to maintain a coordinated metabolic balance between adipogenesis and osteogenesis, and thus may be useful for the prevention and alleviation of osteoporosis and obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3abioactive properties 3abone formation 3acultured cells 3adose response 3agene expression regulation 3ahumans 3aimmunoblotting 3alipids 3ametabolic diseases 3amineralization 3aobesity 3aosteoporosis 3aprotocatechuic acid 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aprotocatechuic acid 0aPPARγ 0aRUNX2 0aosteogenesis 0aadipogenesis1 aAn, Young Jae1 aKim, Do Kyung1 aLee, Sung-Hyen1 aKim, Jung-Bong1 aChoi, Jung-Sook1 aLee, Sung-Joon0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 20, no. 3 p.309-319dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-76007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fjmf.2016.38333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245008100165500001900246520151000265592002801775650002201803650001101825650001701836650002401853650001501877650001201892650001301904650002201917650001301939650001501952650001901967650002401986650001202010650001702022650001002039650001802049650001502067700002002082700002302102700002302125700002202148700002402170773012002194856007302314852000902387655001202396IND60715417220221121055718.0201026e20201009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071541722DNAL7 a10.3390/w121027992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutinova, Petra  Thea10aBenthic Diatom Communities in Urban Streams and the Role of Riparian Buffers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUrbanization impacts stream ecosystems globally through degraded water quality, altered hydrology, and landscape disturbances at the catchment and riparian scales, causing biodiversity losses and altered system functioning. Addressing the “urban stream syndrome” requires multiple mitigation tools, and rehabilitation of riparian vegetation may help improve stream ecological status and provide key ecosystem services. However, the extent to which forested riparian buffers can help support stream biodiversity in the face of numerous environmental contingencies remains uncertain. We assessed how a key indicator of stream ecological status, benthic diatoms, respond to riparian habitat conditions using 10 urban site pairs (each comprising of one unbuffered and one buffered reach), and additional urban downstream and forest reference upstream sites in the Oslo Fjord basin. Diatom communities were structured by multiple drivers including spatial location, land use, water quality, and instream habitat. Among these, riparian habitat condition independently explained 16% of variation in community composition among site pairs. Changes in community structure and indicator taxa, along with a reduction in pollution-tolerant diatoms, suggested tangible benefits of forested riparian buffers for stream biodiversity in urban environments. Managing urban impacts requires multiple solutions, with forested riparian zones providing a potential tool to help improve biodiversity and ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aindicator species 3aland use 3alandscapes 3ariparian areas 3ariparian vegetation 3astreams 3aurbanization 3awater 3awater quality 3awatersheds1 aKahlert, Maria 1 aKupilas, Benjamin 1 aMcKie, Brendan  G.1 aFriberg, Nikolai 1 aBurdon, Francis  J.0 tWater.g2020 Oct. 09, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121027993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03628naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147242051400167245013000681300001800811520169200829592002802521596011302549650001302662650001902675650001702694650003302711650001602744650002702760650002102787650002402808650001002832651001002842700001802852700002102870700002302891700002102914700001902935700002002954773012902974856008203103852000903185655001203194IND60609048420221119162746.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060904842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-018-1740-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrrutia, Javier10aHydrogéologie et future exploitation durable d’eau souterraine au sein de l’aquifère d’Agua Verde dans le désert d’Atacama, Nord du Chili Hidrogeología y futura explotación sostenible de agua subterránea del acuífero Agua Verde en el Desierto de Atacama, norte de Chile 智利北部Atacama沙漠Agua Verde含水层水文地质状况及未来可持续的开采量 Hidrogeologia e abstrações futuras de águas subterrâneas a partir do aquífero Agua Verde no Deserto do Atacama, norte do Chile10aHydrogeology and sustainable future groundwater abstraction from the Agua Verde aquifer in the Atacama Desert, northern Chile  ap. 1989-2007.  aThe hyper-arid conditions prevailing in Agua Verde aquifer in northern Chile make this system the most important water source for nearby towns and mining industries. Due to the growing demand for water in this region, recharge is investigated along with the impact of intense pumping activity in this aquifer. A conceptual model of the hydrogeological system is developed and implemented into a two-dimensional groundwater-flow numerical model. To assess the impact of climate change and groundwater extraction, several scenarios are simulated considering variations in both aquifer recharge and withdrawals. The estimated average groundwater lateral recharge from Precordillera (pre-mountain range) is about 4,482 m³/day. The scenarios that consider an increase of water withdrawal show a non-sustainable groundwater consumption leading to an over-exploitation of the resource, because the outflows surpasses inflows, causing storage depletion. The greater the depletion, the larger the impact of recharge reduction caused by the considered future climate change. This result indicates that the combined effects of such factors may have a severe impact on groundwater availability as found in other groundwater-dependent regions located in arid environments. Furthermore, the scenarios that consider a reduction of the extraction flow rate show that it may be possible to partially alleviate the damage already caused to the aquifer by the continuous extractions since 1974, and it can partially counteract climate change impacts on future groundwater availability caused by a decrease in precipitation (and so in recharge), if the desalination plant in Taltal increases its capacity.  aPublisher supplied data  aCONICYT-PCHA/Doctorado Nacional/2016-21161345 PhDcFondo de Fomento al Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico 3aaquifers 3aclimate change 3adesalination 3adry environmental conditions 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3agroundwater flow 3amathematical models 3atowns 3aChile1 aJódar, Jorge1 aMedina, Agustín1 aHerrera, Christian1 aChong, Guillermo1 aUrqueta, Harry1 aLuque, José A.0 tHydrogeology journal.g2018 Sept., v. 26, no. 6 p.1989-2007dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-1740-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147242054000169245013200709300001800841520189700859592002802756650001302784650001602797650002102813650002502834650001802859650001202877650002402889650001102913650000902924650002002933650001202953650001302965700001802978700001602996700001903012700001303031773012903044856008203173852000903255655001203264IND60609048520221119162753.0180904e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060904852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-018-1758-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtlabachew, Abunu10aModélisation numérique du transport de soluté dans un modèle physique de réservoir sableux sous gradient hydraulique et contraintes hydrologiques variables Modelado numérico del transporte de solutos en un modelo físico de tanques de arena bajo diferentes gradientes hidráulicos y tensiones hidrológicas 沙箱物理模型在不同水力梯度和不同水力应力下的数值建模 Modelagem numérica do transporte de soluto em um modelo físico em tanque de areia sob gradiente hidráulico variável e estresse hidrológico10aNumerical modeling of solute transport in a sand tank physical model under varying hydraulic gradient and hydrological stresses  ap. 2089-2113.  aThis laboratory study improves the understanding of the impacts of horizontal hydraulic gradient, artificial recharge, and groundwater pumping on solute transport through aquifers. Nine experiments and numerical simulations were carried out using a sand tank. The variable-density groundwater flow and sodium chloride transport were simulated using the three-dimensional numerical model SEAWAT. Numerical modelling results successfully reproduced heads and concentrations observed in the sand tank. A higher horizontal hydraulic gradient enhanced the migration of sodium chloride, particularly in the groundwater flow direction. The application of constant artificial recharge increased the spread of the sodium chloride plume in both the longitudinal and lateral directions. In addition, groundwater pumping accelerated spreading of the sodium chloride plume towards the pumping well. Both higher hydraulic gradient and pumping rate generated oval-shaped plumes in the horizontal plane. However, the artificial recharge process produced stretched plumes. These effects of artificial recharge and groundwater pumping were greater under higher hydraulic gradient. The concentration breakthrough curves indicated that emerging solutions never attained the concentration of the originally injected solution. This is probably because of sorption of sodium chloride onto the silica sand and/or the exchange of sodium chloride between the mobile and immobile liquid domains. The fingering and protruding plume shapes in the numerical models constitute instability zones produced by buoyancy-driven flow. Overall, the results have substantiated the influences of hydraulic gradient, boundary condition, artificial recharge, pumping rate and density differences on solute transport through a homogeneous unconfined aquifer. The implications of these findings are important for managing liquid wastes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3agroundwater recharge 3aliquid wastes 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3aquartz 3asand 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3asorption1 aShu, Longcang1 aWu, Peipeng1 aZhang, Yongjie1 aXu, Yang0 tHydrogeology journal.g2018 Sept., v. 26, no. 6 p.2089-2113dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3943547x1431-21747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10040-018-1758-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245009900163300001600262520165800278592002801936650001401964650003801978650001802016650001102034650001502045650001602060650002002076650001002096650002302106650001502129650002502144650002302169650001902192650001402211650001902225650001202244651001002256653002202266653003802288653001302326653001402339653001402353700002002367700002002387700002002407700002302427700001902450700002202469700001902491700002302510700002402533700002202557700001702579700002102596773011802617856007902735852000902814655001202823IND60565344320221120044201.0170426e20170501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056534432DNAL7 a10.1089/vbz.2016.20292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElias, Susan P.10aSeasonal Patterns in Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus Antibody in Songbirds in Southern Maine  ap. 325-330.  aThe intent of this study was to assess passerine eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEv) seroprevalence during the breeding season in southern Maine by testing songbird species identified in the literature as amplifying hosts of this virus. In 2013 and 2014, we collected serum samples from songbirds at a mainland site and an offshore island migratory stopover site, and screened samples for EEEv antibodies using plaque reduction neutralization tests. We compared seasonal changes in EEEv antibody seroprevalence in young (hatched in year of capture) and adult birds at the mainland site, and also compared early season seroprevalence in mainland versus offshore adult birds. EEEv seroprevalence did not differ significantly between years at either site. During the early season (May), EEEv antibody seroprevalence was substantially lower (9.6%) in the island migrant adults than in mainland adults (42.9%), 2013–2014. On the mainland, EEEv antibody seroprevalence in young birds increased from 12.9% in midseason (June–August) to 45.6% in late season (September/October), 2013–2014. Seroprevalence in adult birds did not differ between seasons (48.8% vs. 53.3%). EEEv activity in Maine has increased in the past decade as measured by increased virus detection in mosquitoes and veterinary cases. High EEEv seroprevalence in young birds—as compared to that of young birds in other studies—corresponded with two consecutive active EEEv years in Maine. We suggest that young, locally hatched songbirds be sampled as a part of long-term EEEv surveillance, and provide a list of suggested species to sample, including EEEv “superspreaders.”  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aEastern equine encephalitis virus 3aPasseriformes 3aadults 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3abreeding season 3ahosts 3amigratory behavior 3amonitoring 3aneutralization tests 3aseasonal variation 3aseroprevalence 3asongbirds 3astopover sites 3aviruses 3aMaine 0aCuliseta melanura 0aeastern equine encephalitis virus 0aenzootic 0aepizootic 0asongbirds1 aKeenan, Patrick1 aKenney, Joan L.1 aMorris, Sara R.1 aCovino, Kristen M.1 aRobinson, Sara1 aFoss, Kimberly A.1 aRand, Peter W.1 aLubelczyk, Charles1 aLacombe, Eleanor H.1 aMutebi, John-Paul1 aEvers, David1 aSmith, Robert P.0 tVector borne and zoonotic diseases.g2017 May 01, v. 17, no. 5 p.325-330dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1557-77597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Fvbz.2016.20293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02688naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245009100174300001400265520136400279592002801643650000901671650001601680650001501696650001501711650001401726650001101740650002201751650001401773651001601787651001101803653002201814653002401836653002101860653002601881653002401907653002301931700002301954700002001977700001701997700002102014773010202035856008402137852000902221655001202230IND60602283220221119132314.0180711e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060228322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMainsant, Guénolé10aShear-wave-velocity drop prior to clayey mass movement in laboratory flume experiments  ap. 26-32.  aClay slopes are susceptible to suddenly liquefy into rapidly accelerating landslides, thereby threatening people and facilities in mountainous areas. Because the shear-wave velocity (Vs) characterizes the medium stiffness, this parameter can potentially be used to investigate the rheological behavior of clay materials before and during the solid-to-fluid transition associated to such landslide failures. Previous rheometrical studies performed on clay samples coming from Trièves landslides (French Alps) have established that this material behaves as a yield stress fluid with a marked viscosity bifurcation. When the applied stress reaches a critical level, the viscosity decreases abruptly, along with Vs which tends to zero in the fully fluidized material. Here, we monitor the Rayleigh wave velocity (VR) variations in a saturated clay layer placed in a flume and progressively brought to failure by tilting the device. Experiments performed on clay samples with different water contents show a significant relative drop in VR values (and hence in Vs) before the onset of the mass movement. Additional rheometrical analyses point out that this precursory drop in Vs is presumably due to a complex transient rheological response of the clay. These new results confirm that Vs variations constitute a good indicator for monitoring clay slope stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aengineering 3alandslides 3amonitoring 3amountains 3apeople 3atopographic slope 3aviscosity 3aAlps region 3aFrance 0aClayey landslides 0aTrièves landslides 0aFlume experiment 0aViscoplastic rheology 0aAcoustic monitoring 0aWave-velocity drop1 aChambon, Guillaume1 aJongmans, Denis1 aLarose, Eric1 aBaillet, Laurent0 tEngineering geology.g2015 June 18, v. 192 p.26-32dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02336naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009500160500001900255520122500274592002801499650001301527650002101540650001401561650002301575650002301598650001601621650000901637650001901646650001401665650000901679700002401688700002501712700002001737773012201757856007401879852000901953655001201962IND60735236220221117053611.0210423e20210329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073523622DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130411182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, Rebecca 10aFood Fortification: The Advantages, Disadvantages and Lessons from Sight and Life Programs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDeficiencies in one or more micronutrients such as iron, zinc, and vitamin A are widespread in low- and middle-income countries and compromise the physical and cognitive capacity of millions of people. Food fortification is a cost-effective strategy with demonstrated health, economic and social benefits. Despite ongoing debates globally and in some countries regarding the performance and safety of food fortification, the practice offers significant benefits across each of the main vehicles for food fortification (large-scale food fortification, biofortification and point-of-use or home fortification) ranging from reducing the prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and economic benefits to societies and economies. Using Sight and Life’s global and national experiences in implementing food fortification efforts, we demonstrate how different programs in LMICs have successfully addressed challenges with food fortification and in doing so, find that these efforts are most successful when partnerships are formed that include the public and private sector as well as other parties that can provide support in key areas such as advocacy, management, capacity building, implementation and regulatory monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvocacy 3abiofortification 3acognition 3acost effectiveness 3afood fortification 3afood safety 3airon 3aprivate sector 3avitamin A 3azinc1 aGavin-Smith, Breda 1 aFerraboschi, Chiara 1 aKraemer, Klaus 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 29, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130411183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010900167300001600276520122000292592002801512650001401540650001701554650001601571650003101587650002401618650001001642650001701652650002301669650000901692650001101701650002901712650002601741650002201767700001901789700002201808700002001830700001901850700002001869700001901889700002101908700002301929700002301952700002301975700002201998700001602020773011102036856008102147852000902228655001202237IND60586684320221118065802.0171214e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058668432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-017-2674-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujikawa, Junji10aKruppel-like factor 4 regulates matrix metalloproteinase and aggrecanase gene expression in chondrocytes  ap. 441-449.  aKruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a zinc finger transcription factor that plays crucial roles during the development and maintenance of multiple organs. We and others have previously shown that KLF4 is involved in bone modeling and remodeling but roles played by KLF4 during skeletogenesis are still not fully understood. Here, we show that KLF4 is expressed in the epiphyseal growth plate and articular chondrocytes. Most articular chondrocytes expressed KLF4 in embryos but it localized only in a subset of superficial zone cells in postnatal mice. When KLF4 was overexpressed in chondrocytes in vitro, it severely repressed chondrocytic gene expressions. Global gene expression profiling of KLF4-transduced chondrocytes revealed matrix degrading proteinases of the matrix metalloproteinase and disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-1 domain families within the group of upregulated genes. Proteinase induction by KLF4 was alleviated by Trichostatin A treatment suggesting the possible involvement of epigenetic mechanisms on proteinase induction by KLF4. These results indicate the possible involvement of KLF4 in physiological and pathological aspects during cartilage development and maintenance.  aPublisher supplied data 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3aepigenetics 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agrowth plate 3ametalloproteinases 3amice 3amodels 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3azinc finger motif1 aTakeuchi, Yuto1 aKanazawa, Satoshi1 aNomir, Ahmed G.1 aKito, Akiyoshi1 aElkhashab, Eman1 aGhaleb, Amr M.1 aYang, Vincent W.1 aAkiyama, Shigehisa1 aMorisaki, Ichijiro1 aYamashiro, Takashi1 aWakisaka, Satoshi1 aAbe, Makoto0 tCell and tissue research.g2017 Dec., v. 370, no. 3 p.441-449dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-017-2674-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02492naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014200173300001600315520119600331592002801527650001401555650001701569650001601586650002101602650002501623650001601648651001601664653002701680653001701707653002001724653002601744653003201770653003001802700001701832700001801849700001801867773010401885856008401989852000902073655001202082IND60602283320221119132204.0180711e20150618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060228332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoshnevisan, Sara10aProbabilistic assessment of liquefaction-induced lateral spreads using CPT — Focusing on the 2010–2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence  ap. 113-128.  aStrong earthquake events often result in liquefaction-induced ground movements such as settlements and lateral spreads that are a major cause of damage to buildings, bridges, and lifelines. This paper focuses on the subject of liquefaction-induced lateral spreads. Case histories with detailed cone penetration test (CPT) data are derived from the 2010–2011 Canterbury, New Zealand earthquake sequence and used to examine an existing empirical model for liquefaction-induced lateral spreads. The results confirmed the existence of a substantial discrepancy between the predicted and observed lateral spreads, indicating a need for improved models that consider uncertainties in the input parameters. Using a maximum likelihood analysis of the derived case histories, a new empirical probabilistic model was developed for the estimation of lateral spreads in the Christchurch, New Zealand area. Emphasis is placed on assessing the probability of exceedance of limiting displacements for design against the threat of lateral spreads. The new CPT-based probabilistic model with detailed formulations is presented along with an illustrative example. The limitations of the model are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acase studies 3aearthquakes 3aempirical models 3aprobability analysis 3auncertainty 3aNew Zealand 0aCanterbury earthquakes 0aLiquefaction 0aLateral spreads 0aCone penetration test 0aMaximum likelihood analysis 0aProbability of exceedance1 aJuang, Hsein1 aZhou, Yan-Guo1 aGong, Wenping0 tEngineering geology.g2015 June 18, v. 192 p.113-128dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006300151245013200214300001400346520103100360592002801391650001301419650002601432650001601458650001301474650002301487650001601510650001101526650003801537650002001575650002101595650001501616650000901631650001901640650001701659700002101676700002301697700001701720700002301737773010701760856008601867852000901953655001201962IND60560528420221119201749.0190409e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056052842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCakebread, Julie A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5937-670510aFree secretory component from bovine milk aggregates enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and inhibits binding to intestinal cells  ap. 32-37.  aThe burden of diarrhoeal disease and the progressive increase in antibiotic resistance to enteric pathogens is a critical area of concern that necessitates exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. Free secretory component (FSC), derived from human milk, has been shown to inhibit adhesion and invasion of pathogenic bacteria. Cows' milk also contains FSC, but its activity has not yet been characterised. FSC was purified from non-pasteurised and pasteurised bovine milk. The binding properties of purified bovine FSC were investigated against enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). Bovine FSC bound to EPEC and facilitated aggregation of the bacteria. FSC also attenuated binding of EPEC to Caco-2 cells. Pasteurisation of milk before extraction of FSC did not affect activity of the FSC. These activities of FSC are consistent with a role in suppressing colonisation of EPEC. Milk extracts enriched for bovine FSC have potential as an alternative to antibiotic therapy for protection against diarrhoeal disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abinding properties 3abreast milk 3acattle 3aenteropathogenic Escherichia coli 3aenteropathogens 3ahuman cell lines 3aintestines 3amilk 3apasteurization 3atherapeutics1 aCallaghan, Megan1 aBroadhurst, Marita1 aHarris, Paul1 aWheeler, Thomas T.0 tInternational dairy journal.g2017 May, v. 68 p.32-37dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03246naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245017500167520175000342592002802092650001002120650002002130650000902150650002002159650002902179650002502208650002602233650002602259650001202285650002802297650000702325653001502332653001202347653003202359653002302391653001802414700001302432700001702445700002102462700001802483700001502501700001502516700001702531773011902548856008802667852000902755655001202764IND60732737620221122232746.0220906e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073273762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1464102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Min10aDiet influence on mercury bioaccumulation as revealed by polyunsaturated fatty acids in zoobenthos from two contrasting environments: Chinese reservoirs and Swedish lakes  aThe bioaccumulation of mercury (Hg) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in zoobenthos varies across aquatic food webs. In this field study, contents of total Hg (THg), methylmercury (MeHg) and PUFA were investigated in zoobenthos of Chinese reservoirs and Swedish lakes, with contrasting environmental characteristics and algal diet sources, which can result in difference of Hg and PUFA in zoobenthos from these two habits. Using PUFA as dietary biomarkers of algae in zoobenthos, we evaluated effects of environmental factors and algal diet sources on the accumulation of THg, MeHg, and the highly required PUFA eicosapentaenoic (EPA, 20: 5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) in zoobenthos. Average THg and MeHg in zoobenthos were higher in Chinese reservoirs than Swedish lakes (p < 0.05). Average EPA content of zoobenthos was similar in these two habitats (p > 0.05), yet average DHA content of zoobenthos was higher in Chinese reservoirs than Swedish lakes (p < 0.05). Total Hg and MeHg contents of zoobenthos in Swedish lakes were predicted by environmental factors; e.g., negatively with pH and positively with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, yet had no significant relationship with the algal dietary. In Chinese reservoirs, however, no environmental factor correlated well with THg contents in zoobenthos, and only DOC concentrations showed positive correlation with MeHg contents in zoobenthos. Besides, the algal dietary was also positively correlated with MeHg contents in zoobenthos. EPA and DHA contents of zoobenthos in Swedish lakes primarily associated with algal diet. By contrast, in Chinese reservoirs, EPA and DHA contents of zoobenthos were affected by both environmental factors and algal diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3abioaccumulation 3adiet 3adietary markers 3adissolved organic carbon 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenvironmental factors 3amercury 3amethylmercury compounds 3apH 0aZoobenthos 0aMercury 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acids 0aChinese reservoirs 0aSwedish lakes1 aLin, Dan1 aWu, Pianpian1 aKainz, Martin J.1 aBishop, Kevin1 aYan, Haiyu1 aLi, Qiuhua1 aFeng, Xinbin0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 782 p.146410-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1464103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245010100201300001600302500002000318520180700338592002802145650002702173650001902200650001202219650001502231650001602246650002402262650001402286650000902300650002402309650002402333650001802357651001302375700005502388700006502443700002202508700002502530773011702555856007402672852000902746655001202755IND60769223820221118045758.0220304e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076922382DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.138682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInman, Victoria L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5646-790810aTemporal and spatial patterns of common hippopotamus populations in the Okavango Delta, Botswana  ap. 630-642.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aConservation requires reliable estimates of a species' population and their spatial distribution. Knowledge of large‐scale habitat use and population trends in common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; hereafter hippo) in wetland ecosystems is limited, with no studies of hippo populations in the Okavango Delta (the Delta), Botswana. We examined the drivers of long‐term trends and spatial patterns in the Delta's hippo population, using 13 years of aerial surveys (1996–2018) informing on the potential impacts of changes in inflow, flooding patterns and rainfall on hippo populations. We estimated temporal changes in hippo populations and relationships with rainfall and inflow. We also examined how spatially explicit hippo counts related to flood and surface water extent and vegetation class at different scales. The Delta's hippo population has increased, probably due to increasing long‐term rainfall and inflow, following a period of severe drought/low flooding. Hippos were positively associated with areas with high variation in flooding and negatively associated with broad‐scale surface water extent, indicating hippos avoided permanent swamps and main channels, probably due to water depth, lack of nearby grazing, and thick riparian vegetation. At a fine scale, hippos relied on large lagoons for daytime refuge. The most recent population estimate indicates that Botswana has the third highest hippo population in Africa, reflecting the importance of the Delta. Reductions in inflow and rainfall from climate change and water resource development would threaten these hippo populations by reducing grazing availability, lagoon sizes, and seasonal swamps. Ongoing monitoring of hippos should continue as they represent a good indicator for the entire floodplain ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHippopotamus amphibius 3aclimate change 3adrought 3aecosystems 3afloodplains 3ahabitat preferences 3alimnology 3arain 3aresource management 3ariparian vegetation 3asurface water 3aBotswana1 aBino, Gilad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9265-40571 aKingsford, Richard T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6565-41341 aChase, Michael J.1 aLeggett, Keith E.

Involvement of this species in UHT milk destabilisation was investigated in the present study. Microfiltered milk was inoculated independently with strains S. liquefaciens L53 or L64. Then, UHT treatment was performed and stability of the corresponding UHT milk was investigated during three months of storage. The residual proteolytic activity of strain L53 led to destabilisation of UHT milk, with sedimentation and formation of aggregates. Hydrolysis of casein micelles was confirmed by the increase in the content of non-casein nitrogen and the identification of numerous peptides coming from the four caseins using mass spectrometry. For strain L64, no visual and biochemical alteration were found. This study showed that Ser2 resists UHT treatment and could be a cause of UHT milk destabilisation; however, this destabilisation by S. liquefaciens was strain-dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSerratia 3aUHT milk 3aUHT treatment 3acasein 3aheat stability 3ahydrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3amicelles 3amilk 3anitrogen 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3araw milk 3astorage time1 aJardin, Julien1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0520-93911 aGaucheron, Frédéric1 ade Carvalho, Antonio Fernandes1 aVanetti, Maria Cristina Dantas0 tInternational dairy journal.g2017 May, v. 68 p.38-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48777x0958-69467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.idairyj.2016.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017200153300001800325520152100343592002801864650001201892650002001904650001301924650001801937650001101955650002401966650001401990650001702004650002802021650001402049650001302063650002902076650001902105700001402124700001402138700001402152700001602166700001402182700001602196700001602212700002002228773014102248856007402389852000902463655001202472IND60682661220221119020719.0200130e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068266122DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta11252a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Lei10aConfined encapsulation of living cells in self-assembled fiber macrospheres with micro/nanoporous polymer shells for the transformation of contaminants to green energy  ap. 1929-1938.  aThe encapsulation of living cells in the transformation of contaminants into green energy has great potential for solving energy and environmental pollution problems. However, some unresolved challenges related to the maintenance of the capsules' mechanical stability, biomass harvesting without leaking and necessary high activities hinder its practicability. Here, we develop a novel “interior division-external capsulation” dual-immobilization method to anchor photosynthetic bacteria into self-assembled fiber macrospheres and coating with polymer layers by phase inversion. The functional sites (C–N, C–OH and N–H) of the modified macrospheres cause more cells to adhere in the cage and its large void volume provides sufficient space for cell harvesting. Micro/nanoporous polymer shells can not only facilitate the rapid diffusion of substrates into the cavity, but also effectively reduce cell leakage. This strategy provides a facile method to significantly enhance the chemical/physical stability of the host and quickly achieve much higher activity of the encapsulated cells in the degradation of organics and H₂ production as compared to free cells. Importantly, the core–shell confined encapsulation concept enables the cells to have considerable salt tolerance as high as 80 g L⁻¹ and wide pH stability. The long-term reusability of the self-assembled macrospheres provides extensive application prospects for cell encapsulation as a clean and sustainable alternative in broader fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acell harvesting 3acoatings 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3ahydrogen production 3ananopores 3apH stability 3aphotosynthetic bacteria 3apollution 3apolymers 3arenewable energy sources 3asalt tolerance1 aLi, Chang1 aLi, Xiong1 aZhang, Xu1 aShen, Chong1 aMeng, Qin1 aShen, Liang1 aLu, Yinghua1 aZhang, Guoliang0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 8, no. 4 p.1929-1938dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta11252a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015400154500001900308520185200327592002802179650001302207650001702220650002002237650001202257650001402269650001902283650001602302650001402318650001102332650001602343650001502359650001702374651001002391700001502401700001202416700001602428700001502444700001702459773012002476856007302596852000902669655001202678IND60715417820221122040718.0201026e20201010xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071541782DNAL7 a10.3390/w121028052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Chao 10aResponse of Agricultural Drought to Meteorological Drought: A Case Study of the Winter Wheat above the Bengbu Sluice in the Huaihe River Basin, China  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated the responses of winter wheat to drought for the above part of the Bengbu Sluice in the Huaihe River based on the daily scale dataset of 60 meteorological stations from 1961–2015. Crop water deficit index (CWDI) and relative moisture index (M) were used to examine the winter wheat drought and meteorological drought, respectively. We then analyzed the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of these two kinds of drought to calculate the time lag of winter wheat drought to meteorological drought, and finally discuss the relationship between the time lag of winter wheat drought to meteorological drought and the underlying surface geographical factors, and drew the following conclusions. (1) In terms of time scale, for CWDI, except for the filling and mature period, the CWDI at other growth periods showed a slight downward trend; for M, there was no significant change in the interannual trend of each growth period. In terms of spatial scale, the proportion of above moderate drought level in each station of CWDI and M presented a decreasing feature from north to south. (2) The time lag of winter wheat drought to meteorological drought was the shortest (3.21 days) in the greening and heading period and the longest in the over-wintering period (84.35 days). (3) The correlation between the geographical factors and the time lag of winter wheat drought in each growth period was better than 0.5. The high-value points of the relation between the underlying surface geographical factors and the time lag of winter wheat drought were mostly distributed in the mountainous areas with poor soil field capacity and at a greater depth of shallow groundwater, high elevation and steep slope in the areas with aspects to the east and northeast, and the northern areas with less precipitation and lower temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adrought 3aevolution 3afield capacity 3agroundwater 3amountains 3arivers 3atemperature 3awatersheds 3awinter wheat 3aChina1 aChen, Cai 1 aHe, Yi 1 aRuan, Tian 1 aLuo, Gang 1 aSun, Yanwei 0 tWater.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121028053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02687naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013600166300001600302500001500318520149900333592002801832650002001860650002401880650001901904650001801923650001801941650001501959650001801974650001701992650002202009651001102031653001202042700002402054700002002078773011302098856008102211852000902292655001202301IND4410208020221118124222.0151024e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441020802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-008-9721-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontaño-Ley, Y.10aTidal Hydrodynamics and their Implications for the Dispersion of Effluents in Mazatlán Harbor: An Urbanized Shallow Coastal Lagoon  ap. 343-357.  a2019-12-06  aIn order to investigate the Urias Coastal Lagoon (UCL) hydrodynamics, a vertically integrated semi-implicit, non-linear, finite difference model, has been applied. The flow dynamics in this model has been described by the depth integrated shallow water equations and has been forced by prescribed free surface elevations at the open boundary in the inlet of the lagoon. The predicted instantaneous tidal elevation and the vector field of tidal velocities, reflect reasonably well the flood and ebb conditions in the coastal lagoon. Maximum tidal velocities of 0.6 m/s at the navigation channel of the lagoon and tidal ranges of 1.2 m were predicted for spring tides. Residual current of 0.01–0.06 m/s have also been predicted. The advection-diffusion process of a hypothetical pollutant released at two discrete points in the UCL depended on the intensity of water circulation; sites with slow instantaneous tidal velocities and residual currents of small magnitude presented slow advection and diffusion of the pollutant and may be considered vulnerable to the contamination, specifically the head of the lagoon where the pollutant was difficult to be removed by the tidal currents. The main channel, where the tidal currents exceed 0.6 m/s and the residual currents reached 0.06 m/s, behaved as a natural conduct for the pollutant motion. The forces involved in water circulation within the channel would be the best driving mechanism to flush contaminants from the UCL into the Ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater pollution 3amathematical models 3awater currents 3awater quality 3ahydrodynamics 3awater flow 3acoastal water 3aurbanization 3ahydrologic models 3aMexico 0aharbors1 aPeraza-Vizcarra, R.1 aPáez-Osuna, F.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2008 Oct., v. 194, no. 1-4 p.343-357dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-008-9721-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01789naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245007300187300001600260520066900276592002800945650001200973650001300985650001900998650005601017650003001073650003701103650001401140650002401154700001901178700002901197773012201226856008201348852000901430655001201439IND50069619920221118130906.0210610e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006961992DNAL7 a238573942pmid7 a10.1007/s10482-013-9969-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLage, Olga Maria10aInsights into the ultrastructural morphology of novel Planctomycetes  ap. 467-476.  aKnowledge of the interesting phylum of Planctomycetes has increased in the last decades both due to cultural and molecular methods.

It hosts extensive reed stands that have colonized different habitat types. Two different stands were compared: a lake stand not directly influenced by the intermittent River Stržen and a riparian stand near River Stržen. Reed productivity (growth and assimilate allocation) was monitored for these reed stand types over 13 years (2007–2019), and this measurement was compared to monthly water levels and air temperatures. Reeds from the lake reed stand were significantly shorter with a lower shoot density, overall biomass production, and ratio of flowering plants. A correlation analysis revealed stronger and more numerous significant correlations between environmental and reed productivity parameters for the lake reed stand compared to the riparian reed stand. The variabilities of the growth and assimilate allocation parameters in the lake reed stand were both mostly explained by the combined water levels for June and July, which explained 47% and 52% of the variability, respectively. The most influential temperatures were in May, which explained 29% and 19% of the variability of growth and assimilate allocation parameters, respectively. For the riparian reed stand, water levels and temperatures out of the vegetation season appeared more important. Therefore, habitats with permanent water are more suitable for reeds than those with fluctuating water. However, fluctuating water conditions are expected to become more common due to climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aair 3abiomass production 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3ahabitats 3alakes 3arivers 3avegetation 3awater 3awetlands1 aGrašič, Mateja 1 aAbram, Dragan 1 aZelnik, Igor 0 tWater.g2020 Oct. 10, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w121028063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012600173300001600299520181100315592002802126650002402154650002002178650002802198650001202226650001002238650001102248650002302259650001002282650003102292650001102323650001102334650001602345650001002361650001102371650002302382650002202405650001402427650002002441650001002461650001802471700001502489700002502504773012502529856008102654852000902735655001202744IND60586684820221121054747.0171214e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058668482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-017-0191-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhasemzadeh, Somayyeh10aBiological control of Echinothrips americanus by phytoseiid predatory mites and the effect of pollen as supplemental food  ap. 209-221.  aThe poinsettia thrips, Echinothrips americanus Morgan, is an upcoming pest in greenhouse crops, causing serious damage in various vegetable and ornamental crops through extensive foliage feeding. We assessed which stages of E. americanus are attacked and killed by the phytoseiid predatory mites Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot), Amblydromalus limonicus (Garman and McGregor), Euseius gallicus Kreiter and Tixier and Euseius ovalis (Evans). Both the predation and oviposition rates were assessed in the laboratory to evaluate which mite species is potentially the most effective predator of E. americanus. In two greenhouse trials with non-flowering sweet pepper plants, we compared the efficacy of the predators E. gallicus and E. ovalis with A. swirskii and we assessed how this was affected by the application of cattail pollen. All stages of E. americanus, except adults, were consumed by all species of predatory mites. The highest predation and oviposition rates were recorded for A. limonicus followed by A. swirskii and E. ovalis when first and second larval stages were provided as prey, but E. ovalis appeared to be the best predator of thrips pupae. Euseius gallicus displayed very low predation and oviposition rates compared to the other species of predatory mites. Cattail pollen did not support the population growth of poinsettia thrips, but it strongly increased the predatory mite population densities, particularly those of E. ovalis. Both A. swirskii and E. ovalis significantly reduced thrips densities on plants. The application of pollen significantly enhanced the control of E. americanus by A. swirskii; this was not the case for E. ovalis. Euseius gallicus did not reduce densities of E. americanus on sweet pepper plants, not even at high densities in the presence of pollen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyseius swirskii 3aCapsicum annuum 3aEchinothrips americanus 3aEuseius 3aTypha 3aadults 3abiological control 3acrops 3agreenhouse experimentation 3alarvae 3aleaves 3aoviposition 3apests 3apollen 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3apredatory mites 3apupae 3asweet peppers1 aLeman, Ada1 aMesselink, Gerben J.0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2017 Oct., v. 73, no. 2 p.209-221dSpringer International Publishingx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-017-0191-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009700172300001600269520128800285592002801573650001401601650002301615650001301638650001101651650002001662650001701682650001201699650001501711650002401726650001301750650001401763650001001777650001601787653001301803653001301816653001201829653002001841653002101861700003201882700002701914700001801941773010801959856008502067852000902152655001202161IND60581181620221119165241.0180830e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058118162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMachocki, Andrzej10aHydrogen-rich gas generation from alcohols over cobalt-based catalysts for fuel cell feeding  ap. 341-349.  aThe application of potassium promoted Co-ZnO-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by co-precipitation and citrate methods in the steam reforming of ethanol and methanol has been studied. Experimental results of catalytic activity and selectivity of catalysts are reported. The influence of preparation method, potassium addition (1 and 2wt%) and the reaction temperature (350–600°C) are the focus of the experimental studies. Potassium promoted catalysts prepared by the co-precipitation method with smaller cobalt active phase crystallites and with potassium deposited on the catalyst surface, are easier and in a higher extend reducible and are more active and selective in the steam reforming of ethanol and methanol than those with large crystallites prepared by the citrate method into which potassium was introduced with all other components. Also, the suppression of carbonaceous deposit formation was observed while potassium was present on the surface of the catalyst. It is found that steam reforming of both alcohols proceeds under comparable conditions and hydrogen yields are maximized in the temperature range of 420–450°C. Cobalt-based catalysts can be used in the same processor for hydrogen generation from alternatively methanol or/and ethanol for fuel cell applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acitrates 3acobalt 3acoprecipitation 3acrystallites 3aethanol 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen production 3amethanol 3apotassium 3asteam 3atemperature 0aHydrogen 0aMethanol 0aEthanol 0aSteam reforming 0aCobalt catalysts1 aIōannidēs, Theophilos A.,1 aPapadopoulou, Eftichia1 aBanach, Bogna0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 July, v. 148 p.341-349dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245016500160300001800325500001500343520127200358592002801630650001601658650001301674650002601687650001401713650001801727650001501745650000901760650001401769650002001783653001301803653001801816653001701834653002801851653002001879700002601899700002401925700001801949700001801967700001801985700001602003700002102019700002002040700001902060700001802079700002002097700001702117773012402134856008002258852000902338655001202347IND60565346820221121002140.0170323e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056534682DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b091632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Biki10aDevelopment of Bioactive PEGylated Nanostructured Platforms for Sequential Delivery of Doxorubicin and Imatinib to Overcome Drug Resistance in Metastatic Tumors  ap. 9280-9290.  a2019-12-06  aMetastasis of cancers accounts for almost all cancer-related deaths. In this study, we report a PEGylated nanostructured platform for coadministration of doxorubicin (DOX) and imatinib (IMT) intended to effectively inhibit metastatic tumors. The DOX and IMT coloaded nanostructured system (DOX/IMT-N) is characterized by an excellent encapsulation potential for both drugs and shows sequential and sustained drug release in vitro. DOX/IMT-N significantly inhibited the in vitro proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and SK-MEL-28 cells. The inhibitory effect on in vitro proliferation of the cells was significantly greater than the effect of free DOX, DOX/IMT cocktail, or the nanostructured system housing DOX only (DOX-N). DOX/IMT-N remarkably enhanced cellular drug uptake, resulting in enhanced apoptosis, caused by significant increases in the expression levels of apoptotic marker proteins. Intravenous administration of DOX/IMT-N to MBA-MB-231 xenograft tumor-bearing mice resulted in significantly improved inhibition of tumor progression compared to that with DOX, DOX/IMT, or DOX-N. Therefore, the nanostructured DOX/IMT-N system could potentially aid in overcoming drug resistance in metastatic tumors and improve the effectiveness of metastatic tumor therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3adoxorubicin 3aproteins 3aintravenous injection 3aneoplasms 3aencapsulation 3ametastasis 3amice 3aapoptosis 3adrug resistance 0aimatinib 0adrug delivery 0atherapeutics 0ananostructured platform 0achemoresistance1 aRamasamy, Thiruganesh1 aPoudel, Bijay Kumar1 aPathak, Shiva1 aRegmi, Shobha1 aChoi, Ju Yeon1 aSon, Youlim1 aThapa, Raj Kumar1 aJeong, Jee-Heon1 aKim, Jae Ryong1 aChoi, Han-Gon1 aYong, Chul Soon1 aKim, Jong Oh0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 9, no. 11 p.9280-9290dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b091633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245011300209300001800322520139200340592002801732596006001760650002201820650001801842650001501860650001101875650001901886650001101905650002801916650002501944650001601969700005301985700006002038773016202098856008202260852000902342655001202351IND60674005720221122051417.0191022e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067400572DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-019-01733-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBermúdez, María1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3189-479110aQuantifying the role of individual flood drivers and their correlations in flooding of coastal river reaches  ap. 1851-1861.  aFlooding in coastal river reaches is the result of complex interactions between coastal and inland drivers. Flood hazard assessments need to consider how these drivers interact in space and time, for which a standard method is currently lacking. A complex hydrodynamic model is required to reproduce the physics of the combined forcings and, at the same time, to fully explore the combinations of drivers that can occur in order to determine extreme flood frequencies. In this work, we explore the individual role of astronomical tide, storm surge and river discharge and their correlations in the extreme flood levels of a coastal river reach. We apply a computationally efficient surrogate model of a 2D shallow water model based on least squares support vector machines regression to reconstruct 10,000 years-long time series of water levels in the reach. As input to the model, we consider an ensemble of synthetic time series of the flood drivers, which differ in the number of variables considered and in their correlations. Probabilities of exceedance of water levels are then computed and compared. The proposed methodology can give a better understanding of the flooding processes in a multivariable environment, as low-lying coastal urban areas typically are, and can provide guidance on where to focus modelling efforts when developing flood hazard assessments in such areas.  aPublisher supplied data  a754446cEU H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions COFUND 3ahydrologic models 3aleast squares 3ariver flow 3arivers 3aspace and time 3astorms 3asupport vector machines 3atime series analysis 3aurban areas1 aCea, Luis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3920-04781 aSopelana, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3852-50670 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2019 Oct., v. 33, no. 10 p.1851-1861dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-019-01733-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02829naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013800174300001600312520133700328592002801665650002301693650001301716650001401729650004101743650001901784650002001803650001401823650001601837650000901853653001901862653001201881653000901893653002101902653001401923700002101937700001201958700007001970700002002040700002302060700002502083700002002108700001702128773010802145856008502253852000902338655001202347IND60581181820221119165426.0180830e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058118182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholizadeh, Mortaza10aEffects of temperature on the hydrotreatment behaviour of pyrolysis bio-oil and coke formation in a continuous hydrotreatment reactor  ap. 175-183.  aIn this study, we investigated the effects of temperature on the hydrotreatment behaviour of bio-oil from the pyrolysis of mallee wood with a special focus on coke formation. The experiments were carried out in a continuous hydrotreatment reactor with pre-sulphided NiMo/γ-Al2O3 as the main catalyst over a nominal temperature range from 375 to 450°C while the outlet pressure was set at 70bar. GC-MS, TGA, UV-Fluorescence spectroscopy, elemental analysis and FT-Raman spectroscopy were used to characterise the reaction products and spent catalyst. While an upstream Pd/C catalyst bed had some effects of stabilising bio-oil, it was insufficient to ensure long-term operation under all conditions. Aromatic ring growth and polymerisation could take place continuously even under the overall dominating hydrotreatment/hydrocracking conditions. Temperature drastically affected the hydrotreatment product quality and coke formation. Increasing temperature favours the polymerisation for the formation of coke. At high temperature (e.g. 450°C), the coke formation could be so severe that the reactor was blocked before the heavy liquid could reach the end of the reactor. The coke formed mainly from heavy liquid showed very different properties (different aromatic ring systems) from the coke formed mainly from the light species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3abiofuels 3acatalysts 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3apolymerization 3aproduct quality 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3awood 0aHydrotreatment 0aBio-oil 0aCoke 0aHeavy components 0aAromatics1 aGunawan, Richard1 aHu, Xun1 ade Miguel Mercader, Ferran1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8246-63511 aWesterhof, Roel1 aChaitwat, Weerawut1 aMahmudul Hasan, Md.,1 aMourant, Daniel1 aLi, Chun-Zhu0 tFuel processing technology.g2016 July, v. 148 p.175-183dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2016.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02999naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006000188245009300248300001400341506007600355520126200431592002801693506003701721650001601758650001101774650001501785650002001800650001701820650002601837650001801863650002101881650001601902650001301918650002601931650001601957650002201973653004601995653001002041653001602051653002202067653002002089700006802109700002402177700001802201700002502219700001302244773010902257856008202366852000902448655001202457IND60530582620221207081805.0180905e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053058262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gep.2016.06.0042doi7 aPMC49802212pmcid7 a273644712pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhattarai, Sunil1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4210-972810aKrüpple-like factors 7 and 6a mRNA expression in adult zebrafish central nervous system  ap. 41-53.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKrüpple-like factors (KLFs) are transcription factors with zinc finger DNA binding domains known to play important roles in brain development and central nervous system (CNS) regeneration. There is little information on KLFs expression in adult vertebrate CNS. In this study, we used in situ hybridization to examine Klf7 mRNA (klf7) and Klf6a mRNA (klf6a) expression in adult zebrafish CNS. Both klfs exhibit wide and similar expression in the zebrafish CNS. Brain areas containing strongly labeled cells include the ventricular regions of the dorsomedial telencephalon, the ventromedial telencephalon, periventricular regions of the thalamus and hypothalamus, torus longitudinalis, stratum periventriculare of the optic tectum, granular regions of the cerebellar body and valvula, and superficial layers of the facial and vagal lobes. In the spinal cord, klf7- and klf6a-expressing cells are found in both the dorsal and ventral horns. Numerous sensory structures (e.g. auditory, lateral line, olfactory and visual) and several motor nuclei (e.g. oculomotor, trigeminal, and vagal motor nuclei) contain klf7- and/or klf6a-expressing cells. Our results may provide useful information for determining these Klfs in maintenance and/or function in adult CNS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aadults 3acerebellum 3agene expression 3ahypothalamus 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3aneurodevelopment 3aspinal cord 3athalamus 3atranscription factors 3avertebrates 3azinc finger motif 0aZinc-finger binding transcription factors 0aBrain 0aSpinal cord 0aVisual structures 0aAuditory nuclei1 aSochacka-Marlowe, Alicja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4871-56761 aCrutchfield, Gerald1 aKhan, Ramisha1 aLondraville, Richard1 aLiu, Qin0 tGene expression patterns.g2016 May, v. 21, no. 1 p.41-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12408x1567-133X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gep.2016.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012000155300001800275520135000293592002801643650001701671650001601688650003401704650002101738650001701759650002201776650001901798650001301817650001401830650002201844650002001866650001501886650001101901650001301912650001701925650003101942700001901973700001401992700001402006700001502020700001802035700001702053773014102070856007402211852000902285655001202294IND60682661720221119020617.0200130e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068266172DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta11386j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Teng10a3D printing-based cellular microelectrodes for high-performance asymmetric quasi-solid-state micro-pseudocapacitors  ap. 1749-1756.  aMicro-supercapacitor is a member of the miniaturized energy storage device family, which offers great advantages on power density and life span. However, the limited device capacitance and narrow voltage window limit its energy density, hindering its application. In the present work, a novel micro-pseudocapacitor (MPC) constructed via the facile extrusion-based 3D printing technique has been demonstrated to deliver efficient charge storage with high device capacitance and moderate voltage window. Such an asymmetric MPC is constructed with 3D-printing-enabled asymmetric interdigitated cellular microelectrodes; in which, one is Ni–Co–O nanosheets grown on macroporous 3D reduced GO (3DG) microelectrode and the other is MnO₂ nanosheets grown on 3DG. Such an MPC offers facilitated fast electron transport, ionic diffusion, large number of active sites and desired porosity for electrolyte penetration. The asymmetric MPC shows a high specific capacity of 500 mC cm⁻², an energy density of 90 μW h cm⁻² and a voltage window of 1.3 V. A device cycling stability with 10 000 charge and discharge cycles is also achieved for the as-fabricated asymmetric MPCs. These encouraging results may open a new avenue to design and fabricate state-of-the-art miniaturized electrochemical energy storage devices with customized geometries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3acapacitance 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy density 3ageometry 3alongevity 3amanganese dioxide 3amicroelectrodes 3ananosheets 3anickel 3aporosity 3aporous media 3athree-dimensional printing1 aTian, Xiaocong1 aLi, Liang1 aLu, Luhua1 aHou, Shuen1 aCao, Guozhong1 aJin, Hongyun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 8, no. 4 p.1749-1756dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta11386j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011700162300001800279520098100297592002801278650002501306650001101331650001501342650001901357650002201376650001401398650001201412650001101424653002401435653001701459653002601476653001701502653002301519700001101542700001601553700001701569700002101586700001401607700002001621700001901641773012401660856008001784852000901864655001201873IND60565347020221121002216.0170323e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056534702DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b120802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaolei10aCarbon-Coated Silicon Nanowires on Carbon Fabric as Self-Supported Electrodes for Flexible Lithium-Ion Batteries  ap. 9551-9558.  aA novel self-supported electrode with long cycling life and high mass loading was developed based on carbon-coated Si nanowires grown in situ on highly conductive and flexible carbon fabric substrates through a nickel-catalyzed one-pot atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition. The high-quality carbon coated Si nanowires resulted in high reversible specific capacity (∼3500 mA h g–¹ at 100 mA g–¹), while the three-dimensional electrode’s unique architecture leads to a significantly improved robustness and a high degree of electrode stability. An exceptionally long cyclability with a capacity retention of ∼66% over 500 cycles at 1.0 A g–¹ was achieved. The controllable high mass loading enables an electrode with extremely high areal capacity of ∼5.0 mA h cm–². Such a scalable electrode fabrication technology and the high-performance electrodes hold great promise in future practical applications in high energy density lithium-ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric pressure 3acarbon 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3alithium batteries 3ananowires 3asilicon 3avapors 0aflexible electrodes 0aSi nanowires 0alithium-ion batteries 0acarbon cloth 0asubeutectic growth1 aLi, Ge1 aSeo, Min Ho1 aLui, Gregory1 aHassan, Fathy M.1 aFeng, Kun1 aXiao, Xingcheng1 aChen, Zhongwei0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 9, no. 11 p.9551-9558dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b120803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03485naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006500139245011300204300001600317500002000333520200900353592002802362596007202390596004602462650001202508650001002520650002202530650001702552650001202569650001102581650002402592650001002616650001402626650002902640650001502669650001502684650001602699650001202715700001602727700002702743700001902770700002602789773011702815856007402932852000903006655001203015IND60769224420221118045824.0220304e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076922442DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.138762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez‐Rojo, Naiara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5952-695010aNo evidence of biodiversity effects on stream ecosystem functioning across green and brown food web pathways  ap. 720-730.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBiodiversity loss is known to affect the two fundamental and opposite processes controlling carbon and nutrient cycles globally, that is, primary production and decomposition, which are driven by green and brown food web compartments, respectively. However, biodiversity in these two food web compartments has been mostly studied independently, and potential reciprocal effects of biodiversity loss on ecosystem processes remain unclear. We conducted a 35‐day stream mesocosm experiment with two levels of algal diversity (natural and diluted periphyton communities) and three levels of litter diversity (no litter, monocultures of poplar, maple, and oak, and the three‐spp. mixture) to simulate changes in biodiversity in both the green and brown pathways of an aquatic food web. We then measured multiple ecosystem processes pertaining to carbon cycling. We predicted that algal diversity would enhance decomposition and sporulation of fungal decomposers, while litter diversity would enhance algal growth and net primary production, due to the more diverse algal exudates or litter nutrients being released from more diverse mixtures. In contrast to this hypothesis, we only found biodiversity effects on an ecosystem process within the green pathway: there was a relationship between algal diversity and biofilm carrying capacity. Nevertheless, we found that this relationship was affected by the presence or absence of litter (algal diversity increased the carrying capacity in presence of litter and decreased it in its absence), which also influenced the algal community structure. Our mesocosm experiment did not evidence relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem processes across different food web compartments, but further studies in more realistic conditions would be necessary to confirm this result. If supported, the lack of biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships across compartments would facilitate the prediction of the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  cSpanish Ministry for Science, Innovation and Universities and FEDER  a1332342cU.S. National Science Foundation 3aPopulus 3aalgae 3aaquatic food webs 3abiodiversity 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3afungi 3alimnology 3anet primary productivity 3aperiphyton 3aprediction 3asporulation 3astreams1 aBoyero, Luz1 aPérez Ovalle, Javier,1 aBasaguren, Ana1 aCardinale, Bradley J.0 tFreshwater biology.g2022 Apr., v. 67, no. 4 p.720-730dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.138763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02600naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245024000165500001900405520141300424592002801837650001501865650001201880650001601892650001101908650001501919650002801934650001301962650001501975650001901990700001802009700001802027773012202045856007402167852000902241655001202250IND60735237120221117054100.0210423e20210329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073523712DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130411262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotake-Nara, Eiichi 10aUptake of Vitamins D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, and D7 Solubilized in Mixed Micelles by Human Intestinal Cells, Caco-2, an Enhancing Effect of Lysophosphatidylcholine on the Cellular Uptake, and Estimation of Vitamins D’ Biological Activities  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVitamins D have various biological activities, as well as intestinal calcium absorption. There has been recent concern about insufficient vitamin D intake. In addition to vitamins D₂ and D₃, there are lesser-known vitamins D₄–D₇. We synthesized vitamins D₅–D₇, which are not commercially available, and then evaluated and compared the mixed micelles-solubilized vitamins D uptake by Caco-2 cells. Except for vitamin D₅, the uptake amounts of vitamins D₄–D₇ by differentiated Caco-2 cells were similar to those of vitamins D₂ and D₃. The facilitative diffusion rate in the ezetimibe inhibited pathway was approximately 20% for each vitamin D type, suggesting that they would pass through the pathway at a similar rate. Lysophosphatidylcholine enhanced each vitamin D uptake by approximately 2.5-fold. Lysophosphatidylcholine showed an enhancing effect on vitamin D uptake by reducing the intercellular barrier formation of Caco-2 cells by reducing cellular cholesterol, suggesting that increasing the uptakes of vitamins D and/or co-ingesting them with lysophosphatidylcholine, would improve vitamin D insufficiency. The various biological activities in the activated form of vitamins D₄–D₇ were estimated by Prediction of Activity Spectra for Substances (PASS) online simulation. These may have some biological activities, supporting the potential as nutritional components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acalcium 3acholesterol 3ahumans 3aintestines 3alysophosphatidylcholine 3amicelles 3aprediction 3asolubilization1 aKomba, Shiro 1 aHase, Megumi 0 tNutrients.g2021 Mar. 29, v. 13, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130411263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015000155300001800305520124600323592002801569650001501597650001201612650001101624650001901635650001401654650002301668650002101691650002201712650001601734650002901750650001501779650001301794650002201807650001101829700001801840700001601858700001401874700001601888700001501904700001401919700001701933700001501950700001801965700001601983700002001999773014102019856007402160852000902234655001202243IND60682661820221119020737.0200130e20200128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068266182DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ta11408d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Feili10aOxygen vacancy engineering in spinel-structured nanosheet wrapped hollow polyhedra for electrochemical nitrogen fixation under ambient conditions  ap. 1652-1659.  aElectrochemical nitrogen-to-ammonia conversion by the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions is regarded as a potential approach to tackle the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process with excessive CO₂ emission. However, the NRR is still restricted by low faradaic efficiency and NH₃ yield, which is due to the chemical inertness of N-related groups for efficient adsorption/activation on the electrocatalysts. Here, a series of spinel-structured nanosheet wrapped hollow nitrogen-doped carbon polyhedra with abundant oxygen vacancies are constructed successfully. From theoretical aspects, these materials show increased charge density on their surface for enhanced capture and activation of N₂ molecules. As a result, oxygen vacancy-rich NiCo₂O₄ on hollow N-carbon polyhedra (Vₒ-rich NiCo₂O₄@HNCP) shows outstanding electrocatalytic NRR performance with high production yield (NH₃: 4.1 μg h⁻¹ cm⁻²/17.8 μg h⁻¹ mg⁻¹; faradaic efficiency: 5.3%) and high stability under ambient conditions and is superior to the counterpart oxygen vacancy-poor electrocatalysts. Oxygen vacancy engineering introduces a new concept for rational design of advanced NRR catalysts for energy conversion systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3aengineering 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ananosheets 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aoxygen1 aFeng, Jianrui1 aYe, Xiaobin1 aZong, Wei1 aHe, Guanjie1 aYang, Chao1 aWang, Wei1 aMiao, Yue-E.1 aPan, Bicai1 aYan, Wensheng1 aLiu, Tianxi1 aParkin, Ivan P.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 Jan. 28, v. 8, no. 4 p.1652-1659dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ta11408d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010300168520126000271592002801531650002501559650002001584650001401604650001101618650002201629650003101651650001601682650002101698650001701719650001401736650001701750651001801767653002101785653001801806700002001824773011001844856008601954852000902040655001202049IND60758302920221121090137.0211219e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075830292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2021.1081892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArai, Toshio10aPotential of human helminth therapy for resolution of inflammatory bowel disease: The future ahead  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a dysregulated mucosal immune response in the gastrointestinal tract. The number of patients with IBD has increased worldwide, especially in highly industrialized western societies. The population of patients with IBD in North America is forecasted to reach about four million by 2030; meanwhile, there is no definitive therapy for IBD. Current anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or biological treatment may induce and maintain remission, but not all patients respond to these treatments. Recent studies explored parasitic helminths as a novel modality of therapy due to their potent immunoregulatory properties in humans. Research using IBD animal models infected with a helminth or administered helminth-derived products such as excretory–secretory products has been promising, and helminth–microbiota interactions exert their anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the host immunity. Recent studies also indicate that evidence that helminth-derived metabolites may play a role in anticolitic effects. Thus, the helminth shows a potential benefit for treatment against IBD. Here we review the current feasibility of “helminth therapy” from the laboratory for application in IBD management.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological treatment 3adigestive tract 3ahelminths 3ahumans 3aimmunosuppression 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3ametabolites 3amucosal immunity 3aparasitology 3aremission 3atherapeutics 3aNorth America 0aHelminth therapy 0aImmune system1 aLopes, Fernando0 tExperimental parasitology.g2022 Jan., v. 232 p.108189-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45466x0014-48947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2021.1081893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245009200175300001600267520217500283592002802458650001902486650002302505650001102528650001902539650001702558650001402575650002002589650001502609650001102624650001402635650002702649650001202676650002302688650001502711650002502726650001002751700002102761700003002782700003702812700001802849773009602867856008102963852000903044655001203053IND60521960020221122034130.0160531e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052196002DNAL7 a10.1007/s12600-012-0231-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatzicharisis, Ioannis10aResidues of six pesticides in fresh peach—nectarine fruits after preharvest treatment  ap. 311-317.  aOne of the key features of the new cultural systems is the control of harmful agents with environment-friendly methods. In this study, the residue levels of chlorothalonil, iprodione, bupirimate, pirimicarb, chlorpyrifos and fenoxycarb in different peach—nectarine cultivars were investigated. It was found that, with the exception of chlorpyrifos, the residue levels of all pesticides were lower than the Maximum Residues Limits (MRLs) in all peach—nectarine cultivars used. The detected levels of chlorpyrifos were higher than the MRLs in the cultivar ‘Maria Bianca’ 7 days after application, but in cv. ‘Legory Hkcb’ dropped to very low levels 27 days after application. The degradation over time of the above pesticides in fruits was investigated in the peach cv. ‘Andross’. The detected residue levels of bupirimate, iprodione, fenoxycarb, chlorpyrifos and pirimicarb in this peach cultivar were much lower than those recommended by the European Union (MRLs) 33, 22, 22, 28, and 63 days, respectively, after application, whereas the residue levels of chlorothalonil were below the limit of detection by the analytical method used. All pesticides showed a reduction over time. When examining the levels of residues of pirimicarb and chlorpyrifos in peaches (cv. ‘Andross’) sampled from different parts of the tree canopy, no significant difference was found between samples collected from the top and the middle parts of the canopy; however, residues of pirimicarb were significantly higher in samples collected at the bottom of the canopy. Overall, the pesticide regime gave residue levels much lower than those of MRLs, in all peach—nectarine cultivars. This use of chemicals is in accordance with features of the new cultural systems to produce fruits with no or minimal pesticide residues, in contrast to the conventional system in which pesticide residues are not considered. Attention should however be paid to chlorpyrifos which should be applied at least 27 days before harvest. Factors related to the cultivars and the position of fruits in the tree canopy should be considered when sampling fruits for pesticide residues analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanalytical methods 3acanopy 3achlorothalonil 3achlorpyrifos 3acultivars 3adetection limit 3afenoxycarb 3afruits 3aiprodione 3amaximum residue limits 3apeaches 3apesticide residues 3apirimicarb 3apreharvest treatment 3atrees1 aThomidis, Thomas1 aTsipouridis, Constantinos1 aMourkidou-Papadopoulou, Efthimia1 aVryzas, Zisis0 tPhytoparasitica.g2012 Sept., v. 40, no. 4 p.311-317dSpringer Netherlandsx0334-21237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-012-0231-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01760naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245015800168300001800326520050100344592002800845650002300873650001100896650002800907650002400935650001300959650002100972650001000993650001101003650001401014700001701028700001601045700006001061700005201121773012101173856008301294852000901377655001201386IND60619469420221122220920.0181102e20181019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061946942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b030692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jian-Quan10a[3 + 2] Cycloaddition of Isocyanides with Aryl Diazonium Salts: Catalyst-Dependent Regioselective Synthesis of 1,3- and 1,5-Disubstituted 1,2,4-Triazoles  ap. 6930-6933.  aAn unprecedented catalyst-dependent regioselective [3 + 2] cycloaddition of isocyanides with aryl diazonium salts is reported. 1,3-Disubstituted 1,2,4-triazoles were selectively obtained in high yield under Ag(I) catalysis, whereas 1,5-disubstituted 1,2,4-triazoles were formed by Cu(II) catalysis.

The present study was conducted with an aim to use in-vitro culture using Jones’ medium to diagnose Blastocystis infection. Among the 70 gut contents of different animals cultured in Jones’ medium, 50 were positive, which included 15 microscopically negative samples. In Jones’ medium, organisms appeared generally ovoid or rounded in profile of different sizes, being only occasionally slightly irregular in outline. Vacuolar and granular forms were the most predominant forms found in in-vitro culture of Jones’ medium. The occurrence of granular forms was found to increase in older culture. Amoeboid form was rarely observed. In culture, stages of binary fission, peanut shaped, polymorphic budding stages were recorded. In vitro culture in Jones’ medium can be a useful diagnostic tool as well as a means to obtain pure cultures of Blastocystis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlastocystis 3adiagnostic techniques 3ain vitro culture 3aintestines 3apeanuts 3aprotists 3avacuoles 3aveterinary parasitology 0aIn-vitro culture 0aJones’ medium1 aSreekumar, C.1 aLatha, Bhaskaran Ravi1 aBharathi, M.

In general, they are comprised of a compartmentalized protease whose activity is modulated by one or more regulatory complexes with which it interacts. The quaternary structure of this compartmentalized protease, called the 20S proteasome, is absolutely conserved and consists of four heptameric rings stacked coaxially. The rings are made of structurally related α and β subunits. In eukaryotes, assembly factors chaperone the α and β subunits during 20S biogenesis. Here we demonstrate that proteasome subunits can assemble into structures other than the canonical 20S proteasome in vivo. Specifically, the yeast α4 subunit forms high molecular weight complexes whose abundance increases when proteasome function is compromised. Results from a disulfide crosslinking approach are consistent with these complexes being ring-shaped. Though several eukaryotic α subunits can form rings when expressed recombinantly in bacteria, this is the first evidence that such non-canonical complexes exist in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiogenesis 3acrosslinking 3aeukaryotic cells 3amolecular weight 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteinases 3ayeasts 0aProteasome 0aAssembly 0aYeast 0aProtein complex 0aNative PAGE 0aCP 0aHMWC 0aRP 0aICAR1 aKusmierczyk, Andrew R.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 482 p.164-169dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.11.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03110naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245018000159300001600339520179200355592002802147650002302175650002502198650000902223650001202232650001102244650001402255650001602269650001802285650001602303650001302319650002202332650001502354650001402369651001002383700001502393700001602408700001802424700002002442700001602462773009602478856008102574852000902655655001202664IND60521960120221122034118.0160531e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052196012DNAL7 a10.1007/s12600-012-0232-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Fei10aEffect of temperature on conidial germination, mycelial growth and aggressiveness of the defoliating and nondefoliating pathotypes of Verticillium dahliae from cotton in China  ap. 319-327.  aThree defoliating (D) pathotype isolates and five nondefoliating (ND) pathotype isolates of Verticillium dahliae from cotton in central China were tested for adaptation to various temperatures in conidial germination on water agar (10–33°C), mycelial growth on potato dextrose agar (10–33°C) and infection of cotton seedlings (Gossypium hirsutum cvs. ‘E Mian 24’ and ‘Yin Rui 361’) (25–33°C). Results showed that the D-pathotype isolates adapted better than the ND-pathotype isolates to 30°C for conidial germination and mycelial growth, although the isolates of the two pathotypes had the same optimum temperature of 25°C. Under day/night temperatures of 25/25, 27/27 and 30/25°C for 20 and 25 days, the D-pathotype isolates induced the defoliation syndrome on seedlings of the two upland cotton cultivars, whereas the ND-pathotype isolates did not induce defoliation syndrome. The values for the areas under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) and the vascular discoloration index (VDI) were higher for the D-pathotype isolates than those for the ND-pathotype isolates in each temperature treatment. Under 30/30 or 33/27°C, at least two of the three D-pathotype isolates still had higher AUDPC values and/or VDI values than all the ND-pathotype isolates on E Mian 24. Therefore, the D-pathotype isolates appear more aggressive than the ND-pathotype isolates in infection of cotton. Results also showed that the cotton cultivar Yin Rui 361 was more tolerant than the cotton cultivar E Mian 24 to infection by both pathotypes of V. dahliae. This study suggests that the D-pathotype isolates can well adapt to high temperature and heavily infect cotton under 25–30°C, and these features might be responsible for the rapid spread of this pathotype in central China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aagar 3aconidia 3acotton 3acultivars 3adefoliation 3adiscoloration 3agermination 3amycelium 3anight temperature 3apathotypes 3aseedlings 3aChina1 aYang, Long1 aZhang, Jing1 aGuo, Xiaoping1 aZhang, Xianlong1 aLi, Guoqing0 tPhytoparasitica.g2012 Sept., v. 40, no. 4 p.319-327dSpringer Netherlandsx0334-21237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12600-012-0232-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245009800130300001400228500001900242520095800261592002801219650002301247650001101270650000901281650001001290650001001300650001001310650001701320650001701337650001001354650001201364650001001376650001401386650003101400650001701431650001601448650001001464650002801474653002301502653001001525653002201535653001101557700002301568700002101591700002001612700001401632700001901646700001301665773017501678852000901853655001201862IND60706352420221119081525.0201107e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070635242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSreekumar, C.10aPathogenesis in extra-hepatic organs due to aberrant migration of Fasciola gigantica in sheep  ap. 26-29.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAdult distome flukes belonging to the genus Fasciola usually inhabit the liver, bile ducts and gall bladder of their ruminant natural hosts. However, in unnatural hosts like humans, and cases of peracute fasciolosis in natural hosts, F. gigantica can erratically migrate to extra-hepatic sites and cause pathogenesis. This paper documents cases of peracute fasciolosis among sheep in a private farm, with lesions in extra-hepatic organs like lungs, heart and kidney. All examined cases were found to exhibit pulmonary involvement characterized by circular, haemorrhagic lesions extending into the lung parenchyma. Two cases of cardiac fasciolosis were documented in sheep for the first time, with cardiac tamponade resulting from accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac leading to death in one case. Haemorrhagic nephritis in sheep due to aberrant migration of a single immature F. gigantica into the subcapsular spaces of kidney was also recorded.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola gigantica 3aadults 3abile 3ablood 3adeath 3afarms 3afascioliasis 3agall bladder 3aheart 3akidneys 3aliver 3anephritis 3aparenchyma (animal tissue) 3apathogenesis 3apericardium 3asheep 3aveterinary parasitology 0aAberrant migration 0aLungs 0aCardiac tamponade 0aKidney1 aVenkataramanan, R.1 aKrishnakumar, S.1 aGunasekaran, S.1 aPrema, N.1 aKumar, R.

Part of conserving this vulnerable and threatened species is maintaining the health of penguins within zoo collections. A variety of cardiovascular diseases has been reported in individuals from the Spheniscidae family including ventricular septal defects, Dirofilaria immitis infection, pulmonary hypertension, and valvular dysplasia, ultimately resulting in congestive heart failure. An accurate clinical picture of cardiovascular disease in Humboldt penguins requires diagnostics tailored to this specific species. The aim of this study was to establish a routine methodology for evaluating the cardiac silhouette of clinically healthy Humboldt penguins using vertebral heart scale (VHS), cardiocoelomic width ratio (CCWR), and a novel cardiac silhouette-to-keel ratio (CKR). Ventrodorsal and right lateral radiographs were taken of 10 mature Humboldt penguins during routine health evaluations. An echocardiographic exam of each penguin was performed to confirm that there was no evidence of cardiac structural remodeling from disease. Two penguins were excluded on the basis of echocardiographic findings; therefore, data from eight penguins were used to calculate objective cardiac measurements for the clinically healthy population. Right lateral radiographs were used to determine VHS (7.4–10.4) and CKR (3.4–4.4). Ventrodorsal radiographs were used for calculating CCWR (0.45–0.59). The excluded penguins had CCWRs that were outside the 95% confidence interval for the range generated by this study. This initial work supports that standardizing radiographic views provides objective measures for cardiac silhouette evaluation in this species. Further research in larger populations and comparison with birds having confirmed cardiac disease is needed to determine the value of these three measurement techniques in Humboldt penguins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDirofilaria immitis 3aEl Nino 3aSpheniscus 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoasts 3aconfidence interval 3adiagnostic techniques 3aechocardiography 3aheart 3aheart failure 3ahypertension 3apenguins 3aradiography 3athreatened species 3azoos 3aChile 3aPeru 0aCardiac silhouette 0acardiocoelomic width ratio 0aHumboldt penguins 0aSpheniscus humboldti 0avertebral heart scale1 aHostnik, Eric T.1 aJohnson, James G.1 aGiatis, Ioannis Z.0 tJournal of zoo and wildlife medicine.g2018 Sept., v. 49, no. 3 p.573-580dAmerican Association of Zoo VeterinarianswJournal:jnl43569x1937-28257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1638/2017-0193.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245016100163300001800324520047100342592002800813650001200841650002300853650002800876650001300904700005400917700001700971700001300988700005501001773012101056856008301177852000901260655001201269IND60619469720221122220949.0181102e20181018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061946972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.8b030902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Sen10aConstruction of Substituted 2-Aminophenols via Formal [3 + 3] Cycloaddition of Alkyl 2-Aroyl-1-chlorocyclopropanecarboxylate with in Situ Generated Enamines  ap. 6943-6947.  aA one-pot, three-component reaction between alkyl 1-chlorocyclopropanecarboxylate, alkyne diester, and amine is developed.

Despite its increasing importance, the judicious modulation of ChB donor strength remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present, for the first time, the reversible and large-scale modulation of ChB potency by electrochemical redox control. This is exemplified by both the switching-ON of anion recognition via ChB oxidative activation of a novel bis(ferrocenyltellurotriazole) anion host and switching-OFF reductive ChB deactivation of anion binding potency with a telluroviologen receptor. The direct linking of the redox-active center and ChB receptor donor sites enables strong coupling, which is reflected by up to a remarkable 3 orders of magnitude modulation of anion binding strength. This is demonstrated through large voltammetric perturbations of the respective receptor ferrocene and viologen redox couples, enabling, for the first time, ChB-mediated electrochemical anion sensing. The sensors not only display significant anion-binding-induced electrochemical responses in competitive aqueous-organic solvent systems but can compete with, or even outperform similar, highly potent XB and HB sensors. These observations serve to highlight a unique (redox) tunability of ChB and pave the way for further exploration of the reversible (redox) modulation of ChB in a wide range of applications, including anion sensors as well as molecular switches and machines.  aPublisher supplied data  aEP/N509711/1cEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100000266 3aelectrochemistry 3aferrocenes 3ahalogens 3asolvents 3avoltammetry1 aDocker, Andrew1 aDavis, Jason J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7734-17091 aBeer, Paul D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0810-97160 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 May 06, v. 144, no. 19 p.8827-8836dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c029243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012200170300001600292520183400308592002802142650001602170650001302186650001202199650000902211650000702220650001302227650001602240650002002256650001602276650001402292653002702306653001602333653002302349653003002372653001502402653003102417653000702448653000802455653000802463653000802471653000802479653000802487653000802495653001002503700001702513700001802530700001402548700001602562700001902578700002302597700005702620700005702677700002002734700001902754773012102773856008202894852000902976655001202985IND60560207820221120183611.0170606e20170122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056020782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.11.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinoshita, Misaki10aEnergetic basis on interactions between ferredoxin and ferredoxin NADP+ reductase at varying physiological conditions  ap. 909-915.  aIn spite of a number of studies to characterize ferredoxin (Fd):ferredoxin NADP+ reductase (FNR) interactions at limited conditions, detailed energetic investigation on how these proteins interact under near physiological conditions and its linkage to FNR activity are still lacking.We herein performed systematic Fd:FNR binding thermodynamics using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) at distinct pH (6.0 and 8.0), NaCl concentrations (0–200 mM), and temperatures (19–28 °C) for mimicking physiological conditions in chloroplasts.Energetically unfavorable endothermic enthalpy changes were accompanied by Fd:FNR complexation at all conditions. This energetic cost was compensated by favorable entropy changes, balanced by conformational and hydrational entropy. Increases in the NaCl concentration and pH weakened interprotein affinity due to the less contribution of favorable entropy change regardless of energetic gains from enthalpy changes, suggesting that entropy drove complexation and modulated affinity. Effects of temperature on binding thermodynamics were much smaller than those of pH and NaCl. NaCl concentration and pH-dependent enthalpy and heat capacity changes provided clues for distinct binding modes. Moreover, decreases in the enthalpy level in the Hammond's postulate-based energy landscape implicated kinetic advantages for FNR activity.All these energetic interplays were comprehensively demonstrated by the driving force plot with the enthalpy-entropy compensation which may serve as an energetic buffer against outer stresses. We propose that high affinity at pH 6.0 may be beneficial for protection from proteolysis of Fd and FNR in rest states, and moderate affinity at pH 8.0 and proper NaCl concentrations with smaller endothermic enthalpy changes may contribute to increase FNR activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalorimetry 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3aheat 3apH 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3atitration 0aBinding thermodynamics 0aCalorimetry 0aDriving force plot 0aElectron transfer complex 0aFerredoxin 0aFerredoxin-NADP+ reductase 0aFd 0aFNR 0aSiR 0aITC 0aΔH 0aΔS 0aΔG 0aΔ;Cp1 aKim, Ju Yaen1 aKume, Satoshi1 aLin, Yuxi1 aMok, K.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the genetic diversity of a colored rice germplasm collection containing 376 black-purple rice samples and 172 red pericarp samples, conserved by Dong-A University. There were 600 pairs of SSR primers screened against 11 rice varieties. Sixteen informative primer pairs were selected, having high polymorphism information content (PIC) values, which were then used to assess the genetic diversity within the collection. A total of 409 polymorphic amplified fragments were obtained using the 16 SSR markers. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 11 to 47, with an average of 25.6. The average PIC value was 0.913, ranging from 0.855 to 0.964. Four hundred and nine SSR loci were used to calculate Jaccard&rsquo;s distance coefficients, using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean cluster analysis. These accessions were separated into several distinctive groups corresponding to their morphology. The results provided valuable information for the colored rice breeding program and showed the importance of protecting germplasm resources and the molecular markers that can be derived from them.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3abreeding programs 3achromosome mapping 3acluster analysis 3acolor 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apericarp 3aplant breeding 3arice1 aYang, Won-Tae 1 aKwon, Yong-Sham 1 aKim, Hyeon-Nam 1 aKim, Kyung-Min 1 aKim, Doh-Hoon 0 tPlants.g2019 Nov. 04, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants81104713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01645naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245007700131300001400208500001900222520056000241592002800801650002800829650001900857650001400876650002100890650001000911650002800921651001000949653001900959653001500978653001500993700002201008700001801030700002301048700001601071773017501087852000901262655001201271IND60706352820221119081617.0201107e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070635282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAravindhan, G.10aPrevalence of paramphistomes in sheep slaughtered at Chennai, Tamil Nadu  ap. 43-45.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aParamphistomosis is one of the most important parasitic diseases in sheep and causes severe production loss and mortality.

Unambiguous identification of catalytic poisoning species requires experimental methods simultaneously delivering accurate information regarding adsorption sites and adsorption geometries of adsorbates with nanometer-scale spatial resolution, as well as their detailed chemical structure and surface functional groups. However, to date, it has not been possible to study catalytic sulfur poisoning of metal/metal-oxide interfaces at the nanometer scale without sacrificing chemical definition. Here, we demonstrate that near-field nano-infrared spectroscopy can effectively identify the chemical nature, adsorption sites, and adsorption geometries of sulfur-based catalytic poisons on a Pd(nanodisk)/Al₂O₃ (thin-film) planar model catalyst surface at the nanometer scale. The current results reveal striking variations in the nature of sulfate species from one nanoparticle to another, vast alterations of sulfur poisoning on a single Pd nanoparticle as well as at the assortment of sulfate species at the active metal–metal-oxide support interfacial sites. These findings provide critical molecular-level insights crucial for the development of long-lifetime precious metal catalysts resistant toward deactivation by sulfur.  aPublisher supplied data  a678941/SINCATcH2020 European Research Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010663  a2015.0055cKnut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelsedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004063  a119M058cT?rkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumudhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004410  a2006K12-827cRepublic of Turkey Presidential Directorate of Strategy and Budgetdhttps://doi.org/NA 3aadsorption 3achemical structure 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3ananocatalysts 3asulfates 3asulfur1 aKaya, Melike1 aKaderoğlu, Çağıl1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4382-60751 aKoçak, Yusuf,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4511-13211 aErcan, Kerem Emre1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4650-79771 aSika-Nartey, Abel Tetteh1 aJalal, Ahsan1 aTurk, Ahmet Arda1 aLanghammer, Christoph1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2180-13791 aJahangirzadeh Varjovi, Mirali1 aDurgun, Engin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0639-58621 aOzensoy, Emrah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4352-38240 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2022 Apr. 29, v. 144, no. 19 p.8848-8860dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c030883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245016100160520192100321592002802242650001602270650002402286650001802310650001702328650001602345650001302361650001702374650001602391650001002407650001402417650001402431650002002445650002002465650001802485650001902503650001702522650003002539650001802569650004002587650001202627650002002639650001202659650001302671650002102684650001702705650002102722700002802743700001402771700001502785700001902800700001702819700001602836700001802852700001502870773012102885856007803006852000903084655001203093IND60754186020221118043724.0211023e20210923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075418602DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101022522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Minglei 10aAnti-Hyperlipidemia and Gut Microbiota Community Regulation Effects of Selenium-Rich Cordyceps militaris Polysaccharides on the High-Fat Diet-Fed Mice Model  aSupplementation of polysaccharides is a promising gut microbiota-targeted therapeutic method for obesity and metabolic diseases. Biological activities of Cordyceps militaris polysaccharides have been well reported, but the effect of selenium (Se)-rich C. militaris polysaccharides (SeCMP) on obesity and associated metabolic disorder and gut microbiota composition has been rarely studied. This study aimed to investigate the anti-obesity and gut microbiota modulatory effect of crude polysaccharides separated from Se-rich C. militaris on a high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice model. Mice were treated with a normal diet (CHOW), HFD alone, HFD plus C. militaris polysaccharides (CMP), or low/medium/high dosage of SeCMP for 8 weeks. Body weight, fat content, serum lipid, appetite hormone, lipid gene expression, inflammation cytokines, thermogenic protein, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and gut microbiota structure of the mice were determined. Compared with HFD-fed mice, the serum triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the SeCMP-200 group were decreased by 51.5% and 44.1%, respectively. Furthermore, serum lipopolysaccharide-binding proteins (LBP), adiponectin level, and pro-inflammation gene expression in the colon and subcutaneous fat were inhibited, whereas anti-inflammation gene expression was improved, reflecting SeCMP-200 might mitigate obese-induced inflammation. Meanwhile, SeCMP-200 promoted satiety and thermogenesis of obese mice. It also significantly decreased gut bacteria, such as Dorea, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, that negatively correlated with obesity traits and increased mucosal beneficial bacteria Akkermansia. There was no significant difference between CMP and SeCMP-100 groups. Our results revealed a high dose of SeCMP could prevent HFD-induced dyslipidemia and gut microbiota dysbiosis and was potential to be used as functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aCordyceps militaris 3aLactobacillus 3aRuminococcus 3aadiponectin 3aappetite 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3acolon 3acytokines 3adysbiosis 3agene expression 3aheat production 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid content 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3aobesity 3apolysaccharides 3asatiety 3aselenium 3asubcutaneous fat 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols1 aU̇su̇ru̇nggu̇i, L.,1 aHui, Nan 1 aZhi, Yuee 1 aHayat, Kashif 1 aYang, Xijia 1 aZhang, Dan 1 aChu, Shaohua 1 aZhou, Pei 0 tFoods.g2021 Sept. 23, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101022523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02379naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010500158300001800263500001900281520100400300592002801304650001901332650002201351650002601373650002301399650001201422650001301434650001601447650001301463650001801476650001401494650001301508650001601521650001301537700003101550700002201581700002101603700002501624700001901649700001801668700001801686773012201704856007401826852000901900655001201909IND60682058620221122183006.0200123e20200122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068205862DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09938g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTshuma, Piwai10aCyclometalation of lanthanum(iii) based MOF for catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to formate  ap. 3593-3605.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe hydrogenation of carbon dioxide (CO₂) to formic acid is of great importance due to its useful properties in the chemical industry. In this work, we have prepared a novel metal–organic framework (MOF), JMS-1, using bipyridyl dicarboxylate linkers, with molecular formula [La₂(bpdc)₃(DMF)₃]ₙ. Network analysis of JMS-1 revealed a new 7-connected topology (zaz). The MOF backbone of the activated phase (JMS-1a) was functionalized by cyclometalation using [RuCl₂(p-cymene)]₂ to produce Ru(ii)@JMS-1a. Both JMS-1a and Ru(ii)@JMS-1a were able to convert CO₂ in the presence of hydrogen to formate. Ru(ii)@JMS-1a displayed outstanding conversion evidenced by a yield of 98% of formate under optimized conditions of total pressure 50 bar (CO₂/H₂ = 1 : 4, temperature 110 °C, time 24 h, 5 mmol KOH, 8 mL ethanol). This work is significant in providing new strategies of incorporating active catalytic centres in MOFs for efficient and selective conversion of CO₂ to formate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical industry 3acoordination polymers 3adicarboxylic acids 3aethanol 3aformates 3aformic acid 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3alanthanum 3ap-cymene 3atemperature 3atopology1 aMakhubela, Banothile C.

The bushmeat trade frequently leads to an increase in the number of orphaned primates. HELP Congo was the first project to successfully release wild-born orphan chimpanzees into an existing chimpanzee habitat. A collection of post monitoring data over 16 years now offers the unique opportunity to investigate possible behavioural adaptations in these chimpanzees. We investigated the feeding and activity patterns in eight individuals via focal observation techniques from 1997–1999 and 2001–2005. Our results revealed a decline in the number of fruit and insect species in the diet of released chimpanzees over the years, whereas within the same period of time, the number of consumed seed species increased. Furthermore, we found a decline in time spent travelling, but an increase in time spent on social activities, such as grooming, as individuals matured. In conclusion, the observed changes in feeding and activity patterns seem to reflect important long-term behavioural and ecological adaptations in wild-born orphan released chimpanzees, demonstrating that the release of chimpanzees can be successful, even if it takes time for full adaptation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPan troglodytes 3aanimals 3abushmeat 3adecline 3adiet 3adisease transmission 3afeeding behavior 3afruits 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3alogging 3alongitudinal studies 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3apopulation 3atrade 3aRepublic of the Congo1 aJamart, Aliette1 aGoossens, Benoit1 aRoss, Caroline0 tAnimals.g2013 June 07, v. 3, no. 2 p.532-550dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani30205323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002900143245012200172520172200294592002802016650002302044650005202067650001802119650001602137650001602153650001802169650002202187650001702209650002402226650001302250650001102263650002602274650002002300650001202320700002302332700002402355700002102379700002902400700002002429773012002449856007802569852000902647655001202656IND60754186220221118043710.0211023e20211009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075418622DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101023892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVargas-Ramella, Márcio 12aA Year Following the Onset of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Existing Challenges and Ways the Food Industry Has Been Impacted  aThe COVID-19 pandemic has created significant impacts for nearly all industrial and societal sectors in the world. As closures and social distancing mandates were implemented to help control the spread of the novel coronavirus designated as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the food industry was immensely affected. This review explores the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chain from a multi-disciplinary viewpoint and provides perspectives on the consequences on food safety and food security, a risk assessment on human–animal interactions, and considers logistical/protocol adjustments required for the food industry. While foodborne transmission of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is not a significant factor for food safety as direct transmission of the virus through food products is not evident, food security has been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic threatens food accessibility, especially for vulnerable populations of people, through its effects on food cost and infrastructure, food distribution and public transit access, and social inequities. Currently, global interest for COVID-19 is focused on human health and rightfully so, but adverse effects on the food supply chain are already evident and will likely continue to occur for several years after the pandemic is over, let alone if other global health pandemics of this magnitude surface in upcoming years. Uncertainties over the novel coronavirus have interrupted global trade and supply chains. The pandemic has underlined the importance of a robust and resilient food system, which presents an unprecedented challenge for competent authorities in upcoming years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3afood industry 3afood prices 3afood safety 3afood security 3afood supply chain 3ahuman health 3ainternational trade 3apandemic 3apeople 3apublic transportation 3arisk assessment 3aviruses1 aLorenzo, José M.,1 aBohrer, Benjamin M.1 aPateiro, Mirian 1 aCantalapiedra, Jesús J.1 aFranco, Daniel 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 09, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101023893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010400170300001200274520133100286592002801617650003701645650001201682650003701694650000901731650001401740650000701754650001301761650002301774650001301797700002201810700002501832773012401857856008101981852000902062655001202071IND60574458420221119065158.0170816e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057445842DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3466-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLizama-Allende, K.10aRemoval of Arsenic and Iron from Acidic Water Using Zeolite and Limestone: Batch and Column Studies  ap. 275.  aZeolite and limestone were tested for their capability of removing As and Fe from acidic water in batch and column experiments. Synthetic acidic water with 3 mg/L As and 50 or 100 mg/L Fe at pH = 2 was used in the column experiments. In the batch experiments, the As concentration, the mass of media, and the contact time were varied between 0.2 and 5 mg As/L, 0.5 and 50 g, and 0.25 and 42 h, respectively. Maximum As sorption capacity as indicated by the Langmuir model was 0.17 mg/g for zeolite and 1.3 mg/g for limestone, at 18-h contact time and 6.3 g/L medium concentration. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that As and Fe were retained in zeolite at the end of the batch experiments. The main factors affecting As and Fe removal efficiency and pH raising capacity were the contact time and the media concentration. This was confirmed in the column experiments, since zeolite and limestone columns presented 99% As removal, under a hydraulic loading rate of 21.8 mm/day. However, limestone columns presented a higher Fe removal: 99 versus 73% for zeolite. The results indicate that limestone could be more appropriate than zeolite when As and Fe are present under acidic conditions, given its higher capacity to remove both As and Fe and to raise pH.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aarsenic 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airon 3alimestone 3apH 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3azeolites1 aHenry-Pinilla, D.1 aDiaz-Droguett, D.

The conversion of thioanisole is up to 95%, and the selectivity of methyl phenyl sulfoxide is 98%. The activity of DUT-67(Zr) is over 10 times higher than that of UiO-66. This great increased activity is attributed to the high percentages of oxygen vacancies on DUT-67(Zr). The ESR result shows there are more oxygen vacancies that can expose high density unsaturated Zr sites on DUT-67(Zr). The in situ FTIR reveals that unsaturated Zr sites on DUT-67(Zr) possess Lewis acidity which facilitate the adsorption of the substrates to form the coordination species, promoting the activation of thioanisole. The absorption edge of DUT-67(Zr) with coordination species red-shifts to 360 nm, which can be presented by DRS. Furthermore, the oxygen molecules can be activated by excited electrons to form •O₂⁻. Finally, a possible photocatalytic process of oxidating thioanisole to methyl phenyl sulfoxide based on the coordination effect between DUT-67(Zr) and thioanisole is proposed at a molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aacidity 3aadsorption 3aelectrons 3aorganic sulfur compounds 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aphotocatalysis 3asuperoxide anion 3azirconium1 aZou, Junhua1 aGuo, Binbin1 aRen, Yahang1 aWang, Zhitong1 aSong, Yujie1 aYu, Yan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6748-26201 aWu, Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2652-81050 tLangmuir.g2020 Feb. 19, v. 36, no. 9 p.2199-2208dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b025823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245016200159300001600321520103600337592002801373650002301401650001801424650001701442650001001459650001101469650000901480650002601489650001901515650001901534650001001553650001201563650001301575650001801588650001201606650001001618650002001628650001101648650001501659650001701674650000901691653002801700653002401728653001901752653001101771700001501782700001701797700001601814700001301830773013501843856007801978852000902056655001202065IND60520600720221118121732.0160522e20160119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052060072DNAL7 a10.1515/pjvs-2015-00962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlacha, I.10aEffects of dietary supplementation with sage (Salvia officinalis L.) essential oil on antioxidant status and duodenal wall integrity of laying strain growers  ap. 741-749.  aThe objective of this study was to compare the influence of four different concentrations of Salvia officinalis essential oil (EO) on animal health.

Human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC)-derived osteoblasts and THP-1 human acute monocytic leukemia cell line-derived osteoclasts were dynamically co-cultured on the chitosan-hydroxyapatite (chitosan-HA) superporous hydrogel. In the perfusion bioreactor set-up, bidirectional recycled perfusion with 6mL/h flow rate was applied and cell seeding was realized in two-steps with a preculture time of 12days. Outcomes were compared to static cultures. Two-step cell seeding and long preculture ensured good adhesion of cells on the scaffold surface and minimized cell loss during perfusion. The perfusion bioreactor enhanced mass transfer throughout the scaffolds, thus increased cellularity and provided flow-induced mechanical stimulation for osteoblastic and osteoclastogenic differentiation. The results indicated that osteoblast and osteoclast co-cultures in perfusion bioreactors provide a one-step approach to in vitro bone tissue engineering and emphasized the significance of enhanced mass transfer and mechanical stimulation on cellular activity and differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioreactors 3abones 3acell adhesion 3acoculture 3ahumans 3ahydrocolloids 3ain vitro regeneration 3amass transfer 3aneoplasm cells 3aosteoblasts 3aosteoclasts 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 0aBone tissue engineering 0aPerfusion bioreactor 0aCo-culture 0ahMSCs 0aTHP-1 cell line 0aChitosan1 aHayden, Rebecca S.1 aGlettig, Dean L.1 aKaplan, David L.1 aGümüşderelioğlu, Menemşe0 tProcess biochemistry.g2017 Aug., v. 59 p.303-311dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2016.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03328naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002900113040001800142100002200160245014500182300001600327500001500343520173100358592002802089650001702117650001402134650001202148650002002160650002002180650001002200650001002210650001702220650002502237650001202262650002702274650001402301650002102315650001702336653001702353653002702370653001802397653004102415653001002456653001802466653002502484653001602509653002202525700002002547700002002567773011502587856007502702852000902777655001202786IND60114907020221119194650.0141124e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011490702DNAL7 a234458232pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.12004162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagallón, Susana10aLand plant evolutionary timeline: Gene effects are secondary to fossil constraints in relaxed clock estimation of age and substitution rates  ap. 556-573.  a2019-12-04  a• Premise of the study: Land plants play an essential role in the evolution of terrestrial life. Their time of origin and diversification is fundamental to understanding the evolution of life on land. We investigated the timing and the rate of molecular evolution of land plants, evaluating the effects of different types of molecular data, including temporal information from fossils, and using different molecular clock methods.• Methods: Ages and absolute rates were estimated independently with two substitutionally different data sets: a highly conserved 4-gene data set and matK, a fast-evolving gene. The vascular plant backbone and the crown nodes of all major lineages were calibrated with fossil-derived ages. Dates and absolute rates were estimated while including or excluding the calibrations and using two relaxed clocks that differ in their implementation of temporal autocorrelation.• Key results: Land plants diverged from streptophyte alga 912 (870–962) million years ago (Mya) but diversified into living lineages 475 (471–480) Mya. Ages estimated for all major land-plant lineages agree with their fossil record, except for angiosperms. Different genes estimated very similar ages and correlated absolute rates across the tree. Excluding calibrations resulted in the greatest age differences. Different relaxed clocks provided similar ages, but different and uncorrelated absolute rates.• Conclusions: Whole-genome rate accelerations or decelerations may underlie the similar ages and correlated absolute rates estimated with different genes. We suggest that pronounced substitution rate changes around the angiosperm crown node may represent a challenge for relaxed clocks to model adequately.  aPublisher supplied data 3aembryophytes 3aevolution 3afossils 3adata collection 3aautocorrelation 3atrees 3agenes 3aAngiospermae 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFossils 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aTime Factors 0acalibrations 0amodel misspecification 0afossil record 0auncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock 0aAlgae 0aMagnoliophyta 0apenalized likelihood 0aangiosperms 0asubstitution rate1 aHilu, Khidir W.1 aQuandt, Dietmar0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2013 Mar., v. 100, no. 3 p.556-573dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.12004163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03487naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013700171300001800308520127800326592002801604650001301632650001401645650001601659650001901675650001101694650001101705650001701716650001501733653001301748653001701761653001201778653001001790653001001800653001401810653001401824653001301838653001501851653001401866653001501880653001301895653001301908653001001921653001101931653001301942653001301955653001101968653001701979653001101996653002302007653002302030653001802053653001702071653001802088653001802106653002202124653001902146653002602165653001602191653002702207653002602234653001802260653001602278653002402294700001802318700002402336700001902360700002002379700001902399700005802418773011002476856008602586852000902672655001202681IND60530309720221117213538.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053030972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2016.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrein, Tanja A.10aMultiphase mixing characteristics in a microcarrier-based stirred tank bioreactor suitable for human mesenchymal stem cell expansion  ap. 1109-1119.  aLarge-scale human mesenchymal stem cell expansion calls for a bioreaction system, that provides a sufficient growth surface. An alternative to static cultivations systems like cell factories are disposable stirred tank reactors. Here, microcarriers provide the required growth surface, but these make it difficult to achieve a complete homogenization in the bioreactor, while avoiding shear stress. To gain insight into this process, we investigated the impact of different power inputs (0.02–2.6Wm⁻³) on the mixing time (tm). Whereas tm was inversely proportional to agitation in a one-phase-system, aeration resulted in a constant mixing time at 30–70rpm. A high microcarrier concentration (30gL⁻¹) and low stirrer speed (30rpm) in the liquid-solid system caused a 50-fold increase in tm and the formation of a discrete non-mixed upper zone. The effect of the microcarrier concentration on tm became negligible at higher stirrer speeds. In the three-phase system, microcarrier settling was prevented by aeration and a minimal specific power input of 0.6Wm⁻³ was sufficient for complete homogenization. We confirmed that a low power input during stem cell expansion leads to inhomogeneity, which has not been investigated in the three-phase system up to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aagitation 3abioreactors 3ahomogenization 3ahumans 3amixing 3ashear stress 3astem cells 0acv [−] 0acv,max [−] 0aC [−] 0aD [m] 0ad [m] 0admt [−] 0adpi [−] 0aFG [vvm] 0ag [ms−2] 0an [s−1] 0anc [s−1] 0aNe [−] 0aNm [−] 0aP [W] 0aPa [W] 0aRe [−] 0aSu [−] 0aV [m3] 0aVa [m3s−1] 0atm [s] 0aηl [kgm−1s−1] 0aηm [kgm−1s−1] 0aρm [kgm−3] 0aρ [kgm−3] 0aρc [kgm−3] 0aεT [s3m−2] 0aυ [m2N−1s−1] 0aτ [dyncm−2] 0aMesenchymal stem cell 0aMixing time 0aTransition flow regime 0aDisposable bioreactor 0aMicrocarriers 0aPower input 0aParticle suspension1 aLeber, Jasmin1 aBlumenstock, Miriam1 aPetry, Florian1 aWeidner, Tobias1 aSalzig, Denise1 aCzermak, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7485-500X0 tProcess biochemistry.g2016 Sept., v. 51, no. 9 p.1109-1119dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2016.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245005600171300001800227520124900245536008701494592002801581596001101609650002201620650002301642650002501665650002201690650002001712650001501732650002401747653001501771653002901786653002901815653001001844653000901854653002601863653002201889700002401911700001901935773015301954856008602107852000902193655001202202IND60781614420221120113820.0220629e20220630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078161442DNAL7 a10.1080/10643389.2021.19047092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhar, Bidhan C.10aDeveloping mitochondrial DNA field-compatible tests  ap. 3137-3177.  aNucleic acid-based molecular detection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been used for the detection of eukaryotic pathogens, genetic markers, and biomedical studies in humans and animals, forensic investigation, conservation biology, and environmental monitoring. Currently available molecular mtDNA testing is predominately dependent on relatively expensive laboratory equipment, which limits test applicability for on-site field testing. Recent technical advances in molecular testing of mtDNA using microfluidic chip technology and paper-based methods, and assays based on isothermal nucleic acid amplification show promise for field assay development. Microfluidic and paper-based components for mtDNA sample preparation and isothermal amplification establish the groundwork for targeted detection. The goal is on-site field detection mtDNA assays that combine sample processing, assay setup, and visual representation of the presence of mtDNA. This review examines advantages and disadvantages of alternative field-compatible tests for on-site detection of mtDNA. Despite challenges, developing an integrated “sample-through detection” field test platform is the future direction for mtDNA molecular detection in environmental samples.  aThe work was supported, by funds from the National Pork Board under grant #19-095.  aPublisher supplied data  a19-095 3aforensic sciences 3agene amplification 3alaboratory equipment 3amitochondrial DNA 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3atechnology 3awildlife management 0aBiosensors 0aenvironmental monitoring 0aisothermal amplification 0amtDNA 0anDNA 0aon-site field testing 0apaper-based assay1 aRoche, Christina E.1 aLevine, Jay F.0 tCritical reviews in environmental science and technology.g2022 June 30, v. 52, no. 17 p.3137-3177dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12197x1547-65377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10643389.2021.19047093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03291naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002300171245011200194300001600306520102200322592002801344650002301372650001501395650001201410650001501422650002001437650001401457650000901471650002201480650001601502650001301518650004001531650001201571650002401583650001101607650002701618650002301645650002901668650001101697650003401708650003901742650002301781650004001804650001501844650002701859650002001886650003101906650004201937650001501979650003001994650004102024651001902065651001102084653003302095653002302128653003202151653004902183700002102232700002302253700002202276700002102298700002102319700002102340773010002361856008702461852000902548655001202557IND50070068420221118172629.0190402e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007006842DNAL7 a241285652pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaciel, Juliana V.10aFeasibility of microwave-induced combustion for trace element determination in Engraulis anchoita by ICP-MS  ap. 927-931.  aA method based on microwave-induced combustion (MIC) was developed for fish (Engraulis anchoita) digestion and subsequent determination of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, and Zn by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A reflux step (5min) was applied to improve absorption and recovery of analytes. Nitric acid was investigated as absorbing solution and suitable results were achieved using 5molL−1 HNO3. Microwave-assisted digestion in closed vessels using concentrated HNO3 was also evaluated for comparison of results. Both sample preparation methods were considered suitable for sample digestion but MIC was preferable not only because diluted HNO3 can be used as absorbing solution but also because it provides higher efficiency of digestion and also better limits of detection. Accuracy was evaluated by the analysis of certified reference materials (DORM-2 and TORT-2) after MIC digestion with subsequent determination by ICP-MS.

This may lead to glial reactivity ie. increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and S100β protein, and also to hypertrophy and proliferation of cells which are determined by the presence of Ki-67 antigen. The aim of the study was to analyse the immunoreactivity of the GFAP, S100β and Ki-67 proteins in astrocytes of hippocampal CA1 region in young rats after administration of monosodium glutamate (MSG) at two doses: 2 g/kg b.w. (I group) and 4 g/kg b.w. (II group). In rats from I and II group morphologically altered astrocytes with the GFAP expression were observed in the SLM of the hippocampal CA1 region. The cells had eccentrically located nuclei and on the opposite site of the nuclei there were single or double, long and weakly branched processes. Moreover, in the SLM the increase of the number of GFAP and S100β immunopositive astrocytes and nuclei with Ki-67 expression, in contrary to control individuals, was observed. These results suggest the increased expression of the proteins in early reactions or hyperplasia which, together with cell hypertrophy, indicate late reactivity of astroglia in response to glutamate noxious effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aastrocytes 3ahippocampus 3ahyperplasia 3ahypertrophy 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amonosodium glutamate 3aproteins 3arats 0aastrocytes 0aMSG 0aglial reactivity 0arats 0ahippocampus1 aJaworska-Adamu, J.1 aRycerz, K.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2016 Jan. 19, v. 18, no. 4 p.767-774dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000145x2300-25577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjvs-2015-00993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245006600213300001200279520173500291592002802026650002602054650001602080650003002096650002802126650001902154650001602173650001702189650002502206650001702231650001402248650001802262650001902280650002202299650002002321650000902341651002102350651001502371700003102386700002802417700002802445700002202473700002002495700001902515700002002534700002602554773015202580856008302732852000902815655001202824IND60787272420221121234556.0220826e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078727242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-022-10328-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcevedo-Barrios, Rosa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5593-017110aPerchlorate-reducing bacteria from Antarctic marine sediments  ap. 654.  aPerchlorate is a contaminant that can persist in groundwater and soil, and is frequently detected in different ecosystems at concentrations relevant to human health. This study isolated and characterised halotolerant bacteria that can potentially perform perchlorate reduction. Bacterial microorganisms were isolated from marine sediments on Deception, Horseshoe and Half Moon Islands of Antarctica. The results of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolates were phylogenetically related to Psychrobacter cryohalolentis, Psychrobacter urativorans, Idiomarina loihiensis, Psychrobacter nivimaris, Sporosarcina aquimarina and Pseudomonas lactis. The isolates grew at a sodium chloride concentration of up to 30% and a perchlorate concentration of up to 10,000 mg/L, which showed their ability to survive in saline conditions and high perchlorate concentrations. Between 21.6 and 40% of perchlorate was degraded by the isolated bacteria. P. cryohalolentis and P. urativorans degraded 30.3% and 32.6% of perchlorate, respectively. I. loihiensis degraded 40% of perchlorate, and P. nivimaris, S. aquimarina and P. lactis degraded 22%, 21.8% and 21.6% of perchlorate, respectively. I. loihiensis had the highest reduction in perchlorate, whereas P. lactis had the lowest reduction. This study is significant as it is the first finding of P. cryohalolentis and. P. lactis on the Antarctic continent. In conclusion, these bacteria isolated from marine sediments on Antarctica offer promising resources for the bioremediation of perchlorate contamination due to their ability to degrade perchlorate, showing their potential use as a biological system to reduce perchlorate in high-salinity ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIdiomarina loihiensis 3aPseudomonas 3aPsychrobacter urativorans 3aSporosarcina aquimarina 3abioremediation 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3anucleotide sequences 3aperchlorates 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asalt tolerance 3asequence analysis 3asodium chloride 3asoil 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica1 aRubiano-Labrador, Carolina1 aNavarro-Narvaez, Dhania1 aEscobar-Galarza, Johana1 aGonzález, Diana,1 aMira, Stephanie1 aMoreno, Dayana1 aContreras, Aura1 aMiranda-Castro, Wendy0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2022 Sept., v. 194, no. 9 p.654-654dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-022-10328-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245008300172300001400255520116100269592002801430650001201458650003501470650001201505650001101517650001201528650000901540650002701549650001201576650000901588650001801597650001501615650001301630650001301643650000901656650001601665650001201681651001201693700001801705700001801723700002101741700002001762700002301782700002101805773008701826856008601913852000901999655001202008IND4449747220221120182402.0141111e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444974722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilandžić, Nina10aTrace element levels in raw milk from northern and southern regions of Croatia  ap. 63-66.  aA total of 157 raw milk samples were collected from tankers arriving at processing facilities from rural areas in northern and southern regions of Croatia during 2009 and 2010. Concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Hg and Pb in the samples were analysed by graphite furnace-atomic absorption spectroscopy. Mean Pb concentrations in northern and southern regions were 58.7 and 36.2μgl⁻¹, respectively, and both exceeded the maximum recommended level. Arsenic concentrations ranged from 1 to 283μgl⁻¹ in the southern and to 1019μgl⁻¹ in the northern regions. Mean Cd and Hg levels were: 1.76 and 1.59 in the northern and 3.4 and 7.1μgl⁻¹ in the southern region. Significantly higher Cd and Hg levels were observed in the southern than in the northern region (p<0.001, both). Similar mean Cu levels were found in both regions: 931.9 in the north and 848.4μgl⁻¹ in the south. The results indicate that particular attention should be paid to Pb residues. In future studies, a greater number of milk samples and grass samples from pastures from different regions of Croatia should be controlled to confirm the absence of possible toxicological risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3acopper 3agrasses 3alead 3amaximum residue limits 3amercury 3amilk 3amilk analysis 3amilk tanks 3apastures 3araw milk 3arisk 3arural areas 3atankers 3aCroatia1 aĐokić, Maja1 aSedak, Marija1 aSolomun, Božica1 aVarenina, Ivana1 aKnežević, Zorka,1 aBenić, Miroslav0 tFood chemistry.g2011 July 1, v. 127, no. 1 p.63-66dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245007000163300001600233520076400249592002801013650002901041650001301070650001701083650000901100650001001109650002801119650002101147650002201168650004301190651001101233653002901244653001801273653000901291653001101300700001601311700001401327773013501341856007801476852000901554655001201563IND60520601120221120204129.0160522e20160119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052060112DNAL7 a10.1515/pjvs-2015-01002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalczyk, M.10aDetection of Pentatrichomonas hominis in dogs using real-time PCR  ap. 775-778.  aTrichomonadidae family is a protozoan occurring in different animal species. It inhabits the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts. P. hominis is rarely found in faecal samples of dogs, and its identification and differentiation from other trichomonads by light microscopy are difficult. Methods of molecular biology are the most effective in this case, because they confirm the presence of the specific species in animal organisms, irrespective of the protozoan form. The aim of this study was to find P. hominis in selected dog kennels in North-Eastern Poland. Forty-one faecal samples of dogs from 7 dog kennels were examined. The occurrence of P. hominis in 5 faecal samples of dogs with no symptoms of diarrhoea was the first one to be confirmed in Poland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPentatrichomonas hominis 3adiarrhea 3adog diseases 3adogs 3afeces 3agastrointestinal system 3alight microscopy 3amolecular biology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aPoland 0aPentatrichomonas hominis 0areal-time PCR 0adogs 0aPoland1 aSokół, R.1 aSocha, P.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2016 Jan. 19, v. 18, no. 4 p.775-778dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000145x2300-25577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjvs-2015-01003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010500169500001900274520144600293592002801739650001601767650000901783650001601792650001101808650001301819650001101832650001101843650001101854650000901865650001001874651001001884653002301894653002401917653001801941653002401959653002201983700001902005700001902024700001502043773012502058856008502183852000902268655001202277IND60738535820221120161914.0210705e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073853582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1061842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Zhencun10aRecognition of rice leaf diseases and wheat leaf diseases based on multi-task deep transfer learning  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMore than two-thirds of human in the world view rice or wheat as their diet, rice and wheat are grown in some regions of China and other countries in Asian. However, a variety of diseases can affect the growth of rice and wheat, reducing their harvest and even cause famine in some areas. Diseases in leaves, as a kind of diseases, have negative impacts on plants. Under this background, quickly and accurately recognition method is necessary to take in practice and educe the loss. In order to solve this problem, this article aims at three kinds of rice leaf diseases and two kinds of wheat leaf diseases, collects 40 images of each leaf diseases and enhances them. And aims to improve the Visual Geometry Group Network-16(VGG16) model based on the idea of multi-task learning and then use the pre-training model on ImageNET for transfer learning and alternating learning. The accuracy of such model is 97.22% for rice leaf diseases and 98.75% for wheat leaf diseases. Through comparative experiments, it is proved that the effects of this method are better than single-task model, reuse-model method in transfer learning, resnet50 model and densenet121 model. The experimental results show that the improved VGG16 model and multi-task transfer learning method proposed in this article can recognize rice leaf diseases and wheat leaf diseases at the same time, which provides a reliable method for recognizing leaf diseases of many plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3adiet 3aelectronics 3afamine 3ageometry 3ahumans 3aleaves 3amodels 3arice 3awheat 3aChina 0aRice leaf diseases 0aWheat leaf diseases 0aDeep learning 0aMulti-task learning 0aTransfer learning1 aDong, Zhengxin1 aJiang, Wenping1 aYang, Yuze0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2021 July, v. 186 p.106184-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1061843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003200188245018400220300001800404506007600422520173800498592002802236506003702264650001202301650002002313650001402333650001202347650001302359650001102372650001202383650001802395650001102413650000902424650000902433650000902442650001402451650001002465650001102475650001702486650000902503650001202512650002102524650000902545700002702554700002202581773012702603856008102730852000902811655001202820IND60572560220221207064750.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057256022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-017-0257-22doi7 aPMC53955992pmcid7 a282359932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlpofead, Jawad Ali Hussein12aA novel two-step sequential bioaccessibility test for potentially toxic elements in inhaled particulate matter transported into the gastrointestinal tract by mucociliary clearance  ap. 3165-3174.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA novel two-step sequential extraction has been developed to assess the bioaccessibility of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in airborne particulate matter following inhalation and transport into the human gastrointestinal tract by mucociliary clearance. A new artificial mucus fluid (AMF) was used to determine the bioaccessible potentially toxic element (PTE) fraction in the upper airways, in sequence with the simplified bioaccessibility extraction test (SBET) or the stomach phase of the unified bioaccessibility method (gastric fluid only) (UBMG). Filter dynamic measurement system TX40 filters smeared with soil reference material (BGS RM 102) were used as test samples. Analysis was performed by ICP-MS. Comparison between results obtained for soil alone and when the soil was supported on TX40 filters indicated that the presence of the substrate did not affect the extraction efficiency, although a large Zn blank was detected. The sequential AMF→SBET extraction liberated similar amounts of Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn to the SBET alone; but significantly less Cd; and significantly more As, Cr, Cu and Pb. The sequential AMF→UBMG extraction liberated similar amounts of Cd, Cr, Mn and Zn to the UBMG alone, but significantly less As, Fe and Ni; and significantly more Cu and Pb. Enhanced extractability was due to the greater quantities of exchangeable ions and complexing agents present. Adoption of a two-step sequential extraction (AMF followed by either the SBET or the UBMG) is recommended because it is more representative of biological conditions and avoids overestimation or underestimation of bioaccessible PTE concentrations.

We show here that pigment biosynthesis in the soybean seed coat can be manipulated to provide a distinct color that would enable the simple visible detection of the GM soybean grain. We observed that a distinct red-brown grain color could be engineered by the simultaneous suppression of two proanthocyanidin (PA) genes, ANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE1 (ANR1) and ANR2. Multiple reaction monitoring by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify differentially accumulated seed coat metabolites, and revealed the redirection of metabolic flux into the anthocyanin pigment pathway and unexpectedly the flavonol-3-O-glucoside pathway. The upregulations of anthocyanin isogenes (DFR1 and GST26) and the anthocyanin/flavonol-3-O-glycosyltransferase (UGT78K2) were identified by quantitative RT-PCR to be endogenous feedback and feedforward responses to overaccumulation of upstream flavonoid intermediates resulting from ANR1 and ANR2 suppressions. These results suggested the transcription of flavonoid genes to be a key component of the mechanism responsible for the redirection of metabolite flux. This report identifies the suppression of PA genes to be a novel approach for engineering pigmentation in soybean grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acolor 3agenes 3agrains 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3apigmentation 3asoybeans 3atesta 2aAnthocyaninsxgenetics 2aColor 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aPhenotype 2aPigmentation 2aPigments, Biologicalxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProanthocyanidinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aSeedsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSoybean Proteinsxgenetics 2aSoybeansxgenetics1 aSaleem, Ammar1 aRintoul, Tara L.1 aBrown, D.

The trend of the variation in the stability constants with changing dielectric constant as well as mole fraction of the medium is explained based on the electrostatic interactions of the side chains of the ligands, charge neutralization, chelate effect, stacking interactions and hydrogen bonding.

The emulsion as a whole was studied by contrast variation to identify scattering components dominated by individual emulsifiers. The emulsion was subsequently separated into the aqueous phase and the oil-rich droplet phase, which were characterized separately. Emulsions produced with 1.05% (w/w) CAS and PC fraction which varies between 1.75% (w/w) and 0.35% (w/w) provided droplets between 10 and 19 μm in surface weighted mean in 70% fish oil-in-water emulsions. At least two-third of the overall CAS is associated with the interface, while the rest remains with the aqueous phase. Six percent of PC formed a monolayer in the interface, while the rest of the PC remains in the droplet phase in the form of multilayers. When the separated components were resuspended, the resuspended emulsion showed similar characteristics compared to the original emulsion in terms of droplet size distribution and neutron scattering.

Justin10aFully biodegradable Poly(lactic acid)/Starch blends: A review of toughening strategies  ap. 99-113.  aPolylactic acid (PLA) and Starch are both bio-based biodegradable polymers that have properties that are complementary to each other. PLA/starch blend exploits the good mechanical property of PLA and the low cost of Starch. However, PLA/Starch blend is intrinsically brittle. This paper reviews the current state of arts in toughening of PLA/Starch blend, which are categorized as: Additive Plasticization, Mixture Softening, Elastomer Toughening and Interphase Compatibilization. These strategies are not mutually exclusive and can be applied jointly in a single blend, opening up a wide range of toughening techniques that can be employed in PLA/Starch blend. Even though significant progress has been made in this area, there is still much room for research, in order to achieve easy to process, fully bio-based and completely biodegradable PLA/Starch blends that have mechanical properties suitable for a wide range of applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodegradability 3amechanical properties 3apolylactic acid 3astarch 0aPoly(lactic acid) 0aStarch 0aSustainability 0aBiodegradable 0aBio-based 0aToughening 0aCompatibilization1 aZhang, Xiwen1 aHe, Chaobin0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 109 p.99-113dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013800165300001200303520157200315592002801887650002101915650002701936650002201963650002701985650001302012650001302025650002202038650001102060650001602071650001702087650002102104650000902125650001402134650001402148650003102162650001502193650001302208650001702221650001002238650000902248700001202257700001602269700001602285700002302301700001702324773012402341856008102465852000902546655001202555IND60574459220221119065719.0170816e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057445922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-017-3493-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Hongzhen10aStabilization of Preliminary Anaerobically Digested Slurry in Post-Storage: Dynamics of Chemical Characteristics and Hygienic Quality  ap. 306.  aDynamics of chemical characteristics and hygienic quality, particularly nutrients, heavy metals, and bacterial pathogens, were investigated along the storage of anaerobically digested slurry derived from chicken and pig manure. The average total solid (TS) content decreased by 3.6 and 24.1%, while soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) decreased by 23.7 and 31.4%, in chicken manure- and pig manure-digested slurries storage, respectively. A rapid increase in NH₄ ⁺-N concentration from 1600 to 4800 mg/L in chicken manure-digested slurry and from 1200 to 1700 mg/L in pig manure-digested slurry was noted, particularly during the first 10 days of storage. A positive correlation between TS and content of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cr, and Pb) in the digested slurry was clearly shown. These metals are mainly associated with suspended particles and tend to be settled in the bottom during the storage process. Increasing attention should be paid to the land application of these bottom-settled digestates with higher TS content. The number of total coliforms and Escherichia coli in the both digested slurries decreased continuously during the whole storage period. The higher reduction rate observed during the storage of chicken manure-digested slurry may be due to the higher content of NH₄ ⁺-N, which may cause the inhibition of gram-negative bacteria. The results of this study provides a better understanding of the storage process of anaerobically digested slurry, which could benefit the digested slurry further utilization as agriculture fertilizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3achickens 3achromium 3acoliform bacteria 3acopper 3afertilizers 3aheavy metals 3aland application 3alead 3anutrients 3apathogens 3aphysicochemical properties 3apig manure 3aslurries 3astorage time 3aswine 3azinc1 aLv, Tao1 aShi, Mingni1 aWu, Shubiao1 aCarvalho, Pedro N.1 aDong, Renjie0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2017 Aug., v. 228, no. 8 p.306-306dSpringer International Publishingx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-017-3493-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014300163300001800306520115200324592002801476650001601504650002501520650001701545650002001562650001101582650001501593650001801608650002601626650001001652650002101662650002201683650001501705650001601720650001101736650001401747650000901761700001301770700001601783700001701799700001301816700001501829700001301844773013201857856008201989852000902071655001202080IND60787273020221122010846.0220808e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078727302DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348220801842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXinze Liu, 10aMetabolism of ADB-4en-PINACA in Zebrafish and Rat Liver Microsomes Determined by Liquid Chromatography–High Resolution Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1036-1046.  aMetabolic models can be useful for rapid identification of suitable analytical targets to aid in the detection of new psychoactive substances (NPS) in human biological samples. In vitro and in vivo metabolic studies of the synthetic cannabinoid ADB-4en-PINACA were carried out using zebrafish and rat liver microsome models. Seventeen phase-I metabolites, including seventeen metabolites generated from rat liver microsomes and fourteen metabolites from zebrafish, were identified and structurally characterized by liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry. The main metabolic pathways of the phase-I metabolism included hydroxylation, N-dealkylation, amide hydrolysis, ketone formation from the t-butyl and aliphatic chains, oxidation of the N-double-bond, amide hydrolysis combined with dehydrogenation, and amide hydrolysis followed by hydroxylation, as well as dehydrogenation and N-dealkylation. Hydroxylation (M3), ketone (M10), and dihydrodiol (M15) metabolites can be recommended as metabolic markers for ADB-4en-PINACA. These findings identify the zebrafish model as a promising tool for elucidating the metabolism of NPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aanalytical chemistry 3acannabinoids 3adehydrogenation 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxylation 3aliquid chromatography 3aliver 3aliver microsomes 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aoxidation 3arats1 aLiu, Wei1 aXiang, Ping1 aHang, Taijun1 aShi, Yan1 aYue, Linna1 aYan, Hui0 tJournal of analytical chemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 77, no. 8 p.1036-1046dPleiades PublishingwJournal:J000000418x1061-93487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10619348220801843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010800167300001600275520123000291592002801521650001501549650001401564650001201578650001001590650002601600650002201626650001801648650001901666650001201685773011901697856008201816852000901898655001201907IND60618971220221119131732.0181030e196606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061897122DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517566036006032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichie, R.I.C.10aNonwoven Fabric StudiesbPart VIII: The Influence of Bonding Agent on the Properties of Viscose Fabrics  ap. 501-505.  aA study has been made of the mechanical properties of viscose random-laid fabrics, saturation-bonded with at variety of commercial and experimental binder latices. There appears a rational pattern of behavior over all the materials investigated. Thus, fabric stiffness expressed either as initial modulus or bending length is uniquely related to rupture stress over a wide range of binder types and contents. The form of the relation ship indicates that, in a conventional saturation bonded fabric, stiffness cannot be significantly reduced without seriously impairing the strength. Data obtained with binder films lead to the equation showing fabric modulus Ef to be proportional to binder modulus Eb in the low modulus region and independent of binder modulus in the high modulus region. A similar relationship has been found between fabric and binder rupture stress. Binder uptake was found to be determined canly by liquor uptake, showing that there was no preferential absorption of either latex particles or of water. In general, fabric strength was linearly related to the amount of binder in the fabric. Variation in latex particle size within the limits 0.1 to 0.5 micron was without effect on the fabric properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aequations 3afabrics 3alatex 3amechanical properties 3amechanical stress 3aparticle size 3atextile fibers 3aviscose0 tTextile research journal.g1966 June, v. 36, no. 6 p.501-505dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517566036006033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245009100174300001400265520083500279592002801114650002401142650002001166650001701186650003901203650002701242650001701269650000901286650001201295650002101307650001801328650002201346653001701368653003701385653003101422653002101453700001901474700001901493700001601512773013001528856008801658852000901746655001201755IND60693422120221120035817.0200506e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069342212DNAL7 a10.3184/095422912X132578631585752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xiangliang10aLead complexation behaviour of root exudates of salt marsh plant Salicornia europaea L  ap. 60-63.  aRoot exudates are considered to have an important role in mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals.

In the present study, Pb(II) complexation of the HMW fluorescent fractions in root exudates from Salicornia europaea L. was investigated using excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. Two protein-like fluorescence peaks were identified in the EEM spectrum of root exudates. The fluorescence of both peaks was clearly quenched by Pb(II). The values of conditional stability constants, log Kₐ, for these two protein-like fluorescence peaks were 4.14 and 3.79.

An analysis of the literature demonstrated that the most efforts of researchers were aimed at overcoming the main disadvantage of SERS as an analysis method—low selectivity, which is especially important in the case of complex objects such as biological fluids. In this regard, the main positive results in the SERS analysis of human biological fluids are currently associated with the development of procedures that minimize the level of a background signal. The procedures are based on various combinations of SERS with separation and preconcentration methods, the use of sample preparation, and the application of chemometrics to take into account the background component of an analytical signal. Significant progress is also associated with the development of multifunctional SERS-active materials, which make it possible to improve the selectivity of analysis. However, it is the analytical part of most works that is the weakest point, which requires further research, including the verification of SERS analysis procedures using control reference methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3ablood 3achemometrics 3ahumans 3asaliva 3aurine1 aGoryacheva, I.

The temperature dependence of the second disulfide-controlled stage of stress relaxation of wool fibers from extensions of 20 and 40% was investigated at pH 7.0, both in the presence and absence of the sulfhydryl- blocking agent N-ethylmalimide (NEMI). By plotting the relaxation modulus Eᵣ as a function of temperature, a transition at 70°C was observed for untreated wool fibers. An increase in the SH content by partial reduction of the wool cystine decreases this transition temperature, as was expected from previous evidence of the SH dependence of the transition temperature under stress obtained from stress-strain curves [20]. By normalizing the stress at any time with a stress value in the presence of the SH-group blocking agent, it was possible to eliminate the first stage of stress relaxation without losing any component of the second stage. The viscoelastic behavior of the second stage was found to approximate that of a single Maxwellian element. The controlling mechanism in 'this stage appears to be a disulfide interchange catalyzed by free. SH groups, with an activation energy of approximately 23 kcal mole, which is independent of the strain level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acystine 3adisulfide bonds 3afabrics 3ahydrogen bonding 3akeratin 3apH 3astress relaxation 3atemperature 3atextile fibers 3aviscoelasticity 3awool1 aRebenfield, Ludwig1 aDansizer, Cornelia0 tTextile research journal.g1966 June, v. 36, no. 6 p.535-542dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517566036006053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02712naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007100147245013000218300001200348520146200360592002801822650003201850650002601882650002201908650001001930650001801940650002301958650001601981650001101997650001702008650000902025650000902034650002302043700002902066773015202095856008202247852000902329655001202338IND60609830920221119123805.0181023e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060983092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-6929-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemes da Silva, Aurea Luiza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8176-898310aRelationships between aquatic invertebrate communities, water-level fluctuations and different habitats in a subtropical lake  ap. 548.  aIn lakes, the littoral habitat and its invertebrate communities are often exposed to water-level fluctuations. We examined the effects of seasonal changes on water level, substrata availability and benthic fauna in the littoral zone of Peri Lake, a shallow lake that has experienced a strong reduction in water level due to changes in rainfall. In this study, we also examined whether the abundance and composition of aquatic invertebrates differed among the four substrata. Our main objective was to assess the effect of seasonal changes on water level and benthic invertebrates inhabiting the different types of substrata. Benthic invertebrates were sampled four different substrata (Schoenoplectus californicus, sand and stones, allochthonous leaf litter, and macrophyte stands), and we also measured meteorological, physical and chemical variables. We found that complex habitats, such as allochthonous leaf litter and aquatic macrophyte, stand to be colonised by a larger number of macroinvertebrates because they provide more habitats or potential niches for colonisation by different species. In addition, we observed that during periods of low water level, the presence of substrata in the littoral zone decreased, as did the associated biota. Therefore, our results suggest that water level changes have a major functional impact on the littoral zone of the lake, and can affect substratum availability, which also impacts invertebrate communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchoenoplectus californicus 3aaquatic invertebrates 3abenthic organisms 3alakes 3alittoral zone 3amacroinvertebrates 3amacrophytes 3aniches 3aplant litter 3arain 3asand 3aseasonal variation1 aPetrucio, Mauricio Mello0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Sept., v. 190, no. 9 p.548-548dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-6929-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01611naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011600165300002000281500001900301520052600320592002800846650002300874650001300897650001200910650001400922650001400936650001100950700002300961700001700984700001801001700002301019773013601042856007401178852000901252655001201261IND60715517620221122224906.0201028e20201027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071551762DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc05582d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Quynh Nhu Ba10aOne-step synthesis of 2,5-diformylfuran from monosaccharides by using lanthanum(iii) triflate, sulfur, and DMSO  ap. 13005-13008.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe combination of lanthanum(iii) triflate, sulfur, and dimethyl sulfoxide prompted a facile, direct preparation of 2,5-diformylfuran from glucose and fructose.

The diversity of inflorescences in the economically important family Oleaceae was studied from a comparative developmental point of view for the first time, based on species of seven genera (Chionanthus, Fontanesia, Fraxinus, Jasminum, Ligustrum, Olea, Syringa).• Methods: Series of developmental stages of chemically fixed inflorescences were studied with epi-illumination light microscopy.• Key results: All taxa studied have inflorescences with terminal flowers. The inflorescences are mostly panicles, but in some cases thyrsoids or compound botryoids. Phyllotaxis of the flower-subtending bracts is mostly decussate, rarely tricussate (Fraxinus) or spiral (Jasminum). Accessory flowers or accessory inflorescences, almost unknown in Oleaceae as yet, were found in two genera. In Syringa, common bract-flower primordia are formed by a delay in early bract development compared to flower development. Such a delay is also expressed by the loss of bracts in the distal part of inflorescence branches in Syringa and Chionanthus.• Conclusions: Significant variation in branching pattern and phyllotaxy was observed among the studied species of Oleaceae. The suppression of bracts and formation of accessory flowers were found as special features of inflorescence ontogeny. The occurrence of accessory flowers and accessory partial inflorescences is interesting from the point of view of dense and flower-rich inflorescences in ornamental species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJasminum 3aOlea 3aflowering 3abracts 3abranching 3aSyringa 3aontogeny 3aChionanthus 3aflowers 3alight microscopy 3acrop yield 3ahorticulture 3aFraxinus 3aphyllotaxy 3abranches 3aaesthetics 3aLigustrum 3ashoots 2aBiological Evolution 2aFlowering Topsxanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 2aOleaceaexanatomy & histologyxgrowth & development. 0adevelopmental stages 0aOleaceae 0ainflorescence development 0aphyllotaxis 0aaccessory inflorescences 0abranching pattern 0aepi-illumination microscopy 0aaccessory flowers1 aDadpour, Mohammad Reza1 aGohari, Gholamreza1 aEndress, Peter K.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2013 Apr., v. 100, no. 4 p.647-663dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.12001713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245013100163300001800294520130100312592002801613650002301641650002201664650002301686650002201709653003701731653002801768653003001796653002501826653002801851700001301879700001401892700001701906700001201923700001501935700001301950773011001963856008602073852000902159655001202168IND60530310720221120022639.0180904e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053031072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2016.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Tao10aSubstitution of a non-active-site residue located on the T3 loop increased the catalytic efficiency of endo-polygalacturonases  ap. 1230-1238.  aEndo-polygalacturonases (PGs) of glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 28 share a right handed parallel β-helical structure with a cleft formed by T1 and T3 loops. To reveal the effect of non-active-site residues on endo-PG catalysis, Thr113 of Achaetomium sp. endo-PG (PG8fn) located on the T3 loop was substituted. The experimental results indicated that the catalytic efficiency of PG8fn depends on the side-chain structure of residue at position 113, following the order of Glu (negatively charged)<Gly, Ala and Ile (nonpolar)<Ser, Gln and Thr (polar)<Arg and Lys (positively charged). Void pathway analysis demonstrated that substitution with Arg caused the increased occupancy rates of void pathways T2 and T3 and resulted in the improvement of catalytic efficiency by increasing the kinetics of substrate access (kon) or product release (koff). Further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations illustrated that the substitution enhanced the flexibility of T3 loop and influenced the interaction between enzyme and substrate. The functional role of Arg113 was also verified in another GH28 endo-PG by increasing the catalytic efficiency of ∼2.4-fold. This study proposes a novel strategy, i.e. selective modification of the non-active site residues, to improve the catalytic performance of GH28 PGs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalytic activity 3aenzyme substrates 3amolecular dynamics 3apolygalacturonase 0aEndo-polygalacturonase (endo-PG) 0aNon-active-site residue 0aSite-directed mutagenesis 0aCatalytic efficiency 0aMolecular dynamics (MD)1 aPan, Xia1 aMeng, Kun1 aLuo, Huiying1 aMa, Rui1 aWang, Yuan1 aYao, Bin0 tProcess biochemistry.g2016 Sept., v. 51, no. 9 p.1230-1238dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2016.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002800149245009900177300001800276520111700294592002801411650001901439650001901458650002501477650002701502650001101529650001801540650002301558650002601581650000901607650001001616700002901626700003001655700002701685700002101712700003801733773010101771856008501872852000901957655001201966IND4459230020221120192149.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445923002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2011.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Leandra Pereira10aPhenolic compounds and fatty acids in different parts of Vitis labrusca and V. vinifera grapes  ap. 1414-1418.  atrans-Resveratrol, antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, proximate composition, and fatty-acid composition were quantified in different parts (peel, pulp, and seeds) of four grape varieties: Brazil (Vitis vinifera), Benitaka (V. vinifera), Isabel (Vitis labrusca) and Niagara (V. labrusca).

Citric acid level in fruit is influenced by several factors including environmental conditions. In this study, it was observed that different environments in two habitats (Ganzhou, Jiangxi; Songyang, Zhejiang) had minor effects on total soluble solids and citrus color index but had significant effects on organic acids levels, particularly on citric acid level, in fruit of “Newhall” and “SkaggsBonanza” navel oranges (Citrus sinensis). Expression of genes involved in citric acid biosynthesis and degradation (CitCS1, CitCS2, CitAco1, CitAco2, CitAco3, CitIDH1, CitIDH2, CitIDH3, CitGAD4, CitGAD5, and CitGS2) was analyzed in fruit grown in each of the two habitats. Citric acid biosynthesis-related citrate synthase genes were steadily expressed during navel orange fruit development, while degradation-related genes were differentially expressed. These findings suggested that the influence of different environments on fruit quality traits was predominant on the regulation of organic acids level, particularly on the degradation of citric acid. A cascade of CitAco3–CitIDH1–CitGS2 might be involved in citric acid degradation in response to different environments during fruit growth and development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus sinensis 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3acitric acid 3aenvironmental factors 3afruit growing 3afruit quality 3afruiting 3afruits 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ahabitats 3aoranges 3asugars 3atotal soluble solids 3aChina1 aXie, Xiulan1 aLin, Qiong1 aChen, Jinyin1 aGrierson, Donald1 aYin, Xueren1 aSun, Chongde1 aChen, Kunsong0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.1131-1140dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-013-0583-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245007300188300001600261520088000277592002801157650001301185650001501198650001901213650000901232650004401241650001001285650001501295650001701310650007601327650007601403650004101479650007401520650002401594650002201618650007901640650002101719650004101740650003701781650002401818650002401842650004501866650010401911650003002015650004002045650007502085650004802160650007702208650007602285651001002361653003002371653001802401653001602419653002202435653001802457653001902475700001902494773010002513856008702613852000902700655001202709IND50070069120221118172456.0190402e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007006912DNAL7 a241285712pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.1282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamasamy, D.10aVitiquinolone – A quinolone alkaloid from Hibiscus vitifolius Linn  ap. 970-975.  aPhytochemical investigations of the powdered root of Hibiscus vitifolius Linn.

Rangit River in northeastern India is affected by severe soil erosion, causing reduction in its reservoir capacity. The main aim of the paper is to estimate the soil erosion in the Rangit catchment, India through a process-based soil erosion model that integrates remote sensing and field data in the geospatial domain, and also to identify the problem areas for further watershed management action plans. Various topographic parameters that were derived from land use, soil texture and a digital elevation model were used for the estimation of soil erosion. The Morgan, Morgan and Finny model was used to compute soil erosion. Based on the drainage pattern, the catchment was divided into eight sub-catchments for detailed study. Annual soil erosion was estimated for four years from 2002 to 2005 using the corresponding year’s meteorological data. Estimated soil erosion was compared with the field data in each year and found very good correlation.  aPublisher supplied data 0aremote sensing 0ageographical information system 0asoil erosion 0awatershed management 0aprocess-based model 0asedimentation1 aVala, Venkateshwar Rao0 tGeocarto International.g2014 July 4, v. 29, no. 5 p.507-519dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2013.7983593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02870naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012200168300001600290520118900306592002801495596005901523596006101582596007001643596007201713596008801785650000901873650001501882650001001897650001601907650001601923650001901939650001101958650001701969650001701986650001302003650001902016650001402035651001002049700002002059700001402079700001602093700001702109700005602126773010402182856008102286852000902367655001202376IND60643489520221122183404.0190510e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064348952DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-018-0645-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Yong-Jian10aImpact of Seed Coating Agents on Single-Bud Seedcane Germination and Plant Growth in Commercial Sugarcane Cultivation  ap. 383-387.  aChina is the third largest sugar-producing country in the world. The cost of sugarcane planting has increased rapidly in recent years, and the existing planting model needs to be changed to reduce the cost. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of commercial seed coating agents on the germination and yield of sugarcane. Six commercial seed coating agents (Premis, Gaucho, Colest, Dividend, Manshijin and Maishuping) used for other crops were used to coat the 4-cm-long single seedcane setts and stored for 7 days, respectively, at 22 °C before planting. It was found that all the seed coating agents were effective to reduce the water evaporation of seedcane setts and ensured better germination rate, and Premis, Gaucho, Colest and Maishuping were found better than Dividend and Manshijin. The economic traits of sugarcane, plant height, stalk diameter, single stalk weight and Brix were significantly higher in the Premis seedcane coating treatment than the control at maturity stage in a green house experiment. These results would be helpful to promote the development of the mechanical planting of single-bud seedcane setts for increasing sugarcane production.  aPublisher supplied data  a31360293cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2013DFA31600cInternational Cooperation Project of China  aGKAD17195100cGuangxi special fund for scientific base and talent  a2013-03cGuangxi Funds for Bagui Scholars and Distinguished Experts  agjnytxgxcxtd-03cFund for Guangxi Innovation Teams of Modern Agriculture Technology 3abrix 3acrop yield 3acrops 3aevaporation 3agermination 3amaturity stage 3amodels 3aplant growth 3aplant height 3aplanting 3aseed dressings 3asugarcane 3aChina1 aZhang, Xiao-Qiu1 aYang, Liu1 aLiu, Xi-Hui1 aYang, Li-Tao1 aLi, Yang-Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7559-92440 tSugar tech.g2019 June, v. 21, no. 3 p.383-387dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-018-0645-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03464naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170300001600267520169000283592002801973650003102001650002902032650002502061650001302086650002402099650001402123650002002137650002002157650001902177650002202196650001902218650001802237650003702255650001802292650000902310650001602319650003202335650001302367653002902380653001202409653002202421653001902443653000902462700001902471700005702490700001902547700001602566700005902582700006102641773010202702856008502804852000902889655001202898IND60610122820221117162706.0200128e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061012282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2018.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun Young10aTh17 activation by dendritic cells stimulated with gamma-irradiated Streptococcus pneumoniae  ap. 344-352.  aDendritic cells (DCs) play an important role in antigen presentation, which is an essential step for the induction of antigen-specific adaptive immunity. Inactivated bacterial whole cell vaccines have been widely used to prevent many bacterial infections because they elicit good immunogenicity due to the presence of various antigens and are relatively inexpensive and easy to manufacture. Recently, gamma-irradiated whole cells of nonencapsulated Streptococcus pneumoniae were developed as a broad-spectrum and serotype-independent multivalent vaccine. In the present study, we generated gamma-irradiated S. pneumoniae (r-SP) and investigated its capacity to stimulate mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) in comparison with heat-inactivated and formalin-inactivated S. pneumoniae (h-SP and f-SP, respectively). r-SP showed an attenuated binding and internalization level to BM-DCs when compared to h-SP or f-SP. r-SP weakly induced the expression of CD80, CD83, CD86, MHC class I, and PD-L2 compared with h-SP or f-SP. Furthermore, r-SP less potently induced IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-23 expression than h-SP or f-SP but more potently induced IL-1β expression than h-SP or f-SP in BM-DCs. Since Th17-mediated immune responses are known to be important for the protection against pneumococcal infections, r-SP-primed DCs were co-cultured with splenocytes or splenic CD4⁺ T cells. Interestingly, r-SP-sensitized BM-DCs markedly induced IL-17A⁺ CD4⁺ T cells whereas h-SP- or f-SP-sensitized BM-DCs weakly induced them. Collectively, these results suggest that r-SP could be an effective pneumococcal vaccine candidate eliciting Th17-mediated immune responses by stimulation of DCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aStreptococcus pneumoniae 3aantigen presentation 3aantigens 3abacterial pneumonia 3acoculture 3adendritic cells 3aimmune response 3aimmunogenicity 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-23 3ainterleukin-6 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amanufacturing 3amice 3asplenocytes 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccines 0aStreptococcus pneumoniae 0aVaccine 0aGamma-Irradiation 0aDendritic cell 0aTh171 aKim, Sun Kyung1 aSeo, Ho Seong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7103-13441 aJeong, Soyoung1 aAhn, Ki Bum1 aYun, Cheol-Heui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0041-28871 aHan, Sŏng-hyŏn,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9418-92780 tMolecular immunology.g2018 Sept., v. 101 p.344-352dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2018.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03378naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001700192245009300209300001600302506007600318520172700394592002802121506003702149650002002186650001702206650001502223650000902238650002002247650002002267650001002287650001402297650001202311650001102323650001202334650001402346650001902360650001202379650002202391650001802413653000902431653002002440653002902460653002302489653001702512653002202529700001702551700001902568773014302587856008502730852000902815655001202824IND60646989020221207110733.0190614e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064698902DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2018.14974962doi7 aPMC66601962pmcid7 a313541802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandau, Will10aFully Bayesian Analysis of RNA-seq Counts for the Detection of Gene Expression Heterosis  ap. 610-621.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHeterosis, or hybrid vigor, is the enhancement of the phenotype of hybrid progeny relative to their inbred parents. Heterosis is extensively used in agriculture, and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. To investigate the molecular basis of phenotypic heterosis, researchers search tens of thousands of genes for heterosis with respect to expression in the transcriptome. Difficulty arises in the assessment of heterosis due to composite null hypotheses and nonuniform distributions for p-values under these null hypotheses. Thus, we develop a general hierarchical model for count data and a fully Bayesian analysis in which an efficient parallelized Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm ameliorates the computational burden. We use our method to detect gene expression heterosis in a two-hybrid plant-breeding scenario, both in a real RNA-seq maize dataset and in simulation studies. In the simulation studies, we show our method has well-calibrated posterior probabilities and credible intervals when the model assumed in analysis matches the model used to simulate the data. Although model misspecification can adversely affect calibration, the methodology is still able to accurately rank genes. Finally, we show that hyperparameter posteriors are extremely narrow and an empirical Bayes (eBayes) approach based on posterior means from the fully Bayesian analysis provides virtually equivalent posterior probabilities, credible intervals, and gene rankings relative to the fully Bayesian solution. This evidence of equivalence provides support for the use of eBayes procedures in RNA-seq data analysis if accurate hyperparameter estimates can be obtained.

Supercooling technology has the potential to preserve the original freshness of food without freezing damage. In this study, fresh asparagus was preserved in a supercooled state and its quality changes such as color, weight loss, texture, chlorophyll and anthocyanin content, and enzymatic activities (superoxide dismutase and catalase) were evaluated. The asparagus samples were successfully supercooled at −3 °C with the combination treatment of pulsed electric field (PEF) and oscillating magnetic field (OMF), and the supercooled state was maintained for up to 14 days. Asparagus spears preserved in the supercooled state exhibited lower weight loss and higher levels of quality factors in comparison to the frozen and refrigerated control samples.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Research Foundation of Koreadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000037250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAsparagus officinalis 3aanthocyanins 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3afreshness 3aice 3amagnetic fields 3apulsed electric fields 3arefrigeration 3ashelf life 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atexture 3aweight loss1 aLi, Muci 1 aKang, Taiyoung 1 aKo, Youngbok 1 aKim, Sangoh 1 aLee, Seung-Hyun,1 aJun, Soojin 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 04, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101023613Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010000129300001600229520169500245592002801940650001701968700002001985773011002005852000902115939003302124945000802157946001302165655001202178IND7907577820221120215811.0181002e197909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND790757782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMAKBOUL, H.

Increasing amounts (50,100, and 150 milligrams, respectively) of each clay at different substrate (= p-nitrophenol phosphate) concentrations decreased the enzyme activity. The inhibiting effect of 150 milligrams of illite (64 percent) was considerably higher than those recorded with the same amount of montmorillonite (37 percent) or kaolinite (22 percent). In the presence of montmorillonite or kaolinite, the Michaelis constant Km became enhanced (7.89 and 6.05 X 10 M p-nitrophenol (phosphate, respectively) compared to the soluble state (Km, = 4.26 X 10 M p-nitrophenol phosphate). The values of the maximum enzyme reaction velocity Vmax (= 2553 micrograms p-nitrophenol x 10 ml x h in the soluble state) was accelerated in the presence of montmorillonite (Vmax = 2778 micrograms p-nitrophenol x 10 ml x h), but decreased with kaolinite (Vmax = 2469 micrograms p-nitrophenol x 10 ml x h). In the presence of illite, however, both Km (= 3.92 X Mp-nitrophenol phosphate) as well as Vmax (= 980 microgramsp-nitrophenol X 10 ml x h) were diminished clearly. This increased enzyme-substrate formation in the presence of illite in combi- nation with a lowered hydrolysis of the sorbed enzyme-substrate complex, is explained by a modification of the alkaline-phosphatase configuration as a consequence of sorption. Such a modification in the alkaline-phosphatase configuration could have facilitated the enzyme-substrate complex formation but may have increased its stability against subsequent hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil science1 aOTTOW, J.

The potential of retrieving meaningful spectral material identifications in the presence of reflectance of spectra of various material types and with various similarity metrics has been assessed in this study. Test reflectance spectra of various vegetation, minerals, soils and urban material types are identified by searching through the composite reflectance spectral library obtained by combining various institutional reflectance spectral libraries. The accuracy of material identifications under various conditions: (i) in the presence of identical, similar and dissimilar spectra; (ii) in the presence of only identical and dissimilar spectra; and (iii) in the presence of only dissimilar spectra has been assessed with several similarity metrics. Results indicate the possibility of obtaining 100% accurate material identifications by library search if the spectral library contains identical spectra. However, the presence of a large number of similar spectra, despite the presence of identical spectra, is found to increase false positives, thereby reducing the accuracy of retrievals to 82% at best. Further, the accuracy of material identifications in the presence of similar spectra is similarity metric-dependent and varied from about 52% (obtained from Binary Encoding) to 82% (obtained from Normalized Spectral Similarity Score). Overall, results support the possibility of using independent reflectance spectral libraries for material identification while calling for robust spectral similarity metrics.  aPublisher supplied data 0aspectral library search 0amaterial mapping 0ahyperspectral remote sensing 0areflectance spectroscopy 0aspectral matching methods1 aRamiya, A.M.0 tGeocarto International.g2014 Aug. 18, v. 29, no. 6 p.609-624dTaylor & Francisx1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2013.8211753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245017000159300001800329500002000347520130100367592002801668650001101696650002201707650001201729650001001741650002601751650003101777650001301808650001901821650001301840650001601853650001601869650000701885650002001892650001101912650001601923700001301939700001801952700001701970773010001987856007802087852000902165655001202174IND60523447720221116234335.0160617e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052344772DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2016000662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiu, Danye10aPreparation of phosphorylcholine‐based hydrophilic monolithic column and application for analysis of drug‐related impurities with capillary electrochromatography  ap. 1725-1732.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA hydrophilic monolithic CEC column was prepared by thermal copolymerization of zwitterionic monomer 2‐methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), either methacrylatoethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (META) or sodium 2‐methylpropene‐1‐sulfonate (MPS) in a polar binary porogen consisting of methanol and THF. A typical hydrophilic interaction LC retention mechanism was observed for low‐molecular weight polar compounds including amides, nucleotides, and nucleosides in the separation mode of hydrophilic interaction CEC, when high content of ACN (>60%) was used as the mobile phase. The effect of the electrostatic interaction between the analytes and the stationary phase was found to be negligible. The poly(MPC‐co‐PETA‐co‐META or MPS) monolithic columns have an average column efficiency of 40 000 plates/m and displayed with a satisfactory repeatability in terms of migration time and peak areas. Finally, the column was successfully applied to determine the impurities of a positively charged drug pramipexole which are often separated by ion pair RP chromatography due to their high hydrophilicity. All four components can be baseline separated within 5 min with BGE consisting of ACN/20 mM ammonium formate buffer (pH 3.0; 80/20).  aPublisher supplied data 3aamides 3aammonium chloride 3abuffers 3adrugs 3aelectrochromatography 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aformates 3ahydrophilicity 3amethanol 3anucleosides 3anucleotides 3apH 3apolar compounds 3asodium 3azwitterions1 aLi, Feng1 aZhang, Mingyu1 aKang, Jingwu0 tElectrophoresis.g2016 July, v. 37, no. 12 p.1725-1732dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2016000663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013200174300001600306520116700322592002801489650001501517650002101532650002001553650001201573650002001585650001101605650002001616650001101636650001601647650002101663650001501684650002001699650002401719650001501743650002001758650002201778650001501800653004101815653003001856653002201886773013701908856008502045852000902130655001202139IND60707228320221121003940.0200819e20200702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070722832DNAL7 a10.1080/15538362.2019.16538102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalehi, Fakhreddin10aRecent Advances in the Modeling and Predicting Quality Parameters of Fruits and Vegetables during Postharvest Storage: A Review  ap. 506-520.  aArtificial neural network (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS) have been applied in every aspect of food science in the recent years. These models are useful tools for fruit and vegetable monitoring; grading and classification; modeling the respiration rate; predicting and modeling quality properties; modeling of microbial growth; and forecasting chemical, physical, and sensorial characteristics during processing and postharvest storage. These models hold an enormous deal of promise for modeling difficult task;s in practice control and simulation and in the use of machine perception including machine vision system and electronic nose for fruit and vegetable quality control.

Because of this, complete degradation of xylan needs a large number of enzymes that includes GH10, GH11, and GH3 family xylanases together with auxiliary enzymes. Fluorescence‐assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) is able to accurately differentiate unsubstituted and substituted xylooligosaccharides (XOS) in the heterogeneous products generated by different xylanases and allows changes in concentrations of specific XOS to be analyzed quantitatively. Based on a quantitative analysis of XOS profiles over time using FACE, we have demonstrated that GH10 and GH11 family xylanases immediately degrade xylan into sizeable XOS, which are converted into smaller XOS in a much lower speed. The shortest substituted XOS produced by hydrolysis of the substituted xylan backbone by GH10 and GH11 family xylanases were MeGlcA²Xyl₃ and MeGlcA²Xyl₄, respectively. The unsubstituted xylan backbone was degraded into xylose, xylobiose, and xylotriose by both GH10 and GH11 family xylanases; the product profiles are not family‐specific but, instead, depend on different subsite binding affinities in the active sites of individual enzymes. Synergystic action between xylanases and β‐xylosidase degraded MeGlcA²Xyl₄ into xylose and MeGlcA²Xyl₃ but further degradation of MeGlcA²Xyl₃ required additional enzymes. Synergy between xylanases and β‐xylosidase was also found to significantly accelerate the conversion of XOS into xylose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3abinding capacity 3acellulose 3aelectrophoresis 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3ahydrolysis 3amechanism of action 3aquantitative analysis 3axylan 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase 3axylooligosaccharides 3axylose1 aZhang, Huaiqiang1 aTian, Li1 aLiu, Shijia1 aWu, Xiuyun1 aLi, Fuli1 aWang, Lushan0 tElectrophoresis.g2016 July, v. 37, no. 12 p.1640-1650dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2016000413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008100166300001600247520121200263592002801475650002301503650001501526650001001541650001501551650001901566650000901585650002101594653001901615653001401634653001201648653001301660653002301673700001701696700002301713700002101736773011501757856008501872852000901957655001201966IND60646989420221118222313.0190614e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064698942DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2018.14504482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhau, Inos10aDetection and mapping of maize streak virus using RapidEye satellite imagery  ap. 856-866.  aThe aim of this study was to detect and map MSV using RapidEye multispectral sensor in Ofcolaco farm. To achieve this objective, the acquired RapidEye sensor was classified using the robust Random Forest algorithm. Furthermore, the variable importance technique was used to determine the influence of each spectral band and indices on the mapping accuracy. For better performance of image data, the value of the commonly used vegetation indices in improving the classification accuracy was tested. The results revealed that the use of RapidEye spectral bands in detection and mapping of MSV yielded good classification results with an overall accuracy of 82.75%. The inclusion of vegetation indices computed from RapidEye sensor improved the classification accuracies by 3.4%. The most important RapidEye spectral bands in classifying MSV were near infrared, blue and red-edge. On the other hand, the most important vegetation indices were the Soil adjusted vegetation index, Enhanced vegetation index, Red index and Normalized Vegetation Index. The current study recommends future studies to assess the importance of multi-temporal remote sensing applications in detecting and monitoring the spread of MSV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaize streak virus 3aalgorithms 3afarms 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3avegetation index 0aRemote sensing 0adetection 0amapping 0aRapidEye 0avegetation indices1 aAdam, Elhadi1 aAyisi, Kingsley K.1 aMutanga, Onisimo0 tGeocarto international.g2019 July 3, v. 34, no. 8 p.856-866dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12366x1752-07627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2018.14504483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245016500173300001600338520105300354592002801407650002301435650002501458650002101483650001601504650001401520650002701534650002101561650001301582650000901595650003201604650001001636650001501646653001101661653001601672653001601688653001601704653001101720653001501731653001601746700001501762700001901777700001601796700002301812700001501835700002401850700001701874700001501891773009901906856008702005852000902092655001202101IND60542356120221119071202.0190402e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054235612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.11.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThong, Chan Kei,10aCharacterisation of fatty acid, carotenoid, tocopherol/tocotrienol compositions and antioxidant activities in seeds of three Chenopodium quinoa Willd. genotypes  ap. 502-508.  aComposition of fatty acids, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and carotenoids, and their contribution to antioxidant activities were investigated in seeds of three coloured quinoa cultivars (white, red and black). The major components and individual compounds were significantly different, and their concentrations were higher in darker seeds (p<0.05). The oil yield was 6.58–7.17% which contained predominantly unsaturated fatty acids (89.42%). The ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty acid was ca. 6/1. The total tocopherol content ranged from 37.49 to 59.82μg/g and mainly consisted of γ-tocopherol. Trace amount of α- and β-tocotrienols was also found. Black quinoa had the highest vitamin E followed by red and white quinoas. Carotenoids, mainly trans-lutein (84.7–85.6%) and zeaxanthin were confirmed for the first time in quinoa seeds, and the concentration was also the highest in black seeds. The antioxidant activities of lipophilic extracts were positively correlated with polyunsaturated fatty acids, total carotenoids and total tocopherols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChenopodium quinoa 3aantioxidant activity 3abeta-tocotrienol 3acorrelation 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3agamma-tocopherol 3agenotype 3aoils 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aseeds 3azeaxanthin 0aQuinoa 0aFatty acids 0aTocopherols 0aCarotenoids 0aLutein 0aLipophilic 0aAntioxidant1 aLi, Xihong1 aChen, Peter X.1 aZhang, Bing1 aHernández, Marta,1 aZhang, Hua1 aMarcone, Massimo F.1 aLiu, Ronghua1 aTsao, Rong0 tFood chemistry.g2015 May 01, v. 174 p.502-508dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.11.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010500162520180000267592002802067650001502095650001702110650002402127650002002151650000902171650002002180650004302200650001402243650001202257650001602269650001202285650001402297650001502311650001802326650001702344650001502361650001302376650001302389700001902402700002102421700002102442773012002463856007802583852000902661655001202670IND60754183520221118043809.0211023e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075418352DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101023652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaulsen, Peter10aContents of Polyamines and Biogenic Amines in Canned Pet (Dogs and Cats) Food on the Austrian Market  aBiogenic amines accumulate in proteinaceous raw materials used for pet food production. In canned, sterilized food, amine levels of the ingredients are preserved and may both be indicative of hygiene deficiencies in the ingredients as well as for potential adverse effects to the animals feeding on it. We determined the contents of biogenic amines and polyamines (dansyl derivatives, high performance liquid chromatography) in a variety of canned food for dogs (n = 72) and cats (n = 114) on the Austrian market and compared the results with common quality indices. Contents of putrescine, cadaverine, and tyramine were below the limit of detection in >70% of samples (maximum values: 21.5, 98.4 and 32.5 mg/kg wet weight, respectively). Median contents of histamine, spermidine, and spermine were 14.5, 12.7, and 29.4 mg/kg, and maximum values were 61.6, 28.2, and 53.6 mg/kg wet weight, respectively. The sum of (putrescine + cadaverine + histamine + tyramine) was >50 mg/kg in 22.6% of samples. The biogenic amine index exceeded “1” in 26.7% of samples. Whilst cat food contained significantly higher amounts of tyramine, dog food contained significantly higher amounts of histamine and spermine. In canned cat food, the ingredient “fish” was identified as a statistically significant risk factor for a biogenic amine index > 1 (relative risk = 3.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.8–5.5)) and for (putrescine + cadaverine + histamine + tyramine) exceeding 50 mg/kg (relative risk = 2.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.2–4.6)), due to higher contents of cadaverine in food samples containing fish. While all samples met the limits suggested in pet food production, we could demonstrate that the inclusion of fish in the formulation bears a significant risk for higher cadaverine contents.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadaverine 3acanned foods 3aconfidence interval 3adetection limit 3afish 3afood production 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahistamine 3ahygiene 3aingredients 3amarkets 3apet foods 3aputrescine 3arelative risk 3arisk factors 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3atyramine1 aBauer, Susanne1 aBauer, Friedrich1 aDicakova, Zuzana0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101023653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009200157300001800249520108600267592002801353650002301381650002101404650002201425650002201447650001501469650001701484650002201501650002301523650002201546650001501568700001601583700001501599700001701614773012201631856007401753852000901827655001201836IND60682056020221121130055.0200123e20200117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068205602DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra08985c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xi-wu10aMass spectrometry-based metabolomics in health and medical science: a systematic review  ap. 3092-3104.  aMetabolomics is the study of the investigation of small molecules derived from cellular and organism metabolism, which reflects the outcomes of the complex network of biochemical reactions in living systems. As the most recent member of the omics family, there has been notable progress in metabolomics in the last decade, mainly driven by the improvement in mass spectrometry (MS). MS-based metabolomic strategies in modern health and medical science studies provide innovative tools for novel diagnostic and prognostic approaches, as well as an augmented role in drug development, nutrition science, toxicology, and forensic science. In the present review, we not only introduce the application of MS-based metabolomics in the above fields, but also discuss the MS analysis technologies commonly used in metabolomics and the application of metabolomics in precision medicine, and further explore the challenges and perspectives of metabolomics in the field of health and medical science, which are expected to make a little contribution to the better development of metabolomics.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3adrug development 3aforensic sciences 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3anutrition science 3aprecision medicine 3asystematic review 3atoxicology1 aLi, Qiu-han1 aXu, Zuo-di1 aDou, Jin-jin0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 17, v. 10, no. 6 p.3092-3104dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra08985c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001600112245015900128300001600287500001500303520154800318592002801866650001501894650001701909650001001926650001501936650001701951650001701968650001001985650001901995650001702014650002202031650001602053650001502069650001202084650001302096650001802109651001202127653002402139653001602163653001402179653002102193700002002214700002502234773013802259852000902397655001202406IND60126883720221120210231.0151124e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012688372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnee, Wayne10aDiversity and Host use of Mites (Acari: Mesostigmata, Oribatida) Phoretic on Bark Beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytinae): Global Generalists, Local Specialists?  ap. 339-350.  a2019-12-04  aMites (Arachnida: Acari) are one of the most diverse groups of organisms associated with bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae), but their taxonomy and ecology are poorly understood, including in Canada. Here we address this by describing the diversity, species composition, and host associations of mesostigmatic and oribatid mites collected from scolytines across four sites in eastern Ontario, Canada, in 2008 and 2009. Using Lindgren funnel traps baited with α-pinene, ethanol lures, or Ips pini (Say) pheromone lures, a total of 5,635 bark beetles (30 species) were collected, and 16.4% of these beetles had at least one mite. From these beetles, a total of 2,424 mites representing 33 species from seven families were collected. The majority of mite species had a narrow host range from one (33.3%) or two (36.4%) host species, and fewer species had a host range of three or more hosts (30.3%). This study represents the first broad investigation of the acarofauna of scolytines in Canada, and we expand upon the known (worldwide) host records of described mite species by 19%, and uncover 12 new species. Half (7) of the 14 most common mites collected in this study showed a marked preference for a single host species, which contradicts the hypothesis that nonparasitic mites are typically not host specific, at least locally. Moreover, host records from the literature and those of this study together suggest that at a global scale, bark beetle mites have a broad host range, while at a local scale many species are host specific.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahost range 3abark beetles 3ahosts 3abait traps 3aalpha-pinene 3aMesostigmata 3amites 3aSarcoptiformes 3afunnel traps 3aspecies diversity 3anew species 3apheromones 3aethanol 3aIps pini 3aCurculionidae 3aOntario 0aspecies composition 0abark beetle 0aOribatida 0ahost specificity1 aForbes, Mark R.1 aBeaulieu, Frédéric0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2013 May, v. 106, no. 3 p.339-350dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245007600177300001600253520190200269592002802171650001102199650002702210650001202237650001102249650001702260650000902277650002002286653002402306653001702330653002202347700001602369700001702385773010802402856008802510852000902598655001202607IND60590818320221122045036.0200913e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059081832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.01.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAarão Reis, F.D.A.10aAnomalous behaviors during infiltration into heterogeneous porous media  ap. 180-188.  aFlow and transport in heterogeneous porous media often exhibit anomalous behavior. A physical analog example is the uni-directional infiltration of a viscous liquid into a horizontal oriented Hele-Shaw cell containing through thickness flow obstacles; a system designed to mimic a gravel/sand medium with impervious inclusions. When there are no obstacles present or the obstacles form a multi-repeating pattern, the change of the length of infiltration F with time t tends to follow a Fickian like scaling, F∼t12. In the presence of obstacle fields laid out as Sierpinski carpet fractals, infiltration is anomalous, i.e., F ∼ tⁿ, n ≠ 1/2. Here, we study infiltration into such Hele-Shaw cells. First we investigate infiltration into a square cell containing one fractal carpet and make the observation that it is possible to generate both sub (n < 1/2) and super (n > 1/2) diffusive behaviors within identical heterogeneity configurations. We show that this can be explained in terms of a scaling analysis developed from results of random-walk simulations in fractal obstacles; a result indicating that the nature of the domain boundary controls the exponent n of the resulting anomalous transport. Further, we investigate infiltration into a rectangular cell containing several repeats of a given Sierpinski carpet. At very early times, before the liquid encounters any obstacles, the infiltration is Fickian. When the liquid encounters the first (smallest scale) obstacle the infiltration sharply transitions to sub-diffusive. Subsequently, around the time where the liquid has sampled all of the heterogeneity length scales in the system, there is a rapid transition back to Fickian behavior. An explanation for this second transition is obtained by developing a simplified infiltration model based on the definition of a representative averaged hydraulic conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3agravel 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aliquids 3amodels 3aporous media 3asand 3awater resources 0aAnomalous transport 0aInfiltration 0aFractal dimension1 aBolster, D.1 aVoller, V.R.0 tAdvances in water resources.g2018 Mar., v. 113 p.180-188dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.01.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02316naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010000168300001600268520124300284592002801527650002201555650002201577650002001599650001101619650001801630650001701648650002601665650001301691700002401704700002901728700001701757700001901774773010401793856004801897852000901945655001201954IND4472076020221119110442.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447207602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-011-0172-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrossette, Tatjana10aDirect evidence that (−)-epicatechin increases nitric oxide levels in human endothelial cells  ap. 595-599.  aBACKGROUND: The dietary flavanol (−)-epicatechin has been suggested to mediate its vasodilatory effect by increasing nitric oxide levels in endothelial cells. AIM OF THE STUDY: To directly prove the formation of nitric oxide (NO) in human endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro by trapping NO to yield a fluorescent nitrosamine. METHODS: HUVEC were treated with (−)-epicatechin; nitrite and NO formation were determined by reductive chemiluminescence detection and the NO-sensitive fluorophore 5-methoxy-2-(1H-naphthol[2,3-d]imidazol-2-yl)-phenol copper complex (MNIP-Cu), respectively. MNIP was synthesized in a rapid and convenient one-step microwave reaction. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA levels and mRNA stability were measured. RESULTS: Incubation with (−)-epicatechin (0.3–10 μM) led to elevated NO levels in HUVEC measured via reductive chemiluminescence detection and visualized as the fluorescent NO derivative of MNIP. Expression of eNOS mRNA and mRNA stability were not affected by (−)-epicatechin treatment within the time frame studied. CONCLUSION: (−)-Epicatechin augments the level of NO in endothelial cells, a process suggested to be responsible for the vasodilatory properties of the compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemiluminescence 3aendothelial cells 3agene expression 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3anitrites1 aHundsdörfer, Claas1 aKröncke, Klaus-Dietrich1 aSies, Helmut1 aStahl, Wilhelm0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2011 Oct., v. 50, no. 7 p.595-599dSpringer-Verlagx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-011-0172-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010800157300001800265500001900283520087200302592002801174650001201202650001501214650001801229650001401247650002301261650001301284650001301297650002401310700001601334700001501350700001701365700001501382700001601397773012201413856007401535852000901609655001201618IND60682056220221121200440.0200123e20200117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068205622DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09082g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Weiwen10aPartially charged platinum on aminated and carboxylated SBA-15 as a catalyst for alkene hydrosilylation  ap. 3175-3183.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this paper, we report the successful preparation of a novel bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst Ptᵟ⁺/SBA-APTE-SA with a partial positively charged Ptᵟ⁺ electronic structure via post-synthesis modification of (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTE), succinic anhydride (SA) and platinum precursors.

In addition, our catalyst was suitable for the hydrosilylation of other alkenes. Furthermore, the catalyst displayed sufficient stability after being reused five times without noticeable inactivation. In terms of cycle number and atomic utilization efficiency, it has potential applications as a green hydrosilylation method for industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aanhydrides 3acarboxylation 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aindustry 3aplatinum 3apolyethylene glycol1 aXie, Zhikai1 aLiang, Hui1 aZhou, Xinhua1 aHu, Wenbin1 aShu, Xugang0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 17, v. 10, no. 6 p.3175-3183dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra09082g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01389naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011600155300001800271520029700289592002800586650001500614650002300629650001200652650001300664650001600677650001300693700001300706700001500719700001900734700001600753700002200769700002000791773013300811856007400944852000901018655001201027IND60660134120221117070551.0190823e20140404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066013412DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc00269e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Jin10aTemperature controlled invertible selectivity for adsorption of N₂ and CH₄ by molecular trapdoor chabazites  ap. 4544-4546.  aWe report an unusual operating regime for a chabazite zeolite in which the adsorption selectivity for N₂ over CH₄ inverts from being more selective for N₂ at 253 K, to becoming less selective with increasing temperature and eventually becoming selective for CH₄ over N₂ above 293 K.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical reactions 3amethane 3anitrogen 3atemperature 3azeolites1 aLi, Gang1 aGu, Qinfen1 aSingh, Ranjeet1 aXiao, Penny1 aLiu, Jefferson Z.1 aWebley, Paul A.0 tChemical communications.g2014 Apr. 4, v. 50, no. 35 p.4544-4546dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4cc00269e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245008900173520128700262592002801549650004401577650002201621650002701643650002601670650001801696650001501714650003301729650001401762650001701776650003301793650001601826650002201842650001301864653001201877653002701889653001601916653001801932700002301950700006301973773010402036856008702140852000902227655001202236IND60690630820221121161224.0201209e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069063082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1110522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaidya, Leena B.10aBiological metal organic framework (bio-MOF) of glucoamylase with enhanced stability  aThe handling of conventional enzyme- metal organic framework (MOF) composites is big challenge due to their nano-sized and lightweight structure with low density. Also, conventional MOFs are derived from non-renewable petroleum feedstock which makes them inherent toxic and non-biodegradable. To overcome these difficulties, recently, green, renewable framework material composite, biological metal-organic frameworks (bio-MOFs) have intrigued as a novel class of porous materials. Here, glucoamylase was encapsulated within ZIF-8 in presence of functionalized carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) at mild aqueous conditions. The successful formation of glucoamylase bio-MOF was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In thermal stability, glucoamylase bio-MOF exhibited 187 % enhanced thermal stability in the temperature range of 55−75 °C as compared to native form. Further, glucoamylase bio-MOF was recycled for 5 cycles and compared their activity with traditional glucoamylase MOF. Glucoamylase bio-MOF showed significantly improved recyclability which was attributed by adhesive nature of CMC. Finally, the conformational change occurred in enzyme after immobilization was determined by FT-IR data tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acoordination polymers 3aencapsulation 3afeedstocks 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3apetroleum 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3atoxicity 0aBio-MOF 0aCarboxymethylcellulose 0aReusability 0aGlucoamylase.1 aNadar, Shamraja S.1 aRathod, Virendra K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1130-05460 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Sept., v. 193 p.111052-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1110523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245014400161520111900305592002801424650002401452650001801476650001301494650001401507650002401521650004101545650001401586650001101600650001401611650002601625650001301651650001001664650001501674650001801689650002901707700001801736700002001754773012101774856007801895852000901973655001201982IND60754183820221118043847.0211023e20210923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075418382DNAL7 a10.3390/foods101022502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Yujihn 10aDetermination of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids in Teas Using Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry Combined with Rapid-Easy Extraction  aThis study developed an analytical method to determine pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in teas using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry combined with rapid-easy extraction. PAs were extracted with 40 mL of 0.05 M sulfuric acid in 50% methanol solution and cleaned up using Oasis MCX SPE cartridges. Chromatographic separation of 21 PAs was conducted on an X-Bridge C18 column with gradient elution. According to the AOAC official analysis methods, the developed method was verified to establish linearity, limits of detection, limits of quantification, accuracy, inter-day precision, and intra-day precision for each PA. Overall, the method showed excellent repeatability, sensitivity, and reproducibility. The verified method was applied to tea samples, including maté, lemon balm, fennel, hibiscus, chrysanthemum, lavender, oolong tea, chamomile, rooibos, peppermint, mix tea, black, and green tea. One of the main advantages of the method developed in this study is that it allows complete separation of lycopsamine and intermedine peaks. Therefore, the method could be used to monitor PAs in teas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspalathus linearis 3aChrysanthemum 3aHibiscus 3aLavandula 3aMelissa officinalis 3aMentha piperita nothosubsp. piperita 3achamomile 3afennel 3agreen tea 3aliquid chromatography 3amethanol 3aoases 3aoolong tea 3asulfuric acid 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aKoo, Yongeui 1 aJeong, Yoonhwa 0 tFoods.g2021 Sept. 23, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101022503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04136naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245011000214300001600324520295300340592002803293650001303321650002403334650001503358650002503373650002303398650002203421653001403443653001403457653001703471653001203488653002403500653001403524700001903538773010803557856008803665852000903753655001203762IND60590818520221122045051.0200913e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059081852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedretti, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7677-394810aReproducing tailing in breakthrough curves: Are statistical models equally representative and predictive?  ap. 236-248.  aBreakthrough curves (BTCs) observed during tracer tests in highly heterogeneous aquifers display strong tailing. Power laws are popular models for both the empirical fitting of these curves, and the prediction of transport using upscaling models based on best-fitted estimated parameters (e.g. the power law slope or exponent). The predictive capacity of power law based upscaling models can be however questioned due to the difficulties to link model parameters with the aquifers’ physical properties. This work analyzes two aspects that can limit the use of power laws as effective predictive tools: (a) the implication of statistical subsampling, which often renders power laws undistinguishable from other heavily tailed distributions, such as the logarithmic (LOG); (b) the difficulties to reconcile fitting parameters obtained from models with different formulations, such as the presence of a late-time cutoff in the power law model. Two rigorous and systematic stochastic analyses, one based on benchmark distributions and the other on BTCs obtained from transport simulations, are considered. It is found that a power law model without cutoff (PL) results in best-fitted exponents (αPL) falling in the range of typical experimental values reported in the literature (1.5 < αPL < 4). The PL exponent tends to lower values as the tailing becomes heavier. Strong fluctuations occur when the number of samples is limited, due to the effects of subsampling. On the other hand, when the power law model embeds a cutoff (PLCO), the best-fitted exponent (αCO) is insensitive to the degree of tailing and to the effects of subsampling and tends to a constant αCO ≈ 1. In the PLCO model, the cutoff rate (λ) is the parameter that fully reproduces the persistence of the tailing and is shown to be inversely correlated to the LOG scale parameter (i.e. with the skewness of the distribution). The theoretical results are consistent with the fitting analysis of a tracer test performed during the MADE-5 experiment. It is shown that a simple mechanistic upscaling model based on the PLCO formulation is able to predict the ensemble of BTCs from the stochastic transport simulations without the need of any fitted parameters. The model embeds the constant αCO = 1 and relies on a stratified description of the transport mechanisms to estimate λ. The PL fails to reproduce the ensemble of BTCs at late time, while the LOG model provides consistent results as the PLCO model, however without a clear mechanistic link between physical properties and model parameters. It is concluded that, while all parametric models may work equally well (or equally wrong) for the empirical fitting of the experimental BTCs tails due to the effects of subsampling, for predictive purposes this is not true. A careful selection of the proper heavily tailed models and corresponding parameters is required to ensure physically-based transport predictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aphysical properties 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 3astatistical models 3atracer techniques 0aUpscaling 0aPower law 0aTracer tests 0aTailing 0aAnomalous transport 0aMADE site1 aBianchi, Marco0 tAdvances in water resources.g2018 Mar., v. 113 p.236-248dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2018.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03225naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245010500159300001800264520159100282592002801873650001301901650001701914650001601931650000901947650001701956650001301973650002301986650004302009650001902052650002102071650001602092650002202108650001702130650001402147650001602161650001302177650000902190650001302199650000702212650002002219650001802239650002402257650000902281653001902290653001602309653001402325653001302339653001802352700001802370700001602388773015502404856007902559852000902638655001202647IND60582218020221118115511.0190318e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058221802DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2017-126312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheema, M.14aThe binding of orally dosed hydrophobic active pharmaceutical ingredients to casein micelles in milk  ap. 8670-8679.  aCasein proteins (αS1-, αS2-, β- and κ-casein) account for 80% of the total protein content in bovine milk and form casein micelles (average diameter = 130 nm, approximately 1015 micelles/mL). The affinity of native casein micelles with the 3 hydrophobic active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), meloxicam [351.4 g/mol; log P = 3.43; acid dissociation constant (pKa) = 4.08], flunixin (296.2 g/mol; log P = 4.1; pKa = 5.82), and thiabendazole (201.2 g/mol; log P = 2.92; pKa = 4.64), was evaluated in bovine milk collected from dosed Holstein cows. Native casein micelles were separated from raw bovine milk by mild techniques such as ultracentrifugation, diafiltration, isoelectric point precipitation (pH 4.6), and size exclusion chromatography. Acetonitrile extraction of hydrophobic API was then done, followed by quantification using HPLC-UV. For the API or metabolites meloxicam, 5-hyroxy flunixin and 5-hydroxy thiabendazole, 31 ± 3.90, 31 ± 1.3, and 28 ± 0.5% of the content in milk was associated with casein micelles, respectively. Less than ∼5.0% of the recovered hydrophobic API were found in the milk fat fraction, and the remaining ∼65% were associated with the whey/serum fraction. A separate in vitro study showed that 66 ± 6.4% of meloxicam, 29 ± 0.58% of flunixin, 34 ± 0.21% of the metabolite 5-hyroxy flunixin, 50 ± 4.5% of thiabendazole, and 33 ± 3.8% of metabolite 5-hydroxy thiabendazole was found partitioned into casein micelles. Our study supports the hypothesis that casein micelles are native carriers for hydrophobic compounds in bovine milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aacetonitrile 3ablood serum 3acows 3adissociation 3aflunixin 3agel chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3ain vitro studies 3aingredients 3aisoelectric point 3akappa-casein 3ameloxicam 3ametabolites 3amicelles 3amilk 3amilk fat 3apH 3aprotein content 3athiabendazole 3aultracentrifugation 3awhey 0acasein micelle 0ahydrophobic 0ameloxicam 0aflunixin 0athiabendazole1 aHristov, A.N.1 aHarte, F.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Nov., v. 100, no. 11 p.8670-8679dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-126313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03947naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014800175300001600323500001900339520183200358536013302190592002802323596007602351650001802427650001702445650002702462650003002489650002502519650002202544650001302566650000902579650001302588650000902601650001702610650001802627650001702645650002402662650001702686650001502703650001302718651001002731653004002741653002202781653003302803653001902836653001902855653001402874700002802888700001602916700001702932700002402949700002902973700002003002700002003022700002603042700002503068773010903093856008603202852000903288655001203297IND60707228820221122033509.0200819e20200703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070722882DNAL7 a10.1080/17583004.2020.17902412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArshad, Muḥammad,10aEffects of land use and cultivation histories on the distribution of soil organic carbon stocks in the area of the Northern Nile Delta in Egypt  ap. 341-354.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrecise knowledge of the soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks under various land uses is needed to meet the Kyoto Protocol and for the sustainability of natural resources. The purpose of the present study was to (1) gauge the depth and spatial distribution of the soil bulk density (BD), soil organic carbon (OC) stocks, and soil organic matter (OM) among the various land uses in the northern Nile Delta in Egypt; (2) estimate the soil carbon sequestration rate (CSR) under different land uses in the region; and (3) establish baseline data for SOC stocks in future studies on the dynamics of SOC. The study area was divided into ten sampling zones to represent each land use in the northern Nile Delta. Each sampling zone was further divided into four sampling sites to represent virgin lands and fish farms, and twelve sites were used to represent three crop types and four cultivation histories. The crops included clover, (Trifolium alexandrinum L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), and rice, (Oryza sativa L.) and the years spanned were 5, 15, 30 and 50. The effects of the crop type on the SBD, SOC content, and SOC stocks were significant. In general, the SOC stocks increase as the number of years of cultivation increased. Thematic maps were produced using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) mapping. The Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) technique in ArcGIS10.4 software revealed that the spatial pattern of the SBD, OC content, and stocks conformed to the soil analysis results. The SOC stocks of the croplands and fish farms were 1.6 and 1.5 times higher, respectively, compared to those of virgin land.

The compounds studied inhibited the growth of Lb. helveticus T159 more effectively, whereas as many as 22 other compounds tested had no effect on the growth of Lb. helveticus T103. In numerous cases, the minimal inhibitory concentration values of cinnamic acid derivatives were lower than those of their corresponding benzoic counterparts. Ethyl ferulate, ethyl vanillate and ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.05) growth-inhibitory activity towards Lb. helveticus T159 than corresponding free phenolic acids. The ability of Lb. helveticus T159 to synthesize ferulic acid esterase and surface proteins (S-layer) was reported, whereas no such ability was observed in the case of the other bacterial strain. Therefore, it can be speculated that the differences in the inhibition of both strains can be, at least partly, attributed to the presence of the enzyme and/or hydrophobic surface proteins. The molecular composition of free phenolic acids and their derivatives (the number and/or position of OH or CH₃) seemed to play a minor role in this regard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3acinnamic acid 3aferulic acid 3agrowth retardation 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3asurface proteins1 aSzwajgier, Dominik1 aPolak-Berecka, Magdalena0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2014 Feb., v. 238, no. 2 p.299-306dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-013-2107-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245014300151300001800294500001900312520148900331592002801820650001701848650001801865650001301883650001301896650001801909650002001927650002301947650001901970650002501989700001102014700002402025700001502049700001202064700001202076700001902088773012202107856007402229852000902303655001202312IND60682056620221121161850.0200123e20200121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068205662DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra09199h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xu10aEnhanced thermal conductivity of nanocomposites with MOF-derived encapsulated magnetic oriented carbon nanotube-grafted graphene polyhedra  ap. 3357-3365.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt remains a challenge to develop highly polymer-based nanocomposite thermal interface materials, which can effectively remove heat developed during the miniaturization of electronic instruments. It has been reported that a large number of graphene-based nanocomposites exhibit excellent performance. However, it is still an issue to construct thermal conductive pathways by orientation arrangements with a low filler volume fraction. Herein, a high-thermal conductivity filler of magnetic carbon nanotube-grafted graphene polyhedra (Co@Co₃O₄-G) was exploited via the annealing of metal–organic frameworks (ZIF-67). Co@Co₃O₄-G can improve the thermal conductivity of nanocomposites obviously by forming oriented pathways for phonon transport in an external magnetic field. Therefore, the resulting nanocomposite displayed a high thermal conductivity of 2.11 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ for only 8.7 vol%, which is 10 times higher than that of the pure epoxy resin. Core-shell magnetic cobalt oxide (Co@Co₃O₄) was encapsulated in situ in the nanoarchitecture to avoid falling off. Moreover, the equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulation verifies that Co@Co₃O₄-G had high thermal conductivity to effectively improve the heat dissipation of nanocomposites. This strategy provides an approach for developing high-performance thermal management materials and opens up the possibility for the pioneering applications of encapsulated magnetic-oriented thermal conductive fillers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt oxide 3aencapsulation 3aepoxides 3agraphene 3aheat transfer 3amagnetic fields 3amolecular dynamics 3ananocomposites 3athermal conductivity1 aLi, Ya1 aAlam, Md Mofasserul1 aChen, Peng1 aXia, Ru1 aWu, Bin1 aQian, Jiasheng0 tRSC advances.g2020 Jan. 21, v. 10, no. 6 p.3357-3365dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra09199h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02431naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007300126300001400199520167500213592002801888651001901916700002101935700001801956773010701974852000902081939003302090945000802123946001302131961000902144655001202153IND8003165620221122035106.0181002e198001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND800316562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHUNT, P. G.10aFactors affecting ethylene accumulation in a norfolk sandy loam soil  ap. 22-27.  aLaboratory incubation studies of a Norfolk sandy loam (Typic Paleudult), a soil typical of the southeastern Coastal Plains, were conducted to assess factors affecting ethylene accumulation. Soil from the Ap horizon accumulated more ethylene than soil from either the A2 or B horizon. In the presence of initially high oxygen and methionine, the Ap soil accumulated 35 nanograms of ethylene per gram of soil in 14 days. The same soil with methionine incubated under initial oxygen levels less than 10 percent, however, accumulated less than 5 nanograms per gram of ethylene in 14 days. When incubated under low (< 1 percent) initial oxygen concentrations, ethylene accumulation from soils from all three horizons was unaffected by the addition of methionine. Since methionine did not increase the ethylene concentration in soil with low oxygen concentrations, significant methionine-induced ethylene accumulation in the fields of Norfolk sandy loam does not appear probable. Unamended Ap soil incubated under high oxygen levels did not accumulate significant ethylene unless the water content was near saturation (> 28 percent water by weight). Adding finely ground Bermudagrass residue (0.5 to 2.0 percent) induced an increase in ethylene accumulation. The time required for peak ethylene accumulation decreased with increasing amounts of added plant residue. Nitrate, particularly at concentrations greater than 75 milligrams per kilogram, suppressed the accumulation of ethylene. The research suggests that ethylene accumulation in Norfolk sandy loam is enhanced by high moisture, low oxygen, and added organic matter, and is suppressed by high nitrate concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Carolina1 aCampbell, R.

We tested the hypothesis that the species composition and functional feeding traits of zooplankton are influenced by environmental gradients, such as depth, trophic status, and ion content. This hypothesis was tested in three lignite strip mine lakes in Central Poland. Two shallow, polymictic lakes were reclaimed (1994 and 2008), and the third deep, stratified lake has been reclaimed during the flooding process, since 2011. Samples were collected monthly in 2016 and 2017. The functional responses of zooplankton communities to environmental variables were tested through redundancy analyses. Both eutrophy and oligotrophy contributed to the taxonomic heterogeneity and functional homogeneity of zooplankton. In eutrophic condition small microphagous rotifers and small-sized crustaceans dominated, while oligotrophy and high ion concentrations favored dominance of large microphagous and stationary/suspended feeders. In turn, the depth gradient of a newly emerging, stratified lake resulted in taxonomic and functional heterogeneity of zooplankton. Our results complement existing knowledge about zooplankton in post-industrial areas, and also provide new information on the mechanisms of formation and functioning of mine pit lake ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a18.610.010-110cUniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie  a010/RID/2018/19cMinisterstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyższego 3aRotifera 3aecosystems 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3alignite 3aspecies diversity 3azooplankton 3aPoland1 aKoszałka, Jacek1 aTandyrak, Renata1 aGrochowska, Jolanta1 aParszuto, Katarzyna0 tHydrobiologia.g2021 June, v. 848, no. 11 p.2699-2719dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04590-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02372naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001900112245014600131300001600277520092800293592002801221650002401249650002501273650001501298650001201313650001301325650001801338650001101356650002001367650001301387650001701400650001201417650001101429650002301440650002001463650001401483650002001497650002501517653002301542653001901565653001201584653002401596653002001620700001701640700002001657700001801677700002401695773013801719852000901857655001201866IND60126884420221120195711.0151124e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012688442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmre, Iskender10aChanges in Antioxidative Enzyme Activity, Glycogen, Lipid, Protein, and Malondialdehyde Content in Cadmium-Treated Galleria mellonella Larvae  ap. 371-377.  aIn this study, we analyzed the effects of cadmium (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mg per 100 g of nutrient) on total protein, lipid, and glycogen levels, lipid peroxidation (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, and metal accumulation in Galleria mellonella L.

This work explored the prebiotic potential of a novel fiber plus D-Limonene supplement (FLS) in comparison to fructooligosaccharides (FOS) over distal colonic fermentation with the in vitro model MICODE (multi-unit in vitro colon gut model). During fermentation, volatilome characterization and core microbiota quantifications were performed, then correlations among volatiles and microbes were interpreted. The results indicated that FLS generated positive effects on the host gut model, determining: (i) eubiosis; (ii) increased abundance of beneficial bacteria, as Bifidobacteriaceae; (iii) production of beneficial compounds, as n-Decanoic acid; (iv) reduction in detrimental bacteria, as Enterobaceteriaceae; (v) reduction in detrimental compounds, as skatole. The approach that we followed permitted us to describe the prebiotic potential of FLS and its ability to steadily maintain the metabolism of colon microbiota over time. This aspect is two-faced and should be investigated further because if a fast microbial turnover and production of beneficial compounds is a hallmark of a prebiotic, the ability to reduce microbiota changes and to reduce imbalances in the productions of microbial metabolites could be an added value to FLS. In fact, it has been recently demonstrated that these aspects could serve as an adjuvant in metabolic disorders and cognitive decline.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacteriaceae 3aadjuvants 3acognitive disorders 3acolon 3afermentation 3afructooligosaccharides 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alimonene 3ametabolites 3amodels 3aprebiotics 3askatole1 aValerii, Maria Chiara1 aSpisni, Enzo 1 aCasciano, Flavia 1 aGianotti, Andrea 0 tFoods.g2021 Oct. 07, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods101023713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01362naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010300169300001400272520030400286592002800590650001400618650002400632653000800656653000800664653000800672653000800680653002900688653002900717653003500746653001600781653002400797773009600821856008600917852000901003655001201012IND60610124020221117162703.0181015e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061012402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Minsoo10aConsistent estimator of nonparametric structural spurious regression model for high frequency data  ap. 18-21.  aWe propose a new nonparametric estimator for continuous-time regression models with nonstationary error terms.

Average annual net change in C (AAC) and the cumulative sum of net changes in C were calculated using 65 years of data from permanent plots representing contrasting approaches to managing mixed-species stands dominated by shade-tolerant coniferous species on the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Maine, USA. Simulations of tree growth and mortality were used to estimate C pools to 100 years. On a rotation basis and for all pools combined, scenarios with selection cutting had greater AAC than those with shelterwood cutting followed by thinning or with diameter-limit cutting (p < 0.05). For combined pools, the cumulative sum of net changes in C for the unmanaged, selection, and guiding diameter-limit stands was positive for most of the study period. Our results suggest that strategies that maintain overstory stocking levels necessary to regenerate desired species and promote the development of sawlog-sized trees can enhance long-term C sequestration in mixed-species, naturally regenerated northern temperate forests.  aFunding for this project was provided by the USDA Agricultural Research Service (Project Numbers 0202-11000-001-59S and 0204-41510-001-68S), National Science Foundation Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (Award #1361543), and National Science Foundation RII Track-2 FEC (Award #1920908).  aPublisher supplied data  a0202-11000-001-59S and 0204-41510-001-68ScUSDA Agricultural Research Service  a1361543cNational Science Foundation Center for Advanced Forestry Systems  a1920908cNational Science Foundation RII Track-2 FEC 3aadministrative management 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3adead wood 3aforest management 3amortality 3aoverstory 3ashade tolerance 3ashelterwood systems 3atree growth 3awood 3aMaine 0aCarbon storage 0acarbon stocks 0acarbon accumulation 0asilviculture 0arotation1 aWeiskittel, Aaron R.1 aKenefic, Laura S.1 aWoodall, Christopher W.1 aFernandez, Ivan J.0 tCarbon management.g2020 July 3, v. 11, no. 4 p.381-397dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2218x1758-30127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2020.17955993Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01555naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245006100174300001200235520060700247592002800854650001300882650001200895650001100907650002300918653000700941653000700948653001700955653002000972653002000992700001601012773009401028856008601122852000901208655001201217IND60610124120221117162726.0181015e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061012412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishida, Mitsukuni10aLowering consumer search costs can lead to higher prices  ap. 1-4.  aWe demonstrate that regulations that lower consumer search costs and make them less heterogeneous across consumers can lead to higher prices charged by firms.

Thiamethoxam (10%, WG) was sprayed on Swiss chard grown in two different areas under greenhouse conditions at the recommended dose rate of 10g/20L water. Samples were collected randomly up to 14days post-application, extracted using quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, safe (QuEChERS) acetate-buffered method and purified via a dispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) procedure. Matrix matched calibration showed good linearity with determination coefficients (R2)⩾0.998. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 0.007 and 0.02mg/kg. The method was validated in triplicate at two different spiked concentration levels. Good recoveries (n=3) of 87.48–105.61% with relative standard deviations (RSDs)<10 were obtained for both analytes. The rate of disappearance of total thiamethoxam residues in/on Swiss chard was best described by first-order kinetics with half-lives of 6.3 and 4.2days. We predicted from the PHRL curves that if the residues were <19.21 or 26.98mg/kg at 10days before harvest, then total thiamethoxam concentrations would be below the maximum residue limits during harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 3aclothianidin 3adetection limit 3agreenhouse production 3ahalf life 3aionization 3aliquid chromatography 3amaximum residue limits 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3asolid phase extraction 3astatistical analysis 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athiamethoxam 0aThiamethoxam 0aMetabolite 0aClothianidin 0aSwiss chard 0aLC/MS/MS 0aDissipation 0aHalf-life1 aFarha, Waziha1 aAbd El-Aty, A.M.1 aKabir, Md.

We use the coding technique of content analysis to capture quantitative data of carbon reduction and classify sample firms by disclosure content into three groups and then apply ordinal logit regression to test the proposed hypotheses. Firm size (Size) and profitability (Profit) are positively related to carbon disclosure; SOE blockholder (State-bloc) and high carbon emission industries (HCEI) are significantly more dedicated to carbon disclosure. However, POE blockholder (Private-bloc) and creditors (Lev) are negatively related to carbon disclosure. We also find that the effects of HCEI and Ownership differ most widely between firms in coastal areas and firms in non-coastal areas; State-bloc is more significantly related to carbon disclosure in the 12ᵗʰ-five period than in the 11ᵗʰ-five period. Chinese firms should understand that taking substantive actions of carbon disclosure, fulfilling social responsibilities, and aligning their operations to the planned economy can contribute to their sustainable development. This paper offers evidence of variations in drivers of carbon disclosure, and such variations are attributable to the differences between the two plan periods and between geographical regions. The evidence is helpful for understanding what have motivated Chinese firms to disclose carbon emission information in the two different plan periods and in different geographical areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acarbon 3acentrally planned economy 3aownership 3aprofitability 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 0aCarbon disclosure 0alegitimacy 0astakeholder theory 0asustainable1 aKuo, Lopin1 aMa, Beiling0 tCarbon management.g2020 July 3, v. 11, no. 4 p.399-414dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2218x1758-30127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17583004.2020.17961423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003400147245010100181300001800282520114400300592002801444650002501472650001801497650000901515650001101524650001701535650002501552650001901577700003101596773010901627856004801736852000901784655001201793IND50068837120221116181945.0130828e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006883712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-013-0580-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViswanathaswamy, Dinesh Kumar10aRep-PCR Identifies Both Inter- and Intra-Specific Mitochondrial Genome Differences in Carthamus   ap. 1150-1156.  aMitochondria are derived from ancient prokaryotic endosymbionts, and their genomes exhibit similarities to prokaryote genomes. Therefore, it was hypothesized that the molecular techniques suitable for distinguishing prokaryotic genomes could also be used to assess mitochondrial diversity. The rep-PCR (repetitive element palindromic-PCR) technique, based on the repetitive sequences found in bacterial genomes, has been used extensively for identifying and distinguishing bacterial strains. This study was undertaken to evaluate the utility of rep-PCR for identifying mitochondrial (mt) genome diversity in safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) and its wild relatives. Using three sets of commonly used primers, BOX, ERIC and REP, both inter-specific and intra-specific mt genome diversities in Carthamus were identified. To confirm that the amplicons obtained with rep-PCR were derived from mitochondrial genomes, we cloned and sequenced six randomly chosen bands from rep-PCR gels and demonstrated that the amplified products were mitochondrial-genome-specific. The advantages of rep-PCR in assessing chondriome variability are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aendosymbionts 3agels 3agenome 3amitochondria 3arepetitive sequences 3awild relatives1 aNizampatnam, Narasimha Rao0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2013 Oct., v. 31, no. 5 p.1150-1156dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-013-0580-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01554naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016200159300001800321520028500339592002800624650001700652650002300669650002100692650002700713650002300740650001400763650001900777650002100796700001900817700010300836700001700939700002000956773013300976856007401109852000901183655001201192IND60659818920221120164132.0190823e20130409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065981892DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc41068d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Hisao12aA heterogeneous palladium catalyst hybridised with a titanium dioxide photocatalyst for direct C–C bond formation between an aromatic ring and acetonitrile  ap. 3793-3795.  aA palladium catalyst hybridised with a titanium dioxide photocatalyst can promote cyanomethylation of an aromatic ring by using acetonitrile, where the photocatalyst activates acetonitrile to form a cyanomethyl radical before the C–C bond formation using the palladium catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3aaromatic compounds 3achemical bonding 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3apalladium 3aphotocatalysts 3atitanium dioxide1 aFujimura, Yuki1 aYuzawaPresent address: Institute for Molecular Science, Myodaiji, Okazaki 444-8585, Japan., Hayato1 aKumagai, Jun1 aYoshida, Tomoko0 tChemical communications.g2013 Apr. 9, v. 49, no. 36 p.3793-3795dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3cc41068d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245008500156300001800241500002000259520166300279592002801942650001601970650002601986650001802012650001302030650001202043650001802055650002102073650001802094650002502112650001302137650001502150650001002165650002102175650002202196650001602218650002502234650001102259650000902270650002202279650001702301650001302318650001402331650002102345650001502366651001302381700002002394700002402414773011402438856007202552852000902624655001202633IND60579435220221121211112.0170817e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057943522DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.27302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDejen, Eshete14aThe Decline of the Lake Tana (Ethiopia) Fisheries: Causes and Possible Solutions  ap. 1842-1851.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis article reviews major findings of a vast body of scientific studies on the ecology of the fish community and the fisheries in Lake Tana over the past 25 years. There are three commercially important fish taxa in the lake: Nile tilapia, African catfish and Labeobarbus spp. The catch per unit of effort for all the three taxa declined during the last two decades: total catch 177 kg/trip in 1993,140 kg/trip in 2001 and 56 kg/trip in 2010. But the most drastic reduction was observed for the Labeobarbus species: 63 kg/trip in 1993, 28 kg/trip in 2001 and only 6 kg/trip in 2010. Most probably, both recruitment overfishing and increased recession farming contributed to the decline. The migrating Labeobarbus spp. were heavily affected by irrigation and dam constructions causing destruction of breeding and nursery habitats in the spawning rivers. We conclude that implementation of the fisheries legislation gazetted in 2003 and the lake management plan adopted in 2015 is crucial to prevent the collapse of the Lake Tana fishery. Suspended silt from erosion and land degradation, caused by deforestation in the catchment, increased the turbidity of the lake water. The current Maximum Sustainable Yield is approximately 10–20 kg ha⁻¹ y⁻¹, which is low compared to other African lakes. The low productivity seems to be caused both by both light limitation and nutrient limitation. Soil erosion is probably limiting primary production. Appropriate land use management and soil conservation around Lake Tana, such as afforestation and implementing zero‐grazing practices, are urgently needed.

The immobilization was total in 30min, maintaining 75–80% of activity. These preparations were inactivated at different pH values and in the presence of 50% ethanol. The stability of the enzyme immobilized at pH 9 was much lower than that of the enzyme immobilized at pH 5 under all studied conditions but the differences decreased as the ionic strength of the inactivation solution increased. The likeliest explanation to these different stabilities depending on the immobilization pH was that the enzyme presented a different orientation on the support. The enzyme immobilized at pH 5 was more stable than the free enzyme at pHs 5 and 9 (by a 2 or a 6 fold factor respectively), while at pH 7 the free enzyme was clearly more stable than the immobilized enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus oryzae 3abeta-galactosidase 3aenzyme stability 3aethanol 3aimmobilized enzymes 3aion exchange 3aionic strength 3apH 0aIonic exchange 0aEnzyme-support orientation 0aEnzyme stability 0aβ-Galactosidase 0aBiocatalyst design1 aPeirce, Sara1 aRueda, Nazzoly1 aMarzocchella, Antonio1 aGonçalves, Luciana R.B.1 aRocha, Maria Valderez Ponte1 aFernandez-Lafuente, Roberto0 tProcess biochemistry.g2016 July, v. 51, no. 7 p.875-880dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2016.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008300168300001600251520098500267592002801252650001501280650001501295650000901310650001101319650001901330650000701349650001401356650001301370650003301383650002301416650002101439650001301460650003801473650003701511650001101548653001801559653001501577653001801592653001301610653001301623700001601636700001601652700002001668700001701688773013501705856008701840852000901927655001201936IND60605271020221121041610.0190131e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060527102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.12.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeema, K.M.10aRemoval of lead (II) from aqeouos waste using (CD-PCL-TiO2) bio-nanocomposites  ap. 136-142.  aLead (Pb) pollution is our water system is a major concern, as this metal is toxic even at low concentration. This study aim to fabricate a bio-nanocomposite (cyclodextrin-polycaprolactone titanium dioxide) that will be used as an adsorbent for the removal of lead in aqueous waste. In this study, titanium dioxide was synthesized via sol-gel technique then incorporated in a polymer blend (CD-PCL) via solution blending method. The resulting bio-nanocomposites were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and Brunauer Emmett and Teller (BET). The effect of how factors such as pH, concentration and adsorbent dose affect the removal efficiency of the bio-nanocomposites were studies. Maximum adsorption of lead obtained was 98% at pH 9.7, 10 ppm with 0.005 g dosage. Kinetic studies and adsorption isotherms were also investigated. The adsorption data fit Langmuir isotherm.

The remarkable physicochemical properties of PLA such as renewability, biodegradability, and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for clinical use open up interesting perspectives for application in food packaging and biomedical materials. Nowadays, there is an increasing consumer demands for fresh, high-quality, and natural foods packaged with environmentally friendly materials that prolong the shelf life. The incorporation of antimicrobial agents into PLA-based polymers is likely to lead to the next generation of packaging materials. The development of antimicrobial PLA materials as a delivery system or coating for biomedical devices is also advantageous in order to reduce possible dose-dependent side effects and limit the phenomena of antibiotic resistance. This mini-review summarizes the most recent advances made in antimicrobial PLA-based polymers including their preparation, biocidal action, and applications. It also highlights the potential of PLA systems as efficient stabilizers-carriers of various kinds of antimicrobial additives including essential oils and other natural compounds, active particles and nanoparticles, and conventional and synthetic molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aadditives 3aadverse effects 3aanti-infective agents 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiodegradability 3abiomedical materials 3acoatings 3adose response 3aessential oils 3afood packaging 3amedical equipment 3amicrobial growth 3ananoparticles 3anatural foods 3apackaging materials 3apolylactic acid 3ashelf life1 aLopresti, Francesco1 aMarino, Andreana1 aNostro, Antonia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4280-78950 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2018 Sept., v. 102, no. 18 p.7739-7756dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-018-9220-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245011800207520126100325592002801586650002001614650002401634650002001658650001701678650002001695650001601715650001001731650002001741650001301761650001501774653001901789653002001808653002301828653002001851653002001871700001601891700001501907700001701922700001401939700005601953773010302009856008602112852000902198655001202207IND60738533920221121134749.0210813e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073853392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1058752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastaldo, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4279-731610aCommon carp exposed to binary mixtures of Cd(II) and Zn(II): A study on metal bioaccumulation and ion-homeostasis  aThe aquatic environment receives a wide variety of contaminants that interact with each other, influencing their mutual toxicity. Therefore, studies of mixtures are needed to fully understand their deleterious effects on aquatic organisms. In the present experiment, we aimed to assess the effects of Cd and Zn mixtures in common carp during a one-week exposure. The used nominal waterborne metal levels were 0.02, 0.05 and 0.10 µM for Cd and 3, 7.5 and 15 µM for Zn. Our results showed on the one hand a fast Cd increase and on the other hand a delayed Zn accumulation. In the mixture scenario an inhibition of Cd accumulation due to Zn was marked in the liver but temporary in the gills. For Zn, the delayed accumulation gives an indication of the efficient homeostasis of this essential metal. Between the different mixtures, a stimulation of Zn accumulation by Cd rather than an inhibition was seen in the highest metal mixtures. However, when compared to an earlier single Zn exposure, a reduced Zn accumulation was observed. Metallothionein gene expression was quickly activated in the analysed tissues suggesting that the organism promptly responded to the stressful situation. Finally, the metal mixture did not alter tissue electrolyte levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3aaquatic environment 3abioaccumulation 3aelectrolytes 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3aliver 3ametallothionein 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aMixture stress 0aMetal pollution 0aDefense mechanisms 0aIon-homeostasis 0aCyprinus carpio1 aNguyen, T.,1 aTown, R.M.1 aBervoets, L.1 aBlust, R.1 aDe Boeck, G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0941-34880 tAquatic toxicology.g2021 Aug., v. 237 p.105875-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2021.1058753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009700158300002000255500001900275520039900294592002800693650000800721650001500729650002300744650002000767650001300787650001400800650002100814700001600835700001400851700001700865700001700882700001600899700001500915700001700930700001600947773013600963856007401099852000901173655001201182IND60715515120221122204944.0201028e20201027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071551512DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc04360e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huizhen12aA three-dimensional multipedal DNA walker for the ultrasensitive detection of tumor exosomes  ap. 12949-12952.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA three-dimensional (3D) multipedal DNA walker triggered by the specific recognition between aptamers and proteins was developed for ultrasensitive tumor exosome sensing.

They have been used for aquaculture since 1960. Geochemical distribution of heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn, Pb, Ni and Al) has been studied in surface sediments using single and sequential extractions techniques. The metal concentrations in sediments were in the following order: Fe>Al> Mn>Zn>Cu> Pb>Cr> Ni, and the average concentrations were 29 μg g⁻¹, 54 μg g⁻¹, 328 μg g⁻¹, 32747 μg g⁻¹, 169 μg g⁻¹, 38 μg g⁻¹, 25 μg g⁻¹ and 23371 μg g⁻¹ dry weights for Cr, Cu, Mn, Fe, Zn, Pb, Ni and Al, respectively. Water-soluble percentages of the trace elements are quite low (<0.01–3.75%) but in the presence of chelating agents in the sediments increase the bioavailability of trace elements (2–58%). About 40% of trace elements are in the stable form as a residual fraction of the sediment and more than 50% (nonresidual fraction) metal contamination of the Kolkata wetland sediments were from anthropogenic inputs. The contamination risks of Cr, Mn, Zn, Pb, and Ni are high as their potential availabilities are 70.96%, 58.01%, 63.13%, 55.62%, and 52.15% respectively. The mean concentration of most of the heavy metals in sediments does not exceed the recommended reference values. Zinc and lead concentrations were greater than background level and Interim Sediment Quality Guidelines but lower than Probable Effect Level. Therefore a regular program for monitoring the distribution of heavy metals in water, sediments and biota should be imposed on sewage fed fish ponds of the Kolkata wetland ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaquaculture 3abioavailability 3achelating agents 3achromium 3acopper 3aecosystems 3afish ponds 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3amonitoring 3anickel 3anormal values 3arisk 3asediments 3asewage 3awater solubility 3awetlands 3azinc 3aIndia 0asequential extraction 0ageochemical fractionation 0aheavy metal 0afish pond 0awetland sediment1 aShah, Rita1 aMukherjee, Debapriya0 tChemical speciation and bioavailability.g2011 Jan. 1, v. 23, no. 1 p.24-32dTaylor & FranciswJournal:21328x0954-22997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3184/095422911X129666670261053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006400165300001600229520139400245592002801639650001201667650001701679650001601696650001901712700001701731700001901748773011901767856008201886852000901968655001201977IND60618968820221117235141.0181030e196604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061896882DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517566036004072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrover, E.B.10aCorrelation of Fatigue with the Dynamic Modulus of Polymers  ap. 346-355.  aAn experimental investigation of the relationship between fatigue and dynamic modulus of two polymers, using wave propagation techniques, has shown that the deter mination of dynamie modulus during constant-rate elongation of partially fatigued samples yields Information about the extent of fatigue, which is unobtainable from measurements of modulus during fatigue or from a conventional stress-strain test of the fatigued samples. It is possible to differentiate between normal and fatigued samples by comparing values of dynamic modulus at an arbitrary elongation subsequent to fatiguing. For polyethylene samples, a "fatigue severity index," based on frequency and stroke of axial cycling, is defined. The dynamic modulus measured subsequent to fatiguing is dependent on this index. The creep behavior of the two polymers tested. as reflected in measurement of dynamic modulus, is essentially different from the fatigue behavior disclosed by the same type of measurements. The dynamic modulus, measured subsequent to creep testing and during constant-rate elongation, provides information not obtainable by measurements during creep or from the stress-strain test by itself. The results support the theory that fatigue failure is due to fracture caused by the' formation and growth of micro-flaws under the conditions of frequency, strain, and temperature employed in the experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3afabrics 3apolyethylene 3atemperature 3atextile fibers1 aDillon, J.H.1 aSuppiger, E.W.0 tTextile research journal.g1966 Apr., v. 36, no. 4 p.346-355dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517566036004073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245009900202500002000301520124300321592002801564596005801592650001201650650002501662650001601687650001601703650002001719650001701739650001601756650001701772650001301789650001301802650002001815650001101835700001801846700002001864700001901884700001701903700001601920773011301936856007402049852000902123655001202132IND60781611120221121004311.0220629e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078161112DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.12922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpadhyaya, Giridhar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9824-514X10aEfficient removal of nitrate and arsenic using a two‐stage biotic‐abiotic treatment system  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNitrate and arsenic often co‐exist in groundwater sources. Reverse osmosis, electrodialysis, and ion exchange are the commonly implemented technologies for nitrate removal. Compared to these technologies that generate high‐strength waste streams, biological treatment converts nitrate to innocuous nitrogen gas without producing a concentrated waste. When nitrate and arsenic co‐exist in a water source, combining a biotic process for nitrate removal with an abiotic process (i.e., chemical–physical process such as coagulation/flocculation) for arsenic removal may provide an effective approach for simultaneous removal of these contaminants. A 12‐month pilot study was conducted with a two‐stage, fixed‐bed biotreatment system, originally developed for nitrate removal, for simultaneous removal of nitrate and arsenic. With an empty bed contact time as low as 10 min in the bioreactor, nitrate was consistently lowered from ~35 mg/L N to <0.1 mg/L N (treatment target was <1 mg/L N), whereas arsenic was effectively lowered from ~14 μg/L to <5 μg/L. Overall, the results demonstrated efficient and resilient simultaneous removal of nitrate and arsenic using a two‐stage biotic‐abiotic treatment system.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Nevada Center of Excellence in Water (WaterStart) 3aarsenic 3abiological treatment 3abioreactors 3acoagulation 3aelectrodialysis 3aflocculation 3agroundwater 3aion exchange 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3areverse osmosis 3awastes1 aRaymond, Will1 aGuarin, Tatiana1 aWu, Pei‐Shin1 aWitter, John1 aBrown, Jess0 tAWWA water science.g2022 May, v. 4, no. 3 p.e1292-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:27658x2577-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.12923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02490naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245008900200500002000289520117700309592002801486650002001514650002001534650001101554650003401565650003401599650002701633650001801660650001601678650001001694700001901704700006101723700001601784700002101800700001901821700005601840773011301896856007402009852000902083655001202092IND60781611220221121004221.0220629e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078161122DNAL7 a10.1002/aws2.12842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCadwallader, Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1266-373612aA Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating national PFAS drinking water occurrence  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPer‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in U.S. drinking water are currently a significant topic of public health concern. Data collection efforts have been undertaken to better understand PFAS occurrence, though limited data observed above reporting limits leaves considerable uncertainty. This work presents a hierarchical Bayesian model developed to estimate national PFAS occurrence in drinking water with a simple model structure and assumptions. Here the model is limited to the occurrence of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA). This model estimates national PFAS exposure while capturing uncertainty, provides information on system‐level PFAS co‐occurrence, and creates an expandable foundation for generating future national estimates of PFAS occurrence. National estimates based on currently available data and model assumptions indicated population‐weighted mean exposure to the sum of mean PFOS, PFOA, PFHpA, and PFHxS around 4.7–5.2 ppt while all four chemicals generally had moderate‐to‐strong correlations among system‐level means.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3adata collection 3amodels 3aperfluorohexane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3apublic health 3auncertainty 3awater1 aGreene, Ashley1 aHolsinger, Hannah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8209-55221 aLan, Alexis1 aMessner, Michael1 aSimic, Melissa1 aAlbert, Ryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6634-90190 tAWWA water science.g2022 May, v. 4, no. 3 p.e1284-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:27658x2577-81617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aws2.12843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009000171300001600261520058400277592002800861650001400889650001700903650001200920650000900932650001300941650002600954650001100980650001900991700002001010700002401030773011901054856008201173852000901255655001201264IND60618968920221117235230.0181030e196604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061896892DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517566036004082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBullock, Austin L.12aA Method for the Determination of Soluble Cellulose in Chemically Modified Celluroses  ap. 356-359.  aA method has been developed for the quantitative determination of soluble cellulose and, thereby, insoluble residue, utilizing cupriethylenediamine hydroxide (cuene) to dissolve soluble fractions of cross-linked cellulose.

Laccase from Myceliophthora thermophila was covalently immobilized onto epoxy-functionalized matrix by nucleophilic attack of amino groups of laccase to epoxy groups of the support. The enzyme loading on the support was about 30 mg/g under the optimum conditions (pH 4.5, 24 h). The effect of pH, temperature and organic solvent on immobilized enzyme activity was determined and compared with those of free enzyme. In general the immobilized enzyme was found to be stabilized compared to the free enzyme. Lineweaver-Burk plots were used to calculate kinetic parameters for ABTS oxidation.

However, the structural stability of the soil against the external stresses can be enhanced through the addition of organic substances. The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of biochar addition on the microstructural stability of a Gleyic Luvic Planosol under yearly conventional tillage of rice-fallow-rice lowland ecosystem in southern Brazil. Organic amendment consisted of four levels of rice husk biochar rates namely 0 % (Bio0), 2 % (Bio2), 5 % (Bio5) and 10 % (Bio10) by dry mass, corresponding to 0, 20, 50, and 100 g biochar/kg soil. As organic matter is known to closely interact with density, we decided further to investigate the impact of varying density, namely 1.15, 1.33, 1.45, 1.60, and 1.75 g/cm³. Biochar-incubated soil samples were subjected to four levels of matric potentials (0, -3, -6, and -10 kPa). The microstructural stability parameters of strain (γ), shear resistance (τ), storage and loss moduli (G’, G’’), and coefficient of structural rigidity (Iz) of the amended soil samples were evaluated using the amplitude sweep test in a rheometer. Increasing biochar rate significantly (p < 0.05) increased the soil organic matter and, consequently, the water retention capacity of the biochar-amended Planosol. The stabilizing effect of biochar addition was reflected in higher microstructural stability of the amended soil compared to the control (no biochar). Increasing density in the biochar-amended Planosol increased the shear resistance, reduced the strain at linear viscoelasticity and yield point, and decreased the stiffness degradation. Increased strength and quantity of the menisci are the driving forces for the improved microstructural stability of the Planosol and at the nucleus of environmentally sustainable application. This is important when considering potential carbon sequestration and storage effects of biochars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlanosols 3aanimals 3abiochar 3acarbon sequestration 3aconventional tillage 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental sustainability 3airrigation 3aresearch 3arheometers 3arice 3arice hulls 3asoil amendments 3asoil organic matter 3atraffic 3aviscoelasticity 3awater holding capacity 3aBrazil 0aStructural degradation 0aOrganic amendment 0aDeformation 0aShear resistance1 aReichert, José Miguel1 aHolthusen, Dörthe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3005-45201 aAmbus, Jordano Vaz1 ade Faccio Carvalho, Paulo César0 tSoil & tillage research.g2021 Aug., v. 212 p.105051-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2021.1050513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009800161300001600259520152900275592002801804650002501832650001901857650001201876650001001888650001601898650001001914650001301924650001601937653001001953653001201963653003001975653001502005653001002020700001402030700001502044700001802059700001802077700001602095700001902111773013502130856007802265852000902343655001202352IND60520599120221116162720.0160522e20151127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052059912DNAL7 a10.1515/pjvs-2015-00802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiccione, G.10aLeukocyte modifications during the first month after foaling in mares and their newborn foals  ap. 621-625.  aDuring early post-partum period both neonatal foals and peripartum mares are most susceptible to diseases. The aim of this study was to establish physiologic modifications of leukogram during the first month after foaling in mares and their newborn foals. To this end blood samples were collected from nine mares and nine foals (T0-T10), every three days from the 1st day until the 30th day after foaling. Samples were analysed for white blood cell (WBC) count and differential leucocyte counts.Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed, in postpartum mares WBC showed significant higher values at T0 (9.02±0.76) in respect to other time points, and at T2 (8.08±0.53) and T3 (7.92±0.59) compared to T1 (6.98±0.43), whereas in foals lower WBC values at T0 (6.11±0.49) compared to other experimental periods except T1 (6.90±0.94), and at T1 compared to T8 (7.95±0.61) and T10 (7.90±0.36) were observed.The differential leucocyte counts showed significant modifications in the percentage of neutrophils (π<0.001) and lymphocytes (p<0.001) both in postpartum mares and in foals during the experimental period.Furthermore ANOVA showed significant differences between postpartum mares and foals (P<0.01) in all studied parameters, and between postpartum mares and control mares in WBC and neutrophils values.The obtained results provide suitable information about the influence of foaling on leukogram of periparturient mares and reveal WBC dynamics in newborn foals during the first month post-partum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3ablood sampling 3afoaling 3afoals 3alymphocytes 3amares 3aneonates 3aneutrophils 0afoals 0agrowing 0ahaematological parameters 0aleukocytes 0amares1 aRizzo, M.1 aArfuso, F.1 aGiannetto, C.1 aDi Pietro, S.1 aBazzano, M.1 aQuartuccio, M.0 tPolish journal of veterinary sciences.g2015 Nov. 27, v. 18, no. 3 p.621-625dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:J000000145x2300-25577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/pjvs-2015-00803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04160naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245017600166300001400342520247900356592002802835650003002863650001702893650001302910650002302923650001502946650002302961650001102984650001202995650001303007650001103020650002003031650001303051650001903064650000903083650002003092650002203112650001203134650001503146650002103161650001203182650001503194651001103209653001303220653001103233653002103244653002303265653001103288653002003299700003303319700002403352773011503376856008203491852000903573655001203582IND60562928320221121045223.0190415e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056292832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2016.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoch, Róbert,10aRevealing areas of high nature conservation importance in a seasonally dry tropical forest in Brazil: Combination of modelled plant diversity hot spots and threat patterns  ap. 24-39.  aThe Caatinga biome has been identified as one of the important wilderness areas on earth. However, less than 1% of the region is under strictly legal protection although Seasonally Dry Tropical Forests (SDTFs) are globally highly endangered. There is an urgent need to increase the understanding of diversity pattern and threaten status of Caatinga plant species to preserve the unique biodiversity and protect endangered species. Species distribution modelling (SDM) can support strategic decisions in nature conservation for poorly researched tropical regions. This study provides the first highly representative, spatially explicit overview of plant diversity and threat status for the entire Caatinga, a semi-arid area in Northeast Brazil. For this purpose, we developed (a) a stacked species distribution modelling (S-SDM) approach to predict quantitatively floristic species richness and patterns of threatened plant species and (b) a combined approach of diversity hot spots and hubs of threatened species to derive conservation importance units (CIU) to contribute to improved nature reserve management. We applied the modelling technique MaxEnt to establish predictive distribution models with 22 uncorrelated predictors including climate, topography, solar radiation and soil information at a high spatial resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approx. 1km). Spatial patterns of species richness and threat status were derived by stacking 1062 plant species and 27 endangered species, respectively. These outputs were compared to two levels of protected areas (Brazilian and international standards) and intensive human land use patterns to define a set of recommendations for conservation management. Our complementary S-SDM approach showed that our predicted CIUs covered an area of 24% across the entire biome, whereas only 7% of the Caatinga is currently protected based on the Brazilian standards. We found that apart from an excellent overlap of 38% between CIUs and the current protected areas, a substantial proportion of CIUs (89%) was predicted outside the existing reserve network. Moreover, our findings enable targeted surveys to be done in order to enhance conservation efforts and ensure the efficient use of available resources in this poorly studied tropical region. Future upcoming local and regional studies could focus on a multi-taxonomic approach including e.g. insects, reptiles or mammals as a holistic perspective towards biodiversity conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiogeography 3acaatinga 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3aendangered species 3ahumans 3ainsects 3aland use 3amodels 3aplants (botany) 3areptiles 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3atopography 3atropical forests 3atropics 3awilderness 3aBrazil 0aCaatinga 0aBrazil 0aSpecies richness 0aEndangered species 0aMaxEnt 0aProtected areas1 aAlmeida-Cortez, Jarcilene S.1 aKleinschmit, Birgit0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2017 Feb., v. 35 p.24-39dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2016.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245017800173300001200351520135900363592002801722650001301750650001801763650001301781650002101794650002001815650001001835650001601845650000901861650001201870650001301882650002401895650002601919650002101945650001401966650001901980650002501999650001502024700002602039700001902065700002902084773012502113856008102238852000902319655001202328IND60574457320221119065515.0170808e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057445732DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-017-2323-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaushik, Manish Singh10aImpairment of ntcA gene revealed its role in regulating iron homeostasis, ROS production and cellular phenotype under iron deficiency in cyanobacterium Anabaena sp.

NtcA is a global nitrogen regulator controls wide range of metabolisms in addition to regulation of nitrogen metabolism. In present communication, NtcA based regulation of iron homeostasis, ROS production and cellular phenotype under iron deficiency in Anabaena 7120 has been investigated. NtcA regulates the concentration dependent iron uptake by controlling the expression of furA gene. NtcA also regulated pigment synthesis and phenotypic alterations in Anabaena 7120. A significant increase in ROS production and corresponding reduction in the activities of antioxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, APX and GR) in CSE2 mutant strain in contrast to wild type Anabaena 7120 also suggested the possible involvement of NtcA in protection against oxidative stress in iron deficiency. NtcA has no impact on the expression of furB and furC in spite of presence of consensus NtcA binding site (NBS) and −10 boxes in their promoter. NtcA also regulates the thylakoid arrangement as well as related photosynthetic and respiration rates under iron deficiency in Anabaena 7120. Overall results suggested that NtcA regulates iron acquisition and in turn protect Anabaena cells from the damaging effects of oxidative stress induced under iron deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnabaena 3abinding sites 3acatalase 3acell respiration 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3amutants 3anitrogen 3anitrogen metabolism 3anutrient deficiencies 3aoxidative stress 3aphenotype 3aphotosynthesis 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athylakoids1 aSrivastava, Meenakshi1 aSingh, Anumeha1 aMiśra, Aruṇa Kumāra,0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2017 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.158-158dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-017-2323-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245008600159300001600245520113300261592002801394650000801422650002201430650001601452650001201468650002501480650001001505650000901515650002301524650001101547650001601558650001701574650001201591650002201603700002001625700001901645700001801664773009401682856004801776852000901824655001201833IND4494205020221120151606.0150225e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449420502DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-012-0175-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWIEST, A.10aMolecular analysis of mutants of the Neurospora adenylosuccinate synthetase locus  ap. 199-204.  aThe ad-8 gene of Neurospora crassa, in addition to being used for the study of purine biology, has been extensively studied as a model for gene structure, mutagenesis and intralocus recombination. Because of this there is an extensive collection of well-characterized N. crassa ad-8 mutants in the Fungal Genetics Stock Center collection. Among these are spontaneous mutants and mutants induced with X-ray, UV or chemical mutagens. The specific lesions in these mutants have been genetically mapped at high resolution. We have sequenced the ad-8 locus from 13 of these mutants and identified the molecular nature of the mutation in each strain. We compare the historical fine-structure map to the DNA and amino acid sequence of each allele. The placement of the individual lesions in the fine-structure map was more accurate at the 5′ end of the gene and no mutants were identified in the 3′ untranslated region of this gene. We additionally analysed ad-8 + alleles in 18 N. crassa strains subjected to whole-genome sequence analysis and describe the variability among Neurospora strains and among fungi and other organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aNeurospora crassa 3aX-radiation 3aalleles 3aamino acid sequences 3afungi 3aloci 3amicrobial genetics 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3amutagenicity 3amutants 3asequence analysis1 aMcCARTHY, A.

We sought to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of cefixime–ofloxacin combination against Salmonella Typhi. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 283 nonduplicate S. Typhi isolates collected during 2012–2014 were included in this study. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefixime and ofloxacin was determined by using broth microdilution method. Combinational testing was performed by using checkerboard assay. In checkerboard assay, synergistic activity was seen in 11% of isolates, while the majority of the isolate showed indifference and none of them showed antagonism. An in silico strategy, an alternative to the animal model, was carried out to understand drug interaction and toxicity. Molecular docking results elucidated that cefixime and ofloxacin are capable of inhibiting the cell wall synthesis and DNA replication, respectively. Computational ADMET analysis showed no toxicity and no drug–drug interaction between cefixime and ofloxacin. CONCLUSION: Cefixime–ofloxacin combination could be effective against moderately susceptible fluoroquinolone S. Typhi but not fluoroquinolone‐resistant isolates. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Cefixime–ofloxacin combination with no drug–drug interaction and nontoxic predicted through computational analysis did not show antagonism against S. Typhi in in vitro. Although this study showed no adverse effects with the cefixime–ofloxacin combination, further studies on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK‐PD) parameters of cefixime and ofloxacin combination are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aSalmonella Typhi 3aadverse effects 3aanimal models 3aantagonism 3aantimicrobial properties 3ablood flow 3acefixime 3acell walls 3adrug interactions 3adrugs 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amolecular models 3aofloxacin 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3asynergism 3atoxicity 3atyphoid fever 3aIndia1 aKumar, D.T.1 aTayubi, I.A.1 aShankar, B.A.1 aBabu, P.1 aMunusamy, E.1 aThukkaram, B.1 aRavi, R.1 aDoss, C.G.P.1 aVeeraraghavan, B.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2017 Sept., v. 123, no. 3 p.615-624dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.135223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02187naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245009300188300001400281520084500295592002801140650002801168650002801196650002701224650001601251650002301267650001101290650001901301650001201320650002101332650001501353650001501368653000901383653001101392653002001403653001501423653001101438700001601449700001901465700002001484700001901504773009801523856008701621852000901708655001201717IND50070067520221118172611.0190402e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007006752DNAL7 a241284522pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Shifeng10aEffect of MeJA treatment on polyamine, energy status and anthracnose rot of loquat fruit  ap. 86-89.  aThe effect of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on changes in polyamines content and energy status and their relation to disease resistance was investigated. Freshly harvested loquat fruit were treated with 10μmoll−1 MeJA and wound inoculated with Colletotrichum acutatum spore suspension (1.0×105sporesml−1) after 24h, and then stored at 20°C for 6days. MeJA treatment significantly reduced decay incidence. MeJA treated fruit manifested higher contents of polyamines (putrescine, spermidine and spermine) compared with the control fruit, during storage. MeJA treatment also maintained higher levels of adenosine triphosphate, and suppressed an increase in adenosine monophosphate content in loquat fruit. These results suggest that MeJA treatment may inhibit anthracnose rot by increasing polyamine content and maintaining the energy status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum acutatum 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aanthracnose 3adisease resistance 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3aloquats 3amethyl jasmonate 3apolyamines 3aputrescine 0aMeJA 0aLoquat 0aAnthracnose rot 0aPolyamines 0aEnergy1 aCai, Yuting1 aYang, Zhenfeng1 aJoyce, Daryl C.1 aZheng, Yonghua0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 145 p.86-89dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006700152245009300219300001600312520101100328592002801339650004401367650002201411650002801433650002101461650001401482650002201496650001701518650001101535650001901546650001701565650002201582650001101604650002201615653003001637653001501667653003301682653002301715653002201738700002501760700005801785700001801843773013301861856008701994852000902081655001202090IND60605271620221121083557.0200110e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060527162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPopescu, Maria-Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4543-287010aStructural and morphological evaluation of CNC reinforced PVA/Starch biodegradable films  ap. 385-393.  aNanocomposite films containing cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), as the reinforcing phase, and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/starch (S) blend, as the matrix, were prepared by solution casting technique.

Structural evaluation was done by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and X-ray diffraction, and the morphological aspects by atomic force microscopy. Infrared spectroscopy evidenced the presence of H-bond interactions between the PVA and S and between PVA/S blend and CNC, and also variation in the conformational rearrangement, while the X-ray diffraction showed that the crystallite size and the degree of crystallinity were strongly affected by blending of PVA with S and also by the incorporation of CNC in the nanocomposite films.

To our knowledge, no study has been conducted to concurrently investigate the fluctuation of plant fitness over its whole reproductive season, recording and comparing both short periods (different samplings during the plant’s reproductive season) and the season/pooled data (all fruits produced during the reproductive season). Here, by assigning plants to either ant-present or absent treatments, we investigated the influence of the protective foliage-dwelling ant, Camponotus crassus, on the flower bud and fruit production of four extrafloral nectaried plants (Ancistrotropis firmula, Bionia coriacea, Cochlospermum regium, and Peixotoa tomentosa) throughout their annual reproductive season. Periodic samples in the field revealed a large variation in plant reproduction throughout the season; the increases in buds and fruits were not constantly higher in plants with ants, and in fact, plants without ants had more reproductive structures sometimes. Nonetheless, the examination of the pooled data, i.e., cumulative number of flower buds and fruits produced during the reproductive season, revealed the plants with ants produced more flower buds and fruits (e.g., up to two-fold greater in A. firmula) compared to ant-absent treatments. Our results indicate the effects of ants on plant reproduction are not constant over time, but the net benefits to plants with ants are reflected in increased fruit production. Therefore, the investigations of the benefit of ants on plants should consider the whole plant’s reproductive season rather than single samplings within plant reproduction period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamponotus 3aCochlospermum 3abreeding season 3aflower buds 3aflowers 3afruits 3anectar 3aplant reproduction 3aseasonal variation1 ade Souza, Geane Rodrigues1 aCalixto, Eduardo Soares1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3617-24641 aSilva, Estevao Alves1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1650-86050 tNaturwissenschaften.g2022 Aug., v. 109, no. 4 p.36-36dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl16697x0028-10427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00114-022-01805-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005200149245008800201300001600289520124100305592002801546650001101574650001201585650001301597650001901610650002001629650002101649650001101670650001701681650002901698700001701727700002401744700002501768700007401793700002301867773014401890856008302034852000902117655001202126IND60685933520200401000000.0200311e20200210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068593352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.0c000902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2043-812810aComplex Mixtures of Chlorinated Paraffins Found in Hand Wipes of a Norwegian Cohort  ap. 198-205.  aUp to 18000 ng of total chlorinated paraffins (CPs) was found in hand wipes of individual adult participants in a Norwegian cohort study (n = 60), with a geometric mean (SD) value of 870 (2700) ng. The CPs covered a wide range of alkane chain lengths from C₇ to C₄₈ with variable chlorine substitution. Complex mixtures of very-short-chain (vSCCPs, C<₁₀), short-chain (SCCPs, C₁₀–₁₃), medium-chain (MCCPs, C₁₄–₁₇), and long-chain (LCCPs, C>₁₇) CPs were found, contributing on average 0.3%, 20%, 58%, and 22%, respectively, of the total CPs. Significant positive correlations were found between CP levels and factors related to the indoor environment and product use, including living in a house/apartment built before the ban of SCCPs, having a sofa, the number of TVs in the home, and owning a car, which mirrors CP usage as flame retardants and/or plasticizers in consumer products. Compared to previous studies of other organic contaminants in hand wipe samples from the same cohort, CPs were the most abundant flame retardants. This is the first report of CPs in hand wipes, and dermal exposure based on these data suggested that hand contact could be an important human exposure pathway for LCCPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aalkanes 3achlorine 3acohort studies 3adermal exposure 3aflame retardants 3ahumans 3aplasticizers 3aproducts and commodities1 aTay, Joo Hui1 aPapadopoulou, Eleni1 aHaug, Line Småstuen1 aPadilla-Sánchez, Juan Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0489-12371 ade Wit, Cynthia A.0 tEnvironmental science & technology letters.g2020 Feb. 10, v. 7, no. 3 p.198-205dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23341x2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c000903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011500159300002000274500001900294520080600313592002801119650000801147650001201155650002801167650001101195650001701206650002101223650001201244650001301256700001201269700001901281700002201300700001701322700003701339700002201376700001901398700002001417773013601437856007401573852000901647655001201656IND60715515620221122204912.0201028e20201027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071551562DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cc04957c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYasuda, Mizuho10aTarget identification of a macrocyclic hexaoxazole G-quadruplex ligand using post-target-binding visualization  ap. 12905-12908.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMacrocyclic hexaoxazoles (6OTDs) are G-quadruplex (G4) ligands, and some derivatives, such as L2H2-6OTD (1a) bearing two aminobutyl side chains, show cytotoxicity towards cancer cells. To identify the cellular target of 1a, we employed a post-target-binding strategy utilizing click reaction (Huisgen cyclization) between the azide-conjugated ligand L2H2-6OTD-Az (1b) and the cell-permeable dye CO-1 bearing a strained alkyne moiety and the BODIPY fluorophore under Cu-free conditions. We confirmed that introduction of the small azide group did not alter the physical or biological properties, including anti-cancer activity, of 1a, and we also demonstrated bias-free localization of CO-1. The post-binding visualization strategy suggested that L2H2-6OTD (1a) colocalized with RNA G4 in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aalkynes 3aantineoplastic activity 3aazides 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescent dyes 3aligands 3amoieties1 aMa, Yue1 aOkabe, Sachiko1 aWakabayashi, Yuki1 aSu, Dongdong1 aChang, Yŏng-t'aec(Logistician)1 aSeimiya, Hiroyuki1 aTera, Masayuki1 aNagasawa, Kazuo0 tChemical communications.g2020 Oct. 27, v. 56, no. 85 p.12905-12908dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cc04957c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005000169300001200219500001100231520163800242592002801880650001601908650001901924650002001943650001501963650001401978650001901992650002302011650001802034650001202052650001902064650001002083650002302093650001002116650001002126650002402136650002102160650004202181650001102223650002002234650002802254650001902282650002802301700001702329700002702346700001902373773012502392856008102517852000902598655001202607IND60574457620221119065239.0170808e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057445762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11274-017-2319-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashyap, Prem Lal10aTrichoderma for climate resilient agriculture  ap. 155.  aReview  aClimate change is one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century for sustainable agricultural production. Several reports highlighted the need for better agricultural practices and use of eco-friendly methods for sustainable crop production under such situations. In this context, Trichoderma species could be a model fungus to sustain crop productivity. Currently, these are widely used as inoculants for biocontrol, biofertilization, and phytostimulation. They are reported to improve photosynthetic efficiency, enhance nutrient uptake and increase nitrogen use efficiency in crops. Moreover, they can be used to produce bio-energy, facilitate plants for adaptation and mitigate adverse effect of climate change. The technological advancement in high throughput DNA sequencing and biotechnology provided deep insight into the complex and diverse biotic interactions established in nature by Trichoderma spp. and efforts are being made to translate this knowledge to enhance crop growth, resistance to disease and tolerance to abiotic stresses under field conditions. The discovery of several traits and genes that are involved in the beneficial effects of Trichoderma spp. has resulted in better understanding of the performance of bioinoculants in the field, and will lead to more efficient use of these strains and possibly to their improvement by genetic modification. The present mini-review is an effort to elucidate the molecular basis of plant growth promotion and defence activation by Trichoderma spp. to garner broad perspectives regarding their functioning and applicability for climate resilient agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma 3aabiotic stress 3aadverse effects 3abiocenosis 3abioenergy 3abiofertilizers 3abiological control 3abiotechnology 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adisease resistance 3afungi 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3agrowth promotion 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amodels 3anutrient uptake 3anutrient use efficiency 3aphotosynthesis 3asustainable agriculture1 aRai, Pallavi1 aSrivastava, Alok Kumar1 aKumar, Sudheer0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2017 Aug., v. 33, no. 8 p.155-155dSpringer Netherlandsx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-017-2319-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005400140245008500194300001800279500002000297520146800317592002801785596004401813596004201857596007801899596003101977650001402008650001602022650002102038650001102059650001202070650001502082650000802097650001802105650001602123650001402139700001902153700002002172700002002192700002202212700001902234700001502253773015102268856007402419852000902493655001202502IND60749848320221121011354.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074984832DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.112212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Guoqin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4805-488710aPostharvest factors affect under‐skin browning in ‘Honey Gold’ mango fruit  ap. 5671-5677.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Under‐Skin Browning (USB) is a physiological skin disorder that significantly reduces quality of ‘Honey Gold’ mango (HG) fruit. Relationships between potential causative factors (vibration, holding temperature, sap) and expression factors (enzymes activities, phenolic concentration, anatomy) were investigated. RESULTS: USB incidence was 2.6–3.6‐fold higher in ripe HG fruit vibrated for 3–18 h at 12 °C to simulate transport damage and held then at 12 °C for 8 days compared to control fruit held under the same conditions. USB severity of fruit lightly abraded with sand paper to simulate physical damage and artificially induce USB was higher in fruit held at 10 °C than at 6–8 °C or 12–13 °C for 6–8 days. Compared to non‐affected skin, USB‐affected tissue had a 7.4% increase in total phenolics concentration. However, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities decreased by 19%. Anatomical similarities were observed between USB symptoms and sapburn caused by spurt sap or terpinolene (a major sap component) to abraded skin areas. Incidence of sapburn was higher in abraded fruit held at 12 °C than at 20 °C. CONCLUSION: Holding HG mango fruit at 10 °C can intensify USB. Activities of PPO and POD appear not to be regulatory factors in USB expression in HG. Sap components may be involved in USB expression under conducive postharvest conditions. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe University of Queensland, Australia  cChinese Scholarship Council, PR China  cDepartment of Agriculture and Fisheries, Queensland Government, Australia  cHort Innovation, Australia 3aabrasives 3aagriculture 3acatechol oxidase 3afruits 3amangoes 3aperoxidase 3asap 3askin diseases 3aterpinolene 3avibration1 aJoyce, Daryl C1 aMarques, Jose R1 aHofman, Peter J1 aMacnish, Andrew J1 aGupta, Madan L1 aSan, Anh T0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Oct., v. 101, no. 13 p.5671-5677dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.112213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01684naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245008200173500002200255520055500277592002800832650001100860650002300871650001000894650001000904650001300914650002200927650001400949650001400963650002000977653001800997653001201015653002201027653001301049700002101062700002201083773008701105856008501192852000901277655001201286IND60656953720221119142049.0190822e20190811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065695372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2019.1510412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, Vishal10aEosin Y catalysed visible-light mediated aerobic oxidation of tertiary amines  aPre-press version  aA mild and efficient one-pot visible light-induced method has been developed for the aerobic oxidation of saturated carbon conjugated with pyridine moiety with an important conversion in medicinal and synthetic organic chemistry.

Two T. colubriformis isolates with different anthelmintic (AH) susceptibility status were used for this study. The L₃ of both isolates were maintained on refrigeration (4−5 °C) until use. For the LEIT, the isolates were tested every week during 16 weeks, using a stock solution of Acacia pennatula acetone:water extract at different dilutions (80–1200 μg/mL). Respective positive controls (levamisole 12.5 mM) and negative controls (PBS) were included. Effective concentrations 50 % (EC₅₀), 90 % (EC₉₀) and respective 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) for exsheathment inhibition were calculated at 60 min after exposure to chlorine solution. Motility of L₃ (migration percentages (M%)) was recorded weekly using the larval migration test (LMT) as an indicator of L₃ fitness over time. No correlation was found between L₃ age or M% and the extract’s EC₅₀ or EC₉₀ values. However, the EC₅₀ values for the A. pennatula extract ranged from 80 to 200 μg/mL from weeks 2–10. Beyond week 12, larval exsheathment was irregular, with higher EC₅₀ and EC₉₀ values and wider 95 %CI. The M% decreased below 85 % on week 7 for Paraiso isolate, and on week 10 for FMVZ isolate. A linear negative relationship was observed between the age of L₃ and M% for both T. colubriformis isolates. The relationship (slope) for both isolates was similar therefore a single linear equation was estimated describing all M% data (r² = 0.771, df = 164, P < 0.05). Thus, when using these T. colubriformis isolates under our tropical conditions for the evaluation of AH activity of plant extracts with LEIT, the optimal age of L₃ is between weeks 2–7, when M% remained above 85 %. The latter may ensure consistent and reproducible exsheathment results for T. colubriformis. Each laboratory must identify optimal conditions to perform the LEIT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia pennatula 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3achlorine 3aconfidence interval 3aecdysis 3aequations 3ain vitro studies 3alarvae 3alevamisole 3amedian effective concentration 3aplant extracts 3arefrigeration 0aLarval exsheathment inhibition test 0aOptimal age 0aAnthelmintic activity 0aSmall ruminants1 aIsrael Chan-Pérez, José1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8128-93841 ade Jesús Torres-Acosta, Juan Felipe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3724-33911 aCastañeda-Ramírez, Gloria Sarahi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1006-75541 aCan-Celis, Alhely1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3985-29321 aChan-Pérez, José Israel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8128-93841 aSandoval-Castro, C.

The mechanism of such processes has been elucidated by density functional theory methods for the L₄WCl₂ (L = PMe₃, PMePh₂) systems. The triplet L₄WCl₂ reagents are found to proceed to singlet intermediates and products in a reaction sequence involving dissociation of a phosphine ligand, a triplet → singlet intersystem crossing, an initial CC bond cleavage and a free phosphine attachment transition state. The first step is the rate-determining step with a Gibbs free energy barrier of 19.8 kcal mol⁻¹, and the formation of the stable phosphinoketenylidene intermediate is thermodynamically favorable. Further reaction of the phosphinoketenylidene intermediate to give the final phosphinocarbyne product is unusual because it is thermodynamically disfavored but kinetically feasible. The key steps involve loss of another phosphine ligand to give the transition state involving the cleavage of the second CC bond of C₃O₂.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acarbon 3achemical bonding 3acleavage (chemistry) 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3aligands 3aphosphine 3atungsten1 aZhang, Zhong1 aLi, Qian-shu1 aKing, R.

The so-called flint hybrids are believed by some to have faster growth rates than dent hybrids at low temperatures. This study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using the in vitro kernel growth technique to investigate the effects of temperature on growth of northern flint and dent maize hybrids. Kernels of three hybrids in one experiment and five hybrids and three inbreds in a second experiment were cultured in vitro on a defined medium at 15, 20, 25, or 30°C. The kernels were removed after 2 to 7 weeks in culture and dry weights were determined. The dent endosperm hybrid ‘King KI108’ had the highest rate of kernel growth at all temperatures, whereas the European flint-dent hybrid ‘Limagrain LG1’ had the slowest rate of growth. The Canadian flint-dent hybrid ‘Pioneer 3995’ had an intermediate rate of growth. In one experiment, the differences were more pronounced at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Kernels of inbreds were difficult to culture in vitro, and the growth rates of their kernels were never greater than those of the F₁ progenies. The comparison of flint and dent hybrids suggested that a more extensive study of the major groups of maize would result in detection of differences in growth rates of kernels at different temperature,s.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aseasonal variation1 aSchaalje, G.

In this study, a screening of mineral level in vine leaves is performed to a series of 35 Vitis hybrids for rootstock selection, in two different growing conditions at two sampling times. Mineral levels were determined by elemental analyzer (N) and ICP-MS (P; K; Mg; Ca; Na; Fe; Cu; Fe) in leave samples. Generally, the effect of growing conditions was predominant, whereas genotype effect and their interaction were significant for N, K, Ca, Mg, Na, Mn and Cu. A cluster analysis was used to identify the affinity of each genotypes to K, Mg and Ca. Furthermore, response of genotypes to the different environments was assessed by a plasticity index. An elastic behavior was shown by 14 genotypes. Within this group, genotypes G.05, G.21, G.71, G.76 and G.77 reported high potassium level, beside the already demonstrated tolerance to water stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3acluster analysis 3agenotype 3agrapes 3amineral content 3anutritional status 3aphenotype 3aplasticity 3apotassium 3arootstocks 3avines 3awater stress 0aRootstock selection 0amineral nutrition 0agrapevine 0aviticulture 0abreeding1 aGrossi, Daniele1 aSimone Di Lorenzo, Giovambattista1 aZi Ying, Yang1 aRustioni, Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8168-77531 aBrancadoro, Lucio0 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Apr. 05, v. 264 p.109155-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1091553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245012600166500001900292520178200311592002802093650001602121650001602137650001902153650001702172650002302189650001902212650001802231650002102249650001502270650002802285650001202313653002602325653001902351653001602370653001802386653002802404700001702432700001502449700001302464700001502477773010502492856008502597852000902682655001202691IND60710725320221122232751.0201223e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071072532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envint.2020.1061072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Minghao10aEmerging health risks and underlying toxicological mechanisms of uranium contamination: Lessons from the past two decades  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUranium contamination is a global health concern. Regarding natural or anthropogenic uranium contamination, the major sources of concern are groundwater, mining, phosphate fertilizers, nuclear facilities, and military activities. Many epidemiological and laboratory studies have demonstrated that environmental and occupational uranium exposure can induce multifarious health problems. Uranium exposure may cause health risks because of its chemotoxicity and radiotoxicity in natural or anthropogenic scenarios: the former is generally thought to play a more significant role with regard to the natural uranium exposure, and the latter is more relevant to enriched uranium exposure. The understanding of the health risks and underlying toxicological mechanisms of uranium remains at a preliminary stage, and many controversial findings require further research. In order to present state-of-the-art status in this field, this review will primarily focus on the chemotoxicity of uranium, rather than its radiotoxicity, as well as the involved toxicological mechanisms. First, the natural or anthropogenic uranium contamination scenarios will be briefly summarized. Second, the health risks upon natural uranium exposure, for example, nephrotoxicity, bone toxicity, reproductive toxicity, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity, will be discussed based on the reported epidemiological cases and laboratory studies. Third, the recent advances regarding the toxicological mechanisms of uranium-induced chemotoxicity will be highlighted, including oxidative stress, genetic damage, protein impairment, inflammation, and metabolic disorder. Finally, the gaps and challenges in the knowledge of uranium-induced chemotoxicity and underlying mechanisms will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3ahepatotoxicity 3ainflammation 3ametabolic diseases 3anephrotoxicity 3aneurotoxicity 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphates 3areproductive toxicology 3auranium 0aUranium contamination 0aHuman exposure 0aHealth risk 0aChemotoxicity 0aToxicological mechanism1 aWang, Ruixia1 aXu, Lining1 aXu, Ming1 aLiu, Sijin0 tEnvironment international.g2020 Dec., v. 145 p.106107-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1061073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03436naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100004600188245019700234300001200431506007600443520160800519592002802127596002502155596002402180506003702204650002502241650002502266650001202291650001302303650001302316650002102329650001202350650001302362650003102375650001502406651001102421700003402432700004402466700002902510700002502539700002902564700003602593700003902629700002802668773013102696856008202827852000902909655001202918IND60577614720221207123429.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057761472DNAL7 a287896472pmid7 aPMC55493722pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1905-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalgueiro, Mônica da Consolação Canuto10aEvaluation of muscle activity, bite force and salivary cortisol in children with bruxism before and after low level laser applied to acupoints: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial  ap. 391.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Bruxism is a repetitive activity that causes tooth wear, audible sounds, and discomfort. Preventive measures have been studied for conditions that can exert a negative influence on physiological development in children. Low-level laser therapy administered over acupoints is an effective, painless, low-cost treatment option that has achieved good results. Thus, the aim of the proposed study is to evaluate changes in muscle activity, bite force and salivary cortisol in children with bruxism after the application of low-level laser to accupoints. METHODS: The children will be randomly allocated to four groups of 19 individuals: G1 - low-level laser; G2 - occlusal splint; G3 - placebo laser; and G4 - control (without bruxism). The BTS TMJOINT electromyography will be used to determine muscle activity and a digital gnathodynamometer will be used to measure bite force. Salivary cortisol will be analysed at baseline as well as one and six months after treatment. Two-way ANOVA will be employed and complemented by Tukey’s test. DISCUSSION: Bruxism is a repetitive activity of the masticatory muscles that can have negative consequences if not treated, such as tooth wear, noises, discomfort and anxiety. Thus, control and treatment measures should be taken. Although low-level laser therapy over acupoints has been indicated for children, the effects of this treatment modality have not yet been studied. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02757261 on 8 April 2016.

Knowledge of how to alleviate this loss is still limited due to the complexity of both the stress condition and plant responses. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) is a potential source of important drought-resistance genes for its cultivated relatives. The gene for an emmer DRE-binding protein, TdicDRF1, was cloned and shown to be drought-responsive with orthologs in other plants. This is the first report of the cloning of TdicDRF1, and its expression was further characterized by RT-PCR in both drought-sensitive and drought-resistant accessions of Triticum dicoccoides. Analysis of the AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain of TdicDRF1 as a GST-fusion protein and its binding to DRE by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicate functional differences between wheat DREBs and those characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. DREB expression increased in drought-stressed roots, correlating with the RT-PCR results, but not in leaf, showing that tissue-specific regulation occurs at the protein level. Hence, the DREB–DRE interaction undergoes subtle multi-level regulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA-binding domains 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccon 3abiochemistry 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agel electrophoresis 3agenes 3aleaves 3aprotein content 3awater stress 3awheat1 aDurmaz, Emel1 aAkpınar, Bala Anı1 aBudak, Hikmet0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2011 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.346-351dElsevier Masson SASx0981-94287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2011.01.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02475naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008200167520119200249592002801441653001101469653001101480653000901491653000901500653000801509653000901517653000701526653000901533653000701542653000701549653000701556653000801563653000801571653000801579653000801587653003601595653001701631653002501648700001201673700001701685700001401702700001701716700005601733773010901789856008601898852000901984655001201993IND60681083520221120190029.0200227e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068108352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1091892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yaqiong10aGinkgo biloba microRNA profiling reveals new insight into leaf color mutation  aGinkgo biloba (ginkgo) is a well-known ornamental tree. The yellow-leaf ginkgo mutant is an ideal material for studying leaf pigment synthesis and mutation. In this study, we used the Illumina sequencing of ginkgo small RNAs to gain insight into the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in leaf color mutation. We constructed six small RNA libraries, and identified a total of 426 known and 265 novel miRNAs. Nineteen differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were detected between the yellow-leaf and the green-leaf groups, including 8 upregulated miRNAs. The target genes of DEMs were predicted, resulting in the identification of 205 target mRNAs and 230 target gene binding sites. We found that the novel 158_mature and gma-miR2118a-3p target genes were involved in pigment biosynthesis. Three miRNAs, the novel 151_mature, ptc-miR396e-3p and aly-miR156a-5p appeared to be the potential key regulators of leaf color mutation. These DEMs and their corresponding target genes likely play key roles in the regulation of the yellow-leaf mutant. This study constructed miRNA profiles and provides new insight and a reference for related studies on miRNA regulation of leaf color pigment synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 0aginkgo 0amiRNAs 0aDEMs 0aRISC 0aSPL 0aDEGs 0aGO 0aKEGG 0aBP 0aCC 0aMF 0aCHS 0aAGO 0aARF 0aGRF 0aDifferentially expressed miRNAs 0aTarget genes 0aPigment biosynthesis1 aLi, Xia1 aWang, Tongli1 aGuo, Jing1 aCao, Fuliang1 aWang, Guibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7677-76120 tScientia horticulturae.g2020 Apr. 30, v. 265 p.109189-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2020.1091893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245007900164500002200243520047300265592002800738650001400766650002200780650003100802650002500833650002300858650002300881650001700904650001500921650001000936650002200946650001800968650002400986650001601010650004401026653001001070653002101080700001601101700001901117700001401136700001501150700001901165700001801184700001701202773008701219856008501306852000901391655001201400IND60656954120221119142234.0190822e20190813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065695412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2019.1510452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Kuang10aAnti-inflammatory diterpenoids from an endophytic fungus Phomopsis sp.

The West Helanshan Fault is a Holocene active right‐lateral strike‐slip fault located at the junction of the Tibetan Plateau, Alashan, and Ordos blocks. In this study, a 2‐m‐resolution DEM of the West Helanshan Fault was built from the WorldView‐3 stereo satellite images (0.5 m). Combined with the high‐resolution topography acquired from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images based on the Structure from Motion (SfM) method, a total of 180 lateral offsets and 201 vertical displacements were acquired along ~50 km of the fault. By statistical analysis of the offset observations and constructing the cumulative slip profiles, we conclude that large paleoearthquakes have produced characteristic slip accumulation along the fault with a right‐lateral slip of ~3 m and a vertical slip of ~1 m, rupturing at least two segments of the fault simultaneously, which corresponds to a moment magnitude of Mw 7.1 ~ 7.5. The cumulative slip profiles suggest that the fault has likely propagated northward over its lifetime, and the south segment may be the most mature section of the fault where larger coseismic slip of earthquake ruptures may occur. The ratio of lateral to vertical displacement has remained constant (~3:1) through multiple successive events, indicating that the fault has maintained the same kinematic style over the last few thousands of years.  aPublisher supplied data  aIGCEA1706cFundamental Research Funds in the Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration  a(IGCEA1706cFundamental Research Funds in the Institute of Geology, China Earthquake Administration  a41972228cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a2018082cYouth Innovation Promotion Association CAS  a2019QZKK0901cSecond Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP)  a41972228cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017YFC1500101cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3asatellites 3astatistical analysis 3atopography 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aChina1 aZheng, Wenjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0357-92791 aLei, Qiyun1 aZeng, Jiangyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5039-67741 aZhang, Peizhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5656-84421 aChen, Gan0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 July, v. 125, no. 7 p.e2020JB019983-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0199833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001200188245019600200300001200396506007600408520160700484592002802091596006302119596009202182506003702274650002102311650000902332650002302341650001702364650001402381650001002395650001302405650002002418650002602438650001202464650002702476650001402503650002002517650001102537650002002548650002402568650001102592650002802603650004302631650001302674650005202687650004502739700001602784700001702800700001902817773011002836856008202946852000903028655001203037IND60577614920221207123430.0210203e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057761492DNAL7 a287896942pmid7 aPMC55493332pmcid7 a10.1186/s12985-017-0819-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shu10aCo-infection of two reoviruses increases both viruses accumulation in rice by up-regulating of viroplasm components and movement proteins bilaterally and RNA silencing suppressor unilaterally  ap. 150.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Synergism between southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) and rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV) not only aggravates disease symptoms but also enhances their vector acquisition efficiencies by increasing both viruses’ titers in co-infected rice plants, which may exacerbate the epidemic of both viruses and cause significant damage to rice production. The molecular mechanism of viral synergism of these two viruses remains unexplored. METHODS: Single and double infection of SRBSDV and RRSV were obtained with the viruliferous white-backed planthopper and brown planthopper inoculation on four-leaf stage rice seedlings, respectively, under experimental condition. The second upper leaf from each inoculated rice plants were collected at 9, 15, and 20 days post inoculation (dpi) and used for relative quantification of 13 SRBSDV genes and 11 RRSV genes by the reverse-transcription quantitative PCR. Viral gene expression levels were compared between singly and doubly infected samples at the same stage. RESULTS: The movement protein and viroplasm matrix-related genes as well as the structural (capsid) protein genes of both viruses were remarkably up-regulated at different time points in the co-infected rice plants compared with the samples singly infected with SRBSDV or RRSV, however, the RNA silencing suppressor (P6) of only RRSV, but not of both the viruses, was up-regulated. CONCLUSIONS: The SRBSDV-RRSV synergism promoted replication and movement of both viruses and inhibited the host immunity by enhancing the gene suppressing effect exerted by one of them (RRSV).  aPublisher supplied data  a31272012cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a201303021cthe Special Fund for Agroscientific Research in the Public Interest of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3arice 3aNilaparvata lugens 3aOryza sativa 3aseedlings 3agenes 3aimmunity 3agene expression 3areverse transcription 3aviruses 3aviral inclusion bodies 3asynergism 3amixed infection 3aleaves 3acrop production 3aSogatella furcifera 3acapsid 3aRice ragged stunt virus 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aSouthern rice black-streaked dwarf virus1 aZhang, Tong1 aZhu, Yingzhi1 aZhou, Yingnan,0 tVirology journal.g2017 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.150-150dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0819-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02987naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001500158245015600173300001600329520162400345592002801969650001401997650001502011650001102026650002202037650002102059650002002080650001302100650001002113650002202123650005202145650001802197700001502215700001502230700001602245700001702261700001602278700001202294700001702306700001502323773010902338856007302447852000902520655001202529IND60080455320221119011348.0140728e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008045532DNAL7 a249420492pmid7 a10.1111/rda.123542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, S‐H10aForced Collapse of the Blastocoel Cavity Improves Developmental Potential in Cryopreserved Bovine Blastocysts by Slow‐Rate Freezing and Vitrification  ap. 684-692.  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of forced collapse of the blastocoel before slow‐rate freezing and vitrification of bovine blastocysts. Cryopreservation of bovine blastocysts has been proposed as a tool to improve the feasibility of cattle production using the embryo transfer technique. However, the low efficiency of frozen–thawed embryos survival and further development is a crucial problem. In this study, bovine in vitro and in vivo blastocysts were slow‐rate frozen and vitrified after forced blastocoele collapse (FBC) of the blastocyst cavity by puncturing the blastocoele with a pulled Pasteur pipet. Differences in the developmental potential of frozen–thawed blastocysts derived from FBC and non‐FBC groups were found in both slow‐rate freezing and vitrification. Furthermore, we found that the total cell number of blastocysts in FBC groups was increased and the index of apoptosis in FBC groups was decreased. Consistent with these results, real‐time RT‐PCR analysis data showed that expression of the anti‐apoptotic Bcl‐XL gene was significantly increased by FBC groups, whereas expression of the pro‐apoptotic Bax gene was significantly decreased by FBC groups. Our results also showed that pregnancy outcomes in both slow‐rate frozen and vitrified bovine in vivo blastocysts could be improved by reducing the fluid content after FBC of the blastocyst cavity. Therefore, we suggest that FBC of the blastocyst cavity with a pulled Pasteur pipet is an effective pre‐treatment technique for both slow‐rate freezing and vitrification of bovine blastocysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3acattle production 3acryopreservation 3aembryo transfer 3afreezing 3agenes 3apregnancy outcome 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3avitrification1 aKim, J‐W1 aLee, Y‐H1 aPark, S‐Y1 aJeong, P‐S1 aYeon, J‐Y1 aPark, H1 aChang, K‐T1 aKoo, D‐B0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Aug., v. 49, no. 4 p.684-692dBlackwell Sciencex0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.123543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02904naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006400140245015500204300001800359500002000377520153600397592002801933650001501961650001601976650002601992650001302018650001902031650002202050650001002072650003702082700002702119700006402146700006102210700002502271773015102296856007402447852000902521655001202530IND60749848820221121011827.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074984882DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.111822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrfanakis, Emmanouil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8183-279410aOptical spectroscopy methods combined with multivariate statistical analysis for the classification of Cretan thyme, multi‐floral and honeydew honey  ap. 5337-5347.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The botanical origin of honey attracts both commercial and research interest. Consumers’ preferences and medicinal uses of particular honey types drive the demand for the determination of their authenticity with regard to their botanical origin. This study presents the discrimination of thyme, multi‐floral. and honeydew honeys by Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) and ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectroscopy combined with multivariate statistical analysis. UV absorption spectroscopy was applied without any dilution of the sample using a custom‐made cuvette. FTIR and UV absorption spectroscopic data were processed by means of the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. RESULTS: The optimal classification of floral and honeydew honeys was accomplished with UV spectroscopy with a successful estimation of 92.65% for floral honey and 91.30% for honeydew honey. The discrimination of thyme versus the multi‐floral honey was best achieved with FTIR, with a correct classification of 95.56% and 100% for multi‐floral and thyme honey respectively. Furthermore, our findings revealed the region of 2400–4000 cm⁻¹ of the FTIR spectra as the most significant for this discrimination. CONCLUSION: This work demonstrates that optical spectroscopic techniques in combination with multivariate statistical analysis can be a rapid, low‐cost, easy‐to‐use approach for the determination of the botanical origin of honey without sample pretreatment. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aagriculture 3adiscriminant analysis 3ahoneydew 3ahoneydew honey 3aspectral analysis 3athyme 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aMarkoulidakis, Michail1 aPhilippidis, Aggelos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6418-15121 aZoumi, Aikaterini1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1771-03861 aVelegrakis, Michalis0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Oct., v. 101, no. 13 p.5337-5347dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.111823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03714naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245016700204300001100371520235400382592002802736650003402764650002102798650001902819650001202838650001402850650002302864650001302887650001102900650002302911650001102934650001602945650001002961700002602971700002002997700002003017700003803037700001703075773011003092856008103202852000903283655001203292IND60682705120221120165622.0200603e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068270512DNAL7 a10.1007/s13595-019-0912-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValor, Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3986-256X14aThe effect of prescribed burning on the drought resilience of Pinus nigra ssp. salzmannii Dunal (Franco) and P. sylvestris L. [Erratum: Jun. 2020, v.77(1), p.22]  ap. 13.  aKEY MESSAGE: Prescribed burning applied after a dry year increased (fall burns) or had no effect (spring burns) on pine resilience, measured as the capacity to reach pre-drought growth levels compared with unburned pines. In fall burns, there was a larger increase in resilience when the impact of drought and burning on pines was low and burning caused a significant release from tree competition. CONTEXT: Prescribed burning after a dry year can decrease a tree’s resistance (inverse of growth reduction during disturbance); however, burning can increase resource availability and consequently tree resilience (capacity to reach pre-disturbance growth levels). In addition, the burning season can affect the latewood to earlywood ratio (latewood:earlywood) and thus have an impact on tree-ring density. AIMS: To study the effects of two consecutive disturbances (drought and burning) on Pinus nigra spp. salzmannii and Pinus sylvestris in terms of (i) total tree-ring resistance, (ii) total tree-ring, earlywood and latewood resilience, and (iii) post-stress latewood:earlywood. METHODS: We selected drought-affected trees (control) and drought-and-burning-affected trees (burned) for tree-ring sampling. For each tree, we measured total tree-ring, earlywood, and latewood widths to determine resilience and resistance indices and calculated pre- and post-stress latewood:earlywood as indicators of tree-ring density. We used linear mixed-effects models to relate these response variables to the pine species, burning characteristics, and competition release. RESULTS: Resistance was higher in control trees than burned trees. P. nigra showed lower resistance than P. sylvestris but higher resilience. Resistance positively influenced resilience. Specifically, as resistance increased, total tree-ring and latewood resilience increased significantly in pines burned during the fall compared with those burned in spring or control pines. In fall burns, the pines’ resilience increased, especially when pines were significantly released from tree competition. In P. nigra, post-stress latewood:earlywood increased after fall burns as pre-stress latewood:earlywood decreased. CONCLUSION: Prescribed burning can be a valuable management tool for overcoming the effects of a dry year on tree growth by increasing resilience, especially in P. nigra.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus nigra subsp. salzmannii 3aPinus sylvestris 3aburning season 3adrought 3aearlywood 3agrowth retardation 3alatewood 3amodels 3aprescribed burning 3aspring 3atree growth 3atrees1 aBattipaglia, Giovanna1 aPiqué, Míriam1 aAltieri, Simona1 aGonzález-Olabarria, José Ramón1 aCasals, Pere0 tAnnals of forest science.g2020 Mar., v. 77, no. 1 p.13-13dSpringer PariswJournal:2137x1286-45607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-019-0912-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245011400199500002000313520151900333592002801852596004701880650001501927650001601942650001301958700006101971773013602032856007702168852000902245655001202254IND60790224320221122031103.0220824e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079022432DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0190212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yanying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5034-531210aNumerical Modeling of Dike Propagation Out of Continuously and Episodically Growing Midcrustal Magma Chambers  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn the continental crust, the probability of dike propagation out of magma chambers is governed by thermal, rheological, and pressure conditions of magma chamber‐wall rock systems. Incremental injection of melt into an average‐size, laccolith‐shaped, midcrustal magma chamber produces a volume of mobile magma at the bottom of the chamber that has the potential to escape as dikes through the upper, immobile portion of the chamber and the roof. Here we numerically model the conditions needed for dike propagation out of a magma chamber during continuous and episodic injections of melt into the chamber. The roles of magma buoyancy and overpressure from melt injections in generating dikes are explored within 1.78 × 10⁴ to 1.78 × 10⁸ Pa·s range of magma viscosities (μₘₐg), 10 to 40 GPa range of elastic moduli (E) of the immobile top portion of the magma chamber, and 10 and 20 kyr durations of chamber growth. During episodic, high‐flux melt injections (tens of km³/yr), magma overpressure can reach >100 MPa and initiate dike propagation even when μₘₐg and E are near the high ends of the examined ranges. The probability of generating dikes diminishes when the injection flux is lower. Continuous low‐flux injections favor magma accumulation because injection overpressure never exceeds 20 MPa. During either continuous or episodic growth of magma chamber, there is never a sufficient amount of mobile magma in the chamber for dikes to be induced by magma buoyancy alone.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAR‐1321519cNational Science Foundation 3ageophysics 3aprobability 3aresearch1 aNabelek, Peter I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8409-57370 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 July, v. 125, no. 7 p.e2019JB019021-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0190213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03087naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011000170300001400280520163600294592002801930650002501958650002501983650002002008650002702028650003602055650001302091650001602104650001502120650000902135650001102144650001502155650001102170650001502181650002102196650001802217650001102235653002402246653001302270653002302283653001802306700001902324700001402343700001802357773012102375856008802496852000902584655001202593IND60580997820221120100105.0201111e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058099782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zunwei10aSilver nanoparticles or free silver ions work? An enantioselective phytotoxicity study with a chiral tool  ap. 77-83.  aNowadays, silver nanoparticles (AgNP) have been widely used and there are raising concerns about their potential adverse effects on organism. As for the exact toxicity mechanism of AgNP, opinions still vary and whether the released silver ions (Ag⁺) or AgNP themselves are responsible for the toxicity remains debatable. In the present study, we have designed two exposure systems where Ag⁺ and AgNP coexisted but differed in quantification by using photo-reduced method with cysteine enantiomers, and their toxicities to freshwater microalgae Scenedesmus obliquus and model plant Arabidopsis thaliana were determined. In the results, Ag⁺ was in suit photo-reduced by cysteine enantiomers, and the UV–Vis and circular dichroism spectrum evidence confirmed the quantification difference between Ag-l-cysteine (Ag-l-Cys) and Ag-d-cysteine (Ag-d-Cys), where there was more AgNP and less Ag⁺ in Ag-l-Cys. Furthermore, the toxicity assay data revealed that Ag-d-Cys was more toxic to S. obliquus but A. thaliana was more susceptible to Ag-l-Cys. The metal element distribution in Arabidopsis leaves was also influenced in an enantioselective manner, which was related to the oxidative stress. Considering the quantification difference between Ag-l-Cys and Ag-d-Cys, it can be concluded that AgNP exhibited their toxicity to S. obliquus by the action of Ag⁺, but toxicity brought to A. thaliana was attributed to AgNP themselves rather than Ag⁺. The results of the present study help to better clarify the role of Ag⁺ in AgNP toxicity and offer a chiral tool and a new sight to investigate the toxicity mechanism of AgNP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aScenedesmus obliquus 3aadverse effects 3aattitudes and opinions 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acysteine 3aenantiomers 3afreshwater 3aions 3aleaves 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3ananosilver 3aoxidative stress 3aphytotoxicity 3asilver 0aSilver nanoparticle 0aCysteine 0aEnantioselectivity 0aPhytotoxicity1 aSheng, Xiaolin1 aWang, Jia1 aWen, Yuezhong0 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 610-611 p.77-83dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03136naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001600158245012900174300001600303520193700319592002802256650002502284650001402309650001502323650001102338650001402349650001802363650001002381650001202391650002202403700001402425700001602439700001702455700001802472700001802490700001402508773012202522856007302644852000902717655001202726IND60080455420221119011042.0150206e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008045542DNAL7 a248911122pmid7 a10.1111/rda.123252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Bem, THC14aThe Influence of Morphology, Follicle Size and Bcl‐2 and Bax Transcripts on the Developmental Competence of Bovine Oocytes  ap. 576-583.  aThis study analysed two non‐invasive oocyte selection methods in relation to in vitro embryo development capacity and expression of apoptosis‐related genes. Selection was based on morphological quality of oocytes or follicle diameter. Oocytes were classified as grade I (GI ≥3 layers compact cumulus cells and homogeneous cytoplasm; grade II (GII ≤3 layers compact cells and homogeneous cytoplasm;, and grade III (GIII ≥3 layers, but cells with slight expansion and slightly granulated cytoplasm). Blastocyst development was lower for GII (28.5%) than for GIII (47.7%, p < 0.05), and GI was similar to both (36.9%, p > 0.05). Relative expression of Bcl‐2 gene was lower in the GI (1.0, p < 0.05) than in the GII (1.8) and GIII (2.2), which were not different (p > 0.05). There was no difference (p > 0.05) between GI (1.0), GII (0.92) and GIII (0.93) regarding the Bax transcript. However, the Bax and Bcl‐2 transcript ratios in GII (Bax; 0.92 and Bcl‐2; 1.8) and GIII (Bax; 0.93 and Bcl‐2; 2.2) were different (p < 0.05). Regarding oocytes from follicles of different sizes, cleavage and blastocyst rates for 1–3 mm (82.5; 23.7%) were lower (p < 0.05) than for 6–9 mm (95.6; 41.1%), but similar (p > 0.05) to 3–6 mm (93.7; 35.4%), which were not different (p > 0.05). Regarding Bax and Bcl‐2 expression, the oocytes were similar (p > 0.05) for 1–3 mm (Bax; 1.0 and Bcl‐2; 1.0), 3–6 mm (Bax; 1.0 and Bcl‐2; 0.93) and 6–9 mm (Bax; 0.92 and Bcl‐2; 0.91). In conclusion, oocyte selection based on morphological appearance does not guarantee the success of embryonic development. Additionally, the absence of apoptosis is not necessarily a benefit for the development of oocytes. Bovine COCs with initial signs of atresia may be used for the in vitro production of embryos, and COCs taken from follicles >3 mm in diameter are better suited to in vitro embryo development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabnormal development 3aapoptosis 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3acytoplasm 3aembryogenesis 3agenes 3aoocytes 3aselection methods1 aAdona, PR1 aBressan, FF1 aMesquita, LG1 aChiaratti, MR1 aMeirelles, FV1 aLeal, CLV0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Aug., v. 49, no. 4 p.576-583dP.

Geochronological data reveal three episodes of mafic magmatism at ~1,740, 1,700, and 1,500 Ma. The two older generations have MORB‐like Nb/Ta ratios and superchondritic Nd‐Hf isotopes, indicating that they were likely derived from partial melting of asthenospheric mantle. In contrast, the ~1,500 Ma mafic rocks possess OIB‐like Nb/Ta (16.7–19.1) and Zr/Hf (41.0–45.1) ratios, εNd (t) values (−0.8 to +0.1), and εHf (t) values (−3.3 to +8.4), suggesting that they originated from a mantle plume. These three pulses of mafic magmatic activity in the Yangtze Block have geochemical features (such as TiO₂ contents, Nb/Y, and La/Yb values), similar to coeval mafic rocks in Siberia and Laurentia, consistent with detrital zircon provenance studies, which show a spatial linkage of the Yangtze Block with northern Laurentia in the Nuna configuration. Taking all synchronous mafic magmatism into account, a mantle plume beneath southern Siberia was considered to be initiated at ~1,750 Ma forming a broad region of mafic magmatism that extended into the Yangtze Block as well as beneath northern Laurentia and resulted in lithospheric extension. The Yangtze Block was possibly the nearest neighbor to northwestern Siberia at ~1,500 Ma and subsequently drifted from the Nuna supercontinent induced by the ~1,500 Ma Kuonamka mantle plume, heralding a period of limited magmatic activity and tectonic quiescence in the Yangtze Block that extended throughout the remainder of the Mesoproterozoic.  aPublisher supplied data  a14.Y26.31.0012cGovernment Council on Grants, Russian Federation  aFL160100168cAustralian Research Council  a6272‐2018cAustralian Endeavor Fellowship  aMSFGMR 01‐1cMOST Special Fund  aCUGCJ1709cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  aNSFC41972242cNational Natural Scientific Foundation of China 3aMesoproterozoic era 3aPaleoproterozoic era 3aSiberia 3ageochronology 3ageophysics 3aprovenance 3aresearch 3atectonics 3azircon1 aWang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7944-75981 aCawood, Peter A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1200-38261 aErnst, Richard E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9474-03141 aRaveggi, Massimo1 aHuang, Si‐Fang1 aXue, Er‐Kun0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 July, v. 125, no. 7 p.e2019JB019260-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0192603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02978naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245014300202300001400345500001900359520145700378592002801835650003101863650001501894650001001909650001701919650005001936650001601986650001502002650001202017650001402029650001902043653001702062653001102079653001502090653001802105700005402123700005302177700005902230700002002289700001802309773009902327856008502426852000902511655001202520IND60710725720221122222431.0201104e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071072572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molimm.2020.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Qian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4911-156710aMycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1096, facilitates mycobacterial survival by modulating the NF-κB/MAPK pathway as peptidoglycan N-deacetylase  ap. 47-55.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that can infect and replicate in macrophages. Peptidoglycan (PGN) is a major component of the mycobacterial cell wall and is recognized by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Many bacteria modulate and evade the immune defenses of their hosts through PGN deacetylation. Rv1096 was previously characterized as a PGN N-deacetylase gene in Mtb. However, the underlying mechanism by which Rv1096 regulates host immune defenses during macrophage infection remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of Rv1096 in evading host immunity using a recombinant M. smegmatis expressing exogenous Rv1096 and Rv1096-deleted Mtb strain H37Rv mutant. We found that Rv1096 promoted intracellular bacillary survival and inhibited the inflammatory response in M. smegmatis- or Mtb-infected macrophages. The inhibition of mycobacteria-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was at least partially due to NF-κB and MAPK activation downstream of TLR and NOD signaling pathways. Furthermore, we found that Rv1096 inhibitory effect on inflammatory response was associated with TLR2, TLR4 and NOD2. Finally, we demonstrated the PGN deacetylase activity of Rv1096 by Fourier transform IR and Rv1096 NODB deficient mutant. Our findings suggest that Rv1096 may deacetylate PGNs to evade PRRs recognition, thus protecting Mtb from host immune surveillance and clearance in macrophages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3acell walls 3agenes 3ainflammation 3aintracellular signaling peptides and proteins 3amacrophages 3amonitoring 3amutants 3apathogens 3apeptidoglycans 0aMycobacteria 0aRv1096 0aMacrophage 0aPeptidoglycan1 aZhang, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3312-79911 aFang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0280-65561 aZheng, Jianjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6900-09041 aDong, Chunsheng1 aXiong, Sidong0 tMolecular immunology.g2020 Nov., v. 127 p.47-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:12510x0161-58907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2020.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245016300168300001600331520152500347592002801872650001201900650001501912650002201927650002301949650001401972650003301986650001602019650001202035650001502047653002202062653002302084653001302107653001702120653002002137700001802157700001902175700001902194700005202213773012302265856008802388852000902476655001202485IND60580997920221120100032.0201111e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058099792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Simiao10aEnhancing recovery of magnesium as struvite from landfill leachate by pretreatment of calcium with simultaneous reduction of liquid volume via forward osmosis  ap. 137-146.  aLandfill leachate contains substances that can be potentially recovered as valuable resources. In this study, magnesium in a landfill leachate was recovered as struvite with calcium pretreatment; meanwhile, the leachate volume was reduced by using a submerged forward osmosis (FO) process, thereby enabling significant reduction of further treatment footprint and cost. Without pretreatment, calcium exhibited strong competition for phosphate with magnesium. The pretreatment with a Ca²⁺: CO₃²– molar ratio of 1:1.4 achieved a relatively low loss rate of Mg²⁺ (24.1±2.0%) and high Ca²⁺ removal efficiency (89.5±1.7%). During struvite recovery, 98.6±0.1% of magnesium could be recovered with a significantly lower residual PO₄³⁻-P concentration (<25mgL⁻¹) under the condition of (Mg+Caᵣₑₛᵢdᵤₐₗ): P molar ratio of 1:1.5 and pH9.5. The obtained struvite had a similar crystal structure and composition (19.3% Mg and 29.8% P) to that of standard struvite. The FO process successfully recovered water from the leachate and reduced its volume by 37%. The configuration of calcium pretreatment - FO - struvite recovery was found to be the optimal arrangement in terms of FO performance. These results have demonstrated the feasibility of magnesium recovery from landfill leachate and the importance of the calcium pretreatment, and will encourage further efforts to assess the value and purity of struvite for commercial use and to develop new methods for resource recovery from leachate.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3acrystal structure 3alandfill leachates 3amagnesium 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amethodology 3aosmosis 3aphosphorus 0aLandfill leachate 0aMagnesium recovery 0aStruvite 0aPretreatment 0aForward osmosis1 aZou, Shiqiang1 aLiang, Guannan1 aQian, Guangren1 aHe, Zhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6302-65560 tScience of the total environment.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 610-611 p.137-146dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017700167520110300344592002801447650002201475650002301497650001701520650002101537650003101558650001101589650001901600650004101619650001301660650001601673650000901689650000901698650001301707650001801720650001701738650002501755651001001780653001401790653002201804653002101826653001901847653002201866653002501888653000801913653001001921653000901931653001201940653001101952700001701963700001801980700001601998700002102014700001702035773011602052856008202168852000902250655001202259IND60639406920221118043916.0211206e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063940692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1119162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xia-Ling10aAnti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects of active ingredients in the essential oils from Gynura procumbens, a traditional medicine and a new and popular food material  aGynura procumbens is applied topically for the treatment of traumatic injuries in South China.This study was conducted to identify the active ingredients in the essential oils from Gynura procumbens (GPEO) by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (GC–MS) and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects in vivo and in vitro.A reduction in dswelling and pain were observed in mice treated with GPEO or its active ingredients (α-pinene, 3-carene, and limonene) compared with mice treated with a solvent control. GPEO or its three active ingredients had potent pharmacological effects on COX-2 overexpression and LPS-induced migration of Raw264.7 macrophages. All three ingredients inhibited nociceptive stimulus-induced inflammatory infiltrates and COX-2 overexpression, which could be responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of GPEO. However, only 3-carene produced an antinociceptive effect.Consistent with the traditional usage in Southern China, GPEO may serve as a promising potent external therapeutic agent for the treatment of chronic pain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGynura procumbens 3aactive ingredients 3aalpha-pinene 3aanalgesic effect 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acarene 3aessential oils 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3alimonene 3amacrophages 3amice 3apain 3asolvents 3aspectrometers 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3aChina 0aAnalgesic 0aAnti-Inflammatory 0aCyclooxygenase-2 0aEssential oils 0aGynura procumbens 0aTraditional medicine 0aALD 0aCOX-2 0aGPEO 0aGC–MS 0aNSAIDs1 aLi, Xiaojun,1 aQin, Qiu-Fang1 aLi, Yu-Sang1 aZhang, Wei Kevin1 aTang, He-Bin0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 July 15, v. 239 p.111916-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1119163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010800162300001600270520158500286536014101871592002802012653002802040653001902068653002002087700002002107773009802127856007902225852000902304655001202313IND60713602120221118001451.0201023e20190712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071360212DNAL7 a10.1556/019.70.2019.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiss, Orsolya10aHow do dogs monitor the human’s attentional state after challenged by the presence of forbidden food?  ap. 103-111.  aConverging evidence suggests that the presence of (attentive) others has a positive effect on people’s propensity to conform to social rules. It is also increasingly accepted that pet dogs are promising test subjects to study non-human analogues of “audience effect.” This study investigates whether dogs show a tendency to change their behavior according to the visual attention of familiar and unfamiliar human partners in a situation in which human partners disallowed the dog from eating a piece of food. Dogs (n = 64) participated in two observational conditions (Attentive Owner and Attentive Experimenter) and a control condition in which both human participants engaged in distracting activity. The results showed that the identity of the attentive or inattentive partner has little relevance to the dogs’ gazing behavior (i.e., head orientation toward the different partners and the food) and their decisions about breaking or following the rule. This is in line with previous studies suggesting that the presence of the owner predominantly determines the dogs’ responses to such situations. Further analysis of dogs responding differently to the obedience challenge showed marked differences in the role of the “audience effect” might play in modulating “fully obedient,” “ignorer,” and “hesitating” dogs’ gazing behavior. These findings point to the context-dependent nature of the audience effect in dogs and highlight the importance of frequently ignored individual differences in dogs’ tendency to conform to the situational rules.  aFunding Statement: The authors received support from the National Research Development and Innovation Office (NKFIH grant no. K128448).  aPublisher supplied data 0adogs (Canis familiaris) 0aforbidden food 0aaudience effect1 aTopál, József0 tBiologia futura.g, v. 70, no. 2 p.103-111dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:27396x2676-86077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/019.70.2019.133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011500166500002200281520179400303592002802097650001202125650003402137650001002171650001002181650001802191650002402209650001102233650001802244650001702262650001802279650002502297650002402322650001802346650001702364653002102381653002102402653001802423700001802441700001702459773008702476856008202563852000902645655001202654IND60656954520221119142210.0190815e20190812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065695452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tca.2019.1783762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoniorczyk, P.10aStep-wise transient method for analysis of thermal properties of materials Part 2. Experimental investigations  aPre-press version  aThe subject of the paper which is a continuation of part 1 are issues related to the implementation of the stepwise transient plane source method. Both the measuring device and the testing methodology were developed. Measurements of thermophysical properties k, a and cp of selected materials from the group of thermal insulating foams (polyurethanes, polystyrenes), organic glass polymers and metals, including high thermal conductivity ones, i.e. duralumin at one measurement, were carried out. The measurement time was on the order of a few to several hundred seconds. Procedures for calculating thermal effusivity b and thermal diffusivity a were illustrated. Parameters of the thin-layer heater used in the measurement system were studied, i.e. measurements of the resistance change of the heater in the function of the voltage of the power supply and examination of the heater homogeneity were performed using a thermal imaging camera. The method requires that the thermocouples should be mounted on the faces of the samples. According to authors, this is an advantage of the method, because it allows to limit the applied pressure of the measuring stack on the accuracy of materials thermophysical properties measurements, especially metals. The measurements confirmed the suitability of the method for testing the thermophysical parameters of different groups of materials. The obtained experimentally accuracy of thermophysical parameters of testing materials in relation to reference values did not exceed 10%. The usefulness of the analytical solution of 2D transient heat conduction problem in the considered measuring stack has been confirmed by the results of numerical simulation, which includes heat transfer in a sample and in a flexible thin layer Kapton-nichrome heater.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3aelectric potential difference 3afoams 3aglass 3aheat transfer 3amathematical models 3ametals 3anormal values 3apolystyrenes 3apolyurethanes 3athermal conductivity 3athermal diffusivity 3athermocouples 3athermography 0atransient method 0astep-wise method 0aspecific heat1 aZmywaczyk, J.1 aWielgosz, M.0 tThermochimica acta.g2019 Aug. 12, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2019.1783763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01537naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245003800172520062800210592002800838650001100866650001700877650001000894650001000904650001500914650001800929650001000947650002100957650002100978773013300999856008201132852000901214655001201223IND60682705420221120165624.0200131e20191121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068270542DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture91202472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicoletti, Rosario 10aEndophytic Fungi of Citrus Plants  aBesides a diffuse research activity on drug discovery and biodiversity carried out in natural contexts, more recently, investigations concerning endophytic fungi have started considering their occurrence in crops based on the major role that these microorganisms have been recognized to play in plant protection and growth promotion.

Miguel Dionisio10aPotential synergistic effects of microcystins and bacterial lipopolysaccharides on life history traits of Daphnia galeata raised on low and high food levels  ap. 230-242.  aMetastudies have found no consistent effects of the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin on Daphnia, and there are discrepancies between field observations and experiments. Confounding factors include absence or presence of alternative high quality food or the presence of bioactive compounds, other than microcystins in cyanobacteria. Of specific interest are lipopolysaccharides (LPS) on the outer cell wall. LPS may have a number of biological effects, including reduced detoxication of microcystins in plants and animals. When grazing seston in the field, filterfeeders take up heterotrophic bacteria attached to cyanobacteria, as well as free-living bacteria. The LPS produced by heterotrophic bacteria have been shown to be much more harmful than cyanobacterial LPS. We performed two experiments in which we tested for potential synergistic effects between bacterial LPS and microcystins. Full-factorial experiments separated the main effects and interactions between (i) food quantity as well as food quality (addition of the green alga Scenedesmus), (ii) presence or absence of strains that vary in amount and composition of microcystins (microcystin free strain NIVA-CYA43, moderate microcystin producing strain NIVA-CYA140 and high microcystin producing strain PCC7820), and (iii) presence or absence of bacterial LPS on different life history traits of Daphnia galeata. We measured juvenile growth rate, age and size at first reproduction, death before first reproduction and standard carbon content of Daphnia. From the experiments we conclude that microcystin-producing Microcystis had deleterious effects on the life history of D. galeata, but especially when the availability of high quality green algal food was limited in comparison to the supply of microcystin producing strain PCC7820. In the experiment in which PCC7820 was used as microcystin-producing strain, addition of LPS lowered SCC of Daphnia, but had no effects on other life history parameters. The interaction between Microcystis strain, Microcystis concentration and LPS was highly significant in case of PCC7820, but not in case of CYA-140, indicating that the effects of LPS and its interactions with microcystin on Daphnia life history were strongly context dependent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia galeata 3aMicrocystis 3aScenedesmus 3aanimals 3abacteria 3abioactive properties 3acarbon 3acell walls 3adeath 3afood quality 3afoods 3agrazing 3alipopolysaccharides 3amicrocystins 3areproduction 3asynergism 2aAnimals 2aDaphniaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aDrug Synergism 2aFood Chain 2aLipopolysaccharidesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aMicrocystinsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aStress, Physiological 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aSarpe, Dirk1 aBrehm, Michaela1 aIbelings, Bas W.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2011 Aug., v. 104, no. 3-4 p.230-242dElsevier B.V.x0166-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05108naa a2201057 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245017900159520233200338592002802670650001802698650003102716650002502747650001502772650001602787650002102803650002102824650002202845650002502867650001802892650001802910650001802928650002802946650002202974650001602996650001703012650003703029650002103066650000903087650002003096650000903116650002403125650002503149650001203174650002503186650003203211650004403243653002003287653002703307653001803334653002203352653002403374653000803398653000803406653000703414653001803421653001003439653000703449653001003456653001003466653001003476653000703486653000703493653000703500653000703507653000803514653000803522653000903530653001103539653000903550653000903559653000903568653000903577653000803586653000803594653000903602653001003611653000803621653001103629700001403640700001703654700001403671700001503685700001503700700001503715700001403730700001403744700001703758700001403775700001203789700001303801700001703814773011603831856008203947852000904029655001204038IND60639407120221118043805.0190620e20190810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063940712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1119112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhu10aAnti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects of Dan-Lou tablets in the treatment of coronary heart disease revealed by metabolomics integrated with molecular mechanism studies  aThe Dan-Lou tablet (DLT), a well-known Chinese prescription, has definitive clinical efficacy in the treatment of precordial discomfort and pain caused by coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the pharmacological mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD has not been clearly elucidated and needs to be further explored.We aimed to identify relevant biological pathways by assessing changes in biomarkers in response to DLT intervention in CHD to reveal the potential biological mechanism of DLT treatment for CHD.The major chemical components in DLT were qualitatively analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS), and a model of CHD in rats was subsequently established with a high-fat diet and left anterior coronary artery ligation (LADCA) followed by DLT intervention. Next, the metabolic profile of rat serum samples was analyzed using nontargeted metabolomics, wherein changes in the metabolites in serum samples before and after DLT administration were measured by PLS-DA, and two pathways of DLT treatment for CHD were predicted. Finally, predicted metabolomic pathways were verified by detecting and analyzing tissues from the rat model, revealing the mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD.Forty-five major chemical components were identified by the chemical characterization of DLT. In terms of metabolism, 17 biomarkers of CHD in rats were identified. Among these biomarkers, linoleic acid, γ-linolenic acid and lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) were found to play an important role in energy metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Protein analysis revealed that EGFR phosphorylation was inhibited in CHD rats after DLT treatment, which lowered the expression of TNF-α, IL-6 and MMP9, decreased the expression levels of ox-LDL and MDA, and increased the expression of SOD.The mechanism of DLT in the treatment of CHD involves inhibiting the expression of EGFR and the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway by regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism (LPCs) and energy metabolism (linoleic acid and γ-linolenic acid). Therefore, inflammation-related (TNF-α, IL-6, MMP9) and oxidative stress-related (ox-LDL, MDA, SOD) indicators are affected, leading to the regulation of the oxidative stress state and anti-inflammatory effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acoronary disease 3acoronary vessels 3aenergy metabolism 3agamma-linolenic acid 3ahigh fat diet 3ainterleukin-6 3alinoleic acid 3alysophosphatidylcholine 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoxidative stress 3apain 3aphosphorylation 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissues 3atraditional medicine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aDan-Lou tablets 0aCoronary heart disease 0aUPLC-Q/TOF-MS 0aMolecular biology 0aMechanism of action 0aDLT 0aCHD 0aAS 0aUPLC-Q-TOF/MS 0aLADCA 0aAt 0aDLT-L 0aDLT-M 0aDLT-H 0aEF 0aFS 0aTC 0aTG 0aHDL 0aLDL 0aLPCs 0aTNF-α 0aIL-6 0aMMP9 0aEGFR 0aMMPs 0aMDA 0aSOD 0aMAPK 0aELISA 0aPCA 0aPLS-DA1 aYang, Liu1 aLiu, Yuechen1 aXu, Huiyu1 aWang, Shuo1 aLiu, Yijia1 aZhao, Huan1 aXie, Jing1 aGao, Shan1 aGao, Shuming1 aXu, Yilan1 aLi, Lin1 aLi, Yubo1 aYu, Chunquan0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 Aug. 10, v. 240 p.111911-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1119113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005200092040001800144100002200162245009300184300001600277500000900293520178000302592002802082650001302110650001902123650001102142650003702153700001902190773012202209852000902331856009902340655001202439IND8600012020221118191526.0191122e198509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860001202DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1985.0011183X0025000500010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestgate, Mark E.10aCarbohydrate Reserves and Reproductive Development at Low Leaf Water Potentials in Maize  ap. 762-769.  aepub  aLow water potentials (ψw) during anthesis and early grain fill can decrease yields in grain crops. If photosynthesis is inhibited under these conditions, carbohydrate reserves may become limiting for grain growth. We measured the mobilization of stored nonstructural carbohydrates in the maize plant (Zea mays L.) during low ψw, imposed at silk emergence (T1), early grain fill (T2), and mid-grain fill (T3) and maintained to maturity. low leaf ψw, completely inhibited photosynthesis, and reproductive development depended entirely on reserves. The control yield was equivalent to 9910 kg ha⁻¹. Mean yields on a per-plant basis were 139, 89, 25, and 0 g for the control, T3, T2, and T1 treatments, respectively. Yield losses resulted from decreased seed size in T3, decreased seed size and number in T2, and a cessation of silk and ear development in T1. After anthesis, dry matter accumulated in the stems and leaves and was mobilized to the ear at low ψw in T3 and T2 but not in T1. All the mobilized dry matter from the stems and a sizable fraction from the leaves was carbohydrate. By maturity, the mobilized carbohydrates had been depleted to the level at anthesis. In T1, there was no mobilization and the carbohydrates remained at the low anthesis levels until maturity. The low carbohydrate at T1 indicates that reserves were not sufficient to support reproductive development when photosynthesis was inhibited at low ψw. The lack of reserves may explain the high sensitivity of anthesis and early grain fill to low ψw, as well as previous reports of the inability of silks to maintain turgor by osmotic adjustment. The decreasing sensitivity of grain development to low ψw as reproduction progresses may result from an increasing availability of reserves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aphotosynthesis 3ayields 3atranslocation (plant physiology)1 aBoyer, John S.0 tCrop science.g1985 Sept., v. 25, no. 5 p.762-769dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1985.0011183X0025000500010x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02503naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002800146245010700174300001800281500001900299520125500318592002801573650001601601650001401617650001201631650001301643650002101656650002301677650001601700700002201716700002201738700001901760700006001779700006601839773013501905856008002040852000902120655001202129IND60699433720221118230830.0200618e20200522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069943372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c027932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreras Moreno, Manuel10aTemperature-Dependent Blue Shifting of O–H Stretching Frequencies in Crystalline Cellulose Explained  ap. 4924-4930.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIncreasing the temperature of a chemical system generally causes covalent bonds to lengthen and weaken, often the first step in initiating chemical reactions. However, for some hydrogen-bonded systems, infrared (IR) spectroscopy measurements reveal that covalent O–H bonds actually strengthen and therefore shorten when heated. In 1957, Finch and Lippincott proposed a simple one-dimensional (1D) model to explain this effect, in which thermal excitation of intermolecular stretching modes leads to lengthening and weakening of intermolecular O–H···O hydrogen bonds, thereby indirectly strengthening the associated covalent O–H bonds. Taking cellulose (an infinitely repeating polymer of d-glucose) as an example, we use molecular dynamics modeling to show that the same mechanism is responsible for temperature-dependent blue shifting of O–H stretching bands in IR spectra of carbohydrate biopolymers, except that interchain hydrogen bonds are weakened by thermal excitation of chain-separation modes, while intrachain hydrogen bonds are weakened by thermally induced changes in ring puckering and orientation of ring substituents but not reorientation of glucose units relative to one another or overall twisting of the cellulose chains.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acellulose 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen bonding 3amolecular dynamics 3atemperature1 aStinson, Chris J.1 aShepherd, Ross G.1 aWelsh, Ivan D.1 aAltaner, Clemens1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4542-44321 aCrittenden, Deborah L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6740-04770 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 May 22, v. 124, no. 24 p.4924-4930dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c027933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01601naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001800187245011500205300001800320506007600338520031400414592002800728506003700756650001300793650001200806650000900818650002500827650001500852700002100867700001500888700001900903700001500922700003100937700001900968773012700987856008001114852000901194655001201203IND60117726420221207071635.0141126e20140626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011772642DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00416-142doi7 aPMC40228112pmcid7 a248311472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Yuanyuan10aComplete Genome Sequence of Dyella jiangningensis Strain SBZ3-12, Isolated from the Surfaces of Weathered Rock  ap. e00416-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDyella jiangningensis strain SBZ3-12 can weather biotite and release Al and Fe from biotite under nutrient-poor conditions.

The present study evaluated the effect of a cereal ammoniation treatment, in which barley grains are combined with urea and enzymes that catalyze the conversion of urea to ammonia to optimize rumen function. Twelve rumen cannulated sheep were randomly divided into two groups and fed a diet containing 60% of ammoniated barley (AMM) or untreated barley supplemented with urea (CTL) to investigate the impact on rumen fermentation and feed utilization. RESULTS: AMM had higher total N content and effective rumen degradable N than untreated barely. AMM sheep had a consistently higher rumen pH throughout the day (6.31 versus 6.03) and tended to have a lower post‐prandial ammonia peak and higher acetate molar proportion (+5.1%) than CTL sheep. The rumen environment in AMM sheep favored the colonization and utilization of agro‐industrial by‐products (i.e. orange pulp) by the rumen microbes leading to a higher feed degradability. AMM sheep also had higher total tract apparent N digestibility (+21.7%) and urinary excretion of purine derivatives (+34%), suggesting a higher N uptake and microbial protein synthesis than CTL sheep. CONCLUSION: The inclusion of AMM in the diet of ruminants represents a valid strategy for maintaining rumen pH within a physiological range and improving N utilization by the rumen microbes, which could have positive effects on the health and productivity of animals in intensive production systems. These findings warrant further studies under conventional farm conditions. © 2021 The Authors.

In the study, we investigated the effects of Paris saponin Ⅶ (PSⅦ), and elucidated its mechanism in colorectal carcinoma cells and a xenograft mouse model.HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were treated with different concentrations of PSⅦ (0–100 μM). The effects of PSⅦ on HCT-116 cells were assessed using a microarray. Then, apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis and apoptosis related protein expression was evaluated by Western blot. A xenograft model of nude mice was used to assess the effect of PSⅦ in vivo.MTT assay showed the IC₅₀ values of PSⅦ for growth inhibition of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells were 1.02 ± 0.05 μM and 3.50 ± 0.79 μM respectively. Edu assay demonstrated that PSⅦ effectively suppressed the growth of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. Treatment with 0–3 μM PSⅦ not only triggered apoptosis, but also activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 of HT-29 and HCT-116 cells in a concentration dependent manner. In parallel to the alterations, Bax and Cyto-c expression increased while Bcl-2 decreased. In nude mice, PSⅦ reduced the tumor size and induced the apoptosis of tumor cells. PSVII could suppress IL-6-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in vitro and blocked STAT3 phosphorylation in vivo.Our results suggest that PSVII suppressed the activation of IL-6/STAT3 pathway, consequently suppressed the growth and proliferation and triggered the apoptosis of CRC cells. These findings indicate that PSⅦ might be an effective tumouristatic agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrillium tschonoskii 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-9 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aflow cytometry 3aherbs 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3asaponins 3atraditional medicine 0aParis saponin VII (PSVII) 0aSTAT3 0aApoptosis 0aCaspase 0aCRC 0aMMP 0aPSVII 0aRT1 aSun, Yang1 aZheng, Hongnan1 aFan, Lei1 aMei, Qibing1 aTang, Yuan1 aDuan, Xiaoqun1 aLi, Yuhua0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 July 15, v. 239 p.111903-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1119033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03129naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005400142245013200196500002000328520151500348592002801863596005501891596005901946596005902005650001902064650003502083650001502118650001802133650001502151650002002166650001302186650001902199650001102218651001002229700005802239700001702297700001802314700005602332700005802388700001502446773013602461856007702597852000902674655001202683IND60790224920221122031105.0220824e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079022492DNAL7 a10.1029/2019JB0191142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7062-012010aNew Middle–Late Permian Paleomagnetic and Geochronological Results From Inner Mongolia and their Paleogeographic Implications  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA combined paleomagnetic and geochronological study was conducted on the red beds of the Zhesi Formation (ZSF) in the Xilinhot–Songliao Block (XSB) and the andesites and sandstones of the Qingfengshan Formation (QFF) in the North China Block (NCB). The ZSF tuffs and the QFF andesites were dated to 265.3 ± 1.8 Ma and 254.8–257.1 Ma, respectively, using the zircon U–Pb laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–ICP–MS) method. A total of 246 paleomagnetic samples were subjected to stepwise thermal demagnetization. After removal of the low‐temperature viscous components acquired in the recent geomagnetic field, stable high‐temperature components (HTCs) were isolated from most samples. The HTC of the ZSF passed a fold test, and the HTC of the QFF passed both fold and reversal tests, indicating their primary origins. The corresponding paleomagnetic poles are 57.4°N/342.0°E (A₉₅ = 4.3°) for the XSB at ~265 Ma and 54.3°N/20.2°E (A₉₅ = 3.3°) for the NCB at ~255 Ma. Comparison of high‐quality Permian paleomagnetic poles of the XSB and NCB reveals a latitudinal convergence and relative rotation between them that led to a scissors‐like closure of the Solonker Ocean from west to east between ~265 and ~246 Ma, which controlled the mixing of the Cathaysian and Angara floras in space and time. The XSB and NCB moved rapidly northward between ~265 and ~255 Ma, which probably accelerated the end‐Guadalupian mass extinction in East Asia.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019M660734cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a41902227cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41830215cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aPermian period 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aextinction 3ageochronology 3ageophysics 3amagnetic fields 3aresearch 3aspace and time 3azircon 3aChina1 aZhang, Shihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6030-16121 aGao, Yangjun1 aZhao, Hanqing1 aWu, Huaichun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7708-07881 aYang, Tianshui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5530-00251 aLi, Haiyan0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2020 July, v. 125, no. 7 p.e2019JB019114-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2019JB0191143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245012200166300001800288500002000306520165300326592002801979650000802007650001602015650001102031650001602042650001402058650002302072650002002095650001602115650002102131650001902152650001402171650002002185650002402205650001702229650001702246650001302263650001602276650001902292650001802311650002502329650001502354650001002369700001902379700002002398700002502418700006302443773015102506856007402657852000902731655001202740IND60749849320221120233151.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074984932DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.112062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl‐Saber, Mahmoud M10aEffects of magnetite nanoparticles on physiological processes to alleviate salinity induced oxidative damage in wheat  ap. 5550-5562.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: One of the major abiotic stressors that have a serious effect on plant growth and productivity worldwide is the salinity of soil or irrigation water. The effect of foliar application of magnetite nanoparticles (size = 22.05 nm) at different concentrations (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 ppm) was investigated to improve salinity tolerance in two wheat cultivars, namely, Misr1 (Tolerant) and Gimmeza11 (Sensitive). Moreover, toxicological investigations of magnetite oxide nanoparticle in Wistar albino rats were estimated. RESULTS: The magnetite nanoparticles positively affected growth, chlorophyll, and enzymatic antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), stimulating reduced glutathione and improving the aggregation of several polypeptide chains that may be linked to the tolerance of saline stress. In contrast, magnetite nanoparticles reduced malondialdehyde (MDA). Inverse sequence‐tagged repeat (ISTR) assay of DNA molecular marker showed the change in band numbers with the highest polymorphic bands with 90% polymorphism at primer F3, B5 and 20 positive bands in Gimmeza11 with 0.5 ppm magnetite nanoparticles. In the median lethal dose (LD₅₀) study, no rats died after the oral administration of magnetite nanoparticle at different doses. Therefore, the iron oxide nanoparticle was nontoxic when administered orally by gavage. CONCLUSION: Magnetite nanoparticles partially helped to alleviate the effects of salt stress by activating growth, chlorophyll content, SOD, glutathione, and soluble proteins in two wheat cultivars (Misr1 and Gimmeza11) and decreasing MDA content. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aagriculture 3aalbino 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3afoliar application 3agenetic markers 3aglutathione 3airrigation water 3alethal dose 50 3amagnetite 3amalondialdehyde 3aoral administration 3aplant growth 3apolypeptides 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asoil salinity 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicology 3awheat1 aMahdi, Asmaa A1 aHassan, Ahmed H1 aFarroh, Khaled Yehia1 aOsman M.

The recently developed frozen-density embedding (FDE)-diab methodology [J. Chem. Phys., 2018, 148, 214104] allowed us to effectively avoid the spin-density overdelocalization error characteristic for the standard Kohn–Sham density functional theory and to reliably calculate spin-density distributions and electronic couplings for a number of molecular systems ranging from inner pairs of (bacterio)chlorophyll a molecules in vacuum to large proteins including up to about 2000 atoms. The calculated spin densities show a good agreement with available experimental results and were used to validate reaction center models reported in the literature. Here, we demonstrate that the applied theoretical approach is very sensitive to changes in molecular structures and the relative orientation of molecules. This makes FDE-diab a valuable tool for electronic structure calculations of large photosynthetic models effectively complementing the existing experimental techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3aSynechococcus elongatus 3aThermococcus 3aasymmetry 3acations 3achlorophyll 3adensity functional theory 3aphotosynthetic reaction centers1 aEschenbach, Patrick1 aNeugebauer, Johannes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8923-46840 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 May 25, v. 124, no. 24 p.4873-4888dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c028273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03804naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011000163300001800273520214300291592002802434650000802462650001202470650001002482650002302492650001402515650002402529650001902553650002002572650001402592650000902606650002102615650001402636650001402650650003502664650001502699650001902714650002402733650002502757653000902782653002202791653001602813653002202829653002602851653002302877700001502900700002102915700001802936700001602954700001502970700001302985700001302998773011103011856008303122852000903205655001203214IND60731410620221121063559.0211030e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073141062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2021.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yun10aInteraction between APOE ε4 and dietary protein intake on cognitive decline: A longitudinal cohort study  ap. 2716-2725.  aTo exam the association of cognitive decline with APOE ε4 allele carriage and dietary protein intake and investigate whether there is a gene-diet (GxD) interaction of APOE ε4 allele carriage and dietary protein intake on cognitive decline in a nationwide cohort of older adults.A cohort study of participants from Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey was conducted from 2008 to 2014. A total of 3029 participants (mean age of 77.0 years, SD = 9.0; 49.3% were women) was enrolled. We genotyped APOE ε4 allele for each participant and calculated the diversity of dietary protein intake (DDPI) by summing up the frequency of intake of the 6 protein-rich foods (meats, fish, eggs, nuts, dairy products, and bean products). We assessed cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We used ordinal regression model to estimate the independent and joint effects of APOE ε4 carrier and dietary protein intake on cognitive decline, adjusting for potential confounders of age, sex, education, socio-economic status, lifestyles, BMI, and cardiometabolic conditions.There was significant association between carrying APOE ε4 allele and faster cognitive decline (Odds ratio: 1.19, 95% CI = 1.00–1.42), independent of potential confounders. While the associations of DDPI and the intake of 6 protein-rich foods with cognitive decline did not reach any statistical significance. We observed significant interactions of APOE ε4 with DDPI and fish intake, at multiple correction-adjusted Ps < 0.05. In those who were APOE ε4 carriers rather than non-carriers, both high DDPI (OR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34–0.88) and daily fish intake (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.22–0.78) were significantly associated with slower cognitive decline, respectively. We also found that frequent intake of fish benefits women more than men regarding the mitigating of cognitive decline among APOE ε4 allele carriers (P for interaction = 0.016).The results of this study support the hypothesis that diversified protein food intake in addition to frequent fish intake may reduce the detrimental effect of APOE ε4 on cognitive health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3aalleles 3abeans 3aclinical nutrition 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3acohort studies 3adietary protein 3aeducation 3afish 3afish consumption 3afrequency 3alongevity 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aodds ratio 3aprotein intake 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomic status 0aAPOE 0aProtein-rich diet 0aFish intake 0aCognitive decline 0aGene-diet interaction 0aGender differences1 aJin, Xurui1 aLutz, Michael W.1 aJu, Sang-Yhun1 aLiu, Keyang1 aGuo, Guang1 aZeng, Yi1 aYao, Yao0 tClinical nutrition.g2021 May, v. 40, no. 5 p.2716-2725dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2021.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04324naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245010000164520237300264592002802637650002502665650002302690650001802713650003102731650001602762650001202778650002302790650001002813650001802823650001802841650003702859650000902896650001002905650001402915650001902929650001702948650001502965650002102980650000903001650001103010650003103021650001403052650001603066650001703082650002103099650002503120651001003145651001003155651002103165653002903186653001603215653001603231653003003247653001003277653002503287653001503312700002003327700001803347700001803365700001803383700001803401773011603419856008203535852000903617655001203626IND60639407420221118043900.0211206e20190715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063940742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2019.1119152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jin-Ryul10aAntitussive, expectorant, and anti-inflammatory effects of Adenophorae Radix powder in ICR mice  aAdenophora triphylla var. japonica is frequently used as an oriental medicinal plant in Korea, China, and Japan for its anti-inflammatory, antitussive, and hepatoprotective effects.In the present study, the antitussive, expectorant, and anti-inflammatory effects of AR powder were investigated using animal models to evaluate their potential to treat respiratory disorders.AR powder was administered orally to mice once daily for 11 days, at dose levels of 400, 200, and 100 mg/kg. Theobromine (TB), ambroxol (AM) and dexamethasone (DEXA) were used as standard drugs for antitussive effects, expectorant effects and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. Evaluations of antitussive effects were based on changes in body weight, the number of cough responses and the histopathology of the lung and trachea. Expectorant effects were based on changes in the body weight, macroscopic observations of body surface redness, the mucous secretion of the trachea and histopathology of lung (secondary bronchus). Anti-inflammatory effects were based on changes in the body weight, macroscopic observations involving redness and edema of the treated ear, absolute and relative ear weights and histopathology of the treated ears.Allergic acute inflammation and coughing induced by exposure to NH₄OH and symptoms of xylene-induced contact dermatitis were significantly inhibited by treatment with AR powder in a dose-dependent manner. Histological analyses revealed that AR powder decreased the OD values in trachea lavage fluid, reduced body surface redness, thicknesses of intrapulmonary secondary bronchus mucosa, and the number of PAS-positive mucous producing cells. Overall, AR powder administered at 200 mg/kg displayed superior antitussive and expectorant effects as compared to TB (50 mg/kg), and AM (250 mg/kg). At the highest concentration (400 mg/kg) AR powder displayed only moderately improved anti-inflammatory activities as compared to DEXA (1 mg/kg).The results obtained in this study suggest that AR powder exerts dose-dependent, favorable antitussive, expectorant, and anti-inflammatory activities achieved through modulation of the activity of mast cells and respiratory mucous production. Therefore, AR powder may serve as a therapeutic agent in various respiratory disorders, especially those that occur as a result of environmental toxicants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenophora triphylla 3aammonium hydroxide 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abody weight 3abronchi 3acontact dermatitis 3acough 3adexamethasone 3adose response 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3aears 3aedema 3ahistology 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3amast cells 3amedicinal plants 3amice 3amucosa 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asecretion 3atheobromine 3atherapeutics 3atoxic substances 3atraditional medicine 3aChina 3aJapan 3aKorean Peninsula 0aAdenophorae radix powder 0aAntitussive 0aExpectorant 0aAnti-inflammatory effects 0aMouse 0aPeriodic acid schiff 0aMast cells1 aJung, Chul-Jong1 aKu, Seong-Min1 aJung, Dae-Hwa1 aKu, Sae-Kwang1 aChoi, Jae-Suk0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2019 July 15, v. 239 p.111915-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1119153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03873naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172072000900181072000900190100002300199245011900222300001800341500002400359500001500383520170000398650002702098650001502125650002502140650001402165650002302179650001802202650002702220650002002247650002902267650001302296650001902309650001102328650001702339650001902356650001502375650002002390650002002410650001102430650002302441650002402464650001202488650004702500650003702547650003802584650001402622650002202636650002202658650003302680650004102713653001702754700002002771700001802791700001902809700001902828773012502847852000902972856007502981930003303056945002503089946001303114655001203127IND4441148220221116192553.0100813e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444114822DNAL7 a208577592pmid7 a10.1603/EC093622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF200 0aF600 0aL300 0aL0011 aMagalhães, S.T.V.10aLeaf Alkaloids, Phenolics, and Coffee Resistance to the Leaf Miner Leucoptera coffeella (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae)  ap. 1438-1443.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCoffee (Coffea spp.) alkaloids (caffeine and related methylxanthines) and phenolics (caffeic and chlorogenic acids) have recognized pestistatic/pesticidal activity and mediate insect-plant interactions. The present investigation assessed the resistance of 12 coffee genotypes to the leaf miner Leucoptera (=Perileucoptera) coffeella (Guérin-Méneville & Perrottet) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae) and correlated such results with the leaf content of coffee alkaloids and phenolics that probably play a role in the interaction between coffee and this leaf miner. The levels of chlorogenic and caffeic acid, caffeine, and related methylxanthines were measured and quantified in leaf extracts of these genotypes before and 7 d after their infestation by the leaf miner. Some coffee genotypes (Coffea canephora L. and Coffea racemosa Lour. and its hybrids with Coffea arabica L.) exhibited high pesticidal activity (100% mortality) toward the L. coffeella, indicating their antibiosis resistance. However, there was no correlation between this activity and the leaf levels of coffee alkaloids and phenolics. Curiously, infestation by L. coffeella leads to a nearly four-fold decline in the leaf levels of chlorogenic acid, which does not affect this pest species but may affect other generalist species. Indeed, chlorogenic acid sprayed on coffee leaves stimulated locomotory activity of the green scale Coccus viridis (Green) (Hemiptera: Coccidae), thus minimizing their feeding in contrast with the absence of this polyphenol. Therefore, reduction of chlorogenic acid levels in coffee leaves due to leaf miner infestation seems to also favor infestation by generalist insects, such as the green scale. 3achemical concentration 3aantibiosis 3aantifeeding activity 3aalkaloids 3ainsect development 3ascale insects 3aplant-insect relations 3arisk assessment 3aPerileucoptera coffeella 3agenotype 3aCoccus viridis 3aCoffea 3acoffee beans 3ainsect control 3aleafminers 3apest resistance 3aadverse effects 3aleaves 3aphenolic compounds 2aAlkaloidsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aChlorogenic Acidxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCoffeexchemistryxparasitology. 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHemiptera 2aMothsxphysiology 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPlant Diseasesxparasitology 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxmetabolism. 0ainsect pests1 aFernandes, F.L.1 aDemuner, A.J.1 aPicanço, M.C.1 aGuedes, R.N.C.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2010 Aug., v. 103, no. 4 p.1438-1443dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EC093623Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/09/30  aOther US 7aarticle02839naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011400165300001800279500001900297520168900316592002802005650002202033650002702055650001002082650001902092650000902111650002102120650001902141650001502160650001302175700001802188700002002206700001702226700001802243773013502261856004802396852000902444655001202453IND6036682620221119053914.0130319e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603668262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-012-0810-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Tejal M.10aComparative performance of flat sheet and spiral wound modules in the nanofiltration of reactive dye solution  ap. 2994-3004.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Besides the opportunities for reuse, stringent regulations and growing public awareness demand an enhanced quality of effluent from dye industries. Treatment of an aqueous solution of dye (reactive red 198) was carried out in a nanofiltration unit using both flat sheet and spiral wound modules to obtain a comparative performance evaluation in terms of permeate flux and quality. METHODS: Hydrophilized polyamide membrane with molecular weight cutoff of 150 was used for the experiments. Effects of trans-membrane pressure (TMP), feed concentration and addition of salt on permeate flux were investigated. Percent reduction of color, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solid (TDS), and conductivity were determined to assess performance of the membrane. RESULTS: The maximum flux decline was 16.1% of its initial value at 490 kPa TMP with 50 ppm feed concentration in spiral wound module, whereas the same in flat sheet under same conditions was 7.2%. The effect of TMP showed a quasi-linear increase in flux with increasing pressure. Increased permeate concentration led to the reduction in observed retention of dye in the membrane. The average reduction in color, COD, and TDS were 96.88%, 97.38%, and 89.24%, respectively. The decline in permeate flux was more in case of spiral wound module compared to flat sheet. However, spiral wound module performed better in terms of color removal, COD reduction, and TDS removal. CONCLUSION: Substantial removal of color was achieved in the nanofiltration experiments with a marked reduction in COD and TDS. The process allowed the production of permeate stream with great reutilization possibilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical oxygen demand 3acolor 3adecolorization 3adyes 3amolecular weight 3ananofiltration 3apolyamides 3aresearch1 aChheda, Harsh1 aBaheti, Abhisek1 aPatel, Punit1 aNath, Kaushik0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2012 Aug., v. 19, no. 7 p.2994-3004dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-0810-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011200164300001100276520195400287592002802241596005502269650001602324650000902340650002302349650001502372650001502387650001902402650001802421650002202439650002002461651001102481700002202492700002002514773012602534856008202660852000902742655001202751IND60577615520221122060508.0180904e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057761552DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-017-0436-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeudou, Jean10aCultural and territorial vitality services play a key role in livestock agroecological transition in France  ap. 36.  aIn France, researchers and public policy makers are calling for the agroecological transition of livestock. This transition is facing technical, economic, social, and cultural obstacles. Whereas technical obstacles are extensively studied, other categories remain little studied despite their potential role in agroecological transition of livestock. This article aims to analyze the livestock cultural and territorial vitality (dis)services perceived by local actors on two distinct French territories and to understand how these services could act as levers for the agroecological transition of livestock. To do so, we interviewed 45 local actors from the livestock sector and local rural development in two French territories: Aubrac (24) and Pays de Rennes (21). We conducted inductive content analyses to draw on interviewees’ perceptions and link the cultural and territorial vitality services identified to the agroecological transition of livestock. Our work revealed 20 cultural and territorial vitality services that can be organized into 11 categories (7 categories of cultural services and 4 categories of territorial vitality services). Among the 11 cultural services, cultural landscapes linked to livestock and gastronomy heritage were the most cited. Among the nine territorial vitality services, the contribution to social bonds on the territories was the most cited. Here, we showed for the first time that the prioritization of cultural and territorial vitality services were different between the territories studied. Emblematic cow breed, food know-how, and quality products were more important in Aubrac, whereas territorial vitality services such as on-farm jobs and social bonds linked to livestock were more cited in the Pays de Rennes. Such methodological approach allowed us to highlight and prioritize the different cultural and vitality services, which need to be supported by public policy and translated into action.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-13-AGRO-0006cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aagroecology 3acows 3acultural landscape 3aemployment 3agastronomy 3aprioritization 3apublic policy 3arural development 3asocial cohesion 3aFrance1 aMartin, Guillaume1 aRyschawy, Julie0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2017 Aug., v. 37, no. 4 p.36-36dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl33129x1774-07467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-017-0436-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007300156300001800229500001100247520173200258592002801990596009002018596005902108596012602167650001602293650002502309650001402334650001302348650001202361650001502373650002102388650001902409650002202428650002802450650001102478650001602489650001702505700001802522700001702540700001602557700001602573700001602589700001802605700005802623773015102681856007402832852000902906655001202915IND60749849520221120233121.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074984952DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.113302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Zhidong10aResearch progress on the response of tea catechins to drought stress  ap. 5305-5313.  aREVIEW  aDrought stress (DS) is the most important abiotic stress affecting yield and quality of tea worldwide. DS causes oxidative stress to cells due to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As non‐enzymatic antioxidants, tea catechins can scavenge excess ROS in response to DS. Further, catechin accumulation contributes to the formation of oxidative polymerization products (e.g. theaflavins and thearubigins) that improve the quality of black tea. However, there are no systematic reports on the response of tea catechins to DS. First, we reviewed the available literature on the response of tea plants to DS. Second, we summarized the current knowledge of ROS production in tea leaves under DS and typical antioxidant response mechanisms. Third, we conducted a detailed review of the changes in catechin levels in tea under different drought conditions. We found that the total amounts of catechin and o‐quinone increased under DS conditions. We propose that the possible mechanisms underlying tea catechin accumulation under DS conditions include (i) autotrophic formation of o‐quinone, (ii) polymerization of proanthocyanidins that directly scavenge excess ROS, and (iii) formation of metal ion complexes and by influencing the antioxidant systems that indirectly eliminate excess ROS. Finally, we discuss ways of potentially improving black tea quality using drought before picking in the summer/fall dry season. In summary, we mainly discuss the antioxidant mechanisms of tea catechins under DS and the possibility of using drought to improve black tea quality. Our review provides a theoretical basis for the production of high‐quality black tea under DS conditions. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019XF5041cCentral Committee Guides Local Science and Technology Development Program  a31271789cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a(2019)105cthe Special Project for the Construction of Modern Agricultural Industrial Technology System in Hunan Province 3aagriculture 3aantioxidant activity 3ablack tea 3acatechin 3adrought 3adry season 3aoxidative stress 3apolymerization 3aproanthocyanidins 3areactive oxygen species 3asummer 3atheaflavins 3awater stress1 aZhang, Chenyu1 aShao, Chenyu1 aLiu, Baogui1 aLiu, Enshuo1 aYuan, Danni1 aZhou, Yuebing1 aShen, Chengwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9107-51790 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Oct., v. 101, no. 13 p.5305-5313dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.113303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003100144245006200175300001600237520148400253536036301737592002802100653003102128653002702159653002202186653001002208700001702218700001802235700002202253700002102275773009802296856007902394852000902473655001202482IND60713602820221118001652.0201023e20190726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071360282DNAL7 a10.1556/019.70.2019.202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIotchev, Ivaylo Borislavov10aEncounters between pairs of unfamiliar dogs in a dog park  ap. 156-165.  aThe aim of this study was to explore spontaneous social interactions between dyads of unfamiliar adult dogs. Although intraspecific encounters are frequent events in the life of pet dogs, the factors that might influence encounters, such as sex, dyad composition, reproductive status, age, and state of cohabitation (keeping the dogs singly or in groups), remained unexplored. In this study, we assigned unfamiliar, non-aggressive dogs to three types of dyads defined by sex and size. We observed their unrestrained, spontaneous behaviors in an unfamiliar dog park, where only the two dogs, the owners, and experimenter were present. We found that the dogs, on average, spent only 17% of the time (less than 1 min) in proximity. Sex, dyad composition, reproductive status, and age influenced different aspects of the interactions in dyads. Female dogs were more likely to initiate the first contact in their dyad but later approached the partner less frequently, were less likely to move apart, and displayed less scent marking. Following and moving apart were more frequent in male–male interactions. Neutered dogs spent more time following the other dog and sniffed other dogs more frequently. The time companion dogs spent in proximity and number of approaches decreased with age. The study provides guidance for dog owners about the outcomes of intraspecific encounters based on the dog’s age, sex, and reproductive status, as well as the sex of the interacting partner.  aFunding Statement: This research was funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant agreement no. 680040), the János Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and the ÚNKP-18-4 New National Excellence Program of the Ministry of Human Capacities for EK.  aPublisher supplied data 0aintraspecific interactions 0aspontaneous encounters 0asexual dimorphism 0aaging1 aEgerer, Anna1 aGrafe, Serena1 aAdorján, András1 aKubinyi, Enikő,0 tBiologia futura.g, v. 70, no. 2 p.156-165dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:27396x2676-86077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1556/019.70.2019.203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001500158245010700173300001600280520113000296592002801426650001401454650002701468650002501495650002101520650000901541650001501550650000801565650002101573650001301594650001001607650001901617650001601636650002501652650004401677773012201721856007301843852000901916655001201925IND60080456220221119010201.0150206e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008045622DNAL7 a248892062pmid7 a10.1111/rda.123392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAramli, MS10aATP Content, Oxidative Stress and Motility of Beluga (Huso huso) Semen: Effect of Short‐Term Storage  ap. 636-640.  aAn effective technique for short‐term storage of semen is essential when processing multiple sperm samples and when semen must be transported from collection sites to hatcheries for the fertilization of ova or to laboratories for cryopreservation. In this experiment, beluga (Huso huso) sperm were used to evaluate the effects of short‐term storage on several quality parameters (i.e. motility, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and oxidative stress indices). Sperm cells exhibited > 50% motility during 3 days of storage with an average total duration of sperm motility varying from 13.33 ± 5.77 to 278.33 ± 25.65 s, and no motile spermatozoa were recorded after 9 days of storage. The levels of oxidative stress indices (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and carbonyl derivatives of proteins) and antioxidant activity (superoxide dismutase) increased significantly after 3 days of storage. The ATP content also decreased significantly after 2 days of storage. The results of this study can be used to develop effective reproduction management and cryopreservation protocols for this endangered fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuso huso 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aantioxidant activity 3acryopreservation 3afish 3ahatcheries 3aova 3aoxidative stress 3aproteins 3asemen 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2014 Aug., v. 49, no. 4 p.636-640dP.

The observation shows that there are scales arranged like overlapping tiles on the surface of the moth wings. The shapes of the scales are different between species. They overlap horizontally and there is particular space vertically in the direction of the wing veins. The surface of the scale is structured by micron-class grooves and nanometer-class vertical gibbosities. The biomaterial components of the moth wing scale are mostly made up of protein, lipids and chitin. The observation also shows that the contact angle for wings with scales is in the range from 144.8Â° to 152.9Â°, while that for those without scales is from 90.0Â° to 115.9Â°. It indicates that the surfaces of the wings with scales are more hydrophobic. According as Cassie model, the equation of wettability on the NOCTUIDAE moth wing surface is established and the hydrophobic mechanism is analyzed. It is concluded that the hydrophobicity of the moth wings is induced by the multivariate coupling of the shape, structures and biomaterial of the scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aNoctuidae 3acontact angle 3ahydrophobicity 3alipids 3amodels 3amoths 3awettability 3awings 3aChina1 aCong, Qian1 aZhang, Jianjun,1 aWan, YanLing0 tChinese science bulletin.g2009 Feb., v. 54, no. 4 p.569-575dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-009-0071-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245012100211300001100332500001500343506007600358520167900434592002802113506003702141650001402178650001802192650001002210650001602220650002002236650001902256650001402275650002502289650001402314650001602328650001702344650001702361650001802378651001502396653001002411700002302421700002002444700001402464700001502478700002602493773011602519856008202635852000902717655001202726IND60577615720221207133115.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057761572DNAL7 a10.1186/s40529-017-0187-52doi7 aPMC55487062pmcid7 a287916612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendon, JonathanP.10aCollecting near mature and immature orchid seeds for ex situ conservation: ‘in vitro collecting’ as a case study  ap. 34.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Lack of phenological information and efficient collecting methods are considered impediments for orchid seed collecting. This leads to opportunistic collecting as part of general seed collecting schedules that may last few weeks especially in remote areas. The study explored the feasibility of collecting near mature and immature seeds to support conservation action plans. Mature, near mature and immature seeds of orchids were collected from the wild in the Central Highlands of Madagascar (CHM). Seed capsules were collected in sterile culture medium in the wild, to prevent deterioration of seeds inside the capsule after collecting, later to be cultured under laboratory conditions. RESULTS: Seed capsules collected by the in vitro collecting (IVC) method were kept in very good condition for up to 4 weeks before germination under in vitro conditions. Significantly faster and higher germination rate (p < 0.001) than mature seeds was observed in a number of taxa collected during a 3 year-long study. In some taxa even immature seeds, with no apparent sign of testa covering the embryo, germinated following IVC where mature seeds failed to germinate. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that IVC method has potential to complement conventional seed collecting by increasing the germplasm that can be used in integrated conservation action plans. Improvements can be made in developing collections for taxa from biodiversity hotspots and remote areas where collecting requires considerable resources. This method can further be used on a wider selection of plants from different geographic areas and on embryo rescue programmes for economically important plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agermplasm 3aovule culture 3atesta 3agermination 3aseed collecting 3aaxenic culture 3aphenology 3aex situ conservation 3ahighlands 3aOrchidaceae 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3aculture media 3aMadagascar 0aseeds1 aRajaovelona, Landy1 aSandford, Helen1 aFang, Rui1 aBell, Jake1 aSarasan, Viswambharan0 tBotanical studies.g2017 Dec., v. 58, no. 1 p.34-34dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22891x1999-31107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-017-0187-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03994naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015200170300001600322520198900338592002802327650002102355650003102376650003302407650001502440650002302455650001102478650001302489650001602502650001902518650001302537650002002550650002102570650001802591650001102609650001502620650001102635650002002646650001302666650001502679650001602694650001802710650001102728650001302739650001202752650001202764651001202776653001602788653001902804653001202823653001802835653001302853653001602866700002002882700001602902700001702918700001502935700001802950700001502968700001502983700001702998700001803015700001903033773012303052856008803175852000903263655001203272IND60580998620221120023515.0201111e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058099862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.08.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, A.V.10aEffects of agricultural land use on fluvial carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide concentrations in a large European river, the Meuse (Belgium)  ap. 342-355.  aWe report a data-set of CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O concentrations in the surface waters of the Meuse river network in Belgium, obtained during four surveys covering 50 stations (summer 2013 and late winter 2013, 2014 and 2015), from yearly cycles in four rivers of variable size and catchment land cover, and from 111 groundwater samples. Surface waters of the Meuse river network were over-saturated in CO₂, CH₄, N₂O with respect to atmospheric equilibrium, acting as sources of these greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, although the dissolved gases also showed marked seasonal and spatial variations. Seasonal variations were related to changes in freshwater discharge following the hydrological cycle, with highest concentrations of CO₂, CH₄, N₂O during low water owing to a longer water residence time and lower currents (i.e. lower gas transfer velocities), both contributing to the accumulation of gases in the water column, combined with higher temperatures favourable to microbial processes. Inter-annual differences of discharge also led to differences in CH₄ and N₂O that were higher in years with prolonged low water periods. Spatial variations were mostly due to differences in land cover over the catchments, with systems dominated by agriculture (croplands and pastures) having higher CO₂, CH₄, N₂O levels than forested systems. This seemed to be related to higher levels of dissolved and particulate organic matter, as well as dissolved inorganic nitrogen in agriculture dominated systems compared to forested ones. Groundwater had very low CH₄ concentrations in the shallow and unconfined aquifers (mostly fractured limestones) of the Meuse basin, hence, should not contribute significantly to the high CH₄ levels in surface riverine waters. Owing to high dissolved concentrations, groundwater could potentially transfer important quantities of CO₂ and N₂O to surface waters of the Meuse basin, although this hypothesis remains to be tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3agreenhouse gases 3aparticulate organic matter 3adissolved inorganic nitrogen 3awatersheds 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aland use 3agroundwater 3acarbon dioxide 3apastures 3adata collection 3ahydrologic cycle 3asurface water 3abasins 3afreshwater 3awinter 3adissolved gases 3aaquifers 3aland cover 3atemperature 3anitrous oxide 3arivers 3acropland 3asurveys 3amethane 3aBelgium 0aMeuse river 0aCarbon dioxide 0aMethane 0aNitrous oxide 0aLand use 0aAgriculture1 aDarchambeau, F.1 aLambert, T.1 aBouillon, S.1 aMorana, C.1 aBrouyère, S.1 aHakoun, V.1 aJurado, A.1 aTseng, H.-C.1 aDescy, J.

The removal of TC by biofilm coupled with UCPs-TiO₂ under visible light reached 82%, which was 35% higher than that in treatment using only the biofilm. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) promoted the production of hydroxyl radicals by UCPs-TiO₂, as the EPS acted as an electron transfer medium and accelerated the TC mineralization. Biofilm in the coupled system tolerated TC stress by regulating its antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) and superoxidedismutase (SOD), and allowed it to maintain stable and efficient removal of TC. This study documents a method to couple a hybrid material with microbial aggregates, creating a promising system for removing refractory organics, such as TC, from water. The study also offers insight into the mechanisms underlying TC removal by microbial aggregates combined with new functional materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3aelectron transfer 3alight 3amineralization 3apolymers 3atechnology 3atetracycline 0aTetracycline degradation 0aUpconversion phosphors 0aHybrid material 0aHydroxyl radicals1 aFan, Hua1 aKeung Wong, Po1 aWu, Yonghong1 aRittmann, Bruce0 tBioresource technology.g2021 Mar., v. 323 p.124638-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1246383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03683naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016000168300001400328520217600342592002802518650002702546650002302573650000902596650001602605650001402621650000902635650001802644650001002662650001902672650000902691650001302700650002102713650001102734650000702745650001302752650001602765650001902781653002702800653002102827653002702848653001802875653001602893700002302909700002202932700002202954773009302976856008703069852000903156655001203165IND60531449720221120210847.0190408e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053144972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaka, Maria10aDynamics of Listeria monocytogenes at suboptimal temperatures in/on fish-protein based model systems: Effect of (micro)structure and microbial distribution  ap. 43-50.  aFood (micro)structure is known to influence microbial dynamics to a large extent. However, the effect of this factor is difficult to isolate from physicochemical and compositional aspects of the food products. So far, studies focused on the investigation of the effect of food (micro)structure by comparing planktonic growth in liquid (microbiological) media with colonial growth in/on solid-like systems or on real food surfaces. In practice, however, foods are not only liquids or solids; they can also be emulsions or gelled emulsions with complex compositional and physicochemical characteristics.In this study, Listeria monocytogenes growth dynamics were studied along the whole spectrum of food (micro)structure, in terms of food (model) systems with variable (micro)structural complexity, composition and physicochemical characteristics. The targeted (micro)structures were: liquids and emulsions which were homogeneously inoculated and aqueous gels and gelled emulsions which were surface inoculated. The composition of the gelled emulsion targeted fish patés. The other model systems were developed in order to exhibit characteristics of the targeted food (micro)structures and therefore varied in compositional aspects. The main compositional difference was due to the presence or absence of fat, and to a lesser extent the gelling agents (agar and guar gum) and emulsifiers. All systems were incubated at 4, 8 and 12 °C, at aerobic conditions. Physicochemical aspects (pH and water activity (aw) of the model systems were measured.Results indicated that L. monocytogenes grows faster in colonies on solid surfaces and slower in liquid systems planktonically. At low temperatures (4 °C), emulsion systems (with fat presence) exhibited a cryoprotective effect and favoured L. monocytogenes growth as compared to liquids, where fat was absent. In contrast, at 8 and 12 °C, fat presence inhibited microbial growth, by replacing available space from the water phase which favours microbial growth. Therefore, a complex relation among temperature, compositional and (micro)structural aspects has been observed in this study, requiring further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aaerobic conditions 3aagar 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsions 3afish 3afood surfaces 3afoods 3agelling agents 3agels 3aguar gum 3amicrobial growth 3amodels 3apH 3aplankton 3atemperature 3awater activity 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aMicrobial growth 0aFood intrinsic factors 0aModel systems 0aFish patés1 aVercruyssen, Stijn1 aCornette, Nicolas1 aImpe, Jan F. van,0 tFood control.g2017 Mar., v. 73 p.43-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245010700205300001800312506007600330520179100406592002802197506003702225650001302262650002402275650004202299650001202341650001502353650001102368650002602379650001002405650001002415650001502425650001502440650002102455650001202476650001502488650001902503650003002522650000802552650001702560650001002577700002202587700002102609700001802630700001902648700002502667700002002692700002302712773013102735856007702866852000902943655001202952IND60132428320221207124318.0150505e20141031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013242832DNAL7 a10.1128/mBio.01527-142doi7 aPMC41737812pmcid7 a252050952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoulanger, Alice14aThe Plant Pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris Exploits N-Acetylglucosamine during Infection  ap. e01527-14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aN -Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), the main component of chitin and a major constituent of bacterial peptidoglycan, is present only in trace amounts in plants, in contrast to the huge amount of various sugars that compose the polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Thus, GlcNAc has not previously been considered a substrate exploited by phytopathogenic bacteria during plant infection. Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris , the causal agent of black rot disease of Brassica plants, expresses a carbohydrate utilization system devoted to GlcNAc exploitation. In addition to genes involved in GlcNAc catabolism, this system codes for four TonB-dependent outer membrane transporters (TBDTs) and eight glycoside hydrolases. Expression of all these genes is under the control of GlcNAc. In vitro experiments showed that X. campestris pv. campestris exploits chitooligosaccharides, and there is indirect evidence that during the early stationary phase, X. campestris pv. campestris recycles bacterium-derived peptidoglycan/muropeptides. Results obtained also suggest that during plant infection and during growth in cabbage xylem sap, X. campestris pv. campestris encounters and metabolizes plant-derived GlcNAc-containing molecules. Specific TBDTs seem to be preferentially involved in the consumption of all these plant-, fungus- and bacterium-derived GlcNAc-containing molecules. This is the first evidence of GlcNAc consumption during infection by a phytopathogenic bacterium. Interestingly, N -glycans from plant N -glycosylated proteins are proposed to be substrates for glycoside hydrolases belonging to the X. campestris pv. campestris GlcNAc exploitation system. This observation extends the range of sources of GlcNAc metabolized by phytopathogenic bacteria during their life cycle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3aXanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 3acabbage 3acell walls 3achitin 3achitooligosaccharides 3afungi 3agenes 3aglycosides 3ahydrolases 3ain vitro studies 3ainsects 3ametabolism 3apeptidoglycans 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3asap 3atransporters 3axylem1 aZischek, Claudine1 aLautier, Martine1 aJamet, Stevie1 aRival, Pauline1 aCarrère, Sébastien1 aArlat, Matthieu1 aLauber, Emmanuelle0 tmBio.g2014 Oct. 31, v. 5, no. 5 p.e01527-14-e01527-14dAmerican Society for MicrobiologywJournal:J000001381x2150-75117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01527-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245013300158520124700291592002801538650002201566650002001588650001701608650001001625650002201635650001901657650001101676650002301687650001401710650002001724650001201744650001201756651001001768651001501778700001301793700001701806700002001823700001501843700001601858700001701874700002001891700001801911700001701929700001901946700001401965700001701979700001801996700001402014700001602028700001702044773012202061856007402183852000902257655001202266IND60760886320221120153827.0211223e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076088632DNAL7 a10.3390/v131225242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Dongchang 10aSpatiotemporal Associations and Molecular Evolution of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A H7N9 Virus in China from 2017 to 2021  aHighly pathogenic (HP) H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) emerged in China in 2016. HP H7N9 AIV caused at least 33 human infections and has been circulating in poultry farms continuously since wave 5. The genetic divergence, geographic patterns, and hemagglutinin adaptive and parallel molecular evolution of HP H7N9 AIV in China since 2017 are still unclear. Here, 10 new strains of HP H7N9 AIVs from October 2019 to April 2021 were sequenced. We found that HP H7N9 was primarily circulating in Northern China, particularly in the provinces surrounding the Bohai Sea (Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong) since wave 6. Of note, HP H7N9 AIV phylogenies exhibit a geographical structure compatible with high levels of local transmission after unidirectional rapid geographical expansion towards the north of China in 2017. In addition, we showed that two major subclades were continually expanding with the viral population size undergoing a sharp increase after 2018 with an obvious seasonal tendency. Notably, the hemagglutinin gene showed signs of parallel evolution and positive selection. Our research sheds light on the current epidemiology, evolution, and diversity of HP H7N9 AIV that can help prevent and control the spreading of HP H7N9 AIV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aavian influenza 3aepidemiology 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3aparallel evolution 3aphylogeny 3apopulation size 3apoultry 3aviruses 3aChina 3aYellow Sea1 aGu, Min 1 aWang, Xiyue 1 aWang, Xiaoquan 1 aLi, Gairu 1 aYan, Yayao 1 aGu, Jinyuan 1 aZhan, Tiansong 1 aWu, Huiguang 1 aHao, Xiaoli 1 aWang, Guoqing 1 aHu, Jiao 1 aHu, Shunlin 1 aLiu, Xiaowen 1 aSu, Shuo 1 aDing, Chan 1 aLiu, Xiufan 0 tViruses.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131225243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245014800175300001400323520149000337592002801827650002801855650002201883650002201905650000901927650001001936650001201946650002301958650002501981650001002006650001802016650001102034650001502045650001202060650000702072650001602079650001902095653003302114653002602147653002202173653001202195653001602207700001802223700002502241700002002266773009302286856008702379852000902466655001202475IND60531449820221120210850.0190408e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053144982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.06.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsironi, Theofania10aDeveloping suitable smart TTI labels to match specific monitoring requirements: The case of Vibrio spp. growth during transportation of oysters  ap. 51-56.  aTime-temperature control is a critical issue in food logistics and the effective tracking of cold chain conditions is one of the main points to be addressed. There is a need for development and standardization of labels with a flexible range of temperature sensitivity, expressed by activation energy and of response time. Time Temperature Integrators (TTI) are inexpensive, active smart labels that show the time-temperature history of the food product to which they are attached. Enzymatic TTIs are based on a pH decrease resulting from the temperature-dependent enzymatic hydrolysis of a lipid substrate. The colour change of a pH indicator in the solution can be visually assessed or measured instrumentally. The considerations that allow for targeted design of the response characteristics of this type of TTI are the concentration of the enzyme and choice of substrate. This study applied predictive models for growth of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VP) and Vibrio vulnificus (VV) growth in oysters and used the information from that work to design enzymatic TTI smart labels with response kinetics suitable for indicating the growth potential of Vibrio spp. during the transportation of oysters from harvest to storage for further distribution and sale. The results of the study indicated that the VV- and VP-TTIs developed in this study may be an effective and cost-effective tool for validating improved handling and cooling procedures and for monitoring the transport of oysters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aactivation energy 3acold 3acolor 3acooling 3acost effectiveness 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afoods 3agrowth models 3alipids 3amonitoring 3aoysters 3apH 3atemperature 3atransportation 0aTime temperature integrators 0aCold chain management 0aKinetic modelling 0aSeafood 0aVibrio spp.1 aRonnow, Peter1 aGiannoglou, Marianna1 aTaoukis, Petros0 tFood control.g2017 Mar., v. 73 p.51-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.06.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02052naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008400155520109200239592002801331650001901359650001901378650001501397650001601412651001701428700001401445700001901459700001401478700001601492700001501508773012001523856007401643852000901717655001201726IND60653440620221116161516.0190714e20181025xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065344062DNAL7 a10.3390/w101115162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTa, Zhijie 10aAssessment of Precipitation Simulations in Central Asia by CMIP5 Climate Models  aThe Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) provides data, which is widely used to assess global and regional climate change. In this study, we evaluated the ability of 37 global climate models (GCMs) of CMIP5 to simulate historical precipitation in Central Asia (CA). The relative root mean square error (RRMSE), spatial correlation coefficient, and Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) were used as criteria for evaluation. The precipitation simulation results of GCMs were compared with the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) precipitation in 1986&ndash;2005. Most models show a variety of precipitation simulation capabilities both spatially and temporally, whereas the top six models were identified as having good performance in CA, including HadCM3, MIROC5, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-P, CMCC-CM, and CMCC-CMS. As the GCMs have large uncertainties in the prediction of future precipitation, it is difficult to find the best model to predict future precipitation in CA. Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) results can give a good simulation of precipitation, and are superior to individual models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aprediction 3auncertainty 3aCentral Asia1 aYu, Yang 1 aSun, Lingxiao 1 aChen, Xi 1 aMu, Guijin 1 aYu, Ruide 0 tWater.g2018 Oct. 25, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w101115163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245018400181300001400365520158500379592002801964650001901992650001902011650001702030650001002047650001402057650001602071650001202087650001102099650001202110650001502122650001502137650001102152650001402163650002002177650001602197650001402213650001402227650001502241651001102256653001602267653001702283653001502300653001702315653001402332653003202346700003402378700002302412700002902435700002302464700002802487700002602515700003302541773011502574856008602689852000902775655001202784IND60112593220221122003623.0190410e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011259322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2013.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLago-Vanzela, Ellen Silva10aChromatic characteristics and color-related phenolic composition of Brazilian young red wines made from the hybrid grape cultivar BRS Violeta (“BRS Rúbea”×“IAC 1398-21”)  ap. 33-43.  aThe color characteristics and the phenolic composition related to color of young red wines elaborated with the hybrid grape cultivar BRS Violeta, developed for its adaptation to sub-tropical climates in Brazil, have been studied. These wines are characterized with a deep red-purplish color, reaching color intensity averaging 24 units. In spite of being young red wines elaborated with short maceration time, their content in total polyphenols was very high (around 3692mg/L, as gallic acid equivalents), especially when compared to similar Vitis vinifera young red wines. Within polyphenols, anthocyanins predominated (around 2037mg/L, as malvidin 3,5-diglucoside equivalents) and they were almost exclusively anthocyanidin 3,5-glucosides (ca. 97%), mainly built from B-ring tri-substituted anthocyanidins (delphinidin>petunidin≈malvidin) and having high proportion of p-coumaroylated derivatives (ca. 28%) that confer higher stability. The content of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives was also remarkable (ca. 95mg/L, as caffeic acid equivalents) and unknown glucose derivatives of p-coumaric acid accounted for ca. 42% of total HCAD. Finally, these found flavonols were mainly based on myricetin whereas kaempferol derivatives were missing, their total content being within the ranges usually found for V. vinifera wines, but reaching their top values (ca. 91mg/L, as quercetin 3-glucoside equivalents). All the aforementioned data suggest that Violeta wine could be considered an important dietary source of healthy polyphenols with a moderate alcoholic content (ca. 11.6%).  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanidins 3acaffeic acid 3acolor 3acultivars 3agallic acid 3aglucose 3agrapes 3ahybrids 3akaempferol 3amaceration 3amalvin 3amyricetin 3ap-coumaric acid 3apolyphenols 3aquercetin 3ared wines 3asubtropics 3aBrazil 0aBRS Violeta 0aHybrid grape 0aWine color 0aAnthocyanins 0aFlavonols 0aHydroxycinnamic derivatives1 aRebello, Ligia Portugal Gomes1 aRamos, Afonso Mota1 aStringheta, Paulo César1 aSilva, Roberto da,1 aGarcía-Romero, Esteban1 aGómez-Alonso, Sergio1 aHermosín-Gutiérrez, Isidro0 tFood research international.g2013 Nov., v. 54, no. 1 p.33-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2013.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013600166300001600302520126000318592002801578650001401606650000801620650002001628650001701648650001901665650001701684650001401701650001901715650001301734650001301747650003301760650001301793700001101806700001501817700001701832700001601849700001301865773008201878856008301960990002302043852000902066655001202075IND60094616920221121055012.0141104e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009461692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2011.11.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Yadong10aEffect of spinning conditions on the structure and performance of hydrophobic PVDF hollow fiber membranes for membrane distillation  ap. 326-339.  aMicroporous hydrophobic poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) hollow fibers were prepared via dry-jet wet phase-inversion method using N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) as solvent, LiCl and PEG-400 as non-solvent additives in the polymer dopes. The effects of various preparation conditions, including the concentration of polymer and additives, bore liquid temperature, air gap, take-up speed and dope extrusion rate on the morphology and properties of membrane were studied. The prepared membranes were characterized through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, gas permeation measurement, and tensile property test. The permeate flux of membrane in both vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) and direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) for desalination was tested. It is found that the permeation property of membrane is mainly determined by membrane porosity, especially effective porosity. The formation of the sponge structure reduced VMD flux more fiercely than DCMD flux. Under the synergetic effect of PEG-400/LiCl, high permeate flux and relatively high mechanical strength of membrane can be simultaneously achieved. There exist the best ranges of bore liquid temperature and of air gap distance for relatively high permeate flux of membrane.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aair 3aair temperature 3adesalination 3adirect contact 3adistillation 3aextrusion 3ahydrophobicity 3apolymers 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspinning1 aLi, Na1 aLiu, Anjun1 aDing, Shukai1 aYi, Chunhai1 aLiu, Hao0 tDesalination.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 287 p.326-339dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2011.11.0453Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245021200204300001600416500001500432506007600447520179500523592002802318506003702346650001602383650002202399650001302421650002402434650002802458650001102486650001702497650001102514650001402525650001502539650001602554650001302570650002902583650002002612650002702632650001002659653002702669700002002696700002202716700001802738700002102756773013402777856008002911852000902991655001203000IND4468115320221207122300.0120419e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446811532DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.06385-112doi7 aPMC32729932pmcid7 a221564122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaccaferri, Simone10aPotential Probiotic Kluyveromyces marxianus B0399 Modulates the Immune Response in Caco-2 Cells and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and Impacts the Human Gut Microbiota in an In Vitro Colonic Model System  ap. 956-964.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aConsidering the increase in the consumption of yeasts as human probiotics, the aim of this study was to broadly investigate the beneficial properties of the lactic yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus (formerly Kluyveromyces fragilis) B0399. Several potential probiotic traits of K. marxianus B0399 were investigated by using in vitro assays, including adhesion and immune modulation, and the effect of the administration of 107 CFU/day of K. marxianus B0399 on the composition and metabolic activity of the human intestinal microbiota was investigated in a 3-stage continuous-culture system simulating the human colon. We demonstrated that this strain was highly adhesive to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells and modulated the immune response, inducing proinflammatory cytokines in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In the presence of inflammatory stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), K. marxianus B0399 provoked decreases in the levels of production of proinflammatory cytokines in PBMCs and Caco-2 cells, thus ameliorating the inflammatory response. Furthermore, K. marxianus B0399 impacted the colonic microbiota, increasing the bifidobacterial concentration in the stages of the colonic model system simulating the proximal and transverse colon. The amounts of the short-chain fatty acids acetate and propionate also increased following yeast supplementation. Finally, K. marxianus B0399 was found to induce a decrease of the cytotoxic potential of the culture supernatant from the first stage of the colonic model system. The effects of K. marxianus B0399 on adhesion, immune function, and colonic microbiota demonstrate that this strain possesses a number of beneficial and strain-specific properties desirable for a microorganism considered for application as a probiotic.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afatty acids 3asimulation models 3aacetates 3alipopolysaccharides 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3ahumans 3acytotoxicity 3ayeasts 3acytokines 3aprobiotics 3apropionates 3aadhesion 3aanthropogenic activities 3aimmune response 3amononuclear leukocytes 3acolon 0aKluyveromyces fragilis1 aKlinder, Annett1 aBrigidi, Patrizia1 aCavina, Piero1 aCostabile, Adele0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 78, no. 4 p.956-964dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.06385-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012100165300001600286520125000302592002801552650001901580650001101599650001501610650001601625650001801641650002401659650001501683650001101698650002201709650002101731650002001752650001801772650001301790650002601803650002101829650001601850650001201866650002101878653002601899653001601925653003001941653001501971653001801986653001202004700001802016773011702034856008602151852000902237655001202246IND60112593320221120041150.0190410e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011259332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2013.07.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiang10aIsolation and characterization of proteins and lipids from honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) queen larvae and royal jelly  ap. 330-337.  aHoneybee queen larvae (QL), the byproduct of royal jelly (RJ) production, have not been fully utilized as a food resource. Proteins in QL were characterized by gel electrophoresis and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of fatty acid and sterol composition in QL and RJ were performed. The molecular weight of proteins in QL was generally lower than those in RJ. QL were dominated by major royal jelly protein 1 (MRJP1) and MRJP2 as well as their degradation proteins. High amounts of triacylglycerols (797.5mg/g lipid) and phospholipids (89.8mg/g lipid) were presented in QL, whereas the main fatty acids in RJ were composed of free middle carbon chain fatty acids (>91%). Twelve sterols were identified and clerosterol, ∆7-sitosterol and cycloartenol were reported for the first time in QL. Noteworthy, little difference was observed in the sterol profiles of QL and RJ. Sterols were found to be integrated with MRJP1 oligomer in QL and RJ. This study provides new insight into the nutritional values of QL. The results suggest overall that proteins and lipids of QL compare favorably with those of RJ and could be potential used in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3acarbon 3adesorption 3afatty acids 3afood industry 3agel electrophoresis 3aionization 3alarvae 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3anutritive value 3aphospholipids 3aproteins 3aquantitative analysis 3aqueen honey bees 3aroyal jelly 3asterols 3atriacylglycerols 0aHoneybee queen larvae 0aRoyal jelly 0aMajor royal jelly protein 0aFatty acid 0aPhospholipids 0aSterols1 aGao, Yanxiang0 tFood research international.g2013 Nov., v. 54, no. 1 p.330-337dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2013.07.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012000165300001400285520150600299592002801805650000801833650001301841650002001854650002001874650002201894650001701916650001201933650001301945650001401958650002301972650001301995650002002008650001702028650002402045650003202069650001702101650001902118651001602137653001402153653001302167653002302180653002302203653001402226700001802240700001602258700001502274700001902289773014202308856008602450961001302536852000902549655001202558IND60626343920221119195103.0190219e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062634392DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2018.15468682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdeli, A.10aPost-reclamation Age Effects on Soil Physical Properties and Microbial Activity Under Forest and Pasture Ecosystems  ap. 20-34.  aDuring surface mining and subsequent reclamation efforts, physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils are disturbed. A study was conducted to evaluate the effects of age chronosequence on soil physical property and microbial activity in chronosequence reclaimed sites covering successional ages in the ranges 1, 4, 8, 11, and 13 years under forest and pasture ecosystems. The adjacent normal and unmined pasture and forest were used as a control for comparison purposes. The study site was located at the Red Hill Mine in east central Mississippi (approximately 33.3 N latitude and 89 W longitude), which is used by the North America Mining Company, LLC. Soil samples were collected from the reclaimed and unmined sites at 0–15- and 15–30-cm depth and analyzed for selected soil quality indicators. Results indicated that water stable aggregate and infiltration were increased, but soil bulk density and compaction decreased with increasing reclamation age. Soil penetration resistance was greater in the pasture than forest ecosystem. All reclaimed soils had less microbial enzyme activity than an unmined forest ecosystem; however, bacteria population level after 11 years since reclamation was similar to that of unmined forest soils. Soil organic carbon increased with increasing reclamation age strongly correlated with soil physical indicators and appears to be the main driving force during the development of soil physical and biological properties in the humid southeast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage 3abacteria 3achronosequences 3aenzyme activity 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest soils 3aforests 3alatitude 3alongitude 3amicrobial activity 3apastures 3areclaimed soils 3asoil density 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil penetration resistance 3asoil quality 3asurface mining 3aMississippi 0aCoal mine 0aland use 0amicrobial activity 0aphysical indicator 0areclaimed1 aBrooks, J.

This phenomenon is feared in breweries, because the viscosity of the affected liquids drastically increases due to the β-glucan and concomitant pellicle formation of these LAB. Currently it is unknown if this type of polysaccharide formation provides any advantage for the producing LAB during the colonization of (ethanol-containing) liquids. We thus used the β-glucan producer Levilactobacillus (L.) brevis TMW 1.2112 and its β-glucan-deficient transposon mutant (Δ gtf-2), and compared their growth at different ethanol concentrations and their competitiveness during co-cultivation. No significant inhibition in growth and differences in acidification were observed for both strains up to ethanol concentrations of 8% (v/v). At 10 % ethanol, the β-glucan forming wildtype increased its cell number and produced more acid in comparison to the mutant strain, which settled at the bottom of the fermentation tubes at any tested condition. At higher ethanol concentrations (12–18 % v/v) both strains failed to grow, while a higher viability of the wildtype strain was observed. After co-cultivation of both strains for up to 72 h in liquid nutrient medium (without ethanol), significantly more ropy wildtype colonies were detected, if the wildtype had been initially applied in similar cell counts or in excess. By contrast, the number of smooth mutant colonies was solely significantly higher after 24 h of growth, if the mutant strain had been initially inoculated in excess. These results indicate that the β-glucan-mediated pellicle formation by L. brevis TMW 1.2112 is its dominant phenotype and a selective advantage during colonization of liquids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3abeers 3acoculture 3aethanol 3afermentation 3alactic acid 3aliquids 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aplankton 3aresearch 3atransposons 3aviability 3aviscosity 3awines 0aLevilactobacillus brevis 0aBeverage spoilage 0aβ-glucan formation 0aSelective advantage1 aStahl, Leonie1 aVogel, Rudi F.0 tMicrobiological research.g2021 Feb., v. 243 p.126648-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2020.1266483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03706naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002100162245015400183300001600337520198900353592002802342650001002370650001502380650001102395650001902406650001802425650001602443650001702459650001902476650001102495650002002506650001402526650001902540650002502559650001002584650001602594650002502610650003102635650002802666650004402694650001902738650002902757650003002786650002402816651001602840700002502856700002202881700002502903700002102928773009902949856008303048852000903131655001203140IND4478327520221120121847.0120503e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447832752DNAL7 a215159072pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpr0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitehead, David10aEffects of leaf age and tree size on stomatal and mesophyll limitations to photosynthesis in mountain beech (Nothofagus solandrii var. cliffortiodes)  ap. 985-996.  aMesophyll conductance, gm, was estimated from measurements of stomatal conductance to carbon dioxide transfer, gs, photosynthesis, A, and chlorophyll fluorescence for Year 0 (current-year) and Year 1 (1-year-old) fully sunlit leaves from short (2 m tall, 10-year-old) and tall (15 m tall, 120-year-old) Nothofagus solandrii var. cliffortiodes trees growing in adjacent stands. Rates of photosynthesis at saturating irradiance and ambient CO2 partial pressure, AsatQ, were 25% lower and maximum rates of carboxylation, Vcmax, were 44% lower in Year 1 leaves compared with Year 0 leaves across both tree sizes. Although gs and gm were not significantly different between Year 0 and Year 1 leaves and gs was not significantly different between tree heights, gm was significantly (19%) lower for leaves on tall trees compared with leaves on short trees. Overall, Vcmax was 60% higher when expressed on the basis of CO2 partial pressure at the chloroplasts, Cc, compared with Vcmax on the basis of intercellular CO2 partial pressure, Ci, but this varied with leaf age and tree size. To interpret the relative stomatal and mesophyll limitations to photosynthesis, we used a model of carbon isotopic composition for whole leaves incorporating gm effects to generate a surface of ‘operating values’ of A over the growing season for all leaf classes. Our analysis showed that A was slightly higher for leaves on short compared with tall trees, but lower gm apparently reduced actual A substantially compared with AsatQ. Our findings showed that lower rates of photosynthesis in Year 1 leaves compared with Year 0 leaves were attributable more to increased biochemical limitation to photosynthesis in Year 1 leaves than differences in gm. However, lower A in leaves on tall trees compared with those on short trees could be attributed in part to lower gm and higher stomatal, Ls, and mesophyll, Lm, limitations to photosynthesis, consistent with steeper hydraulic gradients in tall trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aNothofagus 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarboxylation 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3agrowing season 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amesophyll 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3atrees 2aAge Factors 2aBiological Transport 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aFagusxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Stomataxmetabolism 2aPlant Transpiration 0aNew Zealand1 aBarbour, Margaret M.1 aGriffin, Kevin L.1 aTurnbull, Matthew H.1 aTissue, David T.0 tTree physiology.g2011 Sept., v. 31, no. 9 p.985-996dOxford University Pressx0829-318X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpr0213Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003800140245014400178300001800322500002000340520124900360592002801609596006801637596006801705650001601773650003601789650002401825650002601849650001301875650002201888650002701910650002101937650001301958650001101971650002201982650001202004650001402016650001702030650000902047650001202056650001802068700006902086700007502155700004002230700003002270700007102300700003702371773015202408856007402560852000902634655001202643IND60683149020221119084617.0200207e20200315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068314902DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.101972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Paula Tarcila Félix10aUse of mycorrhizal fungi releases the application of organic fertilizers to increase the production of leaf vitexin in yellow passion fruit  ap. 1816-1821.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Low‐cost organic fertilizers, such as coconut powder and vermicompost, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may benefit the Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa plant. However, it has not been established whether the joint application of these inputs may increase the production of vitexin and other molecules associated with the phytotherapeutic properties of this plant. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the application of AMF and organic fertilizers maximizes the production of bioactive compounds in leaves of P. edulis. RESULTS: The inoculation of Acaulospora longula into P. edulis grown in fertilization‐free soil promoted an increase of 86% in the concentration of leaf vitexin, 10.29% in the concentration of total phenols, and 13.78% in the concentration of total tannins in relation to the AMF‐free control, rendering soil fertilization superfluous. CONCLUSION: The application of A. longula increases the production of foliar biomolecules, such as vitexin, in yellow passion fruit plants. Thus, the addition of coconut powder and vermicompost to the substrate composition is not necessary, leading to the commercialized production of phytomass in the herbal medicines industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aAcaulospora 3aPassiflora edulis f. flavicarpa 3abioactive compounds 3abiochemical compounds 3acoconuts 3acommercialization 3afertilizer application 3aherbal medicines 3aindustry 3aleaves 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphenols 3aphytomass 3aphytotherapy 3asoil 3atannins 3avermicomposts1 ados Santos, Emanuela Lima1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0136-47301 ada Silva, Wliana Alves Viturino1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7798-54081 aFerreira, Magda Rhayanny Assunção1 aSoares, Luiz Alberto Lira1 ada Silva, Francineyde Alves1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9232-78301 ada Silva, Fábio Sérgio Barbosa0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2020 Mar. 15, v. 100, no. 4 p.1816-1821dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.101973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013800157520145400295592002801749650001501777650002401792650001101816650001101827650001501838650000901853650001101862650002601873650001301899650001501912651001701927700003001944700002201974700002201996773012002018856007402138852000902212655001202221IND60653440920221116161509.0190714e20181026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065344092DNAL7 a10.3390/w101115192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz, Paul 10aFlash-Flood Forecasting in an Andean Mountain Catchment—Development of a Step-Wise Methodology Based on the Random Forest Algorithm  aFlash-flood forecasting has emerged worldwide due to the catastrophic socio-economic impacts this hazard might cause and the expected increase of its frequency in the future. In mountain catchments, precipitation-runoff forecasts are limited by the intrinsic complexity of the processes involved, particularly its high rainfall variability. While process-based models are hard to implement, there is a potential to use the random forest algorithm due to its simplicity, robustness and capacity to deal with complex data structures. Here a step-wise methodology is proposed to derive parsimonious models accounting for both hydrological functioning of the catchment (e.g., input data, representation of antecedent moisture conditions) and random forest procedures (e.g., sensitivity analyses, dimension reduction, optimal input composition). The methodology was applied to develop short-term prediction models of varying time duration (4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 h) for a catchment representative of the Ecuadorian Andes. Results show that the derived parsimonious models can reach validation efficiencies (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient) from 0.761 (4-h) to 0.384 (24-h) for optimal inputs composed only by features accounting for 80% of the model&rsquo;s outcome variance. Improvement in the prediction of extreme peak flows was demonstrated (extreme value analysis) by including precipitation information in contrast to the use of pure autoregressive models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aantecedent moisture 3afloods 3amodels 3aprediction 3arain 3arunoff 3asocioeconomic factors 3avariance 3awatersheds 3aAndes region1 aOrellana-Alvear, Johanna 1 aWillems, Patrick 1 aCelleri, Rolando,0 tWater.g2018 Oct. 26, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w101115193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013400167300001600301520133300317592002801650650002201678650001001700650001601710650001101726650001201737650002101749650001101770650001501781650001401796650002201810650001201832650003801844650001101882650002101893700002301914700002501937700003001962773012501992856008102117852000902198655001202207IND60479643520221120124129.0160903e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047964352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00244-015-0255-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBesser, John M.10aSurvival and Growth of Freshwater Pulmonate and Nonpulmonate Snails in 28-Day Exposures to Copper, Ammonia, and Pentachlorophenol  ap. 321-331.  aWe performed toxicity tests with two species of pulmonate snails (Lymnaea stagnalis and Physa gyrina) and four taxa of nonpulmonate snails in the family Hydrobiidae (Pyrgulopsis robusta, Taylorconcha serpenticola, Fluminicola sp., and Fontigens aldrichi). Snails were maintained in static-renewal or recirculating culture systems with adults removed periodically to isolate cohorts of offspring for toxicity testing. This method successfully produced offspring for both species of pulmonate snails and for two hydrobiid species, P. robusta and Fluminicola sp. Toxicity tests were performed for 28 days with copper, ammonia, and pentachlorophenol in hard reconstituted water with endpoints of survival and growth. Tests were started with 1-week-old L. stagnalis, 2-week-old P. gyrina, 5- to 13-week-old P. robusta and Fluminicola sp., and older juveniles and adults of several hydrobiid species. For all three chemicals, chronic toxicity values for pulmonate snails were consistently greater than those for hydrobiid snails, and hydrobiids were among the most sensitive taxa in species sensitivity distributions for all three chemicals. These results suggest that the toxicant sensitivity of nonpulmonate snails in the family Hydrobiidae would not be adequately represented by results of toxicity testing with pulmonate snails.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLymnaea stagnalis 3aPhysa 3aPyrgulopsis 3aadults 3aammonia 3achronic toxicity 3acopper 3afreshwater 3ajuveniles 3apentachlorophenol 3aprogeny 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3asnails 3atoxicity testing1 aDorman, Rebecca A.1 aHardesty, Douglas L.1 aIngersoll, Christopher G.0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2016 Feb., v. 70, no. 2 p.321-331dSpringer USx0090-43417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-015-0255-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010800172300001600280520157300296592002801869650002401897650002501921650001501946650001301961650001701974650003601991650001702027650001102044650001702055650002402072650000902096650001402105650001902119700002502138700001702163700003602180700002902216700002702245773011102272856008202383852000902465655001202474IND60590343120221122222509.0180619e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059034312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-006-0035-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahattanadul, Sirima10aPreventive and curative effects of curcumin on the development of gastric inflammatory diseases in rats  ap. 191-197.  aPreventive and curative effects of curcumin on experimental acute and chronic gastric ulcers were investigated to validate its clinical application on a remedy for peptic ulcer. Intraduodenal administration of curcumin, 5–20 mg/kg, inhibited gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats, and oral administration prevented ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal lesions. Curcumin (20–80 mg/kg, p.o.) dose-dependently prevented both serotonin-induced gastric mucosal lesions and compound 48/80-induced gastric mucosal lesions in rats. Furthermore, oral administration of curcumin, 10–80 mg/kg, twice daily for 10 days, significantly accelerated the healing of acetic acid-induced chronic gastric ulcer and promoted mucosal regeneration in the ulcerated portion in a dose-related manner. Cimetidine prevented the formation of ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions, but not of serotonin-induced and compound 48/80-induced gastric mucosal lesions. Consecutive administration of cimetidine showed a marked acceleration in the healing of acetic acid-induced ulcer. Aminoguanidine, an inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor, showed anti-ulcerogenic effects similar to those oberved for curcumin. The present results indicate that curcumin exhibits gastric cytoprotection in the acute lesion models and ulcer healing promotion in the chronic ulcer model. The preventive and curative effects of curcumin might be due to an increase in the mucosal defensive mechanism through its antioxidant property and inhibition of NO or cytokine-mediated inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-ulcer activity 3aantioxidant activity 3acimetidine 3acurcumin 3agastric acid 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3amodels 3anitric oxide 3aoral administration 3arats 3asecretion 3astomach ulcers1 aReanmongkol, Wantana1 aYano, Shingo1 aPanichayupakaranant, Pharkphoom1 aPhdoongsombut, Narubodee1 aTungsinmunkong, Kobkul0 tNatural medicines.g2006 July, v. 60, no. 3 p.191-197dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl4059015x1340-34437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11418-006-0035-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03653naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245013800177520184800315592002802163650003702191650001802228650001902246650001202265650004102277650002202318650001602340650001502356650002002371650001302391650002102404650001302425650001602438650001902454653001902473653002802492653001302520653001602533700003002549700007002579700002602649700006202675700002902737700002402766700007002790700002202860700004102882773010602923856008503029852000903114655001203123IND60718597120221121032840.0220207e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071859712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2020.1266542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeandro, Mariana Ramos10aDegP protease is essential for tolerance to salt stress in the plant growth-promoting bacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5  aThe use of plant growth-promoting bacteria represents an alternative to the massive use of mineral fertilizers in agriculture. However, some abiotic stresses commonly found in the environment, like salinity, can affect the efficiency of this approach. Here, we investigated the key mechanisms involved in the response of the plant growth-promoting bacterium Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus to salt stress by using morphological and cell viability analyses, comparative proteomics, and reverse genetics. Our results revealed that the bacteria produce filamentous cells in response to salt at 100 mM and 150 mM NaCl. However, such a response was not observed at higher concentrations, where cell viability was severely affected. Proteomic analysis showed that salt stress modulates proteins involved in several pathways, including iron uptake, outer membrane efflux, osmotic adjustment, cell division and elongation, and protein transport and quality control. Proteomic data also revealed the repression of several extracytoplasmic proteins, especially those located at periplasm and outer membrane. The role of such pathways in the tolerance to salt stress was analyzed by the use of mutant defectives for Δtbdr (iron uptake), ΔmtlK and ΔotsA (compatible solutes synthesis), and ΔdegP (quality control of nascent extracytoplasmic proteins). ΔdegP presented the highest sensitivity to salt stress, Δtbdr, andΔmtlK also showed increased sensitivity, but ΔotsA was not affected. This is the first demonstration that DegP protein, a protease with minor chaperone activity, is essential for tolerance to salt stress in G. diazotrophicus. Our data contribute to a better understanding of the molecular bases that control the bacterial response/tolerance to salt stress, shedding light on quality control of nascent extracytoplasmic proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGluconacetobacter diazotrophicus 3acell division 3acell viability 3amutants 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aprotein transport 3aproteinases 3aproteomics 3aquality control 3aresearch 3areverse genetics 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 0aAbiotic stress 0aProtein quality control 0aProteome 0aMutagenesis1 aVespoli, Luciano de Souza1 aAndrade, Leandro Fernandes1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9258-59041 aSoares, Fabiano Silva1 aBoechat, Ana Laura1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6299-62271 aPimentel, Vivian Ribeiro1 aMoreira, Julia Rosa1 aPassamani, Lucas Zanchetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7800-46481 aSilveira, Vanildo1 ade Souza Filho, Gonçalo Apolinário0 tMicrobiological research.g2021 Feb., v. 243 p.126654-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:11955x0944-50137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2020.1266543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245015300167300001600320520148200336592002801818650003101846650001701877650002001894650004201914650003601956650001601992650001202008650003402020650002002054650002702074650002202101650002402123700002002147700002002167773011602187856008102303852000902384655001202393IND60083155520221117173039.0141101e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008315552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeon, Woo-Kwang10aGenipin up-regulates heme oxygenase-1 via PI3-kinase-JNK1/2-Nrf2 signaling pathway to enhance the anti-inflammatory capacity in RAW264.7 macrophages  ap. 119-125.  aGenipin, an aglycon of geniposide, has been reported to exhibit diverse pharmacological functions such as antitumor and anti-inflammatory effects. This study aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of genipin, focusing particularly on the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a potent anti-inflammatory enzyme. In RAW264.7 cells, genipin increased HO-1 expression and its enzyme activity via a NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)–antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway. These effects were significantly inhibited by exposure to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor, LY294002, or by expression of a dominant negative mutant of PI 3-kinase. Additional experiments showed that the activation of c-Jun NH₂-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) is required for genipin-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven induction of HO-1, and acts as a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase. Furthermore, functional significance of HO-1 induction was revealed by genipin-mediated inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated inducible nitric oxide synthase expression or cyclooxygenase-2 promoter activity, the response was reversed by the blocking of HO-1 protein synthesis or HO-1 enzyme activity. Therefore, identification of PI 3-kinase-JNK1/2-Nrf2-linked signaling cascade in genipin-mediated HO-1 expression defines the signaling event that could participate in genipin-mediated anti-inflammatory response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aenzyme activity 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3amacrophages 3amutants 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction1 aHong, Hey-Young1 aKim, Byung-Chul0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 512, no. 2 p.119-125dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245008300166300001400249520127000263592002801533650002501561650001401586650001501600650001301615650001301628650001501641650001201656650001601668650002501684650001301709650002301722650001901745650000901764650001401773651001101787651001801798653002401816653001501840653002701855653002201882653002201904653002201926700001801948700001601966773012601982856008402108852000902192655001202201IND60566640920221121001430.0180904e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056664092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibiod.2017.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Guo-You10aConcrete deterioration caused by freshwater mussel Limnoperna fortunei fouling  ap. 55-65.  aSimilar as biofouling of Dreissena species (zebra mussels and quagga mussels) on infrastructure concrete prevalent in the USA and Europe, the freshwater mollusk Limnoperna fortunei has also caused biofouling and exhibits chemical and physical deterioration on concrete structures. Given that numerous inter-basin water diversion projects containing enormous concrete structures have been constructed in L. fortunei colonized regions, it is critical to study the concrete deterioration caused by the mussel fouling such that effective prevention strategies can be proposed. This study analysed the characteristics of concrete deterioration associated with the fouling. Analysis of the affected concrete structures indicated that the pores of different sizes increased, resulting in increased water absorption and carbonation depth, while the compressive strength of the concrete decreased as a consequence of the mussel colonization. Concentrations of aluminum, manganese and iron increased while calcium decreased in the mussel-colonized concrete. These changes are due to the physiological requirements of mussel growth and adhesion activities. L. fortunei adhesion removes the calcium from the surface of the concrete and accelerates the concrete deterioration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aMytilidae 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3aaluminum 3abiofouling 3acalcium 3acarbonation 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3afreshwater mussels 3ainfrastructure 3airon 3amanganese 3aEurope 3aUnited States 0aLimnoperna fortunei 0aBiofouling 0aConcrete deterioration 0aPore distribution 0aElement variation 0aCarbonation depth1 aXu, Meng-Zhen1 aAn, Xue-Hui0 tInternational biodeterioration & biodegradation.g2017 July, v. 121 p.55-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:12418x0964-83057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2017.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245023000158520235000388592002802738650001502766650001302781650001602794650001802810650001802828650001002846650002802856650002002884650001002904651001102914700002002925773012202945856007403067852000903141655001203150IND60760886820221120163701.0211223e20211216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076088682DNAL7 a10.3390/v131225292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlech, Monika 10aMolecular Characterization of Small Ruminant Lentiviruses in Polish Mixed Flocks Supports Evidence of Cross Species Transmission, Dual Infection, a Recombination Event, and Reveals the Existence of New Subtypes within Group A  aSmall ruminant lentiviruses (SRLVs) are a group of highly divergent viruses responsible for global infection in sheep and goats. In a previous study we showed that SRLV strains found in mixed flocks in Poland belonged to subtype A13 and A18, but this study was restricted only to the few flocks from Małopolska region. The present work aimed at extending earlier findings with the analysis of SRLVs in mixed flocks including larger numbers of animals and flocks from different part of Poland. On the basis of gag and env sequences, Polish SRLVs were assigned to the subtypes B2, A5, A12, and A17. Furthermore, the existence of a new subtypes, tentatively designed as A23 and A24, were described for the first time. Subtypes A5 and A17 were only found in goats, subtype A24 has been detected only in sheep while subtypes A12, A23, and B2 have been found in both sheep and goats. Co-infection with strains belonging to different subtypes was evidenced in three sheep and two goats originating from two flocks. Furthermore, three putative recombination events were identified within gag and env SRLVs sequences derived from three sheep. Amino acid (aa) sequences of immunodominant epitopes in CA protein were well conserved while Major Homology Region (MHR) had more alteration showing unique mutations in sequences of subtypes A5 and A17. In contrast, aa sequences of surface glycoprotein exhibited higher variability confirming type-specific variation in the SU5 epitope. The number of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) ranged from 3 to 6 in respective sequences and were located in different positions. The analysis of LTR sequences revealed that sequences corresponding to the TATA box, AP-4, AML-vis, and polyadenylation signal (poly A) were quite conserved, while considerable alteration was observed in AP-1 sites. Interestingly, our results revealed that all sequences belonging to subtype A17 had unique substitution T to A in the fifth position of TATA box and did not have a 11 nt deletion in the R region which was noted in other sequences from Poland. These data revealed a complex picture of SRLVs population with ovine and caprine strains belonging to group A and B. We present strong and multiple evidence of dually infected sheep and goats in mixed flocks and present evidence that these viruses can recombine in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentivirus 3aTATA box 3aamino acids 3aglycoproteins 3aglycosylation 3agoats 3aimmunodominant epitopes 3amixed infection 3asheep 3aPoland1 aKuźmak, Jacek 0 tViruses.g2021 Dec. 16, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131225293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02179naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245008900160520127500249592002801524650001201552650001101564650001901575650001601594650001201610650001501622651001601637700002101653773012001674856007401794852000901868655001201877IND60653441120221116161424.0190714e20181026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065344112DNAL7 a10.3390/w101115212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Jang Hyun,10aEstimation of River Management Flow Considering Stream Water Deficit Characteristics  aSouth Korea endured extreme drought through 2015 and 2016. This hydrological drought led to a socio-economic drought which is a restriction on stream water use. Previous studies have explored streamflow drought using a threshold level based on flow duration curves, but streamflow drought does not necessarily lead to stream water deficit, which is related to water demand. Therefore, this study introduced a threshold for stream water deficit in South Korea, which is termed as river management flow, and was applied to Geum River Basin where a severe drought recently occurred. The stream water coordination council has restricted the use of stream water to cope with the stream water deficit. The deficit characteristics for the upstream and downstream river management flow should be similar in order to ensure the feasibility of stream water restrictions. Thus, upstream and downstream river management flows, which reproduced similar deficit characteristics to those of the reference site, were estimated. The deficit characteristics of Bugang and Gyuam were estimated from their river management flows for the 2015 drought and were comparable to those of Gongju. We expect this study to minimize the conflict between upstream and downstream water users in future.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3arivers 3asocioeconomics 3astream flow 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aSouth Korea1 aSeo, Seung  Beom0 tWater.g2018 Oct. 26, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w101115213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03365naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245016000160520181700320592002802137650002902165650003102194650003102225650003202256650001802288650002402306650002602330650001102356650001502367650000902382650005202391650001802443650001202461650001202473650001202485651001902497700001802516700001902534700001802553700001902571700001802590700002002608700002102628700001702649773012202666856007402788852000902862655001202871IND60760886920221120163627.0211223e20211216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076088692DNAL7 a10.3390/v131225302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFowkes, Aimee R.10aIntegrating High throughput Sequencing into Survey Design Reveals Turnip Yellows Virus and Soybean Dwarf Virus in Pea (Pisum Sativum) in the United Kingdom  aThere is only limited knowledge of the presence and incidence of viruses in peas within the United Kingdom, therefore high-throughput sequencing (HTS) in combination with a bulk sampling strategy and targeted testing was used to determine the virome in cultivated pea crops. Bulks of 120 leaves collected from twenty fields from around the UK were initially tested by HTS, and presence and incidence of virus was then determined using specific real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays by testing smaller mixed-bulk size samples. This study presents the first finding of turnip yellows virus (TuYV) in peas in the UK and the first finding of soybean dwarf virus (SbDV) in the UK. While TuYV was not previously known to be present in UK peas, it was found in 13 of the 20 sites tested and was present at incidences up to 100%. Pea enation mosaic virus-1, pea enation mosaic virus-2, pea seed-borne mosaic virus, bean yellow mosaic virus, pea enation mosaic virus satellite RNA and turnip yellows virus associated RNA were also identified by HTS. Additionally, a subset of bulked samples were re-sequenced at greater depth to ascertain whether the relatively low depth of sequencing had missed any infections. In each case the same viruses were identified as had been identified using the lower sequencing depth. Sequencing of an isolate of pea seed-borne mosaic virus from 2007 also revealed the presence of TuYV and SbDV, showing that both viruses have been present in the UK for at least a decade, and represents the earliest whole genome of SbDV from Europe. This study demonstrates the potential of HTS to be used as a surveillance tool, or for crop-specific field survey, using a bulk sampling strategy combined with HTS and targeted diagnostics to indicate both presence and incidence of viruses in a crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBean yellow mosaic virus 3aPea enation mosaic virus-1 3aPea enation mosaic virus-2 3aPea seed-borne mosaic virus 3aPisum sativum 3aSoybean dwarf virus 3adiagnostic techniques 3agenome 3amonitoring 3apeas 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asatellite RNA 3asurveys 3aturnips 3aviruses 3aUnited Kingdom1 aMcGreig, Sam 1 aPufal, Hollie 1 aDuffy, Shona 1 aHoward, Becky 1 aAdams, Ian P.1 aMacarthur, Roy 1 aWeekes, Rebecca 1 aFox, Adrian 0 tViruses.g2021 Dec. 16, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131225303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02264naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245013800169520109400307592002801401650001901429650001701448650002901465650001101494650002901505650001201534650001701546650002901563650001701592650002301609650002001632700002301652700001801675773012701693856007301820852000901893655001201902IND60652090320221121051242.0190712e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065209032DNAL7 a10.3390/su91120102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalitsakos, Panagiotis12aA Hybrid RES Distributed Generation System for Autonomous Islands: A DER-CAM and Storage-Based Economic and Optimal Dispatch Analysis  aThe possibility of replacing the existing autonomous thermal power plants by Distributed Energy Resources (DER) based on renewable energy sources (RES), along with the appropriate energy storage technologies in order to deal with the major problems that autonomous islands usually face was investigated. A case study of a small Greek island, which is confronted by various energy and water shortages, was studied for assessing the feasibility of DER deployment. The main objectives investigated were cost minimization, CO<inf>2</inf> emissions minimization and DER reliability maximization. The DER-CAM (Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model) decision support tool was used for the multi-objective analysis conducted, which proposes a set of optimal solutions defining the appropriate Distributed Generation (DG) technologies, the capacities of storage and other technologies and the optimal dispatch of the DG system. A mutual beneficial solution, for all stakeholders, was proposed indicating the scope for developing such systems for all islands facing the same problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3adecision support systems 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aislands 3apower plants 3arenewable energy sources 3astakeholders 3astorage technology 3awater shortages1 aMihet-Popa, Lucian1 aXydis, George0 tSustainability.g2017 Nov. 02, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su91120103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02452naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011200170300001600282520126500298592002801563650002101591650001901612650002301631650002801654650001201682650002201694650001101716650002401727650001201751650001101763650002201774700002001796700002101816700002301837773011601860856008101976852000902057655001202066IND60083155820221117160355.0141101e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008315582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakuraba, Haruhiko10aCrystal structure of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum calidifontis  ap. 126-134.  aThe crystal structure of a highly thermostable UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (GalE) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum calidifontis was determined at a resolution of 1.8Å. The asymmetric unit contained one subunit, and the functional dimer was generated by a crystallographic two-fold axis. Each monomer consisted of a Rossmann-fold domain with NAD bound and a carboxyl terminal domain. The overall structure of P. calidifontis GalE showed significant similarity to the structures of the GalEs from Escherichia coli, human and Trypanosoma brucei. However, the sizes of several surface loops were markedly smaller in P. calidifontis GalE than the corresponding loops in the other enzymes. Structural comparison revealed that the presence of an extensive hydrophobic interaction at the subunit interface is likely the main factor contributing to the hyperthermostability of the P. calidifontis enzyme. Within the NAD-binding site of P. calidifontis GalE, a loop (NAD-binding loop) tightly holds the adenine ribose moiety of NAD. Moreover, a deletion mutant lacking this loop bound NAD in a loose, reversible manner. Thus the presence of the NAD-binding loop in GalE is largely responsible for preventing the release of the cofactor from the holoenzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3aUDP-glucose 4-epimerase 3aadenine 3acrystal structure 3ahumans 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amutants 3aribose 3athermal stability1 aKawai, Tomoyuki1 aYoneda, Kazunari1 aOhshima, Toshihisa0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 512, no. 2 p.126-134dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002400189245013800213300001800351506007600369520122100445592002801666596003701694506003701731650002001768650002401788650001201812650001901824650002001843650002201863650000901885650001101894650001401905650002001919650001301939650001701952650001801969650002001987650001102007650001902018650001702037650001402054650001302068650001602081650001402097650002502111650001802136650000902154700001802163700001502181700001702196700001802213700001602231700005902247773013402306856008202440852000902522655001202531IND60667710620221207100214.0190919e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066771062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-019-00692-22doi7 aPMC67455812pmcid7 a315647782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShams, Mostafakamal10aNitric oxide mitigates salt stress effects of pepper seedlings by altering nutrient uptake, enzyme activity and osmolyte accumulation  ap. 1149-1161.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study was planned to evaluate the role of exogenous application of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, on the deleterious effect of salinity in Capsicum annum L. seedlings. Different NO doses (0, 50, 100 and 150 µM SNP) were foliarly applied to pepper seedlings grown under the non-saline and saline conditions (50, 100 and 150 mM of NaCl). The photosynthetic rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO₂ concentration (Ci), transpiration rate (Tr), mineral element (Zn, Fe, B, K, Ca and Mg) uptake, plant growth and leaf relative water content (LRWC) were decreased by NaCl treatment, but NO treatments generally improved the observed parameters. 150 mM NaCl treatment caused overaccumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and malondialdehyde (MDA) by 87 and 100% respectively as compared to control. However, NO application (150 µM SNP) at 150 mM of NaCl significantly decreased H₂O₂ and MDA to 34 and 54%, respectively. The present study clarified that the exogenous NO treatment supported pepper seedlings against salinity stress by regulating the mineral nutrient uptake, antioxidant enzyme activity, osmolyte accumulation, and improving the LRWC and photosynthetic activity.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015/161cAtatürk Üniversitesi0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCapsicum annuum 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amalondialdehyde 3aminerals 3anitric oxide 3anitroprusside 3anutrient uptake 3apepper 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3astomatal conductance 3awater content 3azinc1 aEkinci, Melek1 aOrs, Selda1 aTuran, Metin1 aAgar, Guleray1 aKul, Raziye1 aYildirim, Ertan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3369-06450 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2019 Sept., v. 25, no. 5 p.1149-1161dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-019-00692-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02499naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011600164300001400280520136800294592002801662650002201690650001401712650002501726650001701751650001901768650001301787650001701800650001201817650001101829650002001840650001401860700002501874700001901899773008001918856008301998990002302081852000902104655001202113IND60094617520221120202618.0141104e20120215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009461752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.desal.2011.11.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnanth, A.14aThe influence of tetraethylorthosilicate and polyethyleneimine on the performance of polyethersulfone membranes  ap. 61-70.  aThe effect of inorganic and organic additives in polyethersulfone (PES) membranes was investigated for the possible enhancement in ultrafiltration performances. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were chosen as inorganic respective silica precursor and organic additive based on their potential to promote hydrophilicity in PES membranes. With the addition of TEOS and PEI in PES casting solution, the viscosity and hydrophilicity were increased.In addition of TEOS in PES, the SiO₂ particles were homogeneously dispersed in PES matrix, a large amount of OH groups on the SiO₂ particles generated, and led to an improvement in the hydrophilic property. Characterizations of membranes by FTIR and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) confirmed that the PES suffered a transform from various functional groups due to the addition of TEOS. The 40% of water permeability was found by 5% addition ion of TEOS and PEI repressively. The top surface and cross-section morphology of PES membranes changed from dense-like structure to finger-like macrovoids structure with increasing TEOS and PEI content. Protein solution separation was investigated using lysozyme and bovine serum albumin (BSA) with the concentration of 1000ppm. The observed sieving coefficient of protein decreased exponentially with increasing contents of TEOS and PEI in PES membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadditives 3abovine serum albumin 3adesalination 3ahydrophilicity 3alysozyme 3apermeability 3asieving 3asilica 3aultrafiltration 3aviscosity1 aArthanareeswaran, G.1 aWang, Huanting0 tDesalination.g2012 Feb. 15, v. 287 p.61-70dElsevier B.V.x0011-91647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.desal.2011.11.0303Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013300167300001400300520164000314592002801954650002101982650002102003650000802024650002102032650001402053650001502067650002202082650001402104650001602118650001702134650001402151650001002165650001602175650001402191650001202205650002502217650002602242650001802268650001502286650000702301650001302308650001302321650005202334650001602386650001802402650001202420650001402432653002102446653003102467653001802498653001402516653001802530653000902548653000702557653000902564653000902573653000802582653000802590653000702598653000902605653000802614653000802622653000902630653001202639653000802651653000702659653000802666700002202674700002202696700002402718700002002742773012202762856008302884852000902967655001202976IND60566641220221121024919.0190410e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056664122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2017.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumann, Andre10aUrate Oxidase produced by Lucilia sericata medical maggots is localized in Malpighian tubes and facilitates allantoin production  ap. 44-53.  aLucilia sericata maggots are the only species currently approved for maggot debridement therapy (MDT), an alternative treatment for chronic and recalcitrant wounds. Maggots promote wound debridement, disinfection and healing by producing a complex mixture of proteins, peptides and low-molecular-weight compounds in their secretions and excretions, but the individual components are not well characterized at the molecular level. Here we investigated the purine catabolism pathway in L. sericata, focusing on the production of allantoin by Urate Oxidase (UO), which is thought to promote wound healing. We produced recombinant L. sericata UO in Escherichia coli, and characterized the properties of the pure enzyme in terms of the optimum pH (7–10) and temperature (20–25 °C), its stability, sensitivity to inhibition and ion dependency. We used quantitative RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization to monitor the expression of the UO gene, and we used a guinea pig anti-UO antibody to detect the native enzyme by western blot and by florescence immunohistochemistry in larval tissues. We found that L. sericata UO is exclusively present in the larval excretion organ (the Malpighian tubes) and is freely available in the cytoplasm rather than restricted to a specific subcellular compartment. Allantoin is a final product of L. sericata purine catabolism. It is produced by UO in the Malpighian tubes to remove uric acid from the hemolymph and is consequently excreted via the hindgut. Our findings confirm the hypothesis that both actively secreted molecules and excretion products contribute to the beneficial effects of MDT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aLucilia sericata 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aallantoin 3aantibodies 3achemical elements 3acytoplasm 3adebridement 3adisinfection 3aexcretion 3agenes 3aguinea pigs 3ahemolymph 3ahindgut 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ain situ hybridization 3ainsect larvae 3ametabolism 3apH 3apeptides 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atemperature 3atissue repair 3atissues 3auric acid 0aLucilia sericata 0aMaggot debridement therapy 0aUrate Oxidase 0aAllantoin 0aWound healing 0aAMPs 0aAP 0aDAPI 0aEDTA 0aFDA 0aHRP 0aHS 0aIMAC 0aISH 0aMDT 0aPVDF 0aqRT-PCR 0aTLS 0aUO 0aUOr1 aŠkaljac, Marisa,1 aLehmann, Rudiger,1 aVilcinskas, Andreas1 aFranta, Zdenӗk0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2017 Apr., v. 83 p.44-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48131x0965-17487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2017.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016800169300001600337520106700353592002801420650001201448650003101460650001301491650002501504650001601529650002301545650002001568650001001588650004601598650002101644650002301665650001001688650001401698650001201712650002001724650001101744650001901755650001401774650001701788700002301805700001801828700002401846700002501870700002001895700002501915700001901940773011601959856008102075852000902156655001202165IND60083156020221122234121.0141101e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008315602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, José E.S.10aMolecular, kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural analyses of Mycobacterium tuberculosishisD-encoded metal-dependent dimeric histidinol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.23)  ap. 143-153.  aThe emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the major causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), and the deadly HIV-TB co-infection have led to an urgent need for the development of new anti-TB drugs. The histidine biosynthetic pathway is present in bacteria, archaebacteria, lower eukaryotes and plants, but is absent in mammals. Disruption of the hisD gene has been shown to be essential for M. tuberculosis survival. Here we present cloning, expression and purification of recombinant hisD-encoded histidinol dehydrogenase (MtHisD). N-terminal amino acid sequencing and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the identity of homogeneous MtHisD. Analytical gel filtration, metal requirement analysis, steady-state kinetics and isothermal titration calorimetry data showed that homodimeric MtHisD is a metalloprotein that follows a Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping-Pong mechanism. pH-rate profiles and a three-dimensional model of MtHisD allowed proposal of amino acid residues involved in either catalysis or substrate(s) binding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3acalorimetry 3acatalytic activity 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aeukaryotic cells 3agel chromatography 3agenes 3ahistidine 3amammals 3amixed infection 3amodels 3athermodynamics 3atitration 3atuberculosis1 aDucati, Rodrigo G.1 aBreda, Ardala1 aRosado, Leonardo A.1 ade Souza, Bibiana M.1 aPalma, Mario S.1 aSantos, Diógenes S.1 aBasso, Luiz A.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 512, no. 2 p.143-153dElsevier Inc.x0003-98617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2011.05.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245013500153520125200288592002801540650002501568650002101593650002301614650001301637650002101650650001901671650001301690650001101703650001701714650001301731651001001744700001401754700001601768773012701784856007301911852000901984655001201993IND60652090620221121042439.0190712e20171103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065209062DNAL7 a10.3390/su91120112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Tao10aFactors Influencing Land Development and Redevelopment during China’s Rapid Urbanization: Evidence from Haikou City, 2003–2016  aLand development and redevelopment (LDR) is essential to economic growth and the advancement of urbanization in urban China. Moreover, various factors affect LDR. Based on an investigation, during 2003–2016, which involves 420 parcels within a 2-km section of the Nandu River, Haikou city, this paper employs a logistic model, so as to judge the impact of LDR on these parcels, and then with an improved hedonic model, it sets out to explore the LDR influencing factors. Specifically, the results show that the impact mechanism of LDR in China is different from countries where economy is the main influencing force. Moreover, China’s urban land development results from the cooperation and competition between local government and enterprises, with a particular focus on multiple political and economic factors. Hence, the paper innovatively incorporates quantifiable political and property factors that significantly influence the results. Finally, the paper tries to explain the variance from macro-level government and micro-level enterprises perspectives. In conclusion, China’s land development requires cooperation among the government and enterprises, in order to improve the economic, social, and environmental benefits of land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aeconomic factors 3aecosystem services 3aland use 3alocal government 3alogit analysis 3apolitics 3arivers 3aurbanization 3avariance 3aChina1 aZhao, Rui1 aZhou, Yulin0 tSustainability.g2017 Nov. 03, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su91120113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012300156520254200279592002802821650002902849650001502878650001102893650002902904650001102933650001202944650001702956650001902973650001502992650001803007650001203025650001903037650003103056650001903087650001103106650001403117650001603131650001703147650001603164650001103180650001103191650001403202650001803216650001503234650001503249651001003264700001503274700001903289700001803308700001503326773012003341856007403461852000903535655001203544IND60653441520221116161459.0190714e20181026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065344152DNAL7 a10.3390/w101115242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyu, Xiaoxi 10aChemical Weathering and Riverine Carbonate System Driven by Human Activities in a Subtropical Karst Basin, South China  aIn the context of climate change, the input of acid substances into rivers, caused by human activities in the process of industrial and agricultural development, has significantly disrupted river systems and has had a profound impact on the carbon cycle. The hydrochemical composition and which main sources of the Lianjiang River (LR), a subtropical karst river in northern Guangdong Province, South China, were analyzed in January 2018. The objective was to explicate the influence on the deficit proportion of CO<inf>2</inf> consumption, resulting from carbonate chemical weathering (CCW), driven by nitric acid (HNO<inf>3</inf>) and sulfuric acid (H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>), which is affected by exogenous acids from the industrial regions in north of the Nanling Mountains and the Pearl River Delta. The response of the riverine carbonate system to exogenous acid-related weathering was also discussed. HCO<inf>3</inf>&minus; and Ca2+, respectively, accounted for 84.97% of the total anions and 78.71% of the total cations in the surface runoff of the LR, which was characterized as typical karst water. CCW was the most important material source of river dissolved loads in the LR, followed by human activities and silicate chemical weathering (SCW). Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), derived from CCW induced by carbonic acid (H<inf>2</inf>CO<inf>3</inf>), had the largest contribution to the total amount of DIC in the LR (76.79%), and those from CCW induced by anthropogenic acids (HNO<inf>3</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>) and SCW contributed 13.56% and 9.64% to the total DIC, respectively. The deficit proportion of CO<inf>2</inf> consumption associated with CCW resulting from sulfuric acid and nitric acid (13.56%), was slightly lower than that of the Guizhou Plateau in rainy and pre-rainy seasons (15.67% and 14.17%, respectively). The deficit percentage of CO<inf>2</inf> uptake associated with CCW induced by sulfuric acid and nitric acid, accounted for 38.44% of the total CO<inf>2</inf> consumption related to natural CCW and 18.84% of the anthropogenic acids from external areas. DIC derived from CCW induced by human activities, had a significant positive correlation with the total alkalinity, SIc and pCO<inf>2</inf> in river water, indicating that the carbonate system of the LR was also driven by exogenous acids, with the exception of carbonic acid. More attention should be paid to the effects of human activities on the chemical weathering and riverine carbonate system in the karst drainage basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aalkalinity 3aanions 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3acalcium 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acarbonic acid 3acations 3aclimate change 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3ahydrochemistry 3akarsts 3amountains 3anitric acid 3ariver deltas 3ariver water 3arivers 3arunoff 3asilicates 3asulfuric acid 3awatersheds 3aweathering 3aChina1 aTao, Zhen 1 aGao, Quanzhou 1 aPeng, Haixia 1 aZhou, Mei 0 tWater.g2018 Oct. 26, v. 10, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w101115243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245013400154520123900288592002801527650002201555650003101577650001401608650002201622650001901644650001201663650002201675650001601697700002101713773012701734856007301861852000901934655001201943IND60652090720221121042559.0190712e20171103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065209072DNAL7 a10.3390/su91120132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Yong10aEvaluation of Energy Consumption in the Mercury Treatment of Phosphor Powder from Spent Fluorescent Lamps Using a Thermal Process  aIn a pilot-plant-scale thermal mercury treatment of phosphor powder from spent fluorescent lamps, energy consumption was estimated to control mercury content by the consideration of reaction kinetics. Mercury content was analyzed as a function of treatment temperature and time. The initial mercury content of the phosphor powder used in the thermal process was approximately 3500 mg/kg. The target mercury content in the phosphor powder thermal process of the phosphor powder was 5 mg/kg or less at 400 °C or higher because the target mercury content was recommended by Minamata Convention and Basel Convention. During thermal processing, the reaction rate was represented by a first order reaction with the Arrhenius equation. The reaction rate constant increased with temperature from 0.0112 min−1 at 350 °C to 0.0558 min−1 at 600 °C. The frequency factor was 2.51 min−1, and the activation energy was 6509.11 kcal/kg. Reaction rate constants were used to evaluate the treatment time required to reduce mercury content in phosphor powder to be less than 5 mg/kg. The total energy consumption in a pilot-plant-scale thermal process was evaluated to determine the optimal temperature for removing mercury in phosphor powder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aequations 3afluorescent lamps 3aheat treatment 3amercury 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature1 aRhee, Seung-Whee0 tSustainability.g2017 Nov. 03, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su91120133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005500139245009400194500002000288520156300308592002801871650002501899650002201924650001701946650001901963650001801982650002002000650001402020650001402034650002402048650001002072650001302082650001102095650001002106650001302116650000802129650002902137650001402166700002002180700001702200700001602217700001802233700001702251700001702268773011602285856007302401852000902474655001202483IND60683149620221119084350.0200207e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068314962DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.025922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Binmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5393-799710aTRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (TTG1) regulates leaf trichome density in tea Camellia sinensis  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlant leaf trichomes are both essential for taxonomy and participate in plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In the tea plant, teaf trichomes vary significantly among different varieties, ranging from leaves with high trichome density to relatively glabrous leaves. Leaf trichomes provides crucial diagnostic characters for tea identification and taxonomy. In addition, trichomes are a valued trait in tea production; leaf trichomes are generally considered to be associated with improved taste. However, the molecular mechanisms of trichome formation and the genetic control of trichome density in tea plants remain unknown. In this study, we identified a gene named TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 (CsTTG1), which encodes a WD‐repeat protein and is associated with trichome formation in tea. The results also showed that CsTTG1 is particularly highly expressed in the top bud, which is consistent with trichome formation in this tissue. CsTTG1 encodes a protein localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In addition, the transcription level of CsTTG1 was related to the length and/or density of the trichomes in different tea cultivars with diverse leaf trichome densities and overexpressing CsTTG1 increased the number of trichomes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Collectively, our results indicate that CsTTG1 is involved in regulating trichome formation in general and that the expression level of CsTTG1 is related to trichome density in tea plants. Our results may facilitate research on tea taxonomy and the adaptation of tea to its habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCamellia sinensis 3aWD40 repeats 3aabiotic stress 3abiotic stress 3acrop production 3acultivars 3acytoplasm 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahabitats 3aleaves 3ataste 3ataxonomy 3atea 3atranscription (genetics) 3atrichomes1 aZhu, Zhangsheng1 aLiu, Renjian1 aWang, Limei1 aDai, Fengling1 aCao, Fanrong1 aLiu, Shaoqun0 tNordic journal of botany.g2020 Jan., v. 38, no. 1dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl33104x0107-055X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/njb.025923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04401naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012600167500001400293520230800307592002802615650001902643650002102662650001402683650003402697650002502731650001502756650001902771650001102790650002402801650002502825650002102850650000902871650002902880650001902909650002102928650002202949650001902971650002902990650001603019650002403035653002103059653002203080653001103102653000903113653002503122653000803147653000803155653000803163653000903171653000903180653000803189653000803197653001103205653000903216653000903225653000803234653000803242653001003250653000803260700001803268700001903286700001503305700001403320700001403334700001503348700002903363700001603392700001103408773009403419856008503513852000903598655001203607IND60718597720221121032818.0210219e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071859772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1534142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ziyuan10aDihydromyricetin reverses MRP2-induced multidrug resistance by preventing NF-κB-Nrf2 signaling in colorectal cancer cell  aNAL-light  aDihydromyricetin (DMY), a natural flavonoid compound from the leaves of the Chinese medicinal herb Vitis heyneana, has been shown to have the potential to combat chemoresistance by inhibiting Nrf2/MRP2 signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. However, the precise underlying molecular mechanism and its therapeutic target are not well understood.Our study aims to investigate the effects of DMY on multidrug resistance (MDR), and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.In vitro, HCT116/OXA and HCT8/VCR cells were employed as our MDR models. The cells were treated with DMY (50 µM) or MK-571 (50 µM) plus oxaliplatin (OXA) (10 µM) or vincristine (VCR) (10 µM) for 48 h. In vivo, we used BALB/c mice as a CRC xenograft mouse model. BALB/c mice were given DMY (100 mg/kg), OXA (5 mg/kg) and DMY (100 mg/kg) combined with OXA (5 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal route every 2 days per week for 4 weeks.We used MTT and colony forming assays to detect DMY's ability to reverse MDR. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect apoptosis. Immunocytochemistry was used to detect the localization of Nrf2 and NF-κB/p65. Western blot, qRT-PCR and reporter gene assays were employed to measure the protein and gene transcriptional levels (MRP2, Nrf2, NF-κB/p65). Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was used to investigate the endogenous promoter occupancy of NF-κB/p65. Finally, immunohistochemistry and TUNEL staining were used to detect protein expression and apoptosis in vivo.DMY restored chemosensitivity (OXA and VCR) by inhibiting both MRP2 expression and its promoter activity in HCT116/OXA and HCT8/VCR cell lines. Furthermore, DMY could inhibit NF-κB/p65 expression, reducing NF-κB/p65 translocation to the nucleus to silence Nrf2 signaling, which is necessary for MRP2 expression. Overexpressing NF-κB/p65 expression reduced the reversal effect of DMY. In addition, NF-κB/p65 regulated Nrf2 expression by directly binding to its specific promoter region and activating its transcription. Finally, we proved that the combination of OXA and DMY has a synergistic tumor suppression effect in vivo.Our study provided a novel mechanism of DMY boosted chemosensitivity in human CRC. The downstream signals of DMY, NF-κB or Nrf2 could also be potential targets for the treatment of CRC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis heyneana 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3achromatin immunoprecipitation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aflavonoids 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amedicinal plants 3amice 3amultiple drug resistance 3aneoplasm cells 3apromoter regions 3aprotein synthesis 3areporter genes 3atranscription (genetics) 3avincristine 3axenotransplantation 0aDihydromyricetin 0aColorectal cancer 0aNF-κB 0aMRP2 0aMultidrug resistance 0aARE 0aCBP 0aCRC 0aDAPI 0aHO-1 0aMDR 0aMTT 0aNF-κB 0aNQO1 0aNrf2 0aOXA 0aROS 0aTUNEL 0aVCR1 aSun, Xiaoting1 aFeng, Yuanyuan1 aWang, Yang1 aZhang, Lu1 aWang, Yan1 aFang, Zhen1 aAzami, Nisma Lena Bahaji1 aSun, Mingyu1 aLi, Qi0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Feb., v. 82 p.153414-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.1534143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013100160520165100291592002801942650001701970650002201987650001402009650001602023650001502039650001502054650001502069650002002084650002602104650001002130650001602140651001002156700001802166773012702184856007302311852000902384655001202393IND60652090820221121042643.0190712e20171103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065209082DNAL7 a10.3390/su91120152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClemente, Matteo10a‘Interrupted’ Landscapes: Post-Earthquake Reconstruction in between Urban Renewal and Social Identity of Local Communities  aThe present study deals with the topic of post-seismic reconstruction focusing on landscape and social issues. Sustainable reconstruction requires a connection between the physical context of a given territory and the immaterial (historical, cultural, productive) values that constitute the place’s identity. In this perspective, those places that have been destroyed by severe earthquakes or other disasters could be labelled as “interrupted landscapes”, meaning a drastic break in the individual stories attaching the people to their own territory, as well as an abrupt alteration of the continuous process by which people attribute a sense to their own territory. The study discusses selected cases of post-earthquake reconstruction in Italy, providing an overview of different visions for development of the new towns, that oscillate between two contrasting approaches: the “new town” model, implying the construction of a new town off-site and the “in loco” model. Looking for the reasons for failures of the new town model reconstruction, the study also debates the social dimension of urban landscapes, reflecting upon the notion of ‘collective identity’ connecting place attachment to cultural heritage. These issues were finally considered when defining strategic guidelines for sustainable urban reconstruction promoting place identity and preserving the intimate characteristics of the affected landscapes. Governance actions were defined along with sustainability strategies based on the investigated case studies, outlining a series of best practices that may promote the permanent involvement of local communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acultural heritage 3adisasters 3aearthquakes 3agovernance 3aguidelines 3alandscapes 3aphysical models 3asocial identification 3atowns 3aurban areas 3aItaly1 aSalvati, Luca0 tSustainability.g2017 Nov. 03, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su91120153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04922naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012800169300001400297520261800311592002802929650001202957650000902969650001602978650001302994650001003007650001903017650001903036650002403055650001103079650001403090650002503104650000903129650002003138650001903158650001703177650001603194650001703210650001703227651001203244653002703256653000803283653001203291653001903303653001903322653001203341653002103353700002603374700001603400700002103416700002203437700002203459700002003481700001703501700002203518700001903540700001903559700001603578700003103594700001603625700001903641700002003660700001803680700001903698700001703717700001803734700002003752700001503772700002503787700001503812700001703827700001803844700001703862773011003879856008203989852000904071655001204080IND60531450620221121053126.0190411e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053145062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eja.2016.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhnert, Matthias10aImpact analysis of climate data aggregation at different spatial scales on simulated net primary productivity for croplands  ap. 41-52.  aFor spatial crop and agro-systems modelling, there is often a discrepancy between the scale of measured driving data and the target resolution. Spatial data aggregation is often necessary, which can introduce additional uncertainty into the simulation results. Previous studies have shown that climate data aggregation has little effect on simulation of phenological stages, but effects on net primary production (NPP) might still be expected through changing the length of the growing season and the period of grain filling. This study investigates the impact of spatial climate data aggregation on NPP simulation results, applying eleven different models for the same study region (∼34,000km2), situated in Western Germany. To isolate effects of climate, soil data and management were assumed to be constant over the entire study area and over the entire study period of 29 years. Two crops, winter wheat and silage maize, were tested as monocultures. Compared to the impact of climate data aggregation on yield, the effect on NPP is in a similar range, but is slightly lower, with only small impacts on averages over the entire simulation period and study region. Maximum differences between the five scales in the range of 1–100km grid cells show changes of 0.4–7.8% and 0.0–4.8% for wheat and maize, respectively, whereas the simulated potential NPP averages of the models show a wide range (1.9–4.2gCm−2d−1 and 2.7–6.1gCm−2d−1 for wheat and maize, respectively). The impact of the spatial aggregation was also tested for shorter time periods, to see if impacts over shorter periods attenuate over longer periods. The results show larger impacts for single years (up to 9.4% for wheat and up to 13.6% for maize). An analysis of extreme weather conditions shows an aggregation effect in vulnerability up to 12.8% and 15.5% between the different resolutions for wheat and maize, respectively. Simulations of NPP averages over larger areas (e.g. regional scale) and longer time periods (several years) are relatively insensitive to climate data aggregation. However, the scale of climate data is more relevant for impacts on annual averages of NPP or if the period is strongly affected or dominated by drought stress. There should be an awareness of the greater uncertainty for the NPP values in these situations if data are not available at high resolution. On the other hand, the results suggest that there is no need to simulate at high resolution for long term regional NPP averages based on the simplified assumptions (soil and management constant in time and space) used in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3acorn 3acorn silage 3acropland 3acrops 3afilling period 3agrowing season 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aphenology 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3asoil management 3aspace and time 3aspatial data 3auncertainty 3awater stress 3awinter wheat 3aGermany 0aNet primary production 0aNPP 0aScaling 0aExtreme events 0aCrop modelling 0aClimate 0aData aggregation1 aYeluripati, Jagadeesh1 aSmith, Pete1 aHoffmann, Holger1 avan Oijen, Marcel1 aConstantin, Julie1 aCoucheney, Elsa1 aDechow, Rene1 aEckersten, Henrik1 aGaiser, Thomas1 aGrosz, Balász1 aHaas, Edwin1 aKersebaum, Kurt Christian,1 aKiese, Ralf1 aKlatt, Steffen1 aLewan, Elisabet1 aNendel, Claas1 aRaynal, Helene1 aSosa, Carmen1 aSpecka, Xenia1 aTeixeira, Edmar1 aWang, Enli1 aWeihermüller, Lutz,1 aZhao, Gang1 aZhao, Zhigan1 aOgle, Stephen1 aEwert, Frank0 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2017 Aug., v. 88 p.41-52dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2016.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01530naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010500167300001600272520034100288592002800629650001800657650001600675650001600691650001900707651002100726653001500747653001800762653002600780653001600806653001000822700002000832773023500852856008401087852000901171655001201180IND60531450720221121063117.0190411e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053145072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2016.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Kwang-Sik10aReview of the Stenus indubius group (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae) in Korea, including five new species  ap. 937-946.  aA taxonomic review of Korean Stenus indubius group is presented.

Dry season irrigated Boro rice production is important for national food security. Dry season irrigation mainly uses groundwater, but the extent of its use is not well known. We assessed groundwater use and water productivity of Boro in the northwest region of Bangladesh using remote sensing based energy balance modelling, crop classification and secondary statistics. The energy balance modelling shows a large spatial variation in the actual evapotranspiration (ETₐ) from about 325 to 470 mm, with an overall spatial average of 365 mm during dry season. The estimated values of ETₐcorrespond well with independent values from field and regional scale soil and water balance modelling results. From spatial estimates of ETₐand effective rainfall, we computed regional net groundwater use for Boro production in 2009 as 2.4 km³. Groundwater is being used unsustainably in some areas, and a spatial time series (1990 to 2010) of pre- and post-monsoon groundwater depth changes in the northwest region of Bangladesh suggests that, with the current level of groundwater use, falling groundwater levels may pose a long term threat to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in much of the region.

Here, a divergent PBV genome was assembled from a patient hospitalized for acute respiratory illness (ARI) in Colombia. The RdRp protein branched with sequences previously reported in patients with ARI from Cambodia and China. Sputa from hospitalized individuals (n = 130) were screened by RT-qPCR which enabled detection and subsequent metagenomic characterization of 25 additional PBV infections circulating in Colombia and the US. Phylogenetic analysis of RdRp highlighted the emergence of two dominant lineages linked to the index case and Asian strains, which together clustered as a distinct genotype. Bayesian inference further established capsid and RdRp sequences as both significantly associated with ARI. Various respiratory-tropic pathogens were detected in PBV+ patients, yet no specific bacteria was common among them and four individuals lacked co-infections, suggesting PBV may not be a prokaryotic virus nor exclusively opportunistic, respectively. Competing models for the origin and transmission of this PBV genotype are presented that attempt to reconcile vectoring by a bacterial host with human pathogenicity. A high prevalence in patients with ARI, an ability to reassort, and demonstrated global spread indicate PBV warrant greater public health concern.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPicobirnavirus 3acapsid 3agastrointestinal system 3agenome 3agenotype 3ahumans 3ametagenomics 3apathogenicity 3apatients 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aviruses 3aCambodia 3aChina 3aColombia1 aForberg, Kenn 1 aPerez, Lester J.1 aLuk, Ka-Cheung 1 aMeyer, Todd V.1 aCloherty, Gavin A.0 tViruses.g2021 Dec. 17, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v131225343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245009600204300001600300520148400316592002801800650002301828650002301851650001201874650002501886650001001911650001001921650001701931650001801948650000901966650001301975650001701988650001802005650001102023650002302034650001002057650001402067650001202081650001702093653001302110653001102123653000802134653000902142653001302151653000802164653001702172653001902189653002502208700005402233700001902287700001802306700001902324773013902343856008302482852000902565655001202574IND60722473220221121032337.0210608e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072247322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaim.2020.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWele, Asmita1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3104-160110aNanoparticles of biotite mica as KrishnaVajraAbhraka Bhasma: synthesis and characterization  ap. 269-282.  aBio-inorganic nanoparticles or metal nanoparticles are used in medicine for diagnostic and treatment purposes. The nanomedicines from traditional Ayurvedic system are termed as bhasma. Rasashastra, the branch of inorganic medicines of Ayurveda, has documented monographs of metal-mineral bhasmas as potent drugs. However there is lack of scientific analytical data of the end products.Present study was aimed at finding out the morphological, structural, elemental and chemical composition of the Krishna vajra abhraka bhasma (KVB).Bhasma of KVB (Biotite Mica) was prepared in our laboratory using biotite mica sheets befitting selection criteria and carrying out further processes with strict SOPs as per AFI.The bhasma complied with the confirmatory tests from Rasashastra. The physical and physicochemical tests correlate with the results obtained by instrumental analytical methods. SEM revealed square shaped nanoparticles of mean size of 92.3 nm. EDAX showed presence of Si, Mg, O, Fe, Ca, Na, C, K and Al. XRD revealed the crystalline nature of bhasma with mixture of various individual oxides and spinel shape of the crystal. DLS showed that the nanoparticles are unimodal in nature. FTIR and NMR showed the organic functional groups obtained from cow milk and selected herbs, indicating unique bio-inorganic nature of the KVB.The therapeutic potential imparted to the formulation could be due to the cow milk and specific herbs utilized during the manufacturing process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAyurvedic medicine 3aanalytical methods 3abiotite 3achemical composition 3adrugs 3aherbs 3alaboratories 3amanufacturing 3amica 3amoieties 3ananomedicine 3ananoparticles 3aoxides 3aselection criteria 3ashape 3asynthesis 3atesting 3atherapeutics 0aAyurveda 0aBhasma 0aDLS 0aFTIR 0aSEM-EDAX 0aXRD 0aNanomedicine 0aOrganometallic 0aRespiratory diseases1 aDe, Sourav1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3014-80841 aDalvi, Madhuri1 aDevi, Nandini1 aPandit, Vijaya0 tJournal of Ayurveda and integrative medicine.g2021 Apr.,  June, v. 12, no. 2 p.269-282dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27111x0975-94767nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaim.2020.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245007300171300001600244520048900260592002800749650003100777650001000808650002200818700001700840700002200857700001900879700002100898700002400919700002000943773011100963856008201074852000901156655001201165IND60590344320221120123133.0180619e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059034432DNAL7 a10.1007/s11418-005-0028-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKomai, Shin-ichirou10aNew penicillide derivatives isolated from Penicillium simplicissimum  ap. 185-190.  aTwo new penicillide derivatives, secopenicillides A (3) and B (4), were isolated along with penicillide (1) and purpactin A (2), and altenusin (5) and dehydroaltenusin (6), the antifungal substances of this fungus, from the extract of Penicillium simplicissimum IFM 53375.

We first constructed the antennal transcriptome database of A. confusum. In total, we obtained 48,262,304 clean reads from the dataset and assembled 24,324 unigenes. A total of 12,690 (52.17%) unigenes indicated significant similarity (E-value < 10⁻⁵) compared to known protein sequences of other species from the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Gene ontology (GO) and cluster of orthologous groups (COG) analyses were used to determine the functional categories of these genes. A total of 84 putative chemosensory genes were identified from the antennal transcriptome of A. confusum, including 11 putative odorant-binding protein (OBP) genes, six chemosensory protein (CSP) genes, 44 olfactory receptor (OR) genes (including one olfactory co-receptor, Orco), 19 ionotropic receptor (IR) genes, and four sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMP) genes. Results of qPCR assays indicated that among of 11 AconOBPs, nine AconOBP genes were significantly expressed in the antennae of A. confusum adults. AconOBP8 was significantly expressed in the abdomen and AconOBP10 was highly expressed in the thorax. These findings can build a basis for further study on the processes of chemosensory perception in A. confusum at the molecular level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBraconidae 3aGlyphodes pyloalis 3aPyralidae 3aabdomen 3adata collection 3aendoparasitoids 3agene ontology 3amulberries 3anatural enemies 3aodorant receptors 3aolfactory receptors 3aparasitic wasps 3asensory neurons 3athorax 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aunigenes 3awasps 0aAulacocentrum confusum 0aParasitic wasp 0aAntennal transcriptome 0aChemosensory genes 0aExpression patterns1 aChen, Hong-chao1 aHong, Tian-le1 aYan, Meng-wen1 aWang, Jiao1 aShao, Zuo-min1 aWu, Fu-an1 aSheng, Sheng1 aWang, Jun0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Dec., v. 40 p.100881-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12415x1744-117X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbd.2021.1008813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02192naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159300001800261520125400279592002801533650003001561650001101591650002201602650001201624700001401636700001601650700002001666773012101686856007401807852000901881655001201890IND60640051020221122005806.0190504e20160119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064005102DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra18739g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Zhifeng10aLinking photoluminescence of α-Si₃N₄ to intrinsic point defects via band structure modelling  ap. 7568-7574.  aPhotoluminescence (PL) property data for reported α-Si₃N₄ to date are scattered and it is difficult to clarify the reason only through experimental study. In this paper, the relationship between photoluminescence and intrinsic point defects in α-Si₃N₄ has been established accordingly via band structure modelling based on density functional theory calculation. The results show that band structures of α-Si₃N₄ are significantly affected by the locations of defect levels, which are changed with various partial atomic structures around point defects. Formation energies are also calculated to determine the main types of intrinsic point defects in α-Si₃N₄ under different conditions (Si-rich or N-rich). The results suggest that multiple types of intrinsic point defects coexist in α-Si₃N₄, leading to various electronic transition modes. Furthermore, combined with the calculated results, the discrete photoluminescence data for α-Si₃N₄ are revealed by electronic transition modes under different conditions. The main visible luminescent peaks are attributed to the electron transitions of Ec → Si˙ σ and Si˙ σ → Eᵥ for Si abundant α-Si₃N₄, while N₄⁺ → N₂⁰ for N plentiful α-Si₃N₄.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3amodels 3aphotoluminescence 3asilicon1 aChen, Fei1 aShen, Qiang1 aZhang, Lianmeng0 tRSC advances.g2016 Jan. 19, v. 6, no. 9 p.7568-7574dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra18739g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008200169300001600251520151300267592002801780650002801808650002801836650003001864650001901894650001101913650002601924650002501950650001801975650002101993650001302014650002302027650000702050650001502057650001602072700002202088700002002110773010202130856008102232852000902313655001202322IND60577612620221121044640.0170809e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057761262DNAL7 a10.1007/s12560-017-9296-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaburlin, Delfina10aChanges in Environmental Conditions Modify Infection Kinetics of Dairy Phages  ap. 270-276.  aLatent period, burst time, and burst size, kinetic parameters of phage infection characteristic of a given phage/host system, have been measured for a wide variety of lactic acid bacteria. However, most studies to date were conducted in optimal growth conditions of host bacteria and did not consider variations due to changes in external factors. In this work, we determined the effect of temperature, pH, and starvation on kinetic parameters of phages infecting Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. For kinetics assessment, one-step growth curves were carried out in MRS broth at optimal conditions (control), lower temperature, pH 6.0 and 5.0 (MRS₆ and MRS₅, respectively), or in medium lacking carbon (MRSN) or nitrogen (MRSC) sources. Phage infection was progressively impaired as environmental conditions were modified from optimal. At lower temperature or pH, infection was delayed, as perceived by longer latent and burst times. Burst size, however, was lower, equal or higher than for controls, but this effect was highly dependent on the particular phage–host system studied. Phage infection was strongly inhibited in MRSC, but only mildly impaired in MRSN. Nevertheless, growth of all the bacterial strains tested was severely compromised by starvation, without significant differences between MRSC and MRSN, indicating that nitrogen compounds are specifically required for a successful phage infection, beyond their influence on bacterial growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLeuconostoc mesenteroides 3abacteriophages 3acarbon 3aenvironmental factors 3alactic acid bacteria 3alatent period 3amicrobial growth 3anitrogen 3anitrogen compounds 3apH 3astarvation 3atemperature1 aQuiberoni, Andrea1 aMercanti, Diego0 tFood and environmental virology.g2017 Sept., v. 9, no. 3 p.270-276dSpringer USx1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-017-9296-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006100167500002200228520040400250592002800654650001400682650001400696650002300710650002300733650002200756650001500778650001100793650002100804653002600825653002300851653002400874653003100898700001700929700001500946700001700961700002200978700001301000700001901013773007901032856008201111852000901193655001201202IND60656952220221119142221.0190822e20190807xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065695222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2019.1305152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bing-Jie10aErythrina alkaloids from leaves of Erythrina arborescens  aPre-press version  aContinued interest in Erythrina alkaloids resulted in the isolation of 38 alkaloids including 7 undescribed ones from the leaves of Erythrina arborescens Roxburgh.

Intensive pulsed light (IPL) as a non‐heat‐treatment method can reduce enzyme activity by changing the enzyme structure. Therefore, in this study, the use of IPL pretreatment before drying was aimed to reduce the adverse reactions caused by the browning reaction during the drying processing of shiitake mushrooms. RESULTS: Shiitake mushrooms pretreated with 25 pulses of IPL energy of 400 J reduced the initial polyphenol oxidase enzyme activity, the browning index, and browning degree values by 42.83%, 43.02%, and 47.54% respectively. The IPL pretreatment enhanced the polysaccharides and reducing sugars contents and it reduced 5‐hydroxymethylfurfural generation in the dried shiitake mushrooms. The pretreatment also improved the surface color, the antioxidant activity, and retained the umami taste characteristics in the dried shiitake mushroom. CONCLUSION: The IPL pretreatment combined with controlled temperature and humidity for convection drying could be a suitable method to improve the quality of dried shiitake mushrooms. Therefore, this study provides a new pretreatment method for materials that are prone to browning during drying. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  a18030701152cAnhui Science and Technology Department  a2018‐26cJiangsu Science and Technology Department  aBE2019366cJiangsu Science and Technology Department  aNational Key Research and Development Program ofcMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China  a2016YFD0400705‐04cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China  a2017YFD0400903‐01cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China 3aagriculture 3aantioxidant activity 3acatechol oxidase 3acolor 3aconvection 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3ahumidity 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amarkets 3amushrooms 3apolysaccharides 3ataste 3atemperature 3aumami1 aYagoub, Abu ElGasim A1 aSun, Yanhui1 aS Mujumdar, Arun1 aMa, Haile1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1604-03871 aWahia, Hafida1 aZhou, Cunshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9119-39410 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Oct., v. 101, no. 13 p.5608-5617dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.112123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009900163300001600262500001100278500001500289520214100304592002802445650002102473650000902494650001502503650001602518650001702534650000902551650001102560650001802571650001202589650001802601650001902619650001202638650001002650653002202660700002502682700001802707773010202725856008102827852000902908655001202917IND60577612920221120100947.0170809e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057761292DNAL7 a10.1007/s12560-017-9303-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Nigel10aPotential Approaches to Assess the Infectivity of Hepatitis E Virus in Pork Products: A Review  ap. 243-255.  aReview  a2019-12-06  aThe zoonotic transmission of hepatitis E, caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV), is an emerging issue. HEV appears common in pigs (although infected pigs do not show clinical signs), and evidence suggests that a number of hepatitis E cases have been associated with the consumption of undercooked pork meat and products. Little information is available on whether cooking can eliminate HEV, since there is currently no robust method for measuring its infectivity. HEV infectivity can be clearly demonstrated by monitoring for signs of infection (e.g., shedding of virus) in an animal model. However, this approach has several disadvantages, such as lack of reproducibility and unsuitability for performing large numbers of tests, high costs, and not least ethical considerations. Growth in cell culture can unambiguously show that a virus is infectious and has the potential for replication, without the disadvantages of using animals. Large numbers of tests can also be performed, which can make the results more amenable to statistical interpretation. However, no HEV cell culture system has been shown to be applicable to all HEV strains, none has been standardized, and few studies have demonstrated their use for measurement of HEV infectivity in food samples. Nonetheless, cell culture remains the most promising approach, and the main recommendation of this review is that there should be an extensive research effort to develop and validate a cell culture-based method for assessing HEV infectivity in pork products. Systems comprising promising cell lines and HEV strains which can grow well in cell culture should be tested to select an assay for effective and reliable measurement of HEV infectivity over a wide range of virus concentrations. The assay should then be harnessed to a procedure which can extract HEV from pork products, to produce a method suitable for further use. The method can then be used to determine the effect of heat or other elimination processes on HEV in pork meat and products, or to assess whether HEV detected in any surveyed foodstuffs is infectious and therefore poses a risk to public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOrthohepevirus A 3apork 3amonitoring 3ahepatitis E 3acell culture 3aheat 3aethics 3apathogenicity 3aviruses 3aanimal models 3aviral shedding 3acooking 3aswine 0aHepatitis E virus1 aD’Agostino, Martin1 aJohne, Reimar0 tFood and environmental virology.g2017 Sept., v. 9, no. 3 p.243-255dSpringer USx1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-017-9303-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016300160300002000323520163000343592002801973650002202001650002302023650001202046650001702058650000902075650001902084650001302103650002502116650001802141700002002159700002302179700001802202700002402220773012502244856007402369852000902443655001202452IND60669550220221119172959.0190920e20190918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066955022DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra06073a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSawato, Tsukasa10aFormation and dissociation of synthetic hetero-double-helix complex in aqueous solutions: significant effect of water content on dynamics of structural change  ap. 29456-29462.  aA 1 : 1 mixture of the ethynylhelicene pseudoenantiomers (M)-tetramer and (P)-pentamer, which possess hydrophilic terminal tri(ethyleneglycol) (TEG) groups, changes their structures in the water–THF (10 μM) solvent system between dissociated random-coils and an associated hetero-double-helix upon heating and cooling. A small change in water content between 30 and 33% significantly affects the dynamics of structural changes. At 30% water content, heating to 60 °C causes rapid formation of random-coil and cooling to 10 °C causes the rapid formation of hetero-double-helix, accompanied by repeated changes in Δε at 369 nm between 0 and −2000 cm⁻¹ M⁻¹. Heating and cooling experiments at constant rates between 60 and 10 °C resulted in sigmoidal curves in Δε/temperature profiles, which indicate rapid structural changes. Different phenomena occurred at 33% water content. Heating to 60 °C and cooling to 0 °C initially induced changes in Δε between 0 and −2000 cm⁻¹ M⁻¹, and repeated cycles gradually reduced the range between 0 and −500 cm⁻¹ M⁻¹. Heating and cooling experiments at constant rates between 60 and 10 °C caused small changes in Δε, and repeated cycles at 10 °C gradually increased Δε to −500 cm⁻¹ M⁻¹. These phenomena involved rapid changes in molecular structure and slow structural changes in the water–THF solvent system. The sharp switching of the dynamics of structural changes at water content between 30 and 33% indicated discontinuous structural changes in the hydration of TEG and/or in water clusters in the vicinity of oligomer molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical structure 3acooling 3adissociation 3aheat 3ahydrophilicity 3asolvents 3atemperature profiles 3awater content1 aYuzawa, Ryosuke1 aKobayashi, Higashi1 aSaito, Nozomi1 aYamaguchi, Masahiko0 tRSC advances.g2019 Sept. 18, v. 9, no. 50 p.29456-29462dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra06073a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245013400202500002000336520180400356592002802160596004702188650001502235650002402250650001302274700005302287700005702340700006002397773013602457856007702593852000902670655001202679IND60790222220221122004947.0220824e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079022222DNAL7 a10.1029/2020JB0199172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoigtländer, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7881-436810aConstraining Internal States in Progressive Rock Failure of Carrara Marble by Measuring Residual Strains With Neutron Diffraction  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aKnowledge of the internal state of rock is key to anticipate its rheological response and susceptibility to external factors. Time‐dependent failure in rock is controlled by internal state changes, like damage accumulation or strength degradation. But assessing internal states and changes thereof, nondestructively and independent of external forcing is not straightforward. Residual strains, measured with neutron diffraction techniques are used as a proxy for the internal state in material sciences. We investigated its potential for progressive rock failure by measuring residual strain states of an untested and three mechanically and chemomechanically pretested Carrara marble samples. We collected neutron diffraction data for three crystal lattice planes {10̅14}, {0006}, and {11̅20}. Measurements showed an initial overall contractional spatially homogeneous residual unit cell volume strain state of about −400 μstrain, though magnitudes were strongly partitioned among measured crystal lattice planes. However, they are equal within the spatial orientations of the intact sample. For the pretested samples, the induction and relaxation of strains varied spatially with the pretesting stress field and environmental conditions. The vertical extent of superposition of the initial residual strain state was greatest in wet samples, the magnitude of induced extensional strain highest in the dry sample. This indicates chemomechanically enhanced subcritical crack growth with concomitant residual strain relaxation as well as the mitigation of extensional strain built up by the presence of water during pretesting. Our experiments show that residual strain has a significant potential to provide insights into past and actual internal states to anticipate progressive rock failure.  aPublisher supplied data  a1‐02‐149cInstitut Laue-Langevin (ILL) 3ageophysics 3aneutron diffraction 3aresearch1 aLeith, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4484-004X1 aWalter, J.

Twenty-seven bacteriophages against B. cereus were isolated from various Korean traditional fermented foods and soils. Plaque size, transmission electron microscopy, virulence profile, and in vitro lytic activity of bacteriophage isolates were examined. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed B. cereus bacteriophages belonging to the family Siphoviridae. Among B. cereus bacteriophages with broad host range, 18 isolates (66.7%) did not harbor any B. cereus virulence factors. Among them, bacteriophage strain CAU150036, CAU150038, CAU150058, CAU150064, CAU150065, and CAU150066 effectively inhibited B. cereus in vitro within 1 h. Therefore, they are considered potential candidates for controlling the contamination of B. cereus in food or other applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aSiphoviridae 3abacteriophages 3afermented foods 3ahost range 3asoil 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avirulence1 aSeo, Dong Joo1 aJeon, Su Been1 aPark, Hyunkyung1 aJeong, Suntak1 aChun, Hyang Sook1 aOh, Mihwa1 aChoi, Changsun0 tFood and environmental virology.g2017 Sept., v. 9, no. 3 p.260-269dSpringer USx1867-03347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12560-017-9284-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02885naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015000156300001800306500002000324520152100344592002801865650001801893650002001911650001601931650001001947650003001957650001501987650001402002650001502016650000902031700001402040700001602054700001602070700005702086700001502143700005702158700001402215773015102229856007402380852000902454655001202463IND60749847320221121003228.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074984732DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.111812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Shumao10aLactulose significantly increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Blautia in mice feces as revealed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing  ap. 5721-5729.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Lactulose was one of the earliest prebiotics to be identified.

The relative abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly increased, while that of Bacteroidetes was significantly decreased after lactulose intervention. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium belonging to Actinobacteria was significantly increased, and that of Alistipes belonging to Bacteroidetes was decreased in both low‐dose and high‐dose groups. The relative abundance of Blautia was significantly increased from 0.2% to 7.9% in the high‐dose group and one strain of Blautia producta was isolated from the mice feces. However, the strain could not utilize lactulose. CONCLUSION: Overall, the microbial diversity was decreased after lactulose treatment, with significant increases in the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium. We also provide a strategy to increase the relative abundance of Blautia in the intestine by lactulose feeding at high doses, although the mechanism is not revealed. This will help us understand the prebiotic effect of lactulose on the host health. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aBifidobacterium 3aagriculture 3afeces 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alactulose 3aprebiotics 3arisk1 aGu, Jiayu1 aLiu, Xuemei1 aLi, Dongyao1 aMao, Bingyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6342-12541 aZhang, Hao1 aZhao, Jianxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4516-07991 aChen, Wei0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2021 Oct., v. 101, no. 13 p.5721-5729dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.111813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245009000177520175600267592002802023650001202051650001902063650000902082650001602091650001602107650001502123650000902138653002302147653003002170653003302200653002002233653001102253700001702264700002202281700001802303773009602321856008902417852000902506655001202515IND60749347820221119135633.0220124e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074934782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1057222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, Philipp10aEcosystem-based adaptation in cities: Use of formal and informal planning instruments  aExtreme weather events like heavy rainfall and heat waves will likely increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change. As the impacts of these extremes are particularly prominent in urban agglomerations, cities face an urgent need to develop adaptation strategies. Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) provides helpful strategies that harness ecological processes in addition to technical interventions. EbA has been addressed in informal adaptation planning. Formal municipality planning, namely landscape planning, is supposed to include traditionally some EbA measures, although adaptation has not been their explicit focus. Our research aims to investigate how landscape plans incorporate climate-related extremes and EbA as well as to discuss the potential to enhance EbA uptake in formal planning. We conducted a document analysis of informal planning documents from 85 German cities and the analysis of formal landscape plans of 61 of these cities. The results suggest that city size does affect the extent of informal planning instruments and the comprehensiveness of formal landscape plans. Climate-related extremes and EbA measures have traditionally been part of landscape planning. Almost all landscape plans address heat stress, while climate change and heavy rain have been addressed less often, though more frequently since 2008. Greening of walls and roofs, on-site infiltration and water retention reveal significant potential for better integration in landscape plans. Landscape planning offers an entry point for effective climate adaptation through EbA in cities. Informal and formal planning instruments should be closely combined for robust, spatially explicit, legally binding implementation of EbA measures in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aland policy 3alandscapes 3arain 0aLandscape planning 0aClimate change adaptation 0aInformal and formal planning 0aExtreme weather 0aCities1 aWalz, Ariane1 aAlbert, Christian1 aLipp, Torsten0 tLand use policy.g2021 Oct., v. 109 p.105722-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2021.1057223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006100150245015700211300001800368500001900386520131300405592002801718650003701746650001101783650002701794650001301821650001001834650001101844650002101855650001301876650001701889700003301906700002601939700002301965700002101988700007302009700002102082700002302103773011402126856008402240852000902324655001202333IND60694384020210903000000.0200513e20200421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069438402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c005442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaketa, Thiago B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4861-100610aTracking Sulfonated Polystyrene Diffusion in a Chitosan/Carboxymethyl Cellulose Layer-by-Layer Film: Exploring the Internal Architecture of Nanocoatings  ap. 4985-4994.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSince chitosan presents the ability to interact with a wide range of molecules, it has been one of the most popular natural polymers for the construction of layer-by-layer thin films. In this study, depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to track the diffusion of sulfonated polystyrene (SPS) in carboxymethyl cellulose/chitosan (CMC/Chi) multilayers. Our findings suggest that the CMC/Chi film does not constitute an electrostatic barrier sufficient to block diffusion of SPS, and that diffusion can be controlled by adjusting the diffusion time and the molecular weight of the polymers that compose the CMC/Chi system. In addition to monitoring the diffusion, it was also possible to observe a process of preferential interaction between Chi and SPS. Thus, the nitrogen N 1s peak, due to functional groups found exclusively in chitosan chains, was the key factor to identifying the molecular interactions involving chitosan and the different polyanions. Accordingly, the presence of a strong polyanion such as SPS shifts the N 1s peak to a higher level of binding energy. Such results highlight that understanding the fundamentals of polymer interactions is a major step to fine-tuning the internal architecture of LbL structures for specific applications (e.g., drug release).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanions 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3achitosan 3adrugs 3aenergy 3amolecular weight 3anitrogen 3apolystyrenes1 aRocha Neto, João Batista M.1 ados Santos, Danilo M.1 aFiamingo, Anderson1 aBeppu, Marisa M.1 aCampana Filho, Sérgio Paulo,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0980-00851 aCohen, Robert E.1 aRubner, Michael F.0 tLangmuir.g2020 Apr. 21, v. 36, no. 18 p.4985-4994dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c005443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01452naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245007900169300001600248520049300264592002800757653002300785653002200808653001300830653001800843653001800861653001300879653001300892700001800905773012800923856007801051852000901129655001201138IND60130095320221121042752.0151127e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013009532DNAL7 a10.2994/057.005.03042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArredondo, Juan Camilo12aA New Species of Epictia (Serpentes: Leptotyphlopidae) from Central Brazil  ap. 189-198.  aA new species of blindsnake is described from the gallery forests of the Brazilian Cerrado.

However, a key point for the use of Co ions is that their release profile should be controllable and, more importantly, suitable for the bone regeneration process. Here, 2-ethylimidazole (eIm) was introduced into zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67) to slow down Co-ion release and fabricate eIm-doped ZIF-67 (eIm/ZIF-67), which was combined into gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) to obtain an in situ photo-cross-linking nanocomposite hydrogel as a tunable Co-ion controlled release system. A tunable and controlled release of Co ions from the nanocomposite hydrogel was achieved by variation of linker composition, and GelMA with 75% eIm/ZIF-67 (with 75% eIm in the precursor solutions) could maintain a 21-day sustained release of Co ions, which is matched with early-stage angiogenesis during the bone formation process. Our in vitro study also showed that the GelMA@eIm/ZIF-67 hydrogel could reduce cytotoxicity and effectively promote the angiogenic activity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Moreover, an in vivo rat calvarial defect model demonstrated that the GelMA@eIm/ZIF-67 hydrogel exhibited remarkably enhanced bone formation and neovascularization abilities and had good biocompatibility as shown in organ histopathological examinations. Therefore, this novel nanocomposite hydrogel has strong therapeutic potential as a desirable Co-ion controlled release system and a powerful proangiogenic/osteogenic agent for the treatment of bone defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abiocompatibility 3abone formation 3abone marrow 3acobalt 3acoordination polymers 3acytotoxicity 3agelatin 3ahistopathology 3ahydrogels 3ahypoxia 3amodels 3ananocomposites 3atherapeutics 0ametal−organic framework 0alinker doping 0acobalt ions 0acontrolled release 0abone regeneration1 aLiu, Xuanzhe1 aZhu, Yu1 aHan, Yue1 aShen, Junjie1 aBao, Bingbo1 aGao, Tao1 aLin, Junqing1 aHuang, Tengli1 aXu, Jia1 aChai, Yimin1 aZheng, Xianyou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9770-53940 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Nov. 30, v. 13, no. 49 p.59051-59066dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c163003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013800182300001600320520163700336592002801973650002102001650002902022650001102051650001502062650002602077650001202103650001702115650001902132650002302151650001002174650001002184650001102194650001502205650001502220650003102235650001502266650001102281650001202292650001702304650001802321650002702339650001502366651001402381653000902395653001502404653001102419653001502430653002302445700002502468700003502493700002702528700006402555773010002619856008602719852000902805655001202814IND60538003720221120183637.0190412e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053800372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRautenberg, Gisela Evelín12aA multi-level approach using Gambusia affinis as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of Suquía River  ap. 706-720.  aThe Suquía River middle-lower basin (Córdoba, Argentina) is subjected to a strong anthropogenic impact because it receives pollutants from different sources. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the introduced fish species Gambusia affinis as a bioindicator of environmental pollution in the middle-lower basin of the Suquía River. The assessment was performed by measuring biomarkers at different levels of biological organization, at two sampling sites (before and after Córdoba city), and at dry and wet seasons. Water quality evaluation was made through a water-quality index (based on physico-chemical parameters), heavy-metals and pesticides concentrations in water. The water quality varied between sampling sites, showing the most degraded conditions downstream Córdoba city. The same pattern of variation was detected in the biomarkers studied, mainly in: gill and liver histopathological indexes, copulatory organ (gonopodium) morphology and vitellogenin expression in males and females. The present study characterized the environmental conditions in the middle-lower basin of the Suquía River and revealed the low freshwater quality at the most polluted site. Although G. affinis is an introduced species, it could be considered a good sentinel of water resource quality of invaded Neotropical basins. Our results demonstrated the importance of addressing the environmental quality monitoring through an integrated analysis of water quality parameters together with histological, morphological and molecular parameters. Thus, our study provides a good model for application in other basins of South America.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGambusia affinis 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3abiomarkers 3aenvironmental factors 3afemales 3aheavy metals 3ahistopathology 3aintroduced species 3aliver 3amales 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apesticides 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3arivers 3atropics 3avitellogenin 3awater quality 3awater quality analysis 3awet season 3aArgentina 0aFish 0aBiomarkers 0aMetals 0aPesticides 0aFreshwater quality1 aAmé, María Valeria1 aMonferrán, Magdalena Victoria1 aBonansea, Rocío Inés1 aHued, Andrea Cecilia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4866-33670 tEcological indicators.g2015 Jan., v. 48 p.706-720dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.09.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245009800175520136100273592002801634650001701662650001601679650001001695650001501705650002101720650001201741650000901753650002101762650001201783650001601795700001701811700002501828700001801853773012701871856007401998852000902072655001202081IND60652831520221122054724.0190713e20190304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065283152DNAL7 a10.3390/su110513342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnhill-Dilling, S.  Kathleen10aSustainability as a Framework for Considering Gene Drive Mice for Invasive Rodent Eradication  aGene drives represent a dynamic and controversial set of technologies with applications that range from mosquito control to the conservation of biological diversity on islands. Currently, gene drives are being developed in mice that may one day serve as an important tool for reducing invasive rodent pests, a key threat to island biodiversity and economies. Gene drives in mice are still in development in laboratories, and wild release of modified mice is likely a distant reality. However, technological changes outpace the existing capacity of regulatory frameworks, and thus require integrated governance frameworks. We suggest sustainability&mdash;which gives equal consideration to the environment, economy, and society&mdash;as one framework for addressing complexity and uncertainty in the governance of emerging gene drive technologies for invasive species management. We explore the impacts of rodent gene drives on island environments, including potential conservation and restoration of island biodiversity. We outline considerations for rodent gene drives on island economies, including impacts on agricultural and tourism losses, and reductions in biosecurity costs. Finally, we address the social dimension as an essential space for deliberation that will be integral to evaluating the potential deployment of gene drive rodents on islands.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiosecurity 3agenes 3agovernance 3ainvasive species 3aislands 3amice 3amosquito control 3atourism 3auncertainty1 aSerr, Megan 1 aBlondel, Dimitri  V.1 aGodwin, John 0 tSustainability.g2019 Mar. 04, v. 11, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110513343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013700174500001900311520123500330592002801565650001501593650001101608650001201619650001101631653000801642653001501650653002301665653001801688653002801706653003001734700002201764700002201786700002001808773009101828856008501919852000902004655001202013IND60701002820221123041837.0210201e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070100282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1182232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYıldız, Çağatay10aNumerical investigation of natural convection behavior of molten PCM in an enclosure having rectangular and tree-like branching fins  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn phase-change applications, once the melting process is completed, the natural convective heat transfer of liquid material may be promoted or degraded by the fins, which is the main motivation of this research. For this reason, the natural convection heat transfer inside a PCM container that can be a representative model for PV/PCM systems is numerically investigated in this study by considering three aspect ratios (AR = 1, 2 and 4), three Rayleigh numbers (Ra = 10⁴, 10⁵ and 10⁶), two types of fins as rectangular and tree-like branching fin, and three different length-to-height ratio of rectangular fin (w/H = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5). The rates of increment and decrement are presented taking the finless enclosure as the reference case. The computed results revealed that the natural convection is promoted up to 20%, depending on Ra and fin length by the inclusion of fins when the AR = 1, while it is degraded down by 5.5% for AR = 4. Interestingly, at AR = 2, the percentage increase and decrease of mean Nu numbers are slighter compared to other aspect ratios. Besides, it is also noticed in this study that utilizing a tree-like branching fin is not as effective as a rectangular fin with the same mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3aenergy 3aliquids 3amodels 0aFin 0aMolten PCM 0aNatural convection 0aPV/PCM system 0aTree-like branching fin 0aHeat transfer degradation1 aArıcı, Müslüm1 aNižetić, Sandro1 aShahsavar, Amin0 tEnergy.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 207 p.118223-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1182233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012200172300001300294520191700307592002802224650001502252650001002267650001202277650002202289650001502311650001302326650002202339650001302361650001602374700002202390700002102412700001902433700002002452700003002472700002502502700002102527700002002548700001902568773008202587856008502669990002302754852000902777655001202786IND60093616420221119032150.0141103e20131104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009361642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.08.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, Gavin L.10aInterlaboratory comparison of boron isotope analyses of boric acid, seawater and marine CaCO₃ by MC-ICPMS and NTIMS  ap. 1-14.  aIn this study we make the first attempt to inter-calibrate boron isotope (δ¹¹B) measurements on marine biogenic carbonates measured by four different laboratories, each using a different analytical technique. The importance of such calibrations lies in the major implications of relatively small changes in δ¹¹B (<2‰), which are typical of palaeoclimate applications of the δ¹¹B-pH proxy. Despite the variety of mass spectrometric techniques used by the different laboratories in this study (two variants of negative ion thermal ionisation mass spectrometry and two variants of multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), for samples without a complex sample matrix, such as boric acid, there are no significant interlaboratory biases: the pooled 2sd of these samples is 0.39‰, which is within the measurement uncertainties reported by each laboratory (which range between 0.18 and 0.80‰). For seawater, a common in-house reference material, we find a similarly good agreement (δ¹¹B=39.65±0.41‰, 2sd) despite four different sample preparation procedures. Reported δ¹¹B for calcium carbonate samples have a pooled 2sd of 1.46‰, which is larger than the measurement uncertainty reported by each laboratory. We have attempted to identify the source of this interlaboratory variability, and find that overall sample size (in terms of available B) and B/Ca ratio (i.e. amount of boron relative to matrix) may play a role, but the exact mechanisms remain uncertain. Observed variations in reported δ¹¹B for the CaCO₃ samples are, however, relatively systematic for each laboratory for a given sample matrix (i.e. similar B/Ca and amount of boron for analysis). This implies that relative differences in δ¹¹B in a sample set of a given matrix can be reconstructed by the four laboratories involved in this study more accurately than the absolute boron isotope ratios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboric acid 3aboron 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3aionization 3aisotopes 3amass spectrometry 3aseawater 3auncertainty1 aHönisch, Bärbel1 aParis, Guillaume1 aDwyer, Gary S.1 aRae, James W.B.1 aElliott, T.

It would also be appropriate to monitor the permeation rate through the polymer, composite, and elastomeric layers during the in-service times where applications allow. In the future, any alteration in the short term and long-term transport rates could be analyzed in terms of an initial alteration or degradation of the polymeric materials and, in some cases, metallic components. Crucially, such measurements would serve as an early warning system of any change in a polymeric material that could result in the loss of function of the fluid of a gas containing barrier material. Most experimental determinations are made through recording flux transients (varying flux) through permeation cells in which a polymer membrane or film separates a donor compartment (usually an infinite supply) and an acceptor compartment and in which membrane transport is considered to be slow. Treatment of the resulting experimental data is usually, but not always, undertaken through comparison with a steady-state model based on Fickian diffusion through the membrane, so as to extract the membrane permeability, the diffusion coefficient of the permeant, and the solubility of the permeant in the membrane phase. However, in spite of these measurements being undertaken routinely using closed cell manometric or continuous flow methods, there is a lack of literature in which experimental flux transients are provided, and in several cases, it is clear that the experimental data do not conform to the expected model of slow, Fickian diffusion through the membrane, even though experiments are performed at temperatures much higher than the glass transition temperature of the polymer membrane. In this paper, we first re-examine the classical model for an infinite source and extend it to account for (1) molecular interactions between membrane and permeant, using regular solution theory, (2) slow transport in the acceptor phase, and (3) slow kinetics across the membrane|acceptor interface. We demonstrate that all three aspects can cause permeation flux transients to exhibit unusual, nonclassical waveshapes, which have nevertheless been experimentally realized without rationalization. This enables the development of an algorithmic toolkit for the interpretation of permeation flux transients, so as to provide reliable and accurate data analysis for experimentalists.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3adiffusivity 3adrugs 3aearly warning systems 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aindustry 3amembrane permeability 3amethane 3amodels 3aoils 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3asolubility 3asulfur hexafluoride 3atanks1 aCraster, Bernadette1 aLawrence, Nathan S.1 aKelly, Stephen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0668-62530 tLangmuir.g2020 Apr. 14, v. 36, no. 18 p.5003-5020dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c005893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03102naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245016700177300001600344520178700360592002802147650001802175650001202193650000902205650001502214650000902229650002502238650002202263650001202285653002102297653001602318653001702334653002602351653001302377653001702390653002802407700002502435700002502460773010002485856008602585852000902671655001202680IND60538003920221120183701.0190412e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053800392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeduc, Antoine O.H.C.10aEffects of species vs. functional diversity: Understanding the roles of complementarity and competition on ecosystem function in a tropical stream fish assemblage  ap. 627-635.  aThe positive effects of biodiversity on the functioning of ecosystems are well demonstrated in laboratory microcosms but the precise mechanisms underlying higher ecosystem process rates in natural assemblages are less well understood. We investigated, under semi-natural conditions (field enclosures), the potentially interactive effects of species identity and trophic function (i.e., feeding guild) on consumer growth, using a fish assemblage in a tropical stream. We tested the relative importance of species identity and trophic function on consumer growth by placing 2 fish of either (i) the same species, (ii) different species but of similar trophic function, or (iii) different species of different trophic functions in each of 72 stream enclosures for 48 days and measuring biomass change, individual diet composition and behavior. We predicted that if functional diversity had a larger impact than species diversity, then fish growth would be highest for pairs of species from different functional groups (i.e., those with the highest diet complementarity), intermediate for different species within a guild, and lowest for the same species (those with the lowest complementarity and highest niche overlap), such that functional variation between species in different guilds would exceed functional differences within guilds. Our results show that functional heterogeneity rather than species diversity per se had the greatest impact on food resources used complementarily, leading to higher biomass accrual. Mechanistically, higher growth rates were driven by concomitant increases in resource intake and reductions in antagonistic interactions. Together, these results underscore the importance of functional diversity on macroconsumer production in natural assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal growth 3abiomass 3adiet 3aecosystems 3afish 3afunctional diversity 3aspecies diversity 3astreams 0aTrophic function 0aFish growth 0aBiodiversity 0aNiche complementarity 0aBehavior 0aProductivity 0aAssemblage interactions1 ada Silva, Eduardo M.1 aRosenfeld, Jordan S.0 tEcological indicators.g2015 Jan., v. 48 p.627-635dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010200168520143500270592002801705650002601733650001501759650001901774650001701793650002201810650001601832650002701848650002901875650000901904650001501913650001301928650001601941650000901957650002101966650002101987650001102008650001902019650001602038651001002054653001902064653002902083653002802112653002002140653002002160700001702180700001402197700001402211700001602225700001602241700001602257700001602273773009002289856008502379852000902464655001202473IND60694049020221119182617.0201216e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069404902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1177482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBellocchi, S.10aAnalysis of smart energy system approach in local alpine regions - A case study in Northern Italy  aIncreasing electrification of final uses can be a viable solution towards low-carbon energy systems, when coupled with local renewable power generation. Mountain areas can already benefit from high shares of hydro-power generation, but, at the same time, rely on oil products for transport and for the heating sector in remote areas where natural gas infrastructures are not available. This research work evaluates potential scenarios for the electrification of transport and heating sectors, by coupling the simulation tool EnergyPLAN with a multi-objective optimization algorithm to analyse economic and environmental aspects. Results show that the largest benefits are expected from the electrification of the heating sector. Indeed, a CO₂ emissions reduction up to 30% can be reached by acting on the transport sector alone, while up to 65% combining it with measures on heating, industry and agriculture sectors and additional electricity generation from photovoltaic systems. Moreover, the use of heat pumps can lead to significant CO₂ emissions decrease with only to a slight increase in the overall annual costs thanks to lower variable costs that partly compensate the higher required initial investment and electricity storage deployment. The optimization analyses also highlight the effect of progressive penetration of electric vehicles in the private cars fleet and hydrogen trucks in the light-duty vehicles one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3aalgorithms 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3aelectric vehicles 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3ahydrogen 3anatural gas 3aoils 3apower generation 3asolar collectors 3atrucks 3avariable costs 3awater power 3aItaly 0aEnergy systems 0aRenewable energy sources 0aEnd-use electrification 0aSector coupling 0aDecarbonization1 aDe Iulio, R.1 aGuidi, G.1 aManno, M.1 aNastasi, B.1 aNoussan, M.1 aPrina, M.G.1 aRoberto, R.0 tEnergy.g2020 July 01, v. 202 p.117748-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1177483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001500197245008900212300001600301506007600317520143700393592002801830506003701858650001301895650002601908650001001934650002601944650002401970650001101994650001502005650002402020650001502044650001302059653001502072653002002087653002902107700002602136700001602162700002202178700002302200700001802223700002202241700001802263700002102281700001702302700001402319700002802333700001702361700001902378700002402397700002002421700002102441773007702462856009002539852000902629655001202638IND60564474420221207100329.0170626e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056447442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.03.0232doi7 aPMC48244002pmcid7 a270190262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLevy, Oren12aA prodrug-doped cellular Trojan Horse for the potential treatment of prostate cancer  ap. 140-150.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDespite considerable advances in prostate cancer research, there is a major need for a systemic delivery platform that efficiently targets anti-cancer drugs to sites of disseminated prostate cancer while minimizing host toxicity. In this proof-of-principle study, human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were loaded with poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles (MPs) that encapsulate the macromolecule G114, a thapsigargin-based prostate specific antigen (PSA)-activated prodrug. G114-particles (∼950 nm in size) were internalized by MSCs, followed by the release of G114 as an intact prodrug from loaded cells. Moreover, G114 released from G114 MP-loaded MSCs selectively induced death of the PSA-secreting PCa cell line, LNCaP. Finally, G114 MP-loaded MSCs inhibited tumor growth when used in proof-of-concept co-inoculation studies with CWR22 PCa xenografts, suggesting that cell-based delivery of G114 did not compromise the potency of this pro-drug in-vitro or in-vivo. This study demonstrates a potentially promising approach to assemble a cell-based drug delivery platform, which inhibits cancer growth in-vivo without the need of genetic engineering. We envision that upon achieving efficient homing of systemically infused MSCs to cancer sites, this MSC-based platform may be developed into an effective, systemic ‘Trojan Horse’ therapy for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to sites of metastatic PCa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantigens 3aantineoplastic agents 3adeath 3adrug delivery systems 3agenetic engineering 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3aprostatic neoplasms 3astem cells 3atoxicity 0aStem cells 0aProstate cancer 0aCell-based drug delivery1 aBrennen, W.

Many cases of CA-MRSA spreading to the community have been described worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the features of CA-MRSA isolates from Tenerife Island. Toward this end, one hundred MRSA isolates were collected from eight different health regions, and their molecular features were investigated. This study revealed a wide variety of MRSA clones, including an emergent ST: ST1434 (CC8) and two new spa types, t7575 (ST125) and t7678 (ST22). The PVL genes were found in only five isolates belonging to unrelated lineages, ST8, ST30 and ST22, which could indicate at least three independent introductions of PVL⁺ strains to Tenerife. Moreover, we detected that hospital MRSA clones, like EMRSA-15 and EMRSA-16, had spread to the community and are now circulating in both environments. Therefore, in our study, the CDC’s rules were not specific enough to distinguish CA-MRSA from HA-MRSA. Thus, we think that the current epidemiological information is not enough to discriminate between both MRSAs, and it is necessary for prevention guidelines to include the routine determination of at least the genetic background, the antimicrobial susceptibility profile, and the PVL genes of each MRSA isolate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibiotic resistance 3aclones 3agenes 3agenetic background 3agenetic variation 3aguidelines 3amethicillin 3apatients 3arisk factors 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacterial Typing Techniques 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aCommunity-Acquired Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial 2aFemale 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Variation 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMethicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureusxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aYoung Adult 3aSpain 0aSpainxepidemiology.1 aAlcoba-Flórez, Julia1 aMéndez-Álvarez, Sebastián0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2012 Apr., v. 12, no. 3 p.586-590dElsevier B.V.x1567-13487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2012.02.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04183naa a2201105 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137024002200177024001900199024004700218040001800265100001900283245009600302300001400398506002800412506003600440506007600476506003100552520104000583592002801623596004601651596006001697596011201757596006201869596006801931596004501999506003702044650003602081650001802117650002002135650001402155650002402169650001102193650001402204650001402218650002502232650001702257650002202274650001302296650001402309651000902323651001102332651001802343651001802361653000702379653000902386653000902395653000802404653000602412653001002418653000902428653000802437653000802445653000802453653001002461653000802471653000602479653000602485653000702491653000802498653000802506653001002514653000802524653000902532653000802541653000902549653000802558653000602566653000702572653001102579653000902590653000702599653001002606653000702616653000702623653003002630653003602660653001402696653001802710653001702728653002102745653002102766653001602787700001902803700002302822700001802845773008202863856008702945903002403032852000903056655001203065IND60557020720221207052538.0170710e20161202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055702072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.0232chorus7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.0232doi7 aPMC71114242pmcid7 a272887242pmid7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.0232chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chun-Ming10aEvolution, antigenicity and pathogenicity of global porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains  ap. 20-39.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aEmerging and re-emerging coronaviruses cause morbidity and mortality in human and animal populations, resulting in serious public and animal health threats and economic losses. The ongoing outbreak of a highly contagious and deadly porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Asia, the Americas and Europe is one example. Genomic sequence analyses of PEDV variants have revealed important insights into the evolution of PEDV. However, the antigenic variations among different PEDV strains are less explored, although they may contribute to the failure of PEDV vaccines in Asian countries. In addition, the evolution of PEDV results in variants with distinct genetic features and virulence differences; thus PEDV can serve as a model to explore the molecular mechanisms of coronavirus evolution and pathogenesis. In this article, we review the evolution, antigenic relationships and pathologic features of PEDV strains. This information and review of researches will aid in the development of strategies for control and prevention of PED.  aPublisher supplied data  cMerckdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100004334  cNational Pork Boarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100008370  cOhio Agricultural Research and Development Center Ohio State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100010640  cOhio State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100006928  cOhio State University Pressdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005166  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3aanimal health 3adevelopment aid 3aevolution 3afinancial economics 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogenesis 3asequence analysis 3avaccines 3avirulence 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aSouth America 0aaa 0aCCIF 0aCDCD 0aDPI 0aE 0aELISA 0aFIPV 0aHPI 0aIHC 0aIFN 0aINDEL 0aMAb 0aM 0aN 0ant 0aNTD 0aORF 0aPDCoV 0aPED 0aPEDV 0aPFU 0aPRCV 0aRBD 0aS 0aTC 0aTCID50 0aTGEV 0aUS 0aVH:CD 0aVN 0aWT 0aPorcine epidemic diarrhea 0aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 0aEvolution 0aPathogenicity 0aAntigenicity 0aCross-reactivity 0aCross-protection 0aCoronavirus1 aSaif, Linda J.1 aMarthaler, Douglas1 aWang, Qiuhong0 tVirus research.g2016 Dec. 02, v. 226 p.20-39dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle02028naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245007100134300001600205506002800221520113300249592002801382506003701410650000901447650001201456650002101468653000901489653001101498653001001509653001601519700002801535773014201563852000901705655001201714IND60774356920221207091820.0200306e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077435692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIonescu, Nicolaie10aVariation of early maize cobs with actual morphological characters  ap. 216-222.  aResource is Open Access  aBeing in full swing, studies on the variability of morphological characters, along with biochemical and molecular features, are considered very useful for the improvement of new maize hybrids. Rich genetic dowry and maize crop conditions lead to the characteristic expression of plant morphology. In the case of maize, the hybrid Surterra, some new directions have been found, which has recently been improved, with new morphological characters tendencies. Thus, the cobs had an average length of 17 cm, a thickness of 4 cm and weighed 159 g. The number of grains on the cob was 451, weighed 127 g, and the one thousand grains was 280 g. The cobs had 14 rows of grains, 32 grains/row, and the grain/cob percent was 81%. The grains of this hybrid were 10 mm long, 9 mm wide and 4.6 mm thick. Between the analyzed characters of the cob were mostly positive correlations. Grain percent/cob correlated negatively with most characters, while grain thickness correlated insignificantly with other attributes. The new, early-grading hybrid (FAO 250 group), cultivated, has shown a good adaptability to a new and performing agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorn 3ahybrids 3aplant morphology 0acobs 0agrains 0amaize 0avariability1 aGheorghe, Marian Robert0 tCurrent Trends in Natural Sciences.g2019 July, v. 8, no. 15 p.216-222dEditura Universitatii din PitestiwJournal:27829x2284-953X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011900167300001400286520212000300592002802420650001602448650001602464650001302480650001702493650001902510650001102529650001702540650001402557650002302571650001502594650001002609651001602619653001902635653001302654653001602667653001402683700001902697700001902716700001902735700002702754773009202781856008402873852000902957655001202966IND60535576920221118063103.0210904e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053557692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNo, Elizabeth10aFood references and marketing in popular magazines for children and adolescents in New Zealand: A content analysis  ap. 75-81.  aFood marketing is recognized as an important factor influencing children's food preferences and consumption. The purpose of this study was to examine the nature and extent of unhealthy food marketing and non-branded food references in magazines targeted at and popular among children and adolescents 10–17 years old in New Zealand. A content analysis was conducted of all food references (branded and non-branded) found in the five magazines with the highest readership among 10–17 year olds, and the three magazines (of which two were already included among the five most popular magazines) targeted to 10–17 year olds. For each of the six magazines, one issue per month (n = 72 issues in total) over a one-year period (December 2012–January 2014) was included. All foods referenced were classified into healthy/unhealthy according to the food-based Ministry of Health classification system. Branded food references (30% of total) were more frequent for unhealthy (43%) compared to healthy (25%) foods. Magazines specifically targeted to children and adolescents contained a significantly higher proportion of unhealthy branded food references (n = 51/71, 72%) compared to the most popular magazines among children and adolescents (n = 133/317, 42%), of which most were targeted to women. ‘Snack items’ such as chocolates and ice creams were marketed most frequently (n = 104; 36%), while ‘vegetables and fruits’ were marketed the least frequently (n = 9; 3%). Direct advertisements accounted for 27% of branded food references and 25% of those featured health or nutrition claims. Both branded and non-branded food references were common within magazines targeted at and popular among children and adolescents, and skewed toward unhealthy foods. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of self-regulation in marketing and emphasizes that government regulations are needed in order to curb children's current potential high exposures to unhealthy food marketing. In addition, magazine editors could take socially responsible editorial positions in regard to healthy eating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aadvertising 3achildren 3afood choices 3afood marketing 3afruits 3ahealthy diet 3aice cream 3anutrition labeling 3avegetables 3awomen 3aNew Zealand 0aFood marketing 0aChildren 0aAdolescents 0aMagazines1 aKelly, Bridget1 aDevi, Anandita1 aSwinburn, Boyd1 aVandevijvere, Stefanie0 tAppetite.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 83 p.75-81dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245012800175300001400303520157100317592002801888650001501916650001301931650002001944650001701964650000901981650001201990650002602002650001202028650001602040650000902056650001402065650002802079650001702107650002402124653003002148653002402178653003602202653002002238700001602258700001802274700001502292700001402307700001602321700001702337773007502354856009002429852000902519655001202528IND60564474620221118220459.0170713e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056447462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Liangzhu10aNear-infrared light activation of quenched liposomal Ce6 for synergistic cancer phototherapy with effective skin protection  ap. 13-24.  aCurrent photodynamic therapy (PDT) is suffering from limited efficacy towards hypoxia tumors and severe post-treatment photo-toxicity such as light-induced skin damages. To make PDT more effective in cancer treatment while being patient-comfortable, herein, a hexylamine conjugated chlorin e6 (hCe6) as the photosensitizer together with a lipophilic near-infrared (NIR) dye 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) are co-encapsulated into polyethylene glycol (PEG) shelled liposomes. In the obtained DiR-hCe6-liposome, the photosensitizing effect of hCe6 is quenched by DiR via fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Interestingly, upon irradiation with a 785-nm NIR laser to photobleach DiR, both fluorescence and photodynamic effect of hCe6 in DiR-hCe6-liposome would be activated. Meanwhile, such NIR irradiation applied on tumors of mice with intravenous injection of DiR-hCe6-liposome could result in mild photothermal heating, which in turn would promote intra-tumor blood flow and relieve tumor hypoxia, contributing to the enhanced photodynamic tumor treatment. Importantly, compared to hCe6-loaded liposomes, DiR-hCe6-liposome without being activated by the 785-nm laser shows much lower skin photo-toxicity, demonstrating its great skin protection effect. This work demonstrates a promising yet simple strategy to prepare NIR-light-activatable photodynamic theranostics for synergistic cancer phototherapy, which is featured high specificity/efficacy in tumor treatment with minimal photo-toxicity towards the skin.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood flow 3achlorins 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3aheat 3ahypoxia 3aintravenous injection 3aiodides 3airradiation 3amice 3aneoplasms 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aphototherapy 3apolyethylene glycol 0aNIR light activatable PDT 0aTumor reoxygenation 0aSynergistic cancer phototherapy 0aSkin protection1 aTao, Danlei1 aDong, Ziliang1 aChen, Qian1 aZhao, Yu,1 aLiu, Zhuang1 aChen, Meiwan0 tBiomaterials.g2017 May, v. 127 p.13-24dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2016.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012800187300001800315520165800333592002801991650001202019650002002031650001102051650002502062650003102087650001202118650001202130650001502142650001002157651001602167653002302183653002102206653001202227653001002239653000802249653001202257700002102269700001702290700002402307773013002331856008202461852000902543655001202552IND60517409820221119230228.0190803e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051740982DNAL7 a224438582pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800120008822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadden, Clara EL10aEating in response to hunger and satiety signals is related to BMI in a nationwide sample of 1601 mid-age New Zealand women  ap. 2272-2279.  aTo examine the association between eating in response to hunger and satiety signals (intuitive eating) and BMI. A second objective was to determine whether the hypothesized higher BMI in less intuitive eaters could be explained by the intake of specific foods, speed of eating or binge eating. Cross-sectional survey. Participants were randomly selected from a nationally representative sampling frame. Eating in response to hunger and satiety signals (termed ‘intuitive eating’), self-reported height and weight, frequency of binge eating, speed of eating and usual intakes of fruits, vegetables and selected high-fat and/or high-sugar foods were measured. Nationwide study, New Zealand. Women (n 2500) aged 40–50 years randomly selected from New Zealand electoral rolls, including Māori rolls (66 % response rate; n 1601). Intuitive Eating Scale (IES) scores were significantly associated with BMI in an inverse direction, after adjusting for potential confounding variables. When controlling for confounding variables, as well as potential mediators, the inverse association between intuitive eating (potential range of IES score: 21–105) and BMI was only slightly attenuated and remained statistically significant (5·1 % decrease in BMI for every 10-unit increase in intuitive eating; 95 % CI 4·2, 6·1 %; P < 0·0 0 1). The relationship between intuitive eating and BMI was partially mediated by frequency of binge eating. Eating in response to hunger and satiety signals is strongly associated with lower BMI in mid-age women. The direction of causality needs to be investigated in longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinging 3abody mass index 3afruits 3alongitudinal studies 3arandomized clinical trials 3asatiety 3asurveys 3avegetables 3awomen 3aNew Zealand 0aHunger and satiety 0aIntuitive eating 0aMid-age 0aWomen 0aBMI 0aObesity1 aLeong, Sook Ling1 aGray, Andrew1 aHorwath, Caroline C0 tPublic health nutrition.g2012 Dec., v. 15, no. 12 p.2272-2279dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120008823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01696naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245006500174300001600239520078800255592002801043650002501071650001601096650001101112650002001123650002301143650001301166650002101179651001301200773007701213856008301290852000901373655001201382IND60096837920221118050519.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWisuttisak, Pornchai10aRegulation and competition issues in Thai electricity sector  ap. 185-198.  aThis paper explores the issues related to regulatory reform and liberalisation leading toward competition in the Thai electricity sector, which is still under the monopoly control of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Following an overview of the current market structure of the Thai electricity sector, the process of liberalisation and deregulation that contributes to the uncompetitive market structure under SOEs’ control is examined. The author asserts that there are problems within the Energy Commission and the Energy Industry Act BE 2550 (2007) that contribute to the continuance of an uncompetitive electricity supply. Possible reforms to the Thai electricity regulation are proposed with the aim of creating market competition and efficiency in the Thai electricity sector.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3amarket competition 3amonopoly 3apublic ownership 3aThailand0 tEnergy policy.g2012 May, v. 44 p.185-198dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009600167520132600263592002801589650002101617650001501638650001901653650001701672650001701689650001501706650001701721650002201738650002201760650002001782650001301802653004301815653001701858653001901875653001901894653002001913653002401933700001601957700001701973700005401990700002002044700005202064773009702116856008502213852000902298655001202307IND60770706120221120235702.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077070612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Longqian10aEnhancing Brackish Water Desalination using Magnetic Flow-electrode Capacitive Deionization  aFlow-electrode capacitive deionization (FCDI) is viewed as a potential alternative to the current state-of-the-art electrodriven technology for the desalination of brackish water. However, the key shortcoming of the FCDI is still the discontinuous nature of the electrode conductive network, resulting in low electron transport efficiency and ion adsorption capacity. Here, a novel magnetic field-assisted FCDI system (termed magnetic FCDI) is proposed to enhance brackish water desalination, simply by using magnetic activated carbon (MAC) as flow electrodes. The results show that the assistance from the magnetic field enables a 78.9% – 205% enhancement in the average salt removal rate (ASRR) compared with that in the absence of a magnetic field, which benefits from the artificial manipulation of the flow electrode transport behavior. In long-term tests, the stable desalination performance of magnetic FCDI was also demonstrated with a stable ASRR of 0.70 μmol cm–² min–¹ and energy-normalized removed salt (ENRS) of 8.77 μmol J–¹. In addition, magnetic field also enables the regeneration of the electrode particles from the concentrated electrolyte. In summary, the findings indicate that the magnetic FCDI is an energy-efficient and operation convenient technology for brackish water desalination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abrackish water 3adeionization 3adesalination 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy efficiency 3amagnetic fields 3aresearch 0aFlow-electrode capacitive deionization 0aDesalination 0aBrackish water 0aMagnetic field 0aMagnetic carbon 0aMagnetic separation1 aPeng, Shuai1 aMao, Yunfeng1 aZong, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3776-73821 aZhang, Xiaomeng1 aWu, Deli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8565-07790 tWater research.g2022 June 01, v. 216 p.118290-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02320naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245014700175300001400322520101600336592002801352650001601380650001301396650001101409650001501420650001701435650001701452650001101469650000901480650002501489650000901514650001401523650001201537650002001549650002601569650001701595650001601612650000901628700002301637700002901660773009501689856008101784852000901865655001201874IND60119831720221119184915.0150108e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011983172DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-014-9866-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Tânia A.

Results suggest that the concentrations of some of elements analyzed are not consistent with the values labeled by manufacturers. However, all fall inside the concentration ranges defined by the Portuguese and European legislations, except for Al. The presence of aluminum was detected in all analyzed formulations in an average concentration of 8.25 to 19.75 mg Kg⁻¹. This study also reveals the feasibility of WDXRF for the quantitative analysis of trace mineral nutrients in milk powder samples. Moreover, the approach described herein, using the WDXRF technique in helium mode, presents a new methodological advantage over similar published studies. This technique may represent an option for quality control of milk powder formulations, particularly at their production site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aaluminum 3acopper 3adried milk 3afluorescence 3aheavy metals 3ahelium 3airon 3alaws and regulations 3amilk 3anutrients 3apowders 3aquality control 3aquantitative analysis 3aspectroscopy 3awavelengths 3azinc1 aBrito, José A.

It then describes the two topics most heavily studied in this system, lipid-droplet motility and protein sequestration on droplets, discusses what is known about the molecular players involved, points to open questions, and compares the results from Drosophila embryo studies to what it is known about lipid droplets in other systems.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3abiological properties and phenomena 3adroplets 3alipids 3aorganelles 0aDrosophila embryo 0aLipid droplet 0aMicrotubule motors 0aProtein sequestration0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 Sept., v. 1851, no. 9 p.1156-1185dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2015.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245008700190300001800277520166600295592002801961650001801989650001802007650002202025650001102047650001102058650002602069650001502095650001002110653001002120653001502130653000802145653001702153700002702170700001902197700003002216700002502246773013002271856008202401852000902483655001202492IND60517409920221119230240.0190803e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051740992DNAL7 a224439162pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800120009122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOude Griep, Linda M10aVariety in fruit and vegetable consumption and 10-year incidence of CHD and stroke  ap. 2280-2286.  aConsuming a variety of fruit and vegetables provides many different micronutrients and bioactive compounds. Whether this contributes to the beneficial association between fruit and vegetables and incident CHD and stroke is unknown. Prospective population-based cohort study. The Netherlands. Men and women (n 20 069) aged 20–65 years. Participants completed a validated 178-item FFQ, including nine fruit and thirteen vegetable items. Variety in fruit and vegetables was defined as the sum of different items consumed at least once per 2 weeks over the previous year. Hazard ratios (HR) for variety in relation to incident CHD and stroke were calculated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models additionally adjusted for quantity of fruit and vegetables. Variety and quantity in fruit and vegetables were highly correlated (r = 0·81). Variety was not associated with total energy intake (r = −0·01) and positively associated with nutrient intakes, particularly vitamin C (r = 0·70). During 10 years of follow-up, 245 cases of CHD and 233 cases of stroke occurred. Variety in vegetables (HR per 2 items = 1·05; 95 % CI 0·94, 1·17) and in fruit (HR per 2 items = 1·00; 95 % CI 0·87, 1·15) were not related to incident CHD. Variety in vegetables (HR per 2 items = 0·93; 95 % CI 0·83, 1·04) and in fruit (HR per 2 items = 1·03; 95 % CI 0·89, 1·18) were also not related to incident stroke.

In this work, we report a pH-sensitive polymer (SP), poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether methacrylate)-co-poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-block- poly(propargyl methacrylate-graft-propyl-(4-methoxy-benzylidene)-amine) (p(PMA-PMBA)–b-(p(OEGMA-DMAEMA)), for successful in vitro and in vivo gene transfer. In the physiological condition, the hydrophobization of p(OEGMA-DMAEMA) polycations by p(PMA-PMBA) significantly enhanced the stability of its polyplexes counterpart. In endosomes, the polymer undergoes an acid-triggered hydrophilic transition through the cleavage of benzoic imines, thus allowing the vector to quickly release nucleic acid cargo due to the loss of hydrophobic functionalization. Compared to a pH-insensitive polymer (IP), SP exhibited more significant luciferase plasmid delivery efficiency with HeLa cells in vitro and with in vivo intraventricular brain injections. Therefore, the polymer designed here is a good solution to address the dilemma of stability and cargo release in gene delivery, and may have broad potential applications in therapeutic agent delivery.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ablood serum 3abrain 3acations 3aendosomes 3aethylene glycol 3agene transfer 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aluciferase 3aplasmids 3apolymers 0aGene delivery 0aHydrophobization 0apH sensitive 0aBenzoic imine1 aSellers, Drew L.1 aTan, James-Kevin Y.1 aPeeler, David J.1 aHorner, Philip J.1 aPun, Suzie H.0 tBiomaterials.g2017 May, v. 127 p.89-96dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03960naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100003700188245024900225300001200474506007600486520215100562592002802713506003702741650002402778650001402802650002802816650001002844650001202854650001002866650001402876650001202890650002002902650001602922650003002938650004502968650002203013650002203035651001103057700003303068700003703101700003103138700002903169700003103198700003103229773009203260856008103352852000903433655001203442IND60123824520221207142413.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012382452DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-015-0789-22doi7 aPMC43782262pmcid7 a258898082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira Júnior, Antonio Marques10aEcological aspects and molecular detection of Leishmania DNA Ross (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in terra firme and várzea environments in the Middle Solimões Region, Amazonas State, Brazil  ap. 180.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) are insects of medical importance due to the role that some species play in the transmission of leishmaniasis. This work aimed to study some ecological aspects among sand flies fauna inhabiting two different environments: the várzea (lowland Amazonian forest) and terra firme (upland Amazonian forest), both located in Tefé Municipality, Amazonas State, Braziland to detect Leishmania infection in those phlebotomine populations. METHODS: Sand flies were collected using HP light traps. Collection took place over the course of six months: January, February, April, August, September, and October of 2013. To detect natural infection by Leishmania, DNA samples were extracted from female sand flies and submitted to Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) targeting the kDNA gene; Leishmania species were identified by PCR-RFLP targeting the hsp70 gene and genetic sequencing. RESULTS: In all, 5,716 individuals were collected, and 46 species were identified. Trichophoromyia ubiquitalis (3,330 – 58.26%) and Nyssomyia antunesi (661 – 11.26%) were the most abundant species. Species richness was greater in terra firme environments (42 species) than in the várzea environments (22 species), and forests ecotopes (43 species) were richer than peridomiciles (28 species). DNA of Leishmania was found in Th. ubiquitalis and Psychodopygus davisi, both of which inhabit the terra firme environment and sequencing analysis confirmed the presence of Leishmania (Viannia) lainsoni DNA in Th. ubiquitalis in Tefé Municipality. CONCLUSIONS: The high abundance of Th. ubiquitalis and Ps. davisi and detection of DNA of Leishmania sp. may indicate that both species could be putative vectors for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) in the terra firme environment of Tefé. The sand fly fauna found in várzea is rich and diverse, exhibiting several species, nevertheless the seasonal hydric stress during part of the year that could influence the local diversity, if compared with other studies. This is the first report in Amazonas State of Th. ubiquitalis with presence of L. (V.) lainsoni DNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania lainsoni 3aLutzomyia 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3afauna 3aforests 3agenes 3ahighlands 3ainsects 3akinetoplast DNA 3alight traps 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3aspecies diversity 3aBrazil1 aTeles, Carolina Bioni Garcia1 ade Azevedo dos Santos, Ana Paula1 ade Souza Rodrigues, Moreno1 aMarialva, Eric Fabrício1 aPessoa, Felipe Arley Costa1 aMedeiros, Jansen Fernandes0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.180-180dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0789-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001600295520159700311592002801908596005901936596005901995596007402054650003102128650002202159650002502181650002702206650001602233650002902249650003002278650001202308650001102320650001502331650001802346650001202364650001002376650004302386650002202429650002602451650001602477650001302493650001402506650001702520650004102537650001302578650002002591650001602611650003302627650003702660650001202697700001602709700005102725700001802776700001702794700001802811773013402829856008202963852000903045655001203054IND60672906620221118113638.0191017e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067290662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-019-01774-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jiamin10aMacrolactin a is the key antibacterial substance of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens D2WM against the pathogen Dickeya chrysanthemi  ap. 393-404.  aB. amyloliquefaciens D2WM, a plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria from the Camellia oleifera rhizosphere, exhibits strong antimicrobial activity and has the capacity to promote plant growth, and this study aimed to determine its antibacterial mechanism against the soft rot disease pathogen D. chrysanthemi HBEU-9. The metabolites from D2WM were also identified and purified. The crude extract (CE) of D2WM effectively inhibited the mycelial growth of five fungal species and the growth of five bacterial species. In particular, CE was well able to inhibit walnut blight caused by Xanthomonas arboricola pv. Juglandis, which is an effect that has rarely been reported. Compared with the control, the addition of 0.2%–0.3% CE to the growth medium notably decreased the cell biomass of HBEU-9 and significantly increased the membrane permeability, soluble proteins and reducing sugars of HBEU-9. SEM and TEM analyses revealed that CE could destroy the cell wall and distort cells and decreased the levels of cell-degrading enzymes (Cx, PG and PMG) by 23.4%, 53.8% and 27.5%, respectively. Importantly, CE retained nearly 80% activity after either storage for 7 months at 4 °C or exposure to 121 °C for 30 min. In addition, the most essential antibacterial compound, macrolactin A, was purified and identified from D2WM cultures through column chromatography, semi-preparative HPLC and HPLC-MS. Taken together, our results highlight the potential of B. amyloliquefaciens D2WM as a biocontrol agent against bacterial diseases and the utility of macrolactin A as an antimicrobial compound.  aPublisher supplied data  a31600055cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31671980cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK20160016cOutstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aCamellia oleifera 3aErwinia chrysanthemi 3aXanthomonas arboricola 3aantibiotics 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiological control agents 3abiomass 3ablight 3acell walls 3aculture media 3aenzymes 3afungi 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amembrane permeability 3ametabolites 3amycelium 3apathogens 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aproteins 3areducing sugars 3arhizosphere 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awalnuts1 aLiu, Tingli1 aWei, Mi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5761-39701 aZhu, Zhiqiang1 aLiu, Weixing1 aZhang, Zhilin0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2019 Oct., v. 155, no. 2 p.393-404dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-019-01774-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002500112245011900137300001600256506002800272520127600300592002801576506003701604650001601641650001101657650002501668650002001693653002701713653002501740653002701765653001301792700002501805700002601830700001701856773014101873852000902014655001202023IND60774357520221207091813.0150609e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077435752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiucurel, Constantin12aA model of problem-based learning in a tutorial designed for developing the occupational therapists’ competences  ap. 133-136.  aResource is Open Access  aThe aim of this research is to present a model of problem-based learning (PBL), as a case-based learning, in a tutorial addressed to first year Occupational Therapy (OT) students, level 5 (Bachelor degree). We choose two competences that can be developed by the proposed tutorial, extracted from the TUNING document: a generic competence (Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team) and a specific one (Professional reasoning) and we described the learning outcomes that come from these competences, as knowledge, skills and attitudes. In order to achieve the mentioned competences, we outline some integrated subjects (topics) that need to be learned by the students and we designed the lessons framework. At the end of the tutorial we hope that our students in occupational therapy will be able to understand and to apply an instrument of evaluation of the quality of life (WHOQOL-26), inside a multidisciplinary team-work, remaining with the basic concepts of clinical reasoning in a complex clinical case of an old man with important neuro-vascular comorbidity. This model of PBL in a tutorial designed for developing the occupational therapists’ competences represents an example of good practice in higher education, with large applicability in health sciences.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomorbidity 3amodels 3aoccupational therapy 3aquality of life 0aproblem-based learning 0aoccupational therapy 0aprofessional reasoning 0ateamwork1 aIconaru, Elena Ioana1 aTudor, Mariana Ionela1 aToma, Stefan0 tCurrent Trends in Natural Sciences.g2012 Dec., v. 1, no. 2 p.133-136dEditura Universitatii din PitestiwJournal:27829x2284-953X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03442naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100006000193245011500253300001400368506007600382520162200458592002802080506003702108650002102145650003602166650004002202650001502242650002602257650001302283650002002296650001402316650002602330650001902356650002502375650002002400650002702420650005202447650001302499650001002512650001602522651001002538651001602548651001302564651001802577653002902595653001002624653001602634653001502650653002202665773008202687856008602769852000902855655001202864IND60557021120221207142211.0170710e20161202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055702112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.0282doi7 aPMC71145552pmcid7 a272701292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jianqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7228-620210aPorcine deltacoronavirus: Overview of infection dynamics, diagnostic methods, prevalence and genetic evolution  ap. 71-84.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was first reported in Hong Kong, China in 2012 and reported in United States swine in February 2014. PDCoV has subsequently been detected in South Korea, mainland China, and Thailand. PDCoV has been experimentally confirmed to cause diarrhea in inoculated pigs and need to be differentially diagnosed from porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus in the field. Rapid diagnosis is critical for the implementation of efficient control strategies against PDCoV. Developing high-quality diagnostic methods and understanding PDCoV infection dynamics to collect appropriate specimens at the appropriate time window are important to obtain reliable diagnostic results. Among the virological methods, PDCoV-specific RT-PCR remains the method of choice for the detection of PDCoV; immunohistochemistry combined with hematoxylin and eosin staining has also been commonly used to examine histopathological lesions caused by PDCoV. Serological assays can provide information about previous exposure to PDCoV and also determine antibody responses to infection or vaccination. Prevalence of PDCoV is lower compared to that of PEDV. However, among PDCoV-positive samples, co-infection with other enteric pathogen e.g. PEDV is common. It is also important to understand molecular epidemiology of PDCoV and genetic relationships of global PDCoVs. This review discusses PDCoV infection dynamics and appropriate sample collection for diagnostic testing, the commonly used virological and serological methods for PDCoV diagnosis, prevalence and genetic evolution of PDCoVs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDeltacoronavirus 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3aTransmissible gastroenteritis virus 3aantibodies 3adiagnostic techniques 3adiarrhea 3aenteropathogens 3aevolution 3agenetic relationships 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amixed infection 3amolecular epidemiology 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3aswine 3avaccination 3aChina 3aSouth Korea 3aThailand 3aUnited States 0aPorcine deltacoronavirus 0aPDCoV 0aDiagnostics 0aPrevalence 0aGenetic evolution0 tVirus research.g2016 Dec. 02, v. 226 p.71-84dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016100167520174800328592002802076650004902104650001302153650001302166650001302179650001802192650002102210650001402231650001502245650001502260650002102275650001702296650001302313650001002326653002402336653002902360653002102389653000702410653002902417700001602446700001802462700001502480700001702495700001202512700001902524700001602543700001802559773009702577856008502674852000902759655001202768IND60770706320221120235749.0220523e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077070632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Kecheng10aInorganic anions influenced the photoaging kinetics and mechanism of polystyrene microplastic under the simulated sunlight: Role of reactive radical species  aThe photo-transformation of microplastic (MP) in natural water may involve interactions with various ingredients, but the photoaging kinetics and underlying mechanism are not well understood.

The evolution of carbonyl index value for the photoaged samples conformed to pseudo-first-order kinetic model, and the photoaging rate constant (k) in the presence of inorganic anions at their environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.6 mM, 1.2 mM, 0.1 M and 0.1 mM was calculated to be kHCO₃₋ = 0.0074 d⁻¹, kNO₃₋ = 0.01001 d⁻¹, kCₗ₋ = 0.00783 d⁻¹, and kBᵣ₋ = 0.00888 d⁻¹, which was higher than that in ultrapure water (k=0.00705 d⁻¹). Electron paramagnetic resonance technique and quenching experiments demonstrated that photo-transformation of PS-MP was mainly mediated by indirect photolysis, i.e., the formation of reactive radical species. The photosensitivity of NO₃⁻ promoted more •OH production, thereby accelerated the indirect photoaging of PS-MP. Meanwhile, the presence of halide ions promoted the generation of reactive halogen species, which were also involved in the indirect photoaging of PS-MP. Interestingly, as •OH scavenger, HCO₃⁻ had no inhibitory effect on PS-MP photoaging, attributing to the oxidation of CO₃•⁻. This study provides valuable insights into the understanding of photo-transformation of MPs in natural aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahalogens 3akinetics 3alighting 3amicroplastics 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3aphotoaging 3aphotolysis 3aphotosensitivity 3apolystyrenes 3aresearch 3awater 0aPhotoaging kinetics 0aPolystyrene microplastic 0aInorganic anions 0aOH 0aReactive halogen species1 aSun, Yajiao1 aJiang, Wenjun1 aZhang, Chi1 aDai, Yunchao1 aLiu, Ze1 aWang, Tiecheng1 aGuo, Xuetao1 aJia, Hanzhong0 tWater research.g2022 June 01, v. 216 p.118294-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.1182943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02227naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245015100172300001600323520119000339592002801529650002201557650001801579650001201597650001701609650001501626650001601641651001301657651001801670651001501688700001701703773007701720856008301797852000901880655001201889IND60096838220221118050459.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.01.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurns, John Edward10aComparative economic analysis of supporting policies for residential solar PV in the United States: Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) potential  ap. 217-225.  aNumerous studies and market reports suggest that the solar photovoltaic markets rely heavily, if not entirely, upon governmental support policies at present. Unlike in other countries where these policies are enacted at a national level, the 50 states in the US pursue different policies in an attempt to foster the growth of renewable energy, and specifically solar photovoltaics. This paper provides an economic and financial analysis of the US federal and state level policies in states with solar-targeted policies that have Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SREC) markets. After putting a value on SRECs, this study further compares solar carve-outs with other incentives including the federal tax credit, net metering, and state personal tax credits. Our findings show that SREC markets can certainly be strong, with New Jersey, Delaware, and Massachusetts having the most potential. Despite their strong potential as effective renewable policies, the lack of a guaranteed minimum and the uncertainty attached are major drawbacks of SREC markets. However, the leveraging of this high value offers hope that the policies will indeed stimulate residential solar photovoltaic markets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic analysis 3aenergy policy 3amarkets 3asolar energy 3atax credit 3auncertainty 3aDelaware 3aMassachusetts 3aNew Jersey1 aKang, Jin-Su0 tEnergy policy.g2012 May, v. 44 p.217-225dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.01.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012100169300001600290520152400306592002801830650001401858650001101872650001301883650001301896650002301909650001101932650001101943650001701954650002001971651001001991653002302001653001702024653003402041653003402075653002702109700001502136700001302151700002202164700002102186700001502207773011302222856008602335852000902421655001202430IND60576051120221117182246.0180831e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057605112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPamparana, G.10aIntegrating photovoltaic solar energy and a battery energy storage system to operate a semi-autogenous grinding mill  ap. 273-280.  aThe mining sector in Chile is facing a steady increase of energy consumption, which is mainly explained by the lower grades, the increase in rock hardness, and deeper mines. Although much of the mining activity in Chile is located in the Atacama Desert, where the solar radiation is high, the integration of solar energy in mining remains elusive. This work explores, through simulation, the use of a solar photovoltaic energy system (PV) and a battery energy storage system (BESS), combined with energy from the grid, to operate a semi-autogenous grinding mill (SAG). For this, a novel mixed-integer linear programming model was developed to optimize the operational costs of the joint SAG-PV-BESS operation, after which the best sizes of PV and BESS components are found through scenario inspection. Further, the implementation of a demand side management (DSM) option is considered by a proper sequencing of the SAG feed to make a more efficient use of the solar energy. The results show an interdependent behavior of the SAG-PV-BESS system and a strong influence of DSM. The use of both PV and BESS allows reducing the contracted power for the SAG, without incurring into overconsumption penalties. If DSM is implemented, the system allocates the higher consumption, associated to harder ore, during daytime to use the available PV energy. Overall, the combined effect of PV and BESS operation of SAG mills allows reducing the energy-associated operational costs. This effect is exacerbated when DSM is implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aenergy 3agrinding 3ahardness 3alinear programming 3amining 3amodels 3asolar energy 3asolar radiation 3aChile 0aSustainable mining 0aSolar energy 0aBattery energy storage system 0aSemi-autogenous grinding mill 0aDemand side management1 aKracht, W.1 aHaas, J.1 aDíaz-Ferrán, G.1 aPalma-Behnke, R.1 aRoman, R.,0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 165 p.273-280dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245017700173520159200350592002801942650001101970650001701981650001601998650001602014650001502030650001702045650001602062651001002078653002602088653001702114653002502131653003202156653001802188653001702206700002102223700002202244700001802266700001902284700002302303700002402326700002302350700002102373700002502394700002302419773010402442856008502546852000902631655001202640IND60686389620221119134852.0200503e20200605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068638962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.1055832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Naccio, Deborah10aSite effects and widespread susceptibility to permanent coseismic deformation in the Avezzano town (Fucino basin, Central Italy): Constraints from detailed geological study  aThe Quaternary Fucino basin in the central Apennines of Italy was struck by one of the strongest Italian earthquakes of the last millennium (1915, Mw 7.0). The Avezzano town, ~ 9.0 km away from the epicentre, was completely destroyed. In the surrounding area sizable coseismic surface deformation were catalogued, attesting the severity of earthquake, the proximity to the causative fault and the geological and geomorphological complexity of a basin filled by thick lacustrine sediments.The Avezzano area provides a case study to understand how shallow subsurface geology influences site effects in a deep Quaternary continental basin environment, thus being of potential interest for similar geologic contexts worldwide. Within the investigated area, different possible earthquake-induced effects can occur, such as a) stratigraphic amplifications in a wide range of resonance frequencies (from 0.4 to 15–20 Hz); b) liquefaction; c) coseismic surface faulting; d) basin-edge effects; and e) slope instability.We present and discuss results of basic seismic microzonation study (SM) of the Avezzano area, focusing on geologic constraints aimed at the reconstruction of the shallow subsurface geology, and associated potential for local seismic hazard.We adopted an interdisciplinary approach based on detailed geological-structural, geophysical and seismic analyses to investigate the seismic response of high-seismic risk area, such as the Avezzano town, given the urban and industrial expansion since the last century. We discuss methodological approaches and their uncertainties.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3adeformation 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3aliquefaction 3auncertainty 3aItaly 0aSeismic microzonation 0aSite effects 0aLocal seismic hazard 0aSubsurface geological model 0aCentral Italy 0aFucino basin1 aFamiani, Daniela1 aLiberi, Francesca1 aBoncio, Paolo1 aCara, Fabrizio1 aDe Santis, Antonio1 aDi Giulio, Giuseppe1 aGaladini, Fabrizio1 aMilana, Giuliano1 aRosatelli, Gianluigi1 aVassallo, Maurizio0 tEngineering geology.g2020 June 05, v. 270 p.105583-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.1055833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245010900179300001300288520120600301592002801507650001701535650001001552650001701562650000901579650001901588650001801607650001901625650001401644650001701658650001401675650001701689653001701706653001801723653001701741653002601758653001801784700002101802700002101823700002301844773007401867856009001941852000902031655001202040IND60564475120221118220438.0170713e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056447512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManshian, Bella B.10aPersonalized medicine and follow-up of therapeutic delivery through exploitation of quantum dot toxicity  ap. 1-12.  aTumor therapy using nanoparticles (NPs) is mainly aimed at using the NPs as carriers for therapeutic drugs or as mediators for external stimuli to generate heat. Recent studies have shown that the toxicity of NPs can also be specifically exploited to kill cancer cells. In the present work, we employ core-only CdTe quantum dots and study their cytotoxicity using a validated high-content screening approach. The data revealed a clear correlation between toxicity and quantum dot degradation, which could be monitored through loss of fluorescence intensity. Based on the in vitro data obtained, the in vivo dose was calculated relative to the estimated number of tumor cells based on luminescence measurements. The obtained results show a clear increase in reproducibility of the therapeutic effect compared to normal conditions, where a set dose of quantum dots was administered regardless of the tumor size. The therapeutic delivery could also be monitored in vivo, where the loss of fluorescence intensity correlated with the anticancer efficacy. The present work highlights the benefits of noninvasive imaging to monitor therapeutic delivery and to optimize treatment via personalized medicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3aheat 3aimage analysis 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3aquantum dots 3ascreening 3atherapeutics 0aNanomedicine 0aTumor therapy 0aQuantum dots 0aPersonalized medicine 0aNanoparticles1 aJiménez, Julio,1 aHimmelreich, Uwe1 aSoenen, Stefaan J.0 tBiomaterials.g2017 May, v. 127 p.1-12dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02047naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245016700164300001400331520085600345592002801201650002301229650001601252650002201268650001701290650001801307650002001325650001701345650003801362650002401400650001601424650001801440650001501458700001501473773009501488856008101583852000901664655001201673IND60119832120221119184912.0150108e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011983212DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-014-9871-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhn, Jungwon10aDrop-Type Chemiluminescence (DCL) System and Sample Treatment Platform Using Magnetic Nanoparticles to Determine Enrofloxacin and Its Metabolite in a Chicken Meat  ap. 79-85.  aAn analytical method to determine antibiotics using a lab-built drop-type chemiluminescence (DCL) system is introduced.

Detection is achieved with an antibody specific against enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labelled antibody. The enzyme is capable of catalyzing the luminol reaction, which can be read out with the DCL device. For application, the DCL system was used to determine enrofloxacin and its metabolite in chicken meat. The obtained detection limits were 0.039 pmol/mL (~0.12 ng/mL) and 0.022 pmol/mL for enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, respectively, which are about 10 times better than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aantibiotics 3achemiluminescence 3achicken meat 3aciprofloxacin 3adetection limit 3aenrofloxacin 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amagnetic separation 3ametabolites 3ananoparticles 3aperoxidase1 aLim, H.

Unfortunately, only few studies have been directed towards the unsaturated resilient behavior of tropical soils and the influence of weathering and degree of laterization. This paper presents a study of the unsaturated resilient behavior of two tropical soils with distinct degrees of laterization, used as subgrades of highways in Brazil. The experimental program involved the measurement of the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC), and the MR at different water contents and matric suctions. Eight models for MR, taken from the literature, were evaluated, and a new family of equations is proposed. The obtained SWCCs of the lateritic soil presented bimodal behavior, while the non-lateritic soil is unimodal. The bimodal behavior was attributed to clay aggregates produced by the laterization process. The observed relationship between MR and the stress-state variables depended on the degree of laterization. The lateritic subgrade soil showed significantly higher values of MR, but the resilient behavior was more sensitive to the water content when compared to the non-lateritic soil. The analysis of the literature models for MR indicated limitations in the manner how the unsaturated behavior was incorporated, producing adjusted coefficients of determination (Adj. R²) between 0.48 and 0.77. The newly proposed MR model was based on the statistical analyses of seven equations. The final proposed model includes two independent stress-state variable and a third state variable, that accounts for the water content deviation from optimum conditions. Finally, the proposed model was validated using MR data from the literature. The proposed model produced superior results when comparing to the previously proposed equations, resulting in values of Adj. R² varying between 0.93 and 0.99. The newly proposed model proved to be flexible, being capable of modeling both the lateritic and non-lateritic soils in an accurate manner. These results are expected to offer significant improvements to the Brazilian mechanistic-empirical pavement design guide, and for similar guides in other countries where tropical soils are found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclimate 3aequations 3ahighways 3alaterites 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apavements 3aprediction 3aseasonal variation 3asoil water characteristic 3astatistical analysis 3atropical soils 3aunsaturated conditions 3awater content 3aweathering 3aBrazil 0aPavement design 0aResilient modulus 0aMatric suction 0aUnsaturated Soils1 aRezende, Lilian Ribeiro de1 aGitirana Jr., Gilson de F.N.0 tEngineering geology.g2020 June 05, v. 270 p.105580-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.1055803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094024002200138024001900160040001800179100001500197245011100212300001200323506007600335520120000411592002801611506003701639650002001676650001301696650001101709650000901720650001301729653003401742653001601776653002101792653001801813653001401831653001701845653001801862700002301880700002301903700002501926700002201951700002301973773007401996856009002070852000902160655001202169IND60564475220221207105945.0170713e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056447522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.0402doi7 aPMC53827932pmcid7 a282851932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArya, Jaya10aTolerability, usability and acceptability of dissolving microneedle patch administration in human subjects  ap. 1-7.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo support translation of microneedle patches from pre-clinical development into clinical trials, this study examined the effect of microneedle patch application on local skin reactions, reliability of use and acceptability to patients. Placebo patches containing dissolving microneedles were administered to fifteen human participants. Microneedle patches were well tolerated in the skin with no pain or swelling and only mild erythema localized to the site of patch administration that resolved fully within seven days. Microneedle patches could be administered by hand without the need of an applicator and delivery efficiencies were similar for investigator-administration and self-administration. Microneedle patch administration was not considered painful and the large majority of subjects were somewhat or fully confident that they self-administered patches correctly. Microneedle patches were overwhelmingly preferred over conventional needle and syringe injection. Altogether, these results demonstrate that dissolving microneedle patches were well tolerated, easily usable and strongly accepted by human subjects, which will facilitate further clinical translation of this technology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclinical trials 3aerythema 3ahumans 3apain 3apatients 0aDissolvable microneedle patch 0aHuman study 0aSkin vaccination 0aAcceptability 0aUsability 0aTolerability 0aDrug delivery1 aHenry, Sébastien,1 aKalluri, Haripriya1 aMcAllister, Devin V.1 aPewin, Winston P.1 aPrausnitz, Mark R.0 tBiomaterials.g2017 June, v. 128 p.1-7dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2017.02.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03691naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012800165520222400293592002802517650001902545650001302564650001302577650001102590650001202601650002202613650001602635650001402651650001502665650002402680650002602704650001102730650001802741650001402759651001102773653002102784653002902805653002302834653002702857700001702884700001902901700001702920700001602937700001802953700001602971773010402987856008503091852000903176655001203185IND60686389820221119134652.0200503e20200605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068638982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.1055882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRohmer, O.10aCombining borehole log-stratigraphies and ambient vibration data to build a 3D Model of the Lower Var Valley, Nice (France)  aIn seismic hazard studies, site effects assessment is based on an accurate knowledge of mechanical properties and geometry of superficial geological formations. The Lower Var Valley (Nice, southeastern France) is a 2 km wide fluvial sedimentary basin where site effects have been observed on earthquake recordings. In addition, this area is a significant economically developing zone including the second largest airport of France. Therefore, it is highly important to define a 3D sub-surface model of the basin to understand the ground motion amplifications. Based on the compilation of several years of geotechnical and geophysical studies, the Quaternary alluvial deposits of the Lower Var Valley were investigated using 331 borehole log-stratigraphies and 439 ambient vibration measurements. These data were combined in a commercial software that models and allows to visualize geoscientific data and geological models in 3D. The borehole log-stratigraphies helped to define a representative lithostratigraphic soil profile and the geometry of the different sedimentary layers. Only few boreholes are reaching the engineering bedrock (Pliocene conglomerates characterized by a S-wave velocity larger than 800 m.s⁻¹). From the ambient vibration data, the fundamental resonance frequency identified from H/V curves indicates the bedrock depth using the well-known f₀ = Vs/4H relationship. These H/V curves were interpreted using geological knowledge of the studied zone.Our results show that the bedrock depth varies, in the center of the valley, between 50 m in the northern part of the studied zone and more than 100 m on the river estuary. First, the average S-wave velocity in the alluvial deposits is estimated according to combined analysis of the borehole log-stratigraphies and H/V calculations on ambient vibration measurements. The spatial variability of this velocity has been translated into a velocity zonation of the valley. Second, this zonation allows us to extrapolate the Quaternary-Pliocene limit in the whole valley. The 3D model of the Lower Var Valley will be useful in future numerical simulations of seismic ground motions in order to evaluate and mitigate seismic risk in the area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPliocene epoch 3aairports 3aalluvium 3abasins 3abedrock 3acomputer software 3aearthquakes 3aestuaries 3ageophysics 3amathematical models 3amechanical properties 3arivers 3asoil profiles 3avibration 3aFrance 0aLower Var Valley 0aLithostratigraphic model 0aAmbient vibrations 0aGeotechnical boreholes1 aBertrand, E.1 aMercerat, E.D.1 aRégnier, J.1 aPernoud, M.1 aLanglaude, P.1 aAlvarez, M.0 tEngineering geology.g2020 June 05, v. 270 p.105588-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.1055883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010800166300001400274520147100288592002801759650001501787650001001802650001101812650002501823650001201848650002301860650002001883650002901903650002101932650002201953650001401975650002901989650000902018650001002027651001002037700001602047700002302063773007502086856008302161852000902244655001202253IND60096838420221118050652.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jin’e10aSustainability assessment of bioethanol and petroleum fuel production in Japan based on emergy analysis  ap. 23-33.  aTo promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, research and development of bioethanol technologies are encouraged in Japan and a plan to utilize untilled fields to develop rice for bioethanol production as a substitute for petroleum fuel is being devised. This study applies emergy methods to compare the sustainability of petroleum fuel production and two Japanese rice-to-ethanol production scenarios: (a) ethanol from rice grain, while straw and chaff are burned as energy and (b) ethanol from rice+straw+chaff. The major emergy indices, Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR), Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR), Emergy Investment Ratio (EIR), Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI), Environmental Impacts Ratio (EVR) and system transformity (Tr), are analyzed to assess the production processes. The results show that (1) petroleum fuel production presents higher ELR, EIR, EVR and lower EYR, ESI, Tr than rice-to-ethanol production, indicating rice-to-ethanol production makes sense for reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG); (2) scenario (a) performs similarly on major indicators (EYR, ESI, ELR, EIR and EVR) to scenario (b), yet the system efficiency indicator (Tr) of scenario (a, 7.572×10⁵semj/J) is much higher than (b, 4.573×10⁵semj/J), and therefore (b) is a better alternative for policy decisions; (3) both petroleum fuel production and rice-to-ethanol processes are mainly driven by purchased resources and are unsustainable and nonrenewable in the long run.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioethanol 3achaff 3aemergy 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3apetroleum 3aresearch and development 3arice 3astraw 3aJapan1 aLin, Bin-Le1 aSagisaka, Masayuki0 tEnergy policy.g2012 May, v. 44 p.23-33dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2011.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245007800134300001400212520105600226592002801282650002401310650001301334650001601347650001501363650001601378650002601394650002301420650001801443650001601461650001601477650001501493650001001508651001001518653001701528653003401545700001601579773014001595852000901735655001201744IND60721433920221120174811.0201224e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072143392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhary, Monika10aAntagonistic potential of bacillus species against plant pathogenic fungi  ap. 49-54.  aIn the present study, Bacillus strains showed highest antifungal activity against some plant pathogenic fungi that is Rhizoctonia spp. and Rhizopus. The antagonism between different microbial (bacterial strains) can be expressed by the production of metabolites, competition and direct parasitism. Biological control refers to the suppression of a single pathogen (or pest), by a single antagonist, in a single cropping system. Biocontrol can occur when non-pathogens compete with pathogens for nutrients in and around the host plant. Direct interactions that benefit one population at the expense of another also affect our understanding of biological control. Bacillus spp. isolates were used in vitro sensitivity experiments against fungal spp., these fungi were collected from IMTEC Chandigarh including Rhizotina solani and Rhizopus species.

The region has experienced a number of destructive earthquakes and tsunamis over the past few centuries, which have caused loss of human life and significant damage to infrastructure, highlighting the importance of seismic hazard assessment in the region. In fact, a reliable seismic hazard assessment is critical for developing policies for seismic hazard mitigation and risk reduction. In this study, we performed a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) of the study area based on an earthquake catalog that was very carefully analyzed. In earlier studies, we demonstrated that inappropriate treatment of the earthquake catalog can result in a serious bias in evaluations of seismicity parameters (e.g., a bias of up to 42% in the “b” parameter of the Gutenberg–Richter law). To address this issue, we compiled a homogenous earthquake catalog consisting of 39,977 events during the 1513–2016 period and accounted for site-specific local effects by developing site-specific scaling relationships between different measures of magnitude (e.g., mb, Mₛ, MD) and moment magnitude (Mw). The study area was subdivided into 15 seismogenic zones, accounting for site-specific seismicity patterns. The parameters “a” and “b” of the Gutenberg–Richter law were estimated for each zone based on independent earthquake events. The PSHA was performed using a standard logic tree approach, which allowed us to systematically take into account the model-based uncertainty and its influence on the estimated ground motion parameters. Uniform hazard spectra for return periods of 475 and 2475 years were estimated for peak ground accelerations and spectral accelerations at 0.2 s and 1.0 s to meet the definitions of seismic hazards provided by the International Building Code (IBC, International Code Council [ICC], 2009). This study is expected to provide a basis for design maps for building codes and emergency planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3ahazard characterization 3ainfrastructure 3aissues and policy 3aplanning 3arisk reduction 3atsunamis 3auncertainty 3aChile 3aPeru1 aGonzález, Gabriel,1 aLlera, Juan Carlos de la,1 aSaez, Esteban1 aSalazar, Pablo1 aGonzález, Juan,1 aMeneses, Claudio0 tEngineering geology.g2020 June 20, v. 271 p.105585-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2020.1055853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04308naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024001700135024002300152024003800175024001200213040001800225100001700243245014000260300001400400506017300414506007600587506003100663520121900694592002801913596006901941596008302010596008802093506003702181650002702218650002902245650001202274650001402286650001102300650002102311650001402332650002602346650001202372650001102384650001802395650001102413650001302424650001302437650001902450650001002469650001302479650005202492650002602544650001102570650002902581650002202610653002002632653003602652653001502688653002302703653001702726653003002743700001802773700002502791700002002816700001802836700001602854700002202870700002402892700001502916700002002931700002402951700001702975773011902992856008503111856011403196956011803310961001703428852000903445655001203454IND60637908320221207131502.0190809e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063790832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.04.0072chorus7 a3516402aris7 a10113/63790832hdl7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.04.0072doi8 ans17880  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shengyun12aA long non-coding RNA regulates cadherin transcription and susceptibility to Bt toxin Cry1Ac in pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella  ap. 54-60.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aExtensive planting of transgenic crops producing insecticidal proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has spurred increasingly rapid evolution of resistance in pests. In the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella, a devastating global pest, resistance to Bt toxin Cry1Ac produced by transgenic cotton is linked with mutations in a gene (PgCad1) encoding a cadherin protein that binds Cry1Ac in the larval midgut. We previously reported a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in intron 20 of cadherin alleles associated with both resistance and susceptibility to Cry1Ac. Here we tested the hypothesis that reducing expression of this lncRNA decreases transcription of PgCad1 and susceptibility to Cry1Ac. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that feeding susceptible neonates small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting this lncRNA but not PgCad1 decreased the abundance of transcripts of both the lncRNA and PgCad1. Moreover, neonates fed the siRNAs had lower susceptibility to Cry1Ac. The results imply that the lncRNA increases transcription of PgCad1 and susceptibility of pink bollworm to Cry1Ac. The results suggest that disruption of lncRNA expression could be a novel mechanism of pest resistance to Bt toxins.  aPublisher supplied data  cChina Scholarship Councildhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004543  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100005825  cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000018090 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aPectinophora gossypiella 3aalleles 3acadherins 3acotton 3acrystal proteins 3aevolution 3ainsecticidal proteins 3aintrons 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3amidgut 3amutation 3aneonates 3anon-coding RNA 3apests 3aplanting 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atoxins 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 0aGene regulation 0aSmall interfering RNAs (siRNAs) 0aResistance 0aOff-target effects 0aPest control 0aGenetically modified crop1 aHussain, Fiaz1 aUnnithan, Gopalan C.1 aDong, Shuanglin1 aUlAbdin, Zain1 aGu, Shaohua1 aMathew, Lolita G.1 aFabrick, Jeffrey A.1 aNi, Xinzhi1 aCarrière, Yves1 aTabashnik, Bruce E.1 aLi, Xianchun0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2019 July, v. 158 p.54-60dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.04.0073Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/63790833Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Li%20et%20al%202019%20PBP%20158%2054-60.pdf  aUSDAUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02950naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014200169300001400311520152700325592002801852650001101880650001301891650001101904650001501915650002501930650002601955650001101981650001101992650003302003650000902036650001402045653001702059653004302076653004202119653003402161653002602195700001202221700001802233700001702251700001802268773011102286856008602397852000902483655001202492IND60576051520221117182245.0180831e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057605152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xinpeng10aMix design and characteristics evaluation of an eco-friendly Ultra-High Performance Concrete incorporating recycled coral based materials  ap. 70-80.  aThis paper addresses the mix design and properties evaluation of an eco-friendly Ultra-High Performance Concrete with recycled coral based materials. The modified Andreasen & Andersen particle packing model is utilized to achieve a densely compacted cementitious matrix. Micro-coral sand and coral sand are used to replace cement and sand, respectively. By adopting the Response Surface Method, the effect of blending micro-coral sand and coral sand on the mechanical properties of the designed UHPC is analyzed, aiming at a maximum use of recycled coral based materials. After that, the individual and interactive effects on the durability, autogenous shrinkage and ecological properties of the designed Ultra-High Performance Concrete are evaluated. The results show that the addition of individual recycled coral based materials can improve the workability and reduce the autogenous shrinkage of Ultra-High Performance Concrete without decreasing the durability of Ultra-High Performance Concrete. Compared to the mixture with micro-coral sand, the one with coral sand has less autogenous shrinkage and better durability. Moreover, the designed Ultra-High Performance Concrete with 15% micro-coral sand and 30% coral sand together show the best properties in this study. Additionally, the ecological evaluation demonstrates that the designed Ultra-High Performance Concrete with recycled coral based materials has relatively low environmental impact, which is promising to generate a cleaner product in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3acement 3aconcrete 3acorals 3adurability 3aenvironmental impact 3amechanical properties 3amixing 3amodels 3aresponse surface methodology 3asand 3ashrinkage 0aEco-friendly 0aUltra-high performance concrete (UHPC) 0aRecycled coral based materials (RCBM) 0aResponse surface method (RSM) 0aEcological evaluation1 aYu, Rui1 aShui, Zhonghe1 aSong, Qiulei1 aZhang, Zhihao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 165 p.70-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02274naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245011100133300001400244520124300258592002801501650001401529650002601543650001601569650001001585650002401595650002601619650001201645650001601657650001701673650001401690651001001704653001901714653000801733700002201741773014001763852000901903655001201912IND60721434020221120164825.0201224e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072143402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaishram, Nomita10aEffect of corm splitting and GA₃ application on growth and flowering of gladiolus cv. ‘Pusa Jyotsna’  ap. 55-59.  aA field experiment was carried out at the experimental farm of the Department of Horticulture, Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat during the year 2006–07 to ascertain the effect of corm splitting and GA₃ application on growth and flowering of gladiolus cv. ‘Pusa Jyotsna’. The experiment was laid down in Factorial Randomized Block Design with 24 treatments replicated thrice. Six corm sizes viz., small whole corms (S₁), large and medium corms cut into two pieces (S₂ and S₃, respectively), large and medium corm cut into three pieces (S₄ and S₅, respectively) and small corm cut into two pieces (S₆), were treated with four different concentrations of GA₃ (0, 50, 100 and 200 ppm). Findings revealed that S₂ produced significantly greater plant height (117.74 cm), no. of leaves per plant (9.33) and leaf length (69.46 cm). Maximum number of florets per spike (14.72), spike length (105.79 cm) and rachis length (75.52 cm) were also recorded with S₂. Both S₂ and S₃ produced the maximum floret size and vase life. Application of 200 ppm GA₃ induces early emergence of shoot (16.77 days), produced maximum number of leaves (9.06) per plant, maximum spike length (92.66 cm) and rachis length (72.25 cm).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGladiolus 3aagricultural colleges 3aagriculture 3acorms 3ademonstration farms 3afield experimentation 3aflorets 3aleaf length 3aplant height 3avase life 3aIndia 0aCorm splitting 0aGA31 aHatibarua, Preeti0 tProgressive agriculture.g2013 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.55-59dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245006200170300001600232520142600248592002801674650001101702650001101713650002301724650001401747650001001761650001001771653000901781653001001790653003101800653002201831653002001853700002401873700002701897700002601924773009401950856008402044852000902128655001202137IND60535577520221118063150.0210904e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053557752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2014.08.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerbert, Vanessa10aMemory processes in the development of reduced-salt foods  ap. 125-134.  aAcceptance of a reduced-salt food is likely to be influenced by a mismatch between the sensory characteristics of a reformulated product and a memory for a previously-encountered formulation. In two initial pilot studies we established the reliability of a new measure of memory for saltiness, based on a method of constant stimuli. We then used this technique to explore the effects of different patterns of repeated exposure on memory for the taste of a reduced-salt soup. Participants (N = 135) were assigned to one of four exposure patterns: (1) reduced-salt, (2) no salt reduction, i.e. regular-salt, (3) reduced- and regular-salt, in an alternating pattern, and (4) gradually declining salt concentration. In the final session, all participants received an identical reduced-salt soup. Memory for the saltiness of this sample was assessed, together with its expected liking. Our results indicate that different interactions with the test soup had little effect on taste memory. Nevertheless, (1) participants remembered the final exposure soup as saltier than the reduced-salt formulation that they had received and (2) remembered salt concentrations correlated with individual ideal salt concentrations. These findings are consistent with contemporary models of reconstructive memory and they illustrate the importance of understanding ‘memory for saltiness’ in the acceptance of reduced-salt formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3amemory 3amodels 3asalt concentration 3asaltiness 3asoups 3ataste 0aSalt 0aTaste 0aMethod of constant stimuli 0aRepeated exposure 0aEpisodic memory1 aBertenshaw, Emma J.1 aZandstra, Elizabeth H.1 aBrunstrom, Jeffrey M.0 tAppetite.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 83 p.125-134dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.08.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245004000133300001400173520147300187592002801660650004201688650001601730650001401746650001601760650001201776650001201788650001601800650001401816650001901830650002701849650001801876653001201894653000701906653000701913653000801920653000801928653002101936653001401957700001501971700002001986700002202006773014002028852000902168655001202177IND60721434120221120164742.0201224e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072143412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaishram, Nomita10aEustoma micro propagation: A review  ap. 60-67.  aLisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum (Raf) Shinn.) is becoming one of the most highly ranked cut flowers in the International market. Propagation by seeds is complicated and difficult exercise due to slow germination and growth and seedling populations are disadvantageously variable with respect to flowering time, stem length and flower qualities. Vegetative propagation of selected cultivars might provide a useful alternative to seed propagation as the limited availability of cuttings from each stock resulting in apical dieback is a major setback.Therefore, micro propagation serves as potent tool to develop a method of rapid propagation of selected/elite genotypes of lisianthus. The clonal multiplication of lisianthus especially through tissue culture might provide a useful alternative to seed propagation, thus resulting in to production of better quality planting stock. In vitro multiplication of elite plant genotypes offers immense opportunities to multiply large number of disease free, healthy and vigorous planting material in shortest possible time. In this review, the scattered information on clonal multiplication of Eustoma through micro propagation are being tried to put together. This could eventually be helpful in drawing the attention of the researchers and scientists to work on it, besides would be benefitted by utilizing the knowledge review in this paper so as to popularize it as a cut flower to make its place among top 10 cut flowers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEustoma exaltatum subsp. russellianum 3aagriculture 3acultivars 3acut flowers 3adieback 3aflowers 3agermination 3aseedlings 3atissue culture 3avegetative propagation 3aworld markets 0aEustoma 0aGA 0aBA 0aNAA 0aIBA 0aIn vitro rooting 0aHardening1 aKumar, Raj1 aSingh, Arvinder1 aChaudhary, S.V.S.0 tProgressive agriculture.g2013 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.60-67dSociety for Recent Development in AgriculturewJournal:2097x0976-46157nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100003400166245011700200300001800317520147000335592002801805650001401833650002801847650002001875650000901895650001401904650002801918650001001946650001201956650002001968650001201988650001202000650001602012651001002028653002202038653001102060653001902071653001402090653001002104700003302114700002902147700002902176700003402205700002602239700002802265700003002293700003402323773013002357856008202487852000902569655001202578IND60517410520221119232116.0190803e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051741052DNAL7 a231641692pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800120034732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez Vizcaíno, Vicente,10aTrends in excess of weight, underweight and adiposity among Spanish children from 2004 to 2010: the Cuenca Study  ap. 2170-2174.  aTo examine the trends in BMI and adiposity among schoolchildren from Cuenca, Spain, during 2004–2010. Two methodologically comparable surveys were carried out in 2004 and 2010. Primary schools in Cuenca, a province in the middle of Spain. All schoolchildren aged 8–11 years, belonging to 4th and 5th grades from twenty schools in the Province of Cuenca, were invited to participate in both cross-sectional studies. Weight, height and body fat percentage (BF%) from bioelectrical impedance were measured with standardized procedures. The study included 550 boys and 539 girls in 2004, and 569 boys and 531 girls in 2010. In 2010, 8·1 % of children were underweight, 25·9 % overweight and 9·5 % obese. From 2004 to 2010, the prevalence of overweight rose from 21·6 % to 28·0 % (P = 0·004) and BF % increased from 22·6 % to 24·0 % (P = 0·001) among boys. No change was observed in overweight and BF % in girls, or in underweight and obesity in either sex. In boys, most of the distribution of BMI and BF % shifted to the right; in contrast, among girls no substantial change was apparent in the distribution of BMI and BF %. From 2004 to 2010 the prevalence of overweight and adiposity has continued to increase among boys. However, the obesity epidemic may have levelled off in girls. Given that the prevalence of childhood excess weight is still very high, the current evidence-based efforts to halt the obesity epidemic in Spain should be strengthened.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody mass index 3aboys 3achildhood 3across-sectional studies 3agirls 3aobesity 3aschool children 3aschools 3asurveys 3aunderweight 3aSpain 0aChildhood obesity 0aTrends 0aSchoolchildren 0aAdiposity 0aSpain1 aMartínez, Montserrat Solera1 aNotario Pacheco, Blanca,1 aLópez, Mairena Sánchez1 aGarcía-Prieto, Jorge Cañete1 aNiño, Coral Torrijos1 aPalencia, Natalia Arias1 aAguilar, Fernando Salcedo1 aRodríguez-Artalejo, Fernando0 tPublic health nutrition.g2012 Dec., v. 15, no. 12 p.2170-2174dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800120034733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02807naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100005600184242006800240245008000308300001600388506007600404520108300480592002801563506003701591650001801628650001701646650001301663650002001676650001001696650001801706650002301724650001801747650001301765650001201778650003301790650001701823650001101840650002401851650001701875650002301892650001801915700001701933700001401950700001701964700001901981700001902000700001802019773013002037856007702167852000902244655001202253IND60672907220221207143351.0191017e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067290722DNAL7 a10.1631/jzus.B19001572doi7 aPMC68258132pmcid7 a315957262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiang-yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3125-846110a通过四种不同的干燥方式制备β-胡萝卜素微胶囊10aMicroencapsulated β-carotene preparation using different drying treatments  ap. 901-909.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aβ-Carotene is one of the most abundant natural pigments in foods; however, usage of β-carotene is limited because of its instability. Microencapsulation techniques are usually applied to protect microencapsulated β-carotene from oxidization. In this study, β-carotene was microencapsulated using different drying processes: spray-drying, spray freeze-drying, coating, and spray granulation. The properties of morphology, particle size, water content, thermal characteristic, and chemical stability have been explored and compared. Scanning electron microscopy measure¬ments showed that the coated powder had a dense surface surrounded by starch and suggested that the coating process gave a microencapsulated powder with the smallest bulk density and the best compressibility among the prepared powders. The chemical stabilities of microcapsules were evaluated during six months of storage at different temperatures. The coated powder had the highest mass fraction of β-carotene, which indicated that the coating pro¬cess was superior to the three other drying processes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta-carotene 3abulk density 3acoatings 3acompressibility 3afoods 3afreeze drying 3amicroencapsulation 3aparticle size 3apigments 3apowders 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspray drying 3astarch 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3athermal properties 3awater content1 aWu, Mian-bin1 aXiao, Min1 aLu, Shu-huan1 aWang, Zhi-ming1 aYao, Jian-ming1 aYang, Li-rong0 tJournal of Zhejiang University.g2019 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.901-909dZhejiang University PresswJournal:5353x1673-15817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B19001573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001900191245010600210300001800316506007600334520134700410592002801757506003701785650001801822650001701840650002001857650001801877650001801895650001601913650001101929650001401940650001201954650001701966650000901983650001401992650001202006650001502018650001502033650001502048650002102063650000902084650001202093653000802105653000802113653000802121653001002129653001202139653000802151653000802159653000802167653000802175653000802183653000802191653001602199653002502215653002302240653002602263653001202289700002802301700002502329700002202354773012202376856008502498852000902583655001202592IND60554260020221207133733.0180904e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055426002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2015.05.0062doi7 aPMC45166662pmcid7 a260249272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgarashi, Miki10aFeeding-induced oleoylethanolamide mobilization is disrupted in the gut of diet-induced obese rodents  ap. 1218-1226.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe gastrointestinal tract plays a critical role in the regulation of energy homeostasis by initiating neural and hormonal responses to the ingestion of nutrients. In addition to peptide hormones, such as cholecystokinin (CKK) and peptide YY (PYY), the lipid-derived mediator oleoylethanolamide (OEA) has been implicated in the control of satiety. Previous studies in humans and rodent models have shown that obesity is associated with changes in CCK, PYY and other gut-derived peptide hormones, which may contribute to decreased satiety and increased energy intake. In the present study, we show that small-intestinal OEA production is disrupted in the gut of diet-induced obese (DIO) rats and mice. In lean rodents, feeding or duodenal infusion of Intralipid® or pure oleic acid stimulates jejunal OEA mobilization. This response is strikingly absent in DIO rats and mice. Confirming previous reports, we found that feeding rats or mice a high-fat diet for 7days is sufficient to suppress jejunal OEA mobilization. Surprisingly, a similar effect is elicited by feeding rats and mice a high-sucrose low-fat diet for 7days. Collectively, our findings suggest that high fat-induced obesity is accompanied by alterations in the post-digestive machinery responsible for OEA biosynthesis, which may contribute to reduced satiety and hyperphagia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3abiosynthesis 3acholecystokinin 3aenergy intake 3ahigh fat diet 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aingestion 3ajejunum 3alow fat diet 3amice 3anutrients 3aobesity 3aoleic acid 3aovereating 3apeptide YY 3apeptide hormones 3arats 3asatiety 0aCCK 0aDIO 0aFAE 0aGLP-1 0aLC–MS 0aLEA 0aOEA 0aPEA 0aPYY 0aSEA 0aVEA 0aDietary fat 0aDiet-induced obesity 0aOleoylethanolamide 0aLinoleoylethanolamide 0aSatiety1 aDiPatrizio, Nicholas V.1 aNarayanaswami, Vidya1 aPiomelli, Daniele0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2015 Sept., v. 1851, no. 9 p.1218-1226dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12057x1388-19817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbalip.2015.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001500176245010500191300001500296520129400311592002801605650002001633650001401653650002501667650001301692650001901705650001301724650000901737650001501746650002001761650001001781650001201791650001201803700001201815773015001827856006901977856010402046990002302150852000902173655001202182IND60643532320221120141138.0190510e20140512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064353232DNAL7 a10.3791/515202doi7 aPMC41816792pmcid7 a248945632pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xinzhu10aTwo-photon in vivo imaging of dendritic spines in the mouse cortex using a thinned-skull preparation  ap. e51520.  aIn the mammalian cortex, neurons form extremely complicated networks and exchange information at synapses. Changes in synaptic strength, as well as addition/removal of synapses, occur in an experience-dependent manner, providing the structural foundation of neuronal plasticity. As postsynaptic components of the most excitatory synapses in the cortex, dendritic spines are considered to be a good proxy of synapses. Taking advantages of mouse genetics and fluorescent labeling techniques, individual neurons and their synaptic structures can be labeled in the intact brain. Here we introduce a transcranial imaging protocol using two-photon laser scanning microscopy to follow fluorescently labeled postsynaptic dendritic spines over time in vivo. This protocol utilizes a thinned-skull preparation, which keeps the skull intact and avoids inflammatory effects caused by exposure of the meninges and the cortex. Therefore, images can be acquired immediately after surgery is performed. The experimental procedure can be performed repetitively over various time intervals ranging from hours to years. The application of this preparation can also be expanded to investigate different cortical regions and layers, as well as other cell types, under physiological and pathological conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acerebral cortex 3adendrites 3afluorescent labeling 3agenetics 3aimage analysis 3ameninges 3amice 3amicroscopy 3aneuroplasticity 3askull 3asurgery 3asynapse1 aZuo, Yi0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 May 12, , no. 87 p.e51520-e51520dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/515203Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/51520/two-photon-vivo-imaging-dendritic-spines-mouse-cortex-using-thinned  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245017200163300001400335520138400349592002801733650002301761650001401784650002301798650002001821650003101841650001001872650001801882650002001900650002101920650001101941650001701952650002901969650002101998653000902019653001202028653002002040653001602060653001702076653002002093700002402113700001802137700001702155773011902172856008102291852000902372655001202381IND60610668820221122044247.0180829e20170105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061066882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2016.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMishra, Ila10aConcurrent hypothalamic gene expression under acute and chronic long days: Implications for initiation and maintenance of photoperiodic response in migratory songbirds  ap. 81-94.  aHypothalamic expression of the thyroid hormone (TH) responsive gonadostimulatory (eya3, cga, tshβ, dio2, dio3, gnrh, gnih) and neurosteroid pathway genes (androgen receptor [ar], aromatase [cyp19], estrogen receptor [er] α and β) was examined in photosensitive redheaded buntings exposed to 2 (acute, experiment 1) or 12 (chronic, experiment 2) long days (16L:8D). Experiment 2 also included a photorefractory group. Acute long days caused a significant increase in eya3, cga, tshβ, dio2 and gnrh and decrease in dio3 mRNA levels. eya3, cga and tshβ expressions were unchanged after the chronic long days. We also found increased cyp19, erα and erβ mRNA levels after acute, and increased cyp19 and decreased erβ levels after the chronic long-day exposure. Photorefractory buntings showed expression patterns similar to that in the photosensitive state, except for high gnrh and gnih and low dio3 mRNA levels. Consistent with gene expression patterns, there were changes in fat deposition, body mass, testis size, and plasma levels of testosterone, tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine. These results show concurrent photostimulation of the TH-signalling and neurosteroid pathways, and extend the idea, based on differences in gene expression, that transitions in seasonal photoperiodic states are accomplished at the transcriptional levels in absolute photorefractory species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrogen receptors 3aaromatase 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3amigratory birds 3aphotosensitivity 3atestes 3atestosterone 3atranscription (genetics) 3atriiodothyronine 0aBird 0aBunting 0aGene expression 0aPhotoperiod 0aNeurosteroid 0aThyroid hormone1 aBhardwaj, Sanjay K.1 aMalik, Shalie1 aKumar, Vinod0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2017 Jan. 05, v. 439 p.81-94dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2016.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03263naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002200188245014000210300001600350506007600366520131300442592002801755506003701783650001501820650001101835650002001846650001201866650001801878650000901896650001501905650002001920650000901940650002001949650002101969650001401990650001202004650001402016650001902030650002402049650001802073650001402091650001902105650001602124651001002140653001202150653001402162653001502176653001602191700001802207700002302225700001802248700002102266700002102287700003102308700002002339700002402359773012702383856008202510852000902592655001202601IND60517410720221207092430.0190803e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051741072DNAL7 aPMC37134782pmcid7 a225754872pmid7 a10.1017/S136898001200119X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamuel, Tinu Mary10aCorrelates of anaemia in pregnant urban South Indian women: a possible role of dietary intake of nutrients that inhibit iron absorption  ap. 316-324.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo identify correlates of anaemia during the first trimester of pregnancy among 366 urban South Indian pregnant women. Cross-sectional study evaluating demographic, socio-economic, anthropometric and dietary intake data on haematological outcomes. A government maternity health-care centre catering predominantly to the needs of pregnant women from the lower socio-economic strata of urban Bangalore. Pregnant women (n 366) aged ≥18 and ≤40 years, who registered for antenatal screening at ≤14 weeks of gestation. Mean age was 22·6 (sd 3·4) years, mean BMI was 20·4 (sd 3·3) kg/m² and 236 (64·5 %) of the pregnant women were primiparous. The prevalence of anaemia (Hb <11·0 g/dl) was 30·3 % and of microcytic anaemia (anaemia with mean corpuscular volume <80 fl) 20·2 %. Mean dietary intakes of energy, Ca, Fe and folate were well below the Indian RDA. In multivariable log-binomial regression analysis, anaemia was independently associated with high dietary intakes of Ca (relative risk; 95 % CI: 1·79; 1·16, 2·76) and P (1·96; 1·31, 2·96) and high intake of meat, fish and poultry (1·94; 1·29, 2·91). Low dietary intake of multiple micronutrients, but higher intakes of nutrients that inhibit Fe absorption such as Ca and P, may help explain high rates of maternal anaemia in India.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabsorption 3aanemia 3abody mass index 3acalcium 3aenergy intake 3afish 3afolic acid 3ahealth services 3airon 3airon absorption 3ameat consumption 3anutrients 3apoultry 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3aregression analysis 3arelative risk 3ascreening 3asocioeconomics 3aurban areas 3aIndia 0aAnaemia 0aPregnancy 0aCorrelates 0aSouth India1 aThomas, Tinku1 aFinkelstein, Julia1 aBosch, Ronald1 aRajendran, Ramya1 aVirtanen, Suvi M1 aSrinivasan, Krishnamachari1 aKurpad, Anura V1 aDuggan, Christopher0 tPublic health nutrition.g2013 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.316-324dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S136898001200119X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245010000174300001600274520132700290592002801617650001601645650001101661650001701672650001801689650001701707650001701724650000901741650001501750651001801765700002101783700002401804700002201828773007701850856008301927852000902010655001202019IND60096839220221118050643.0141104e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009683922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2012.01.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDenholm, P.q(Paul),10aDecarbonizing the electric sector: Combining renewable and nuclear energy using thermal storage  ap. 301-311.  aBoth renewable and nuclear energy can provide significant contributions to decarbonizing the electric sector. However, a grid employing large amounts of wind and solar energy requires the balance of the system to be highly flexible to respond to the increased variability of the net load. This makes deployment of conventional nuclear power challenging both due to the technical challenges of plant cycling and economic limits of reduced capacity factor. In the United States nuclear power plants generally provide constant, base load power and are most economic when operated at constant power levels. Operating nuclear power plants in load-following modes decreases the plants' annual energy output and increases the levelized cost of energy, decreasing economic competitiveness. One possible solution is to couple thermal energy storage to nuclear power plants. This would enable the reactor to remain at nearly constant output, while cycling the electrical generator in response to the variability of the net load. This paper conceptually explores combinations of wind, solar, and nuclear that can provide a large fraction of a system's electricity, assuming the use of thermal energy storage that would allow nuclear power to provide load following and cycling duty while operating at a constant reactor power output.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3asolar energy 3awind 3awind power 3aUnited States1 aKing, Jeffrey C.1 aKutcher, Charles F.1 aWilson, Paul P.H.0 tEnergy policy.g2012 May, v. 44 p.301-311dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2012.01.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100001900193245006600212300001600278506007600294520135600370592002801726506003701754650002101791650002401812650001301836650001001849650001801859650001701877650002501894650002401919650001001943650001601953650002401969650001901993650001402012650002102026650001202047653001602059653002702075653001302102653001702115653002702132700007102159700002302230700001702253700001902270773008402289856008602373852000902459655001202468IND60557022020221207142043.0170710e20161202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055702202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2016.07.0032doi7 aPMC51591992pmcid7 a273971002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuñiga, Sonia10aVirulence factors in porcine coronaviruses and vaccine design  ap. 142-151.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorcine enteric coronaviruses (CoVs) cause severe disease in the porcine herds worldwide, leading to important economic losses. Despite the knowledge of these viruses since the 1970s, vaccination strategies have not been implemented, leading to continuous re-emergence of novel virulent strains. Live attenuated vaccines historically have been the most efficient. We consider that the new trend is the development of recombinant vaccines by using reverse genetics systems to engineer attenuated viruses, which could be used as effective and safe modified live vaccine candidates. To this end, host cell signaling pathways influencing porcine CoV virulence should be identified. Similarly, the identity of viral proteins involved in the modulation of host cell pathways influencing CoV pathogenesis should be analyzed. With this information, and using reverse genetics systems, it is possible to design viruses with modifications in the viral proteins acting as virulence factors, which may lead to attenuated viruses and, therefore, vaccine candidates. In addition, novel antiviral drugs may be developed once the host cell pathways and the molecular mechanism affecting porcine CoV replication and virulence are known. This review is focused in the host cell responses to enteric porcine CoV infection and the viral proteins involved in pathogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantiviral agents 3afinancial economics 3agenetics 3aherds 3alive vaccines 3apathogenesis 3arecombinant vaccines 3asignal transduction 3aswine 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3aviral proteins 3avirulence 3avirulent strains 3aviruses 0aCoronavirus 0aVirus-host interaction 0aVaccines 0aPathogenesis 0aInnate immune response1 aPascual-Iglesias, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2214-54411 aSanchez, Carlos M.1 aSola, Isabel1 aEnjuanes, Luis0 tVirus research.g2016 Dec. 02, v. 226 p.142-151dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.07.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001700176245010000193300001500293520125000308592002801558650001801586650002401604650001901628650002401647650000901671650001501680650001401695650001701709650001501726700002701741700002101768700002301789700001801812700002001830773015101850856006902001856009702070990002302167852000902190655001202199IND60643532520221120141147.0190510e20150423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064353252DNAL7 a10.3791/515242doi7 aPMC46506742pmcid7 a259387372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakic, Boris10aBehavioral phenotyping of murine disease models with the integrated behavioral station (inbest)  ap. e51524.  aDue to rapid advances in genetic engineering, small rodents have become the preferred subjects in many disciplines of biomedical research. In studies of chronic CNS disorders, there is an increasing demand for murine models with high validity at the behavioral level. However, multiple pathogenic mechanisms and complex functional deficits often impose challenges to reliably measure and interpret behavior of chronically sick mice. Therefore, the assessment of peripheral pathology and a behavioral profile at several time points using a battery of tests are required. Video-tracking, behavioral spectroscopy, and remote acquisition of physiological measures are emerging technologies that allow for comprehensive, accurate, and unbiased behavioral analysis in a home-base-like setting. This report describes a refined phenotyping protocol, which includes a custom-made monitoring apparatus (Integrated Behavioral Station, INBEST) that focuses on prolonged measurements of basic functional outputs, such as spontaneous activity, food/water intake and motivated behavior in a relatively stress-free environment. Technical and conceptual improvements in INBEST design may further promote reproducibility and standardization of behavioral studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3abiomedical research 3adisease models 3agenetic engineering 3amice 3amonitoring 3aphenotype 3aspectroscopy 3atechnology1 aCooper, Marcella P.

In this study, an improved heating approach using electric-driven heat pumps to replace HC and HB was proposed and its thermodynamic superiority, environmental benefit and economic viability were quantitatively determined based on the scenario of a large metropolitan area including Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei area in North China (abbr. with Jing-Jin-Ji region). The results showed that using the proposed heating pattern, the primary energy efficiency of the overall energy system (OES) could be improved by 8.2 percentage points with a reduction of 20.31 Mt coal as compared to the original OES using the HB and HC. The emissions of main pollutants and CO2 per kg coal and per MJ heating output could be significantly reduced, leading to a 74.85, 329.7, 87.7 kt and 37.4 Mt reduction in particulate matter (PM), SO2, NOx, and CO2 emissions of the OES, respectively. Moreover, the annualized investment and O&M costs of the proposed heating system would increase by $1.36/m² and $0.31/m², respectively, while the energy costs would decrease by $0.23/m² as compared to the traditional heating system. Finally, the general analyses from the perspectives of strength, weakness, opportunity and threat (SWOT) were performed and the results revealled that the inherent advantages toghther with some preferential policies will play a positive role in promoting the proposed heating system application in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acase studies 3acoal 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy costs 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental assessment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3aissues and policy 3anitrogen oxides 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aprimary energy 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aBoiler coal 0aElectric-driven heat pumps 0aEnergy efficiency 0aHousehold coal 0aPollutant emission1 aWang, Chunlan1 aXu, Gang1 aHu, Yue1 aGuo, Hao1 aYang, Yongping0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 165 p.36-47dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.07.0873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04326naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007000153245009200223300001400315520245400329592002802783650002102811650001902832650001102851650001902862650002102881650001602902650001802918650002202936650001402958650002202972650002202994650001503016650001003031650002203041650001403063650001703077650001103094650002403105650002303129651001803152653001903170653002603189653001703215653001103232653002603243653002503269700002503294700002303319700003103342700001603373700002203389700002103411700002603432700002503458773012003483856008803603852000903691655001203700IND60635876120221118051052.0190801e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063587612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesforges, Jean-Pierre W.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6816-769710aQuantification of the full lifecycle bioenergetics of a large mammal in the high Arctic  ap. 27-39.  aEnergy is a critical driver of animal life-history traits and Darwinian fitness, with direct implications for population dynamics. In the Arctic, extreme seasonal climatic conditions dictate energy flow and physiology of resident species. Consequently, vital rates of animal populations in the Arctic are tightly linked to climatic factors influencing food availability and quality. The muskox (Ovibos moschatus) is a capital breeder and the largest herbivore in the Arctic. Seasonal changes in energy intake influence body reserve dynamics of this species, impacting inter-annual and spatial variations in survival and recruitment. Yet, little is known about the full lifecycle bioenergetics of this and other Arctic species, and the impact of extreme seasonal conditions on life-history traits have never been quantified. By integrating energetic and physiological processes throughout the full lifecycle of individuals, we developed an individual-based model using dynamic energy budget theory (DEB-IBM) of the muskox that covers all aspects of mammalian life-history. We parameterized a baseline muskox model using data from a well-studied captive research herd, and then explored its application to a wild population in the high Arctic to assess the life-history implications of seasonal food availability. Our baseline DEB-IBM, which for the first time explicitly characterized fetal development using DEB theory, successfully predicted life-history traits as well as patterns of growth, body condition, feeding, metabolic rates, and reproduction of captive muskoxen. Adaptation of the model to the wild population required re-parameterization of only three variables that controlled seasonal food availability and upregulated assimilation. The wild model successfully captured inter-annual costs of reproduction, such that lactating females were in poorer body condition than females without calves. Arctic seasonal food limitations reduced fecundity in wild muskoxen by 42% compared to annual reproduction in well-fed captive individuals. We have developed a mechanistic energy-based framework to study life-history processes of muskoxen but the model is broadly applicable also for other mammals in the Arctic. Our study quantifies and highlights the strong interplay between energetics and individual fitness components, opening the door to future applications of the model in assessments of population dynamics and climate change impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOvibos moschatus 3abody condition 3acalves 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aenergy flow 3aenergy intake 3aenergy metabolism 3afecundity 3afetal development 3afood availability 3aherbivores 3aherds 3alactating females 3alactation 3alife history 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3aseasonal variation 3aArctic region 0aArctic mammals 0aDynamic energy budget 0aLife history 0aMuskox 0aPhysiological ecology 0aSeasonal environment1 aMarques, Gonçalo M.1 aBeumer, Larissa T.1 aChimienti, M.q(Marianna),1 aBlake, John1 aRowell, Janice E.1 aAdamczewski, Jan1 aSchmidt, Niels Martin1 avan Beest, Floris M.0 tEcological modelling.g2019 June 01, v. 401 p.27-39dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2019.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245009800172500002000270520140800290592002801698650002601726650002001752650002101772650002001793650001501813650002101828650001101849650002301860650002301883650001501906650001701921650001601938650001901954650002201973700003501995700003102030773011502061856007402176852000902250655001202259IND60577449820221120225323.0170808e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057744982DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.130782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadolahi‐Baghloei, Mohsen10aBehavior of Staphylococcus aureus Affected by Sumac Water Extract in vitro and Koobideh Kebab  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis experiment was carried out to introduce a palatable and stable new product against staphylococcus aureus resulting from adding of sumac water extract (SWE) to Koobideh kebab as a traditional food. After determining of MIC (3.125 mg/mL) and MBC (6.25 mg/mL) value of SWE against S. aureus, the bacterial growth was evaluated at sensorial acceptability concentrations of SWE. These treatments were assessed in vitro and a food model at 4 and 25C. Bacterial population significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in all the treatments as compared to control during storage period at both temperatures. SWE with 6.25 mg/mL concentration was the strongest group among the treatments at 4C. Sensory evaluation revealed that SWE gave a pleasant effect on sensory attributes at 3.125 and 6.25 mg/mL concentrations of SWE. In conclusion, SWE has high potential to extend the shelf life and upgrade of overall acceptability of Koobideh Kebab. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Nowadays, consumers are applicant to usage of natural replacements causing to side effects of synthetic preservatives such as carcinogenicity and teratogenicity. The excessive demand for natural preservatives particularly plant‐based compounds results in their extended utility. Sumac water extract (SWE) can be suggested as a replacement to synthetic preservatives as well as synthetic flavorings in Koobideh kebab with added health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadverse effects 3abiopreservatives 3acarcinogenicity 3aflavorings 3amicrobial growth 3amodels 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3ashelf life 3astorage time 3atemperature 3ateratogenicity 3atraditional foods1 aPajohi‐Alamoti, Mohammadreza1 aBazargani‐Gilani, Behnaz0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Aug., v. 41, no. 4dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.130783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03327naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245008200165300001400247520189900261536008102160592002802241650002102269650001502290650001102305650001402316650002302330650000902353650001502362650001102377650002502388650001702413650001402430650001202444650002602456650002902482653001102511653002502522653001602547653001302563653000902576700001802585700001802603700001902621773010402640856008002744852000902824655001202833IND60614964820221116204644.0181003e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061496482DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858103874472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmedley, R.

These neoplasms can resemble carcinomas, sarcomas, and round cell neoplasms, which differ in prognosis and treatment. A variety of immunohistochemical antibodies have been used for diagnosis of melanocytic neoplasms in humans and dogs; however, sensitivity and specificity of many markers have not been determined in amelanotic melanocytic neoplasms in dogs. The authors investigated a comprehensive panel of immunohistochemical markers in 49 canine oral amelanotic melanocytic neoplasms—namely, Melan-A, PNL2, HMB-45, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF), S-100, tyrosine hydroxylase, tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related proteins 1 and 2 (TRP-1 and TRP-2), and CD34. Ten well-differentiated cutaneous soft tissue spindle cell sarcomas were negative controls. Melan-A, PNL2, TRP-1, and TRP-2 were highly sensitive and 100% specific for the diagnosis of canine oral amelanotic melanocytic neoplasms. S-100 and MiTF showed high sensitivity but were less specific; that is, they also labeled a proportion of the soft tissue spindle cell sarcomas. HMB-45, tyrosinase, and tyrosine hydroxylase were 100% specific but had low sensitivities. CD34 did not label any of the melanocytic neoplasms but did label 80% of the soft tissue spindle cell sarcomas. A cost-effective and efficient immunodiagnostic cocktail containing antibodies against PNL2, Melan-A, TRP-1, and TRP-2 was created that had 100% specificity and 93.9% sensitivity in identifying canine oral amelanotic melanocytic neoplasms. The spindloid variant was the variant with the lowest sensitivity to the cocktail. The likelihood of correctly diagnosing canine oral amelanotic melanocytic neoplasms was dramatically higher when biopsy samples contained ample overlying and adjacent epithelium.  aFinancial support to perform this project came from Leica Microsystems, Inc.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3aantibodies 3abiopsy 3acarcinoma 3acost effectiveness 3adogs 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3apigmentation 3aprognosis 3asarcoma 3atranscription factors 3atyrosine 3-monooxygenase 0acanine 0aimmunohistochemistry 0amelanocytic 0amelanoma 0aoral1 aLamoureux, J.1 aSledge, D.

Triflumezopyrim (TFM) is a new mesoionic insecticide used to control SBPH in China. However, the sublethal effects of TFM on the growth and fecundity of SBPH are unknown and require further study. In this study, the age-stage life table and physiological parameters were used to assess the TFM's sublethal effects on SBPH. We found that sublethal doses of TFM significantly changed the life table parameters of SBPH. The oviposition and fecundity of female SBPH decreased significantly after treatment with different sublethal doses, as did the emergence rate of adults. In contrast, insects treated with sublethal doses of TFM had longer developmental durations and adult life spans than the control group. The activities of carboxylesterase (CarE) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in the treatment group showed inhibitory effects. Mixed-function oxidase (MFO) showed an induction effects at 24 and 48 h after treated. The results showed that the sublethal doses of TFM had negative effects on the population development of SBPH. These results can provide a theoretical basis for population control and resistance management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaodelphax striatellus 3aadults 3acarboxylesterase 3acorn 3afecundity 3afemales 3aglutathione transferase 3ainsecticides 3alife tables 3aoviposition 3apests 3aplant protection 3aresistance management 3arice 3awheat 3aChina 0aTriflumezopyrim 0aLife table 0aDetoxification enzymes 0aSublethal effect1 aXue, Yannan1 aDu, Ruoshi1 aLiu, Chang1 aWang, Xueting1 aWang, Youwei1 aLiu, Chao1 aWang, Sheng1 aWang, Jinhua1 aXia, Xiaoming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0327-66060 tCrop protection.g2021 Dec., v. 150 p.105813-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2021.1058133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012900158500002000287520177500307592002802082650002402110650002602134650002502160650002302185650002502208650002402233650002902257650002802286650002702314650002802341650002902369650002002398650001202418650002702430650002002457650001802477650002602495650002502521650001202546650002202558650001502580650001802595650001302613650001802626650002202644651000902666700002002675700002502695700002002720773011502740856007402855852000902929655001202938IND60577449920221120225300.0170808e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057744992DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.130092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilani, Elnaz10aIsolation and Identification of Lactic Acid Bacteria in Kurdish Cheese during Ripening using 16S rRNA Gene Sequence Analysis  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aKurdish cheese is a special local cheese produced and consumed in Khorasan province, North East, Iran. One‐hundred and five lactic acid bacteria isolates from various steps of Kurdish cheese ripening after identification of genus level by biochemical tests and molecular analysis based on universal and specific primers are Enterococcus faecium (29.5%), Lactobacillus plantarum (16.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (13.3%), Lactococcus lactis subsp lactis (11.4%), Enterococcus durans (8.6%), Lactobacillus pentosus (8.6%), Lactobacillus casei (3.8%), Enterococcus hirae (2.9%), Lactobacillus paracasei (2.9%), Lactobacillus helveticus (1.9%) and Lactobacillus brevis (0.9%). In initial stages of Kurdish cheese ripening, L. lactis subsp lactis was the predominant LAB, while Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus plantarum were the predominant LAB at the later stages. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Advances in molecular biology have allowed characterization of relevant strains exactly and improved the possibilities of isolating and characterizing due to the lack of precise genotypic identification of Kurdish cheese lactic microbiota. Traditional fermented foods, including dairy products, can be a source of new LAB strains, with interesting functional properties and with potential applications in food industry and health. Kurdish cheeses have been traditionally prepared, and markets exist in many parts of Iran for many years. The microbial diversity originates from natural microbiota present in the raw milk, and environmental exposures are important for public health point. The results of this work can lead to a useful regulation of further studies on antimicrobial activity of Kurdish cheese LAB, their technological activities and evaluation probiotic potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus durans 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aEnterococcus hirae 3aLactobacillus brevis 3aLactobacillus casei 3aLactobacillus helveticus 3aLactobacillus paracasei 3aLactobacillus pentosus 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aantimicrobial properties 3acheese ripening 3acheeses 3aenvironmental exposure 3afermented foods 3afood industry 3afunctional properties 3alactic acid bacteria 3amarkets 3amolecular biology 3aprobiotics 3apublic health 3araw milk 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aIran1 aShahidi, Fakhri1 aMortazavi, Seyed Ali1 aSaeedi, Mansour0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Aug., v. 41, no. 4dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.130093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009900168300001600267520067400283592002800957650001500985650001301000650001801013650001801031650001201049700002001061773012801081856008201209852000901291655001201300IND60089366920221118235954.0141102e20110325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008936692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.02.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllegra, Danilo10aIn-vivo quantification of primary microRNA processing by Drosha with a luciferase based system  ap. 501-505.  aThe RNAse III Drosha is responsible for the first step of microRNA maturation, the cleavage of primary miRNA to produce the precursor miRNA.

With respect to other methods for measuring Drosha activity, our system is faster and scalable, can be used with any cellular system and does not require cell sorting or use of radioactive isotopes.

However, measles outbreaks continue to occur increasingly involving adolescents and adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence to measles antibody in a sample of Italian population between 1993 and 2018.Human serum samples from subjects aged 3–40 years were collected between 1993 and 2018 and tested for measles IgG antibodies by commercial ELISA.During the study period, the 3–10-year-old age group showed the most important change, with a significant increase in 2003–2007 in both seroprevalence and IgG levels, followed by a slow decrease. The 11–18-year-old age group showed relatively stable seroprevalence rates and IgG levels over the years. The 19–30-year-old group showed stable seroprevalence rates, albeit with a decrease in IgG levels. After a significant increase in 1999–2002, the 31–40-year-old age group had high seroprevalence rates and IgG levels.Despite efforts at national level for implementing measles vaccination, a large proportion of the population is still susceptible to measles. Even if vaccination coverage increases enough to achieve the level of immunization required for herd immunity in new birth cohorts, outbreaks will continue to occur if there are immunity gaps in older age groups. Establishing policies for measles vaccination targeting adult population is needed to close immunity gaps and reach the elimination goal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3aherd immunity 3ameasles 3aseroprevalence 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aItaly 0aImmunity 0aEpidemiology1 aRemarque, Edmond J.1 aViviani, Simonetta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3652-50821 aRizzo, Caterina1 aMonteverde Spencer, Geraldo Tadinho1 aColuccio, Rosa1 aMontomoli, Emanuele1 aTrombetta, Claudia Maria0 tVaccine.g2021 Sept. 24, v. 39, no. 40 p.5928-5933dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010100169500001900270520147100289592002801760650004101788650001201829650001201841650001901853650001201872650002301884650002501907650001101932650001301943650001601956650002001972650001601992650002402008650001502032651002202047653002202069653001602091653001702107653000902124700005302133700001302186700001402199700001402213700001702227700001902244773010202263856008502365852000902450655001202459IND60700999720221122142453.0201025e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070099972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2020.1047672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qianfeng10aFreeze-Thaw cycle representation alters response of watershed hydrology to future climate change  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHydrologic models are widely used for projecting influences of changing climate on water resources. In this study, we compared the original Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an enhanced version of SWAT model with physically based Freeze-Thaw cycle representation (SWAT-FT) for simulating future annual ET, stream flow, water yield, surface runoff, and subsurface runoff in the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB). SWAT-FT projected fewer frozen days than the original SWAT model due to its better representation of snow cover insulation effects. Both models derived declining trends in annual streamflow and terrestrial water yield in the late 21st century due to increased ET under warmer climate. However, these two models exhibited contrasting mechanisms underlying the streamflow decline. For original SWAT model, the decrease in surface runoff was the major driver, while for SWAT-FT, reduced subsurface runoff was the main cause. In general, the original SWAT model predicted more surface runoff and less subsurface runoff than SWAT-FT. Further geospatial inspection shows large discrepancies between these two models, particularly in the northern colder parts of the UMRB, where the maximum differences in annual surface and subsurface runoff reached 130 mm yr⁻¹ and 140 mm yr⁻¹, respectively. Collectively, the results demonstrate the importance of accounting for Freeze-Thaw cycles for reliable projection of future water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3acatenas 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adecline 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3ainsulating materials 3arunoff 3asnowpack 3astream flow 3asubsurface flow 3awater yield 3awatershed hydrology 3awatersheds 3aMississippi River 0aFreeze-Thaw Cycle 0aCold Region 0aSurface Flow 0aSWAT1 aQi, Junyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5316-42261 aWu, Huan1 aZeng, Yue1 aShui, Wei1 aZeng, Jingyu1 aZhang, Xuesong0 tCatena.g2020 Dec., v. 195 p.104767-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2020.1047673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012500167300001600292520111000308592002801418650001201446650001901458650002901477650001901506650001201525650001101537650002101548650001301569650001501582650002601597650001501623650001401638650001101652650001301663650001401676651001201690653001701702653002301719653001301742653001301755653001101768653001201779653001801791700002601809773010401835856008101939852000902020655001202029IND60622227020221122011319.0181124e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062222702DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683603hl616rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCole, Edwina E.10aHuman impact on the Irish landscape during the late Holocene inferred from palynological studies at three peatland sites  ap. 507-515.  aPollen data covering the last 1200 years from a transect of three peatland sites across Ireland are reported. The data reveal reductions in woodland and increased anthropogenic activity over time. A decline in Corylus-type pollen at around AD 1750 was a dramatic and concurrent event at all three sites which coincided with more intensive land use. Multivariate data analysis reveals that prior to the Corylus-type decline distinct regional differences occurred between the sites, but that after it this regional variation was lost. It is concluded that more intense land use led to greater regional uniformity. Rising human population coincides with evidence for intense land use in the pollen data. The failure of the potato crop and the Great Famine of 1845 led to a population crash, but this had limited impact on the landscape. The imprint of human activity on the landscape over the last 1200 years appears to have overwhelmed any impacts that could be attributed solely to climatic change associated with the ‘Mediaeval Warm Period’, the ‘Little Ice Age’ or late twentieth-century warming.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorylus 3aHolocene epoch 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate change 3adecline 3afamine 3ahuman population 3aland use 3alandscapes 3amultivariate analysis 3apalynology 3apeatlands 3apollen 3apotatoes 3awoodlands 3aIreland 0aHuman impact 0avegetation history 0apeatland 0aland use 0apollen 0aIreland 0alate Holocene1 aMitchell, Fraser J.G.0 tHolocene.g2003 May, v. 13, no. 4 p.507-515dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl616rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015400167300001400321520197000335592002802305650001202333650001502345650001302360650001302373650001802386650001302404650001702417650001402434650001002448650001602458651001102474700001802485700002002503700001502523700001902538700001902557700002102576773008302597856008502680990002302765852000902788655001202797IND60093613320221119034137.0141103e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009361332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzmy, Karem10aMagnesium-isotope and REE compositions of Lower Ordovician carbonates from eastern Laurentia: Implications for the origin of dolomites and limestones  ap. 64-75.  aCarbonates representing different depositional and diagenetic settings (near-surface to deep burial), including modern sabkha, were collected from the Lower Ordovician St. George Group in eastern Laurentia (western Newfoundland, Canada). Based on petrographic examination, three dolomite phases were identified: D1 dolomicrite (crystals ranging from 4 to 50μm), D2 dolomite (50 to 150μm) and D3 saddle dolomite (≥500μm). They occur as replacements and cements, and exhibit dull (for D1 and D3) to zoned (for D2) luminescence. The occurrence of near-micritic dolomites (D1) suggests that dolomitization started at low temperatures under near-surface conditions during an early stage of diagenesis, whereas microthermometric studies of the D2 and D3 dolomites confirmed their formation at higher temperatures, on average, of 112±19°C and 153±30°C, respectively, under deeper burial conditions. The D1 dolomicrite yields an average δ²⁶Mg value of −1.92±0.30‰ (DSM3), which is slightly more negative than those of the D2 dolomite with −1.75±0.34‰ (DSM3) and D3 saddle dolomite with −1.58±0.31‰ (DSM3). The slightly more positive δ²⁶Mg values of the higher-temperature dolomites (D2 and D3) suggest insignificant kinetic fractionation and slight overprinting by ²⁶Mg-enriched diagenetic fluids recirculating in siliciclastic and ²⁶Mg-rich crustal rocks under closed to semi-closed diagenetic conditions. The Sr-isotope signatures support the formation of D1 dolomicrite in an early diagenetic stage and the REE compositions of the investigated dolomites favor their formation in semi-closed to closed diagenetic systems with fluid compositions evolving by circulation through crustal rocks with progressive burial. Furthermore, the Mg isotopes suggest that the lime mudstones of the St. George Group had an algal origin, whereas the D2 dolomite was sourced and subsequently altered mostly from the D1 dolomicrites of the succession.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLobelia 3acarbonates 3acrystals 3adolomite 3afractionation 3aisotopes 3aluminescence 3amagnesium 3arocks 3atemperature 3aCanada1 aLavoie, Denis1 aWang, Zhengrong1 aBrand, Uwe1 aAl-Aasm, Ihsan1 aJackson, Simon1 aGirard, Isabelle0 tChemical geology.g2013 Oct. 9, v. 356 p.64-75dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.07.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245007100170300001400241500001900255520082200274592002801096650001401124650001201138650001301150650002301163650001901186650000901205651001101214700002101225700002101246773009201267856007601359852000901435655001201444IND60687204120221118144343.0200328e20100706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068720412DNAL7 a10.3897/biorisk.4.542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCochard, Pierre-Olivier10aAlien terrestrial crustaceans (Isopods and Amphipods).

In addition, 21 species native to Europe were introduced in a European region to which they are not native. The establishment of alien crustacean species in Europe slowly increased during the 20th century without any marked changes during the recent decades. Almost all species alien to Europe originate from sub-tropical or tropical areas. Most of the initial introductions were recorded in greenhouses, botanical gardens and urban parks, probably associated with passive transport of soil, plants or compost. Alien woodlice are still confined to urban habitats. Natural habitats have only been colonized by three amphipod species in the family Talitridade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aIsopoda 3acomposts 3aindigenous species 3alawns and turf 3asoil 3aEurope1 aVilisics, Ferenc1 aSechet, Emmanuel0 tBioRisk.g2010 July 06, v. 4 p.81-96dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2140x1313-26527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/biorisk.4.543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245002700130300001100157520085300168592002801021650001101049650001601060650001101076650001501087650001601102650001401118650001501132650001301147651001001160773012201170852000901292655001201301IND60312911120221117035732.0150714e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031291112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPease, Roland10aDouble-whammy tsunami?  ap. 18.  aThe 2011 earthquake that rocked Japan and sent a devastating tsunami sweeping down the country's coast may have had help from a huge undersea landslide, an international team of researchers says. If confirmed, the scenario could explain why waves along one 100-kilometer stretch of coastline topped 40 meters—four times as high as elsewhere in Japan—and claimed about a quarter of the tsunami's 18,000 victims. Other geoscientists had proposed that an undetected second earthquake triggered the monster waves, but the authors of the new study were unconvinced. Working backward from water motion recorded by shoreline gauges on the day of the earthquake, they conclude that a slab of sediment the size of Paris slid down the steep slope of the Japan Trench near the northern end of the 2011 rupture, acting like a piston to amplify the tsunami.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aearthquakes 3agauges 3alandslides 3aresearchers 3asediments 3ashorelines 3atsunamis 3aJapan0 tScience.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 346, no. 6205 p.18-18dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01819naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012000158520084700278592002801125650000901153650002701162650000901189650001801198650002101216650002901237700002001266700002101286773012701307856007401434852000901508655001201517IND60652828920221122040821.0190713e20190216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065282892DNAL7 a10.3390/su110410352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyo-jin,10aDoes Combined Heat and Power Play the Role of a Bridge in Energy Transition? Evidence from a Cross-Country Analysis  aIn an era of energy transition involving an increase in renewable energy and a reduction in coal-fired power generation and nuclear power generation, the role of combined heat and power (CHP) as a bridging energy is highly emphasized. This article attempts to look empirically into the impact of increasing the share of renewable energy in total electricity generation on CHP share in total electricity generation in a cross-country context. Data from 35 countries during the period 2009&ndash;2015 were used, and the least absolute deviations estimator was applied to obtain a more robust parameter estimate. The results showed that a 1%p increase in the share of renewable energy significantly increased the CHP share by 0.87%p. Therefore, the hypothesis that CHP serves as bridge energy in the process of energy transition was established.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3aelectricity generation 3aheat 3anuclear power 3apower generation 3arenewable energy sources1 aYu, Jeong-Joon 1 aYoo, Seung-Hoon 0 tSustainability.g2019 Feb. 16, v. 11, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110410353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02596naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245006900163300001600232520110200248536013801350592002801488650002101516650001201537650001101549650002201560650000901582650001301591650001001604650001401614650001101628650001301639650001001652650000901662650004301671650000901714653000901723653002201732653001301754653002001767700001301787700001401800700001801814700001801832700001501850700001801865773010601883856008001989852000902069655001202078IND60614965320221116204742.0181003e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061496532DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858103885232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanemoto, H.10aExpression of Fibrosis-Related Genes in Canine Chronic Hepatitis  ap. 839-845.  aMolecular regulation of fibrosis in chronic canine hepatitis is poorly understood. The authors employed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the expression levels of genes reported to be related to fibrosis in other species (human, mouse, and rat) and to elucidate the relationship of these genes with the degree of fibrosis and the presence or absence of ascites and/or jaundice in dogs with hepatitis. Nine fibrosis-related genes were assayed: PDGFB, PDGFD, MMP2, TIMP1, THBS1, COL1A1, COL3A1, TGFB1, and TGFB2. Liver samples of 15 dogs with chronic hepatitis and 4 healthy control dogs were obtained via laparoscopic biopsy and subjected to histologic and quantitative PCR analyses. The expression of all 9 genes showed significant positive correlation (P < .01, r > .70) with the degree of fibrosis. Furthermore, the expression levels of all genes except TGFB1 were significantly higher (P < .05) in dogs with hepatic failure–related symptoms (ascites/jaundice). Results suggest that these 9 genes are integral to the development of fibrosis in canine chronic hepatitis.  aThis work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) of Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (KAKENHI 21380193).  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3aascites 3abiopsy 3achronic hepatitis 3adogs 3afibrosis 3agenes 3ahistology 3ahumans 3ajaundice 3aliver 3amice 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 0adogs 0achronic hepatitis 0afibrosis 0agene expression1 aOhno, K.1 aSakai, M.1 aNakashima, K.1 aTakahashi, M.1 aFujino, Y.1 aTsujimoto, H.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 48, no. 4 p.839-845dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858103885233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014700174300001800321520130100339592002801640650001401668650001301682650001501695650002601710650002301736650001401759650001401773650002601787650001801813650001201831650001601843650001301859651001201872653002201884653002301906653001901929653001001948653001001958653001001968700002201978700001402000700002102014700001902035773010002054856008602154852000902240655001202249IND60749345420221119135505.0220103e20210924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074934542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClayton, Katherine10aEvaluating the effects of vaccine messaging on immunization intentions and behavior: Evidence from two randomized controlled trials in Vermont  ap. 5909-5917.  aThe effectiveness of vaccines in reducing child morbidity and mortality worldwide relies on public acceptance. However, relatively little is known about the effects of vaccine communication on vaccine attitudes and immunization behavior. Previous research suggests that common communication approaches may be ineffective or even counterproductive, especially among vaccine-hesitant parents. However, these studies typically rely on observational data or self-reported measures of vaccination intention. Using novel research designs, we tested the attitudinal and behavioral effects of messages encouraging vaccination in both a survey experiment conducted among a large sample of parents in Vermont who expressed hesitancy about childhood immunizations and a field experiment among parents whose children were overdue for vaccines. We find that neither a message promoting immunization as a social norm nor a message correcting common misperceptions about vaccines was measurably more effective than a standard public health message at improving parents’ attitudes toward vaccines, intention to vaccinate their children, or compliance with the recommended vaccine schedule. Our results highlight the need for more research on approaches to successfully reducing vaccine hesitancy among parents.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood 3achildren 3acompliance 3afield experimentation 3ahealth information 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aobservational studies 3apublic health 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aVermont 0aVaccine hesitancy 0aChildhood vaccines 0aMisperceptions 0aMyths 0aFacts 0aNorms1 aFinley, Christine1 aDJ Flynn,1 aGraves, Meredith1 aNyhan, Brendan0 tVaccine.g2021 Sept. 24, v. 39, no. 40 p.5909-5917dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015500168300001300323520171700336592002802053650001302081650001402094650001102108650001702119650001102136650000902147650002502156650001202181650001602193650000902209651001102218653002102229653004802250653002702298653004202325653001902367700001702386700001802403700001702421700001902438700001902457773007602476856008602552852000902638655001202647IND60539375020221120204030.0160815e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053937502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Yu-Pin10aIdentification of spatial distributions and uncertainties of multiple heavy metal concentrations by using spatial conditioned Latin Hypercube sampling  ap. 9-21.  aThis work develops spatial conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (scLHS), a novel advance on conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) [Minasny and McBratney, Computers & Geosciences (2006) 1378–1388]. The difference between cLHS and scLHS is that the latter introduces variograms of ancillary variables into the objective function of the optimization procedure that selects sampling locations. The improvement of scLHS was evaluated by applying both scLHS and cLHS to simulated samples of multiple heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn) in the soil of Changhua County in Taiwan. Simulation was done by using sequential indicator simulation (SIS), which generated 1000 realizations of spatial distributions of the heavy metals, based on existing sample data, to represent the real distributions of heavy metals. The results of the Ripley K analysis show that the locations of samples obtained by both approaches were not significantly spatially segregated. The sampling results show that the declustering of sample locations may dominate the optimization process in cLHS and scLHS. Statistical analysis indicated that compared with cLHS, the means, standard deviations and contamination proportions of scLHS samples captured more efficiently the variability of the SIS realizations. Moreover, the experimental variograms of scLHS samples, especially for small sample sizes, captured the experimental variograms of the SIS realizations more efficiently. Therefore, the use of the scLHS approach is recommended as a novel alternative sampling approach without the need for a reconnaissance survey to increase the efficiency of capturing the spatial structures of soil heavy metals and delineating contaminated sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3acomputers 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3anickel 3asoil 3astatistical analysis 3asurveys 3auncertainty 3azinc 3aTaiwan 0aSpatial sampling 0aConditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS) 0aExperimental variogram 0aSequential indicator simulation (SIS) 0aSoil pollution1 aLin, Weizhi,1 aLi, Meng-Ying1 aChen, Yen-Yu1 aChiang, Li-Chi1 aWang, Yongjie,0 tGeoderma.g2014 Oct., v. 230-231 p.9-21dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245014600154500002000300520162800320592002801948650001401976650002701990650001702017650001402034650001002048650001602058650001702074650001102091650004302102650002202145650001602167650001402183650001702197650001502214651001002229700001202239700001302251700001402264700002302278773011502301856007402416852000902490655001202499IND60577450520221119014504.0170808e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057745052DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.130802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Bo10aImpact of Adding Ellagic Acid to Red Grapes on the Phenolic Composition and Chromatic Quality of Cabernet Sauvignon Wines from a Warm Climate  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, the effect of adding ellagic acid (Ea) before alcoholic fermentation on the phenolic composition and chromatic quality of Cabernet Sauvignon wines were investigated. The evolution of the color and polyphenolics was determined by tristimulus colorimetry and HPLC‐MS during the industrial‐scale winemaking process, which showed that the prefermentation addition of Ea could obtain more saturated and vivid hue wines, consistent with the significant increase in anthocyanins concentration. The copigmentation effect induced by Ea was also confirmed by the higher copigmentation degree in the treated samples. Thus, the addition of Ea could provide a simple and useful enological technique to enhance the red wine quality, improve the intensity and stability of wine color, and can be employed as an alternative strategy for obtaining high‐quality red wines from a warm climate region (e.g., Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China). PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The main objective of this work is to evaluate the effect of adding Ea before alcoholic fermentation on color and phenolic compounds of red wines, which could be helpful in reasonably application of copigment additives and enlargement the understanding of the chemistry of interaction between this copigment and anthocyanins. Although the Ea is currently not approved for use in wines in somewhere of world, this addition treatment could provide a useful enological technique to enhance the intensity and stability of red wine color. For this reason, we believe that this study is valuable in providing useful insights for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aanthocyanins 3achemistry 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aellagic acid 3agrapes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3apolyphenols 3ared wines 3awine quality 3awinemaking 3aChina1 aHe, Fei1 aLiu, Yue1 aCai, Jian1 aDuan, Chang‐Qing0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2017 Aug., v. 41, no. 4dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.130803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245016100164300001600325520165400341536009401995592002802089650002302117650002102140650002102161650001702182650002502199650002402224650001002248650001402258650001402272650001602286651002002302653001602322653001502338653001702353653001002370653001002380653001702390653001402407653002102421653001402442653000902456700001502465700002202480773010602502856008002608852000902688655001202697IND60614965420221116204938.0181003e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061496542DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858103885242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDennis, M.

The role of C forsteri in annual SBT mortality outbreaks, which peak 6 to 12 weeks poststocking, is unknown. The objective of this study was to identify lesions unique to cultured SBT that died during a mortality event in 2009 and to determine the significance of C forsteri–associated lesions. Cultured SBT were sampled from 4 pontoons of a single site in Spencer Gulf that experienced a mortality epidemic that spanned 5 to 14 weeks poststocking. Study SBT comprised 7 that died during peak mortality, 27 that did not die, and 10 wild-caught (noncultured) SBT. All cultured SBT had branchitis and myocarditis due to C forsteri, whereas no life stages of C forsteri were histologically identified in any wild-caught SBT. Mortality was associated with the presence of severe branchitis (P < .005), and the odds of severe branchitis were 90 times greater for SBT that died than for SBT that were live caught during peak mortality (95% confidence interval, 5 to 1,684). In SBT that had died, no lesions other than those associated with C forsteri were of sufficient severity or physiologic significance to account for death. Other lesions common among cultured SBT included systemic granulocytic perivascular infiltrate, granulocytic gastric infiltrate, hepatic lipidosis, visceral granulomas, and branchial parasitic infestation. This study shows for the first time that a substantial proportion of poststocking mortality in cultured SBT is strongly associated with severe branchitis caused by C forsteri.  aThis work was part of a diagnostic investigation funded by Blaslov Fishing Group Pty Ltd.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCardicola forsteri 3aThunnus maccoyii 3aanimal pathology 3ablood flukes 3acase-control studies 3aconfidence interval 3adeath 3agranuloma 3amortality 3amyocarditis 3aSouth Australia 0ablood fluke 0abranchitis 0aCardicola sp 0agills 0aheart 0ainflammation 0apathology 0aThunnus maccoyii 0aTrematoda 0atuna1 aLandos, M.1 aD’Antignana, T.0 tVeterinary pathology.g, v. 48, no. 4 p.846-855dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl13945x1544-22177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03009858103885243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245019500162300001600357520180900373592002802182650001302210650001402223650001302237653001302250653001002263653002302273653001402296653000902310653001102319700001602330700001402346700001802360700001902378773009502397856008402492852000902576655001202585IND60525634520221119164645.0190401e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052563452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2016.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoar, K.10aInvestigating the effects of caffeine on executive functions using traditional Stroop and a new ecologically-valid virtual reality task, the Jansari assessment of Executive Functions (JEF©)  ap. 156-163.  aCaffeine has been shown to have effects on certain areas of cognition, but in executive functioning the research is limited and also inconsistent. One reason could be the need for a more sensitive measure to detect the effects of caffeine on executive function. This study used a new non-immersive virtual reality assessment of executive functions known as JEF© (the Jansari Assessment of Executive Function) alongside the ‘classic’ Stroop Colour-Word task to assess the effects of a normal dose of caffeinated coffee on executive function.Using a double-blind, counterbalanced within participants procedure 43 participants were administered either a caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee and completed the ‘JEF©’ and Stroop tasks, as well as a subjective mood scale and blood pressure pre- and post condition on two separate occasions a week apart. JEF© yields measures for eight separate aspects of executive functions, in addition to a total average score.Findings indicate that performance was significantly improved on the planning, creative thinking, event-, time- and action-based prospective memory, as well as total JEF© score following caffeinated coffee relative to the decaffeinated coffee. The caffeinated beverage significantly decreased reaction times on the Stroop task, but there was no effect on Stroop interference.The results provide further support for the effects of a caffeinated beverage on cognitive functioning. In particular, it has demonstrated the ability of JEF© to detect the effects of caffeine across a number of executive functioning constructs, which weren’t shown in the Stroop task, suggesting executive functioning improvements as a result of a ‘typical’ dose of caffeine may only be detected by the use of more real-world, ecologically valid tasks.  aPublisher supplied data 3acaffeine 3acognition 3aemotions 0aCaffeine 0aJEF© 0aExecutive function 0aCognitive 0aMood 0aStroop1 aChapman, E.1 aLavan, N.1 aJansari, A.S.1 aTurner, J.J.D.0 tAppetite.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 105 p.156-163dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245010800166300001600274500001900290520118400309592002801493650001401521650002601535650001501561650003001576700001401606700001601620700001501636700001801651700005701669773014401726856008301870852000901953655001201962IND60694381720221122064222.0200513e20200312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069438172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.0c001372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hai-Bo10aProbing the Deposition Kinetics of Nanoparticles by Plasmonic Imaging and Counting Single Nanoparticles  ap. 298-302.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnderstanding the nanoparticle deposition process is important for predicting the transport and fate of nanoparticles in natural and engineered aquatic environments. Traditional methods for deposition studies are based on ensemble analysis of nanoparticles. Here, a single-nanoparticle imaging method was used to probe the deposition kinetics of nanoparticles by directly counting single nanoparticles with powerful surface plasmon resonance microscopy (SPRM). The ability of SPRM to provide single-nanoparticle imaging and its vertical sensitivity enabled us to differentiate collision and attachment events and, consequently, determine the attachment efficiency without any additional control experiments. As a proof-of-concept application of SPRM in measuring nanoparticle deposition, the relationship of the solution chemistry and surface chemistry with the attachment efficiency of nanoparticles was correlated. These results demonstrated that nanoparticle deposition kinetics at the single-particle level can be obtained with SPRM and that this technology can also be used to investigate other particle–particle or particle–surface interactions in aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3aenvironmental science 3amicroscopy 3asurface plasmon resonance1 aJiang, Di1 aLiu, Yi-Nan1 aQian, Chen1 aZhou, Xiao-Li1 aLiu, Xian-Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0493-82100 tEnvironmental science & technology letters.g2020 Mar. 12, v. 7, no. 5 p.298-302dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23341x2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c001373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245009100169500001900260520113600279592002801415650001501443650002201458650001101480650001301491650001301504650001701517650002401534650001101558650001501569650000901584653001301593653003001606653001701636700002501653700002401678700002201702700002501724773009101749856008501840852000901925655001201934IND60701000220221121065031.0210201e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070100022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1181532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStraka, Robert10aPrediction of raceway shape in zinc blast furnace under the different blast parameters  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe shape of raceway cavities in the Imperial Smelting Process plays an important role in zinc production; the effectiveness of this process is also improved because the deadman zone is changed. We present numerical simulations of the raceway based on a two-phase mathematical model. MFIX software is used to simulate the flue gas flow, combustion and gasification of coke particles in the raceway as these are the main phenomena that contribute to the shape of raceway cavities. The purpose of the paper is to describe changes in the shape of these cavities when the blast parameters are altered. Simulations with the blast volumetric flow ranging from 30,000 mN3/h to 35,000 mN3/h with different oxygen enrichment levels ranging from 400 mN3/h to 800 mN3/h were performed. The results showed that the change in depth of the cavities correlates with blast volume but not with oxygen enrichment. The height of the cavity correlates with both blast volume and oxygen enrichment. The shape of the deadman depends significantly on the blast volume, while oxygen enrichment does not play any substantial role in its depth or width.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aflue gas 3afurnaces 3agasification 3amathematical models 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3azinc 0aModeling 0aImperial smelting furnace 0aRaceway zone1 aBernasowski, Mikolaj1 aKlimczyk, Arkadiusz1 aStachura, Ryszard1 aSvyetlichnyy, Dmytro0 tEnergy.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 207 p.118153-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1181533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01877naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245005200127300001400179520102200193592002801215650001201243650001901255650003501274650002001309650001101329650001101340650001201351650001801363650001601381650001201397651001101409773012201420852000901542655001201551IND60312911320221117035234.0150714e20141003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031291132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCohen, Jon10aEarly AIDS virus may have ridden Africa's rails  ap. 21-22.  aA new, sophisticated analysis of hundreds of genetic sequences of HIV from different time points and locations adds fascinating insights to the origin of the AIDS epidemic. The study, which appears in this issue of Science (see p. 56), confirms earlier analyses that an HIV-infected person came to what today is Kinshasa around 1920, but it then shows for the first time how the virus went from there to two cities in the southeastern portion of the country, likely aided by the extensive rail system that then existed. The researchers also note that 13 documented cases exist of different simian viruses jumping from chimpanzees, gorillas, and monkeys into humans, but only one—known has HIV-1 group M—sparked a global epidemic. They show that group M and another strain, group O, expanded at the same rate until about 1960, but then group M nearly tripled its rate of spread. Possible reasons include public health campaigns that had contaminated needles and an increase in the number of clients of sex workers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGorilla 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aPan troglodytes 3acities 3ahumans 3amonkeys 3apublic health 3aresearchers 3aviruses 3aAfrica0 tScience.g2014 Oct. 3, v. 346, no. 6205 p.21-22dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245011100164300001600275500001900291520146000310592002801770650001501798650002001813650002601833650001701859650001201876650001001888650001901898650001501917650002301932650001501955700001701970700001201987700001701999700001302016700001602029700001502045700002102060700001602081700005602097773014402153856008302297852000902380655001202389IND60694381820221122112314.0200513e20200420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069438182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.0c001692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Manni12aA New Portable Instrument for Online Measurements of Formaldehyde: From Ambient to Mobile Emission Sources  ap. 292-297.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFormaldehyde (HCHO) plays an important role in atmospheric photochemistry, HOₓ budget, and ozone formation. Several instruments have been developed for measuring ambient HCHO, yet few have targeted primary emission sources due to their very high HCHO levels and complex emission conditions. Here, we present a novel portable instrument, the Hantzsch-Abs, based on the Hantzsch reaction and absorption photometry, which is specifically designed for online continuous measurement of HCHO concentrations both in ambient environment and from vehicle exhaust. The Hantzsch-Abs features an adjustable liquid waveguide capillary cell (LWCC), displaying high sensitivity and strong flexibility for HCHO detection. The limit of detection of the Hantzsch-Abs based on a 50 cm LWCC was 25 pptv; the measurement range could be adjusted up to approximately 3 ppmv. A field comparison with commercially available instruments indicated that the Hantzsch-Abs was sufficiently robust in monitoring atmospheric HCHO concentrations. Furthermore, the instrument is capable of capturing dynamic patterns in HCHO emissions from vehicles under both chassis dynamometer and on-road tests, which suggests potential applications in measuring vehicle emissions. Our experimental data indicated that HCHO emission patterns from vehicles are strongly correlated with driving conditions and that current HCHO emission characteristics for vehicles likely require systematic updating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adetection limit 3aenvironmental science 3aformaldehyde 3aliquids 3aozone 3aphotochemistry 3aphotometry 3aportable equipment 3atechnology1 aDong, Huabin1 aYu, Fei1 aLiao, Songdi1 aXie, Yan1 aLiu, Junwen1 aSha, Qinge1 aZhong, Zhuangmin1 aZeng, Limin1 aZheng, Junyu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8267-72550 tEnvironmental science & technology letters.g2020 Apr. 20, v. 7, no. 5 p.292-297dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23341x2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c001693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010600170300001800276520201700294592002802311650001502339650001902354650000802373650001202381650002202393650001602415650001602431650001302447653002202460653002302482653004702505653002302552700002002575700002102595700002402616700002502640773010002665856008602765852000902851655001202860IND60749345720221119135456.0220103e20210924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074934572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzam, James M.10aModelling the relative benefits of using the measles vaccine outside cold chain for outbreak response  ap. 5845-5853.  aRapid outbreak response vaccination is a strategy for measles control and elimination. Measles vaccines must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range, but this can present significant challenges when targeting remote populations. Measles vaccine licensure for delivery outside cold chain (OCC) could provide more vaccine transport/storage space without ice packs, and a solution to shorten response times. However, due to vaccine safety and wastage considerations, the OCC strategy will require other operational changes, potentially including the use of 1-dose (monodose) instead of 10-dose vials, requiring larger transport/storage equipment currently achieved with 10-dose vials. These trade-offs require quantitative comparisons of vaccine delivery options to evaluate their relative benefits.We developed a modelling framework combining elements of the vaccine supply chain - cold chain, vial, team, and transport equipment types - with a measles transmission dynamics model to compare vaccine delivery options. We compared 10 strategies resulting from combinations of the vaccine supply elements and grouped into three main classes: OCC, partial cold chain (PCC), and full cold chain (FCC). For each strategy, we explored a campaign with 20 teams sequentially targeting 5 locations with 100,000 individuals each. We characterised the time needed to freeze ice packs and complete the campaign (campaign duration), vaccination coverage, and cases averted, assuming a fixed pre-deployment delay before campaign commencement. We performed sensitivity analyses of the pre-deployment delay, population sizes, and two team allocation schemes.The OCC, PCC, and FCC strategies achieve campaign durations of 50, 51, and 52 days, respectively. Nine of the ten strategies can achieve a vaccination coverage of 80%, and OCC averts the most cases.The OCC strategy, therefore, presents improved operational and epidemiological outcomes relative to current practice and the other options considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold chain 3adynamic models 3aice 3ameasles 3astorage equipment 3atemperature 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aOutbreak response 0aVaccine cold chain 0aExtended controlled temperature conditions 0aOutside cold chain1 aSaitta, Barbara1 aBonner, Kimberly1 aFerrari, Matthew J.1 aPulliam, Juliet R.C.0 tVaccine.g2021 Sept. 24, v. 39, no. 40 p.5845-5853dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.08.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245007400164300001400238520163700252536017201889592002802061650002102089650001002110650000902120650001502129650002502144650001302169650001202182650001702194650001502211650001402226650001202240653001702252653001102269653001302280653003202293653001802325700001902343700001802362700002002380700001902400773010402419856008002523852000902603655001202612IND60614965820221116205104.0181003e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061496582DNAL7 a10.1177/03009858103889472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergin, I. L.10aPrognostic Evaluation of Ki67 Threshold Value in Canine Oral Melanoma  ap. 41-53.  aOral melanoma is a common canine cancer with a historically poor prognosis. Recent evidence suggests that a subset of cases may have a more favorable outcome, defined as long-term survival in the absence of intervention other than initial surgery. Traditional histological parameters have had prognostic significance in some studies but not in others, potentially due to interobserver variation. We evaluated the prognostic utility of Ki67 immunohistochemistry in a group of 79 canine oral melanomas using a technique easily applied in a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. A threshold Ki67 value of >19.5 had a sensitivity and specificity of 87.1% and 85.4%, respectively, at predicting death or euthanasia due to melanoma by 1 year postdiagnosis. Threshold values for classical histological parameters were also identified for most cases and were >4 (>30%; sensitivity = 83.9%, specificity = 86.0%) for the nuclear atypia score and >4/10 hpfs (sensitivity = 90.3%, specificity = 84.4%) for the mitotic index. In this study, the percentages correctly classified with respect to death by 1 year postdiagnosis were comparable for Ki67 (86.1%, 68/79), the nuclear atypia score (86.3%, 63/73), and the mitotic index (86.8%, 66/76). High pigmentation (>50%) had a high negative predictive value of 90.9% (18/20), but overall, only 61.0% (47/77) of cases could be correctly classified by this parameter. Based on these results, we recommend a panel of prognostic parameters, including the nuclear atypia score, the mitotic index, Ki67, and pigmentation quantification to more accurately predict the likely outcome of canine oral melanomas.  aThis project was funded by the Marilyn and Ron Palleschi Fund for Canine Health within the Companion Animal Fund program at Michigan State University, grant 81-3214-A.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal pathology 3adeath 3adogs 3aeuthanasia 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amelanoma 3amitosis 3apigmentation 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3asurgery 0aantigen Ki67 0acanine 0amelanoma 0asensitivity and specificity 0amitotic index1 aSmedley, R.

B. maculata from a Lower-Mid Pleistocene locality in Ramallo, Buenos Aires, Argentina is described, representing the first fossil record of this genus. This specimen is referred to this living genus on the basis of the following features: robust supratemporal bone very wide at mid-length; subcentral process of the basioccipital with three well-developed subequal projections forming a wide, flat, posteriorly indented surface; lymphatic fossae of trunk vertebrae wide and deep, with well developed subcentral ridges; and third cloacal vertebra with anteroposteriorly extended neural spine, amongst others. This record is outside the current geographical range of the species of this genus, indicating warmer environmental conditions at the end of the Ensenadan age in Buenos Aires province. As in other continents, the South American fossil Pleistocene record indicates that Pleistocene extinctions affected mainly (and perhaps only) large reptiles.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBoiruna maculate 0aPleistocene 0aSouth America 0aReptiles 0aExtinction1 aAgnolin, Federico1 aVoglino, Damiáán0 tSouth american journal of herpetology.g2009 Dec., v. 4, no. 3 p.259-267dBrazilian Society of Herpetologyx1808-97987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2994%2F057.004.03093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02235naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002800142245008100170300001400251520097200265592002801237650001301265650001001278650001501288650001501303650001401318650001101332650002301343650001201366651001101378653000901389653001801398653001201416653002901428700002601457700003001483700002901513700002401542700002601566773012201592856007801714852000901792655001201801IND60519646920221116145836.0160507e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051964692DNAL7 a10.2983/035.035.01042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Ricardo L.

The clams were collected at Mangue Seco beach (Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil) and transferred to the laboratory where their gametes were released spontaneously. Trochophore and D larvae were identified in the hatchery from 18 to 24 h afterward. Dlarvae had an average length (L) of 71.9 µm, remaining at this stage until the 5ᵗʰ day, when first umbo veligers appeared (L = 115.9 µm). Pediveliger larvae (L = 183.2 µm) were observed after the 9ᵗʰ day. Within 15 days larvae reached juvenile stage (L = 282.0 µm) with growth lines in the shells. Survival was 58.8%, 20%, 60%, and 100% for D larvae, umbo veligers, pediveligers, and juveniles, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the hatchery rearing for A. brasiliana and serves as a basis for future research and culture of this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aclams 3agerm cells 3ahatcheries 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alarval development 3arearing 3aBrazil 0aclam 0alarval growth 0aveliger 0aAnomalocardia brasiliana1 aLavander, Henrique D.1 aSantos, Leilane B.

Ca²⁺ distributes to form a vertical gradient that peaks at the stratum granulosum. It is thought that the stratum corneum (SC) forms the Ca²⁺ gradient since it is considered the only permeability barrier in the skin. However, the epidermal tight junction (TJ) in the granulosum has recently been suggested to restrict molecular movement to assist the SC as a secondary barrier. The objective of this study was to clarify the contribution of the TJ to Ca²⁺ gradient and epidermal differentiation in reconstructed human epidermis. When the epidermal TJ barrier was disrupted by sodium caprate treatment, Ca²⁺ flux increased and the gradient changed in ion-capture cytochemistry images. Alterations of ultrastructures and proliferation/differentiation markers revealed that both hyperproliferation and precocious differentiation occurred regionally in the epidermis. These results suggest that the TJ plays a crucial role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis by controlling the Ca²⁺ gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acytochemistry 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aions 3akeratinocytes 3apermeability 3asodium 3atight junctions1 aMaeda, Tetsuo1 aOba, Ai1 aYamamoto, Takuya1 aSasaki, Hiroyuki0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Mar. 25, v. 406, no. 4 p.506-511dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.02.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012400171500001900295520111600314592002801430650001401458650001401472650001201486650001501498650001101513650000901524650001501533653000601548653000701554653000701561653000601568653000701574653000901581653000601590653000601596653000701602653000701609653000701616653001001623653001301633653000901646653000901655653000801664653000801672653000801680653001101688653000601699653000801705653000801713653000701721653000701728653000801735653000801743653000801751653000801759653000801767653000801775653000901783653000801792653000901800700002301809700002201832700002101854700002101875700002501896700002201921700002101943700001701964773009101981856008502072852000902157655001202166IND60701000820221123022318.0210201e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070100082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2020.1181832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoloiu, Valentin10an-Butanol and Oleic Acid Methyl Ester, Combustion and NVH Characteristics In Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCombustion, noise and vibrations produced by n-Butanol and Oleic Acid Methyl Ester (MO) in Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI) were investigated. The Cetane Number was determined using a Constant Volume Combustion Chamber (CVCC) for MO100, ULSD, and n-Butanol and found to be 73.8, 47.2, and 16 respectively. In the case of the MO20Bu80 (Methyl Oleate 20% with 80% n-butanol), the maximum Apparent Heat Release Rate was higher compared to ULSD Classical Diesel Combustion (CDC), due to accumulation of fuel in the combustion chamber because of the longer ignition delay and cylinder and charge cooling effect of n-butanol. RCCI with Methyl-Oleate had a vibrations level of as much 4.5 (m/s2) higher than ULSD in CDC up to 2k Hz. The sound level found by the Acoustic Array sound level for MO20Bu80 in combustion was 4 (dB) louder than ULSD in CDC. RCCI was found to have its own acoustic spectrum compared to CDC, and this is because of the wider range and higher sound levels produced by RCCI. The study suggests that MO can be used as a surrogate fuel for full body biodiesel in RCCI combustion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3abiodiesel 3abutanol 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aheat 3aoleic acid 0aN 0aFt 0aβ 0aK 0aFp 0aFitr 0aT 0aZ 0aα 0aβ 0aω 0aMO100 0aMO20Bu80 0aULSD 0aRCCI 0aNVH 0aCPB 0aFFT 0adB (A) 0aP 0aCOV 0aSMD 0aID 0aCD 0aTDC 0aIVC 0aEVC 0aIVO 0aEVO 0aPFI 0aCVCC 0aCDC 0aOSHA1 aKnowles, Aliyah R.1 aCarapia, Cesar E.1 aMoncada, Jose D.1 aWiley, Justin T.1 aKilpatrick, Margaret1 aWilliams, Johnnie1 aRahman, Mosfequr1 aIlie, Marcel0 tEnergy.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 207 p.118183-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2020.1181833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006300149245009300212300001600305500001900321520135200340592002801692650002001720650001501740650002001755650002001775650002601795650001401821650001301835650001101848650001901859650001201878650001201890650002201902651001301924700006301937773014402000856008302144852000902227655001202236IND60694382320221122112414.0200513e20200403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069438232DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.0c002062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaguire, Timothy J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7742-769X10aCitizen Science Data Show Temperature-Driven Declines in Riverine Sentinel Invertebrates  ap. 303-307.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe used the presence and absence data of sentinel invertebrates (stonefly, order Plecoptera) collected by citizen scientists over 17 years to approximate trends in stream health in urban Detroit, Michigan, USA. Citizen science data are commonly collected based on availability of limited funds. Thus, survey locations lack consistent data collection, and missing values are common. While citizen science data sets can be large, on a regional and local scale, they are often undervalued but present an opportunity for managers to inform their decisions if the missing data can be addressed. To overcome this hurdle, here, missing values were modeled with a combination of spatial (inverse distance weighting and spatial stream network), temporal (Bayesian state space), and machine learning (ensemble random forest) models combining atmospheric, hydrologic, and biologic data. Using the estimated missing values, we determined negative population trends in stoneflies driven by stream temperature via a dynamic occupancy model. Urban streams present a challenge to resource managers because data are collected at disparate locations and frequencies and inconsistently recorded. However, we show how a combination of methods with publicly available and citizen science data from across disciplines can inform managers and support land-use decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPlecoptera 3acitizen science 3adata collection 3aenvironmental science 3ahydrology 3aland use 3amodels 3ariparian areas 3astreams 3asurveys 3awater temperature 3aMichigan1 aMundle, Scott O.

We predict that, under normal oceanic conditions, [Formula: see text] is not sensitive to pH indeed but may be significantly influenced (on the order of 12‰) by temperature. Since the isotope ratios found in Li containing calcium carbonate shells show no indications of variation in isotopic composition, we conclude that the mechanism by which Li is incorporated to this material is not dependent on aqueous Li speciation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium carbonate 3aclimate 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3alithium 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apH 3atemperature1 aClaeys, Philippe1 aDe Proft, Frank1 aGeerlings, Paul0 tChemical geology.g2013 Oct. 24, v. 357 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.08.0193Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245021500165300001400380520128500394592002801679650002501707650002801732650001401760650001601774650001101790650001001801650002301811650001801834650001301852650001801865650001301883651001701896651001201913653000901925653002801934653002501962653002101987653001302008653001302021653002502034700002202059700002302081773012202104856007802226852000902304655001202313IND60519647020221116145853.0160507e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051964702DNAL7 a10.2983/035.035.01052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNerlović, Vedrana10aMorphological and Molecular Differences Between the Invasive Bivalve Ruditapes philippinarum (Adams & Reeve, 1850) and the Native Species Ruditapes decussatus (Linnaeus, 1758) from the Northeastern Adriatic Sea  ap. 31-39.  aThe alien bivalve Ruditapes philippinarum (Manila clam) was intentionally introduced along the Italian Coast of the northwestern Adriatic Sea for aquaculture purposes in 1983. In February 2013, R. philippinarum was recorded at a site of the northeastern Adriatic Sea (Zelena Laguna, vicinity of city Poreč, west Istrian Coast, Croatia). This finding represents the first record of R. philippinarum in Croatian waters. The colonized site is located at a distance of approximately 100 km by a straight line in the west east direction from the site where the mollusc was firstly introduced. At Zelena Laguna, R. philippinarum colonized the intertidal sandy substrate together with the native species Ruditapes decussatus. The two sympatric species were initially differentiated based on the morphology of the siphons. Molecular analysis of 16S rRNA gene confirmed the morphological distinction between the two species. Although the two species are very similar in shell morphology, the relationships width/length and width/height were negative allometric for R. decussatus and isometric for R. philippinarum. The relationship height/length was isometric for both species. Additionally, the length of the pallial sinus was significantly different between the two species (P < 0.001).  aPublisher supplied data 3aRuditapes decussatus 3aRuditapes philippinarum 3aallometry 3aaquaculture 3acoasts 3agenes 3aindigenous species 3alittoral zone 3amolluscs 3aribosomal RNA 3asympatry 3aAdriatic Sea 3aCroatia 0aclam 0aRuditapes philippinarum 0aRuditapes decussatus 0ainvasive species 0abiometry 0a16S rDNA 0anorthernAdriatic Sea1 aKorlević, Marino1 aMravinac, Brankica0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2016 Apr., v. 35, no. 1 p.31-39dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.035.01053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03690naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245015600170300001600326520209000342592002802432650001502460650002002475650001202495650001302507650001802520650002102538650001502559650002202574650001402596650001202610650001602622650002702638650001502665650002402680650001402704650001802718650001602736650002202752651001802774653002402792653001602816653002402832653002502856653003102881653002302912700001902935700002002954773007902974856008603053852000903139655001203148IND60539375820221120203545.0160815e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053937582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Liu-Mei10aRare earth elements of a 1000-year paddy soil chronosequence: Implications for sediment provenances, parent material uniformity and pedological changes  ap. 274-279.  aA series of paddy soil profiles with approximately 50, 300, 700 and 1000years of paddy cultivation history and an uncultivated mud beach profile under nearly identical landscape and climate conditions were studied. The signatures of rare earth elements (REEs) were used to identify sediment provenances and parent material uniformity of the studied profiles and to assess long-term paddy management effects on REE mobilization and fractionation. The distribution patterns of samples on a δEuN–ΣREEs plot indicate that the parent materials of paddy soils and the uncultivated soil mainly originate from Yangtze River sediments. The REE chondrite-normalized curve could be used to adequately evaluate parent material uniformity, thus allowing further studies of soil REE changes along a time sequence of paddy cultivation. To understand anthro-pedogenic effects on REE mobilization and fractionation, the REE concentrations of paddy soils were normalized to those of the uncultivated soil. Paddy management resulted in accumulation of all REEs within the upper 100cm, possibly due to anthropogenic inputs such as irrigation water and phosphate fertilizers. In particular, a distinct positive Ce anomaly was observed. This was likely due to periodic reduction and oxidation processes caused by artificial submergence and drainage. These REE signatures are especially marked in the anthrostagnic epipedon (Ap), as compared with the hydragric horizon (Bg). The positive Ce anomaly increased gradually with increasing paddy cultivation age. This demonstrates the utility of Ce anomaly as a trace of the frequency and intensity of redox conditions. The relative enrichment of all REEs and gradual accumulation with paddy cultivation time in the Ap horizons imply low mobility of REEs in the investigated paddy soils. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the effectiveness of various REE proxies as tracers of sediment provenances and parent material uniformity in present paddy soils. It also reveals the effects of long-term paddy management on REE enrichment and positive Ce anomalies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aA horizons 3achronosequences 3aclimate 3adrainage 3afractionation 3airrigation water 3alandscapes 3along term effects 3aoxidation 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3aprovenance 3arare earth elements 3asediments 3asoil profiles 3asubmergence 3atracer techniques 3aYangtze River 0aRare earth elements 0aPaddy soils 0aSoil chronosequence 0aSediment provenances 0aParent material uniformity 0aAnthro-pedogenesis1 aZhang, Gan-Lin1 aJin, Zhang-Dong0 tGeoderma.g2014 Oct., v. 230-231 p.274-279dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2014.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245016000161300001400321520120500335592002801540650001701568650002501585650001501610650001001625650001801635650002101653650002601674650001001700650001201710650001001722650002101732650001301753650001601766651001001782651001101792653001901803653000901822653001001831653002201841653002101863653001201884653002101896653001301917700002401930700002201954700002301976700001901999700002202018700002502040700002002065773012202085856007802207852000902285655001202294IND60519647120221116145903.0160507e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051964712DNAL7 a10.2983/035.035.01062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaisano, Maria10aInfluences of Environmental Variables on Neurotransmission, Oxidative System, and Hypoxia Signaling on Two Clam Species from a Mediterranean Coastal Lagoon  ap. 41-49.  aCapo Peloro Lagoon is a coastal brackish system in northeastern Sicily (Italy), consisting of Ganzirri Lake and Faro Lake. The biological effects related to physicochemical parameters were assessed in two autochthonous clam species, Tapes decussatus and Tapes laeta, chosen for their abundance and economic interest, collected from the two Ganzirri Lake subbasins. Higher temperature and salinity values along with lower dissolved oxygen levels were recorded at the southernmost (site B) relatively to northernmost (site A) subbasin. A battery of biomarkers was investigated in clam gills, including histomorphological endpoint, cholinergic neurotransmission, oxidative stress, and hypoxia biomarkers. Both clam species from site B showed altered gill histomorphology attributable to inflammatory processes. A compromised cholinergic neurotransmission, stimulation of the antioxidant defense system, and onset of hypoxic adaptive responseswere also observed. Overall, data suggest that the environmental variables, as those recorded in the southernmost subbasin ofGanzirri Lake, adversely interfere with the physiological function of the gills, triggering a number of adaptive responses in the clams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3abioactive properties 3abiomarkers 3aclams 3acoastal water 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3agills 3ahypoxia 3alakes 3aoxidative stress 3asalinity 3atemperature 3aItaly 3aSicily 0acoastal lagoon 0aclam 0agills 0aneurotransmission 0aoxidative stress 0ahypoxia 0aTapes decussatus 0aT. laeta1 aNatalotto, Antonino1 aCappello, Tiziana1 aGiannetto, Alessia1 aOliva, Sabrina1 aParrino, Vincenzo1 aSanfilippo, Marilena1 aMauceri, Angela0 tJournal of shellfish research.g2016 Apr., v. 35, no. 1 p.41-49dNational Shellfisheries Associationx0730-80007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2983%2F035.035.01063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300001600309520148500325592002801810650001301838650001201851650001401863650001301877650001501890650002401905650000901929650001601938650001101954651001101965653001301976653003001989653000802019653003002027653001202057653001102069700002102080700001602101773010502117856008102222852000902303655001202312IND60622228220221122010910.0181124e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062222822DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683603hl629rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLie, Øyvind12aA theoretical approach to glacier equilibrium-line altitudes using meteorological data and glacier mass-balance records from southern Norway  ap. 365-372.  aBased on a close exponential relationship between mean ablation-season temperature and winter precipitation at the equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) of 10 Norwegian glaciers, three equations are derived. The first equation enables calculation of the minimum altitude of areas climatically suited for glacier formation, and is termed the altitude of instantaneous glacierization (AIG). Equation (2) is derived based on the ‘principle of terrain adaptation’, enabling quantification of the glacial buildup sensitivity (GBS) in presently non-glaciated areas. The theoretical climatic temperature-precipitation ELA (CTP-ELA) in presently non-glaciated areas is calculated in equation three by combining GBS with terrain altitude. Mass-balance records from four modern glaciers (Ålfotbreen, Nigardsbreen, Storbreen and GrÅsubreen) situated in maritime to continental climate regimes in southern Norway are used to test these equations. Correlation between AIG and net balance measurements (bn) yielded correlation coefficients of r=-0.80 to r=-0.84. Calculated AIGs correspond well with observed ELAs on Ålfotbreen, Nigardsbreen and GrÅsubreen, while it deviates from the observed ELA on Storbreen; the latter is probably due to leeward accumulation of wind-blown snow on this cirque glacier. Based on this approach, regional representative climatic ELAs can be calculated for non-glaciated areas with instrumental records of ablation-season temperature and winter precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aclimate 3aequations 3aglaciers 3alandscapes 3ameteorological data 3asnow 3atemperature 3awinter 3aNorway 0aGlaciers 0aequilibrium-line altitude 0aELA 0amass-balance measurements 0aclimate 0aNorway1 aDahl, Svein Olaf1 aNesje, Atle0 tHolocene.g2003 Apr., v. 13, no. 3 p.365-372dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683603hl629rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02899naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245013600170520166100306592002801967650000801995650002102003650001402024650002502038650001502063650000902078650002002087650001102107650002402118650001502142653002502157653001502182653001902197653003102216700001702247700001402264700001702278773009802295856008702393852000902480655001202489IND60694047120221119182532.0201023e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069404712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRan, Fengming12aA virtual sensor based self-adjusting control for HVAC fast demand response in commercial buildings towards smart grid applications  aThe power grid is facing the critical issue concerning the power imbalance. To address the issue, demand response programs are increasingly deployed to encourage the end-users to change their load profiles. For buildings, the existing fast demand response strategy has been demonstrated effective in performing quick response to the grid request by reducing the power demand. However, the existing fast demand response methods require a physical flowmeter to be installed in each air handling unit. While in most of the existing commercial buildings, flowmeters are rarely installed in individual air handling units due to the high initial cost. As a result, the existing fast demand response method may not be applicable in these commercial buildings. Thus, this paper presents a virtual sensor based self-adjusting control strategy for fast demand response of building heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system. A virtual flowmeter model is first developed to estimate the water flow rate in each air handling unit. Based on the virtual flowmeter model, a self-adjusting water flow supervisor, in which the online self-adjusting method is integrated to reduce efforts in parameter identification, is then developed to achieve a balanced water flow distribution among different air handling units. The performances of the proposed control strategy have been tested and evaluated on a simulated system. The results show that the virtual flowmeter model has good accuracy for estimating the water flow rate in AHUs. The proposed control strategy can achieve significant and quick power reduction and meanwhile address the hydraulic imbalance problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3abuildings 3aelectrical equipment 3aflowmeters 3aheat 3aheating systems 3amodels 3aventilation systems 3awater flow 0aFast demand response 0aSmart grid 0aVirtual sensor 0aBuilding energy management1 aGao, Dian-ce1 aZhang, Xu1 aChen, Shuyue0 tApplied energy.g2020 July 01, v. 269 p.115103-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.1151033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245011700166300001600283500001500299520196200314592002802276650001402304650001502318650002202333650001202355650002302367650001902390650000902409650002402418650001402442650001202456650001602468650001302484653002402497700001802521700002802539773008602567856008502653990002302738852000902761655001202770IND60093614620221119034149.0141103e20131024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009361462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jiao10aModel-based analysis of mixed uranium(VI) reduction by biotic and abiotic pathways during in situ bioremediation  ap. 215-222.  a2019-12-06  aGiven the numerous unknowns and uncertainties in sediment systems, understanding of the mechanisms of U(VI) reduction is still at the stage of improvement. Recent studies have shown that reductive immobilization of U(VI) in the subsurface is not caused by purely biological or purely abiotic reactions but rather a group of interconnected abiotic–biotic pathways (e.g. via mackinawite and biomass). These new findings necessitate an update of the existing mathematical models that make simplifications typically involving a single reducing agent (e.g. indigenous bacteria) for in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater. In this study, a comprehensive model was constructed based on new experimental observations, including mixed U(VI) reduction by chemical and enzymatic reactions. Thermodynamic analysis was done to predict the feasibility of the potential pathways that affect mackinawite formation under field conditions. Model simulations indicate that low concentrations of the reactant species make the reaction of homogeneous Fe(II) oxidation coupled to U(VI) reduction unfavorable in the field. Instead, FeS precipitation is an important Fe(II) sequestration reaction once sulfate metabolism dominates. The subsequent reduction of U(VI) by FeS (mackinawite) contributes to the total U(VI) removal under a variety of U(VI) concentrations encountered at field sites, which is in accordance with experimental observations. The model suggests the potential for both competition and coordination between chemical and biological pathways on the cell surface, providing a possible explanation as to why U(VI) can be efficiently reduced at either low or high sulfate concentration during the process of in situ bioremediation. Further increase in the resolution of the model (e.g. across multiple scales such as genome-, micron- and pore-sale) is necessary for better understanding of the interactions between biotic and abiotic pathways.  aPublisher supplied data 3asediments 3ametabolism 3asimulation models 3auranium 3achemical reduction 3abioremediation 3airon 3aenzymatic reactions 3aoxidation 3abiomass 3agroundwater 3abacteria 0amathematical models1 aScheibe, T.D.1 aMahādevaśarmā, Rā.,0 tChemical geology.g2013 Oct. 24, v. 357 p.215-222dElsevier B.V.x0009-25417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.08.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245013900167300001400306520107300320592002801393650005601421650002701477650002001504650001901524650001601543650003701559650001401596650002401610650001001634650003601644700001601680700001701696700001801713773008201731856008601813852000901899655001201908IND60557019320221118113045.0170711e20161002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055701932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virusres.2016.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhibin10aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) induces IL-12p40 production through JNK-AP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways  ap. 73-81.  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) mainly infects monocyte/macrophage cells and modulates cytokine production to regulate host immune response. IL-12p40 is the basic subunit of IL-12, a heterodimeric cytokine, which plays key roles in the cell-mediated immune response. In the present study, we demonstrated that PRRSV infection induced IL-12p40 production in vitro and in vivo. Subsequently, we showed that inhibitors of p38 MAPK, JNK, and NF-κB dramatically reduced PRRSV-induced IL-12p40 expression. To further characterize the molecular mechanism of IL-12p40 production induced by PRRSV infection, we cloned and analyzed the porcine IL-12p40 promoter, in which AP-1 and NF-κB motifs were found. In addition, both JNK-AP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways were activated by PRRSV infection. Taken together, these data indicate that PRRSV induces IL-12p40 expression through the JNK-AP-1 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Our findings might facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of IL-12 production induced by PRRSV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3acell-mediated immunity 3aimmune response 3ainterleukin-12 3amacrophages 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amonocytes 3asignal transduction 3aswine 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aHuang, Chen1 aZhang, Qiong1 aFeng, Wen-hai0 tVirus research.g2016 Oct. 02, v. 225 p.73-81dElsevier B.V.x0168-17027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2016.09.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005900155245012900214300001600343520152500359592002801884650001601912650002201928650001101950650003701961650001601998650001702014650001902031650001902050650001502069650003302084650002102117650002602138653002402164653002702188653003802215653001902253653002102272700007002293700001702363773009102380856009002471852000902561655001202570IND60637906020221123001741.0190529e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063790602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.04.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDzinun, Hazlini1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8227-516810aPhotocatalytic performance of TiO2/Clinoptilolite: Comparison study in suspension and hybrid photocatalytic membrane reactor  ap. 241-248.  aComparison studies in suspension and hybrid photocatalytic membrane reactor (HPMR) system was investigated by using Reactive Black 5 (RB5) as target pollutant under UVA light irradiation. To achieve this aim, hybrid TiO2/clinoptilolite (TCP) photocatalyst powder was prepared by solid-state dispersion (SSD) methods and embedded at the outer layer of dual layer hollow fiber (DLHF) membranes fabricated via single step co-spinning process. TiO2 and CP photocatalyst were also used as control samples. The samples were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersion of X-ray (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyses. The result shows that TCP was actively functioned as photocatalyst in suspension system and 86% of RB5 photocatalytic degradation achieved within 60 min; however the additional step is required to separate the catalyst with treated water. In the HPMR system, even though the RB5 photocatalytic degradation exhibits lower efficiency however the rejection of RB5 was achieved up to 95% under UV irradiation due to the properties of photocatalytic membranes. The well dispersed of TCP at the outer layer of DLHF membrane have improved the surface affinity of DL-TCP membrane towards water, exhibit the highest pure water flux of 41.72 L/m2.h compared to DL-TiO2 membrane. In general, CP can help on improving photocatalytic activity of TiO2 in suspension, increased the RB5 removal and the permeability of DLHF membrane in HPMR system as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aenergy 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airradiation 3apermeability 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atitanium dioxide 3aultraviolet radiation 0aTiO2/Clinoptilolite 0aSolid state dispersion 0aDual layer hollow fiber membranes 0aPhotocatalytic 0aReactive Black 51 aOthman, Mohd Hafiz Dzarfan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5842-24471 aIsmail, A.F.0 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug., v. 228 p.241-248dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.04.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010800160300001600268520132300284592002801607596005901635596005901694650002101753650001901774650001601793650001601809650001501825650001501840650001701855650001201872650001001884650001601894650001101910650002601921650002501947650001101972650001701983650001602000650001402016650001602030700001902046700001302065700001702078700001402095700001702109773013402126856008202260852000902342655001202351IND60672904420221118113657.0191017e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067290442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-019-01793-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhi10aInfection process and host responses to Elsinoë ampelina, the causal organism of grapevine anthracnose  ap. 571-582.  aGrape anthracnose, caused by Elsinoë ampelina, is an important fungal disease during grape production. Little is known about the interactions of grape-E.ampelina compared with other grapevine fungal diseases. This study used potted seedlings of Vitis vinifera ‘Red Globe’ and E. ampelina to investigate their interactions under greenhouse conditions. The infection process of E. ampelina in the young leaves of grape was observed from 0 to 6 days post-inoculation (dpi) under microscope. Results showed that the first symptom on grape leaves were observed at 3 dpi. The rates of conidial germination on grape leaves were 23.4, 73.2, and 85.6% at 1, 2, and 3 dpi, respectively. Early penetration occurred in the epidermal cells with or without forming appressoria at 2 dpi. E. ampelina enlarged in intercellular spaces at 2–3 dpi and began to enter intracellular spaces from 3 dpi. New conidia were produced in acervuli on the leaf surface from 6 dpi. The ultrastructural observation revealed defense responses in infected host cells, including collapse of cell walls and chloroplasts, changes in the number of mitochondria, plasmolysis, and cell death. Overall, these results provide a detailed understanding of the grape-E.ampelina interaction and theoretical bases for infection pathway of grape anthracnose.  aPublisher supplied data  a31501740cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31572110cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aElsinoe ampelina 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthracnose 3aappressoria 3acell death 3acell walls 3achloroplasts 3aconidia 3afungi 3agermination 3agrapes 3agreenhouse production 3aintercellular spaces 3aleaves 3amitochondria 3aplasmolysis 3aseedlings 3aviticulture1 aZhang, Songlin1 aHan, Rui1 aZhang, Haoyu1 aLi, Kexin1 aWang Xiping,0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2019 Oct., v. 155, no. 2 p.571-582dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-019-01793-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245013600174300001600310520168900326592002802015650001802043650001502061650001502076650001902091650000902110650002402119650002302143650000902166650001502175650001302190650002002203650002302223650002102246650001502267650001102282650001502293650001302308650002402321650001402345650000902359650001402368650001602382650001202398650001602410650001602426650001302442650001302455651001202468700002902480700002202509700002702531700002102558700002102579700002302600700002102623773009902644856008102743852000902824655001202833IND60123822620221118052751.0150406e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012382262DNAL7 a10.1007/s00267-014-0397-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCatano, Christopher P.10aUsing Scenario Planning to Evaluate the Impacts of Climate Change on Wildlife Populations and Communities in the Florida Everglades  ap. 807-823.  aIt is uncertain how climate change will impact hydrologic drivers of wildlife population dynamics in freshwater wetlands of the Florida Everglades, or how to accommodate this uncertainty in restoration decisions. Using projections of climate scenarios for the year 2060, we evaluated how several possible futures could affect wildlife populations (wading birds, fish, alligators, native apple snails, amphibians, threatened and invasive species) across the Everglades landscape and inform planning already underway. We used data collected from prior research and monitoring to parameterize our wildlife population models. Hydrologic data were simulated using a spatially explicit, regional-scale model. Our scenario evaluations show that expected changes in temperature, precipitation, and sea level could significantly alter important ecological functions. All of our wildlife indicators were negatively affected by scenarios with less rainfall and more evapotranspiration. Under such scenarios, habitat suitability was substantially reduced for iconic animals such as wading birds and alligators. Conversely, the increased rainfall scenario benefited aquatic prey productivity and apex predators. Cascading impacts on non-native species is speculative, but increasing temperatures could increase the time between cold events that currently limit expansion and abundance of non-native fishes, amphibians, and reptiles with natural ranges in the tropics. This scenario planning framework underscored the benefits of proceeding with Everglades restoration plans that capture and clean more freshwater with the potential to mitigate rainfall loss and postpone impacts of sea level rise.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmpullariidae 3aalligators 3aamphibians 3aclimate change 3acold 3aecological function 3aevapotranspiration 3afish 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahydrologic data 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3apopulation dynamics 3apredators 3arain 3asea level 3atemperature 3atropics 3auncertainty 3awater birds 3awetlands 3awildlife 3aFlorida1 aRomañach, Stephanie S.,1 aBeerens, James M.1 aPearlstine, Leonard G.1 aBrandt, Laura A.1 aHart, Kristen M.1 aMazzotti, Frank J.1 aTrexler, Joel C.0 tEnvironmental management.g2015 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.807-823dSpringer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-014-0397-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001500176245007100191300001500262520083300277592002801110650001401138650001401152650001201166650001201178700001801190700001701208700001601225700001401241700001601255700001601271700001701287773015001304856006901454856010301523990002301626852000901649655001201658IND60643530720221120130641.0190510e20140529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064353072DNAL7 a10.3791/514972doi7 aPMC42172362pmcid7 a249620132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Kewen10aFabrication and testing of microfluidic optomechanical oscillators  ap. e51497.  aCavity optomechanics experiments that parametrically couple the phonon modes and photon modes have been investigated in various optical systems including microresonators.

An increase in riparian vegetation converts the naturally open‐canopy prairie streams to closed‐canopy systems. The effects of a change in canopy cover on stream metabolism are unknown. 2. Our goal was to determine the effects of canopy cover on prairie stream metabolism during a 4‐year period in Kings Creek, KS, U.S.A. Metabolic rates from forested reaches were compared to rates in naturally open‐canopy reaches and restoration reaches, the latter having closed canopies in 2006 and 2007 and open canopies in 2008 and 2009. Whole‐stream metabolism was estimated using the two‐station diurnal method. Chlorophyll a concentrations and mass of filamentous algae were measured after riparian removal to assess potential differences in algal biomass between reaches with open or closed canopies. 3. Metabolic rates were spatially and temporally variable even though the sites were on very similar streams or adjacent to each other within streams. Before riparian vegetation removal, whole‐stream community respiration (CR) and net ecosystem production were greater with greater canopy cover. In the vegetation removal reaches, gross primary production was slightly greater after removal. 4. Chlorophyll a concentrations were marginally significantly greater in open (naturally open and removal reaches) than in closed canopy and differed significantly between seasons. Filamentous algal biomass was greater in open than in closed‐canopy reaches. 5. Overall, the restoration allowed recovery of some features of open‐canopy prairie streams. Woody expansion apparently increases CR and moves prairie stream metabolism towards a more net heterotrophic state. An increase in canopy cover decreases benthic chlorophyll, decreases dominance of filamentous algae and potentially alters resources available to the stream food web. The results of this study provide insights for land managers and conservationists interested in preserving prairie streams in their native open‐canopy state.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acanopy gaps 3achlorophyll 3aecosystems 3afood webs 3amanagers 3ametabolism 3anet ecosystem production 3aprairies 3aprimary productivity 3astreams1 aDODDS, WALTER K.0 tFreshwater biology.g2012 June, v. 57, no. 6 p.1138-1150dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2012.02778.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01857naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003200145245005800177300001400235506002800249520084200277592002801119506003701147650001401184650001301198650000901211650001601220650002301236651001401259700002301273773014601296856008001442852000901522655001201531IND60774354820221207092558.0170202e199404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077435482DNAL7 a10.20543/mkkp.v9i16.4002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiryodiningrat, Suliestiyah10aPenelitian standard ukuran sepatu anak-anak indonesia  ap. 64-74.  aResource is Open Access  aThis research is aimed at compilation of size standard of Indonesian children shoes, for it is abviously that the available size systems currently, such as English system, American system and French system are not suitable with Indonesian foot sizes.

Cycloxaprid is a potentially promising substitute, but its metabolism in plants is still poorly understood. The study aims to clarify the translocation of cycloxaprid, identify its metabolites, propose possible metabolic pathways and compare differences between enantiomers in oilseed rape via ¹⁴C tracing technology and HPLC–QTOF–MS. The results showed that most cycloxaprid remained in the treated leaves, and only a small amount translocated to the anthers. Seven metabolites were identified, and the possible metabolic pathway was divided into two phases. Phase Ⅰ metabolism included two metabolites obtained via cleavage of the oxa-bridged seven-membered ring. Phase II metabolism was responsible for glucose conjugate formation. The possible metabolic pathways revealed that the proportion of phase I metabolites gradually decreased over time, and the phase II metabolites transformed from monosaccharide and disaccharide conjugates to trisaccharide and tetrasaccharide conjugates. The levels of metabolites were significantly different between the enantiomers. In particular, the main metabolite was M4, which has confirmed biological toxicity. M2 was the only metabolite detected in rapeseed. The results will promote the scientific application of cycloxaprid in agriculture and could have implications for assessing environmental risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3abiochemical pathways 3aecotoxicology 3aenantiomers 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3aneonicotinoid insecticides 3arapeseed 3arisk 3atoxicity 3atrisaccharides 0aNeonicotinoid 0aCycloxaprid 0aEnantiomer 0aTransport 0aDegradation1 aZhang, Subin,1 aShao, Siyao1 aZheng, Ruonan1 aYu, Zhiyang1 aYe, Qingfu0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 426 p.128125-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.1281253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245015500175300001600330520126600346592002801612650001201640650001801652650001501670650001101685650001601696651001101712653001501723653002801738653001701766653004801783653002001831653002101851700001701872700001801889700002401907773010701931856008802038852000902126655001202135IND60582408320221119044451.0190401e20171024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058240832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.08.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopainsky, Birgit10aTransforming food systems at local levels: Using participatory system dynamics in an interactive manner to refine small-scale farmers’ mental models  ap. 101-110.  aFood systems will need to undergo considerable transformation. To be better prepared for and resilient to uncertainty and disturbances in the future, resource users and managers need to further develop knowledge about the food and farming system, with its dominating feedback structures and complexities, and to test robust and integrated system-based solutions. This paper investigates how participatory system dynamics modeling can be adapted to groups at the community level with low or no formal educational background. The paper also analyses the refinement of workshop participants’ mental models as a consequence of a participatory system dynamics intervention. For this purpose, we ran two workshops with small-scale farmers in Zambia. Analysis of workshop data and post-workshop interviews shows that participatory system dynamics is well adaptable to support an audience-specific learning-by-doing approach. The use of pictures, objects and water glasses in combination with the basic aspects of causal loop diagramming makes for a well-balanced toolbox. Participants acquire understanding that is also relevant beyond systems thinking in that it offers a range of practical insights such as a critical evaluation of common food security strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarmers 3afood security 3ainterviews 3amodels 3auncertainty 3aZambia 0aAdaptation 0aMental model refinement 0aFood systems 0aKnowledge management participatory modeling 0aSystem dynamics 0aSystems thinking1 aHager, Gerid1 aHerrera, Hugo1 aNyanga, Progress H.0 tEcological modelling.g2017 Oct. 24, v. 362 p.101-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245012200205300001800327520183500345592002802180596005902208596005902267596005902326596005902385596006202444596007502506596010402581650002902685650002102714650002802735650001402763650002502777650001702802650001802819650001802837650001402855650001602869650001102885650001702896650000702913650001702920650002502937650001702962700001402979700001402993700001203007700001703019700001203036773011203048856008203160852000903242655001203251IND60744630920221120142306.0210716e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074463092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10570-021-03978-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yingying1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3562-089410aConstruction of nanocellulose-based composite hydrogel with a double packing structure as an intelligent drug carrier  ap. 6953-6966.  aIntelligent hydrogels with multifunctions including biocompatibility, good mechanical property, photothermal property, sustained drug delivery ability, and antibacterial property are urgently needed in the biomaterial fields. Herein, mesoporous polydopamine (MPDA) nanoparticles were wrapped by polyethyleneimine-modified cellulose nanocrystals (PCNC) and then physically crosslinked in cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) hydrogel, obtaining a novel MPDA@PCNC/CNFs composite hydrogel with a double packing structure for controlled drug release. Tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) was selected as the drug model and it was loaded on MPDA nanoparticles. PCNC was warped outside surface of MPDA nanoparticle, which was used to prolong drug release time and reinforce the mechanical strength of MPDA@PCNC/CNFs composite hydrogel. Results presented that the mechanical strength of MPDA@PCNC/CNFs composite hydrogel was 3.5 times stronger than that of pure CNFs hydrogel. Burst release was reduced and drug delivery time of MPDA@PCNC/CNFs composite hydrogel was 3 times and 1.25 times longer than that of CNFs hydrogel and polydopamine/CNFs composite hydrogel, respectively. The drug delivery behavior of the MPDA@PCNC/CNFs composite hydrogel could be controlled by near infrared (NIR) light irradiation and acidic pH condition. Korsmeyer-Peppas model could be used to describe the drug delivery kinetics of the MPDA@PCNC/CNFs composite hydrogel. Fick’s diffusion was the main drug delivery mechanism. Moreover, MPDA@PCNC/CNFs composite hydrogel was found to have good biocompatibility. The as-fabricated composite hydrogel with a double encapsulation structure and unique pH and NIR responsiveness can be applied as a promising drug release carrier, and it may also has potential applications in the fields of physical and chemical therapies.  aPublisher supplied data  a32001281cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31700509cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31870568cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21476091cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20JCQNJC00110cNatural Science Foundation of Tianjin City  a2017YFB0307900cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  aZR2019JQ10cShandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholar of China 3aantibacterial properties 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acellulose 3acellulose nanofibers 3acrosslinking 3adrug carriers 3aencapsulation 3ahydrogels 3airradiation 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3apH 3aporous media 3astrength (mechanics) 3atetracycline1 aFan, Qing1 aHuo, Ying1 aLi, Mei1 aLiu, Hongbin1 aLi, Bin0 tCellulose.g2021 July, v. 28, no. 11 p.6953-6966dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871471x0969-02397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-021-03978-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009500164300001600259520091100275650001601186650002101202650001401223650004301237650001301280650004401293650002501337650001601362650001501378650002101393650000801414700001901422700002101441700001801462773015901480856004701639852000901686655001201695IND60520072920221118023808.0160513e20160113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052007292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.5b050882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Kazuki10aInteraction between Tea Polyphenols and Bile Acid Inhibits Micellar Cholesterol Solubility  ap. 204-209.  aThe molecular mechanism by which tea polyphenols decrease the micellar solubility of cholesterol is not completely clear. To clarify this mechanism, this study investigated the interaction between tea polyphenols (catechins and oolongtheanins) and cholesterol micelles. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study was performed on a micellar solution containing taurocholic acid and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was carried out on the precipitate and the supernatant that formed when EGCg was added to a cholesterol–micelle solution. The data indicated a regiospecific interaction of EGCg with taurocholic acid. Therefore, the ability of EGCg to lower the solubility of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterol in micellar solutions can be attributed to their elimination from the micelles due to interaction between taurocholic acids and EGCg. 3acholesterol 3aepigallocatechin 3aflavanols 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apolyphenols 3asolubility 3ataurocholic acid 3atea1 aHirose, Sayumi1 aNagaoka, Satoshi1 aYanase, Emiko0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2016 Jan. 13, v. 64, no. 1 p.204-209dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05088  aDNAL 7aarticle02823naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024001700117024003600134024001200170040001800182100001900200245007900219300001500298506017300313520129100486650001701777650001601794650001201810650002301822650001901845650000901864650002001873650002001893650001701913700002101930700001601951773009501967856011402062856008202176956012502258961000902383852000902392655001202401IND60672275620221214231429.0170307s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067227562DNAL7 a10113/67227562hdl7 a3263252aris7 a10.17830/j.eaj.2015.02.0932doi8 ans11970  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrueger, Elena10aFuzzy Indicator Approach: Development of Impact Factor for Soil Amendments  ap. 93-105.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aSoil amendments have been shown to be useful for improving soil condition, but it is often difficult to make management decisions as to their usefulness. Utilization of Fuzzy Set Theory is a promising method for decision support associated with utilization of soil amendments. In this article a tool based on fuzzy indicator model was developed. The effectiveness of soil amendments in frame of work of this tool can be evaluated by two indicators: Impact Factor Simple (IFS), and Impact Factor Complex (IFC). Using IFS, an estimate of the effectiveness of soil amendments can be determine when only one experimental soil parameter is available. Using IFC, an estimation of soil amendment effectiveness can be calculated based on information about several soil parameters. This methodology was utilized in two case-studies. In the first, evaluation of the effectiveness of using polyacrylamide application as an amendment to reduce subsoil compaction was evaluated. In the second, the evaluation of the organic material “Fluff” as a soil amendment for establishing native prairie grasses was evaluated. In both cases, improved understanding of the effectiveness of the amendments was demonstrated and the decision support associated with utilization of soil amendments was improved. 3acase studies 3afuzzy logic 3agrasses 3aindigenous species 3apolyacrylamide 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3asoil compaction 3asoil quality1 aKurtener, Dmitry1 aTorbert, H.0 tEuropean agrophysical journal.g2015, v. 2, no. 4 p.93-105wJournal:27186x2296-763X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/67227563Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17830/j.eaj.2015.02.0933Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/149%20Krueger%202015%20soil%20amendments%20EAJ.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle04094naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245008900167300001400256520256300270592002802833650002402861650001302885650002302898650001502921650001202936650003102948650001902979650001502998650001403013650001403027650001203041650001603053650001203069650000903081650001303090650001103103650002103114650001803135650001503153650001603168650001003184650001903194650002303213650002103236700001503257700002503272700001703297700001803314773011103332856008803443852000903531655001203540IND4477347420221121064933.0150812e20120228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447734742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2011.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFievez, V.10aMilk odd- and branched-chain fatty acids as biomarkers of rumen function—An update  ap. 51-65.  aThe main odd- and branched-chain fatty acids (OBCFA) in milk of dairy cows are isomers of tridecanoic acid (iso C13:0), tetradecanoic acid (iso C14:0), pentadecanoic acid (C15:0, iso C15:0 and anteiso C15:0), hexadecanoic acid (iso C16:0) and heptadecanoic acid (C17:0, iso C17:0 and anteiso C17:0). OBCFA are suggested to reflect rumen function (e.g. ruminal fermentation pattern, including methane, duodenal flow of microbial protein and acidosis). This relies on their predominant origin, i.e. bacteria leaving the rumen. The OBCFA are synthesized de novo by ruminal bacteria and incorporated in their cell membrane, suggesting a direct relation with bacterial biomass. Their potential as duodenal markers to quantify bacterial protein is strengthened by their constant relation with bacterial N content over a diversity of bacterial groups. From a limited database, evidence was shown of a useful relation of milk OBCFA yield with microbial protein flow from the rumen, but more research is needed to elucidate some discrepancies under diverse dietary regimes. Further, variation in the OBCFA profile of pure strains of ruminal bacteria were reported and are, in the current review, linked with their production of metabolites. From this, it can be assumed that the rumen fermentation pattern is related to the rumen OBCFA profile, which seems consistent for milk OBCFA. The close stoichiometric relation between ruminal VFA and methane further opens perspective for the use of OBCFA profiles in milk to quantify methane emissions. OBCFA consistently contributing to the predictive models, irrespective of the modeling approach are: iso C14:0 and iso C15:0, which positively relate to acetate and methane and negatively to propionate; and C15:0 and C17:0 which show an inverse relationship. Anteiso C15:0 seemed only relevant in the prediction of butyrate proportions. As changes in the ruminal microbial population (e.g. increased dominance of Streptococcus bovis) sometimes initiate a chain of events that eventually might lead to (sub-acute) ruminal acidosis, OBCFA in milk fat are targeted as candidates for the early detection of ruminal acidosis. Increasing C17:0+C17:1 cis-9 and decreasing iso C14:0 concentration show potential as indicators of sub-acute acidosis or were obvious before clinical symptoms of acute acidosis occurred. Collection of more experimental data is currently on-going for the development of more robust models to classify rumen health in continuous probability classes rather than discrete acidotic vs. non-acidotic cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus bovis 3abacteria 3abacterial proteins 3abiomarkers 3abiomass 3abranched chain fatty acids 3acell membranes 3adairy cows 3adatabases 3aemissions 3aisomers 3ametabolites 3amethane 3amilk 3amilk fat 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3apalmitic acid 3aprediction 3aprobability 3arumen 3arumen bacteria 3arumen fermentation 3aruminal acidosis1 aColman, E.1 aCastro-Montoya, J.M.1 aStefanov, I.1 aVlaeminck, B.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 Feb. 28, v. 172, no. 1-2 p.51-65dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2011.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03412naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245007200160300001600232520200400248592002802252650002002280650000802300650003002308650002902338650001902367650001402386650003502400650000902435650001302444650001402457650001302471650001502484650001302499650001602512650002102528650001902549651001002568651001302578651001702591700001802608700002002626700002202646700002402668700002302692773011102715856007102826852000902897655001202906IND60519114820221117015006.0160420e199308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051911482DNAL7 a10.2307/19419152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOllinger, Scott V.12aA Spatial Model of Atmospheric Deposition for the Northeastern U.S.  ap. 459-472.  aSpatial patterns of atmospheric deposition across the northeastern United States were evaluated and summarized in a simple model as a function of elevation and geographic position within the region. For wet deposition, 3—11 yr of annual concentration data for the major ions in precipitation were obtained from the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trend Network (NADP/NTN) for 26 sites within the region. Concentration trends were evaluated by regression of annual mean concentrations against latitude and longitude. For nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium concentrations, a more than twofold linear decrease occurs from western New York and Pennsylvania to eastern Maine. These trends were combined with regional and elevational trends of precipitation amount, obtained from 30—yr records of annual precipitation at >300 weather stations, to provide long—term patterns of wet deposition. Regional trends of dry deposition of N and S compounds were determined using 2—3 yr of particle and gas concentration data collected by the National Dry Deposition Network (NDDN) and several other sources, in combination with estimates of deposition velocities. Contrary to wet deposition trends, the dominant air concentration trends were steep decreases from south to north, creating regional decreases in total deposition (wet + dry) from the southwest to the northeast. This contrast between wet and dry deposition trends suggests that within the northeast the two deposition forms are received in different proportions from different source areas, wet deposited materials primarily from areas to the west and dry deposited materials primarily from urban areas along the southern edge of the region. The equations generated describing spatial patterns of wet and dry deposition within the region were entered into a geographic information system (GIS) containing a digital elevation model (DEM) in order to develop spatially explicit predictions of atmospheric deposition for the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aair 3aatmospheric precipitation 3adigital elevation models 3adry deposition 3aequations 3ageographic information systems 3aions 3alatitude 3alongitude 3anitrates 3aprediction 3asulfates 3aurban areas 3aweather stations 3awet deposition 3aMaine 3aNew York 3aPennsylvania1 aAber, John D.1 aLovett, Gary M.1 aMillham, Sarah E.1 aLathrop, Richard G.1 aEllis, Jennifer M.0 tEcological applications.g1993 Aug., v. 3, no. 3 p.459-472dEcological Society of Americax1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19419153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04083naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245012400213300001500337506007600352520201100428592002802439506003702467650001602504650002502520650002202545650001402567650001802581650001302599650002302612650001002635650001802645650001902663650002002682650001302702650001602715650001402731650001202745650002102757650003402778650001602812650004802828650002102876650002902897650001302926653000802939653000802947653000902955653000902964653000902973653000802982653000902990653000902999653001603008653001103024653001103035653001003046653001903056653000903075700001903084700002203103700002803125773010103153856008603254852000903340655001203349IND60592310420221207121737.0190318e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059231042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.02.0102doi7 aPMC60779772pmcid7 a295247432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSant, Karilyn E.10aNrf2a modulates the embryonic antioxidant response to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in the zebrafish, Danio rerio  ap. 92-102.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe glutathione redox system undergoes precise and dynamic changes during embryonic development, protecting against and mitigating oxidative insults. The antioxidant response is coordinately largely by the transcription factor Nuclear factor erythroid-2 (Nrf2), an endogenous sensor for cellular oxidative stress. We have previously demonstrated that impaired Nrf family signaling disrupts the glutathione redox system in the zebrafish embryo, and that impaired Nrf2 function increases embryonic sensitivity to environmental toxicants. Here, we investigated the persistent environmental toxicant and reported pro-oxidant perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and its impact on the embryonic glutathione-mediated redox environment. We further examined whether impaired Nrf2a function exacerbates PFOS-induced oxidative stress and embryotoxicity in the zebrafish, and the potential for Nrf2-PPAR crosstalk in the embryonic adaptive response. Wild-type and nrf2afh318−/− mutant embryos were exposed daily to 0 (0.01% v/v DMSO), 16, 32, or 64 μM PFOS beginning at 3 h post fertilization (hpf). Embryonic glutathione and cysteine redox environments were examined at 72 hpf. Gross embryonic toxicity, antioxidant gene expression, and apoptosis were examined at 96 hpf. Mortality, pericardial edema, and yolk sac utilization were increased in wild-type embryos exposed to PFOS. Embryonic glutathione and cysteine redox couples and gene expression of Nrf2 pathway targets were modulated by both exposure and genotype. Apoptosis was increased in PFOS-exposed wild-type embryos, though not in nrf2a mutants. In silico examination of putative transcription factor binding site suggested potential crosstalk between Nrf2 and PPAR signaling, since expression of PPARs and gene targets was modulated by both PFOS exposure and Nrf2a genotype. Overall, this work demonstrates that nrf2a modulates the embryonic response to PFOS, and that PPAR signaling may play a role in the embryonic adaptive response to PFOS.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant genes 3aapoptosis 3abinding sites 3acysteine 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aedema 3aembryogenesis 3aembryotoxicity 3agene expression 3agenotype 3aglutathione 3amortality 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3apericardium 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptors 3atoxic substances 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayolk sac 0aROS 0aGSH 0aGSSG 0aPFOS 0aDMSO 0aARE 0aPPAR 0aPPRE 0aGlutathione 0aNfe2l2 0aEmbryo 0aRedox 0aPerfluorinated 0aPFAS1 aSinno, Paul P.1 aJacobs, Haydee M.1 aTimme-Laragy, Alicia R.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2018 May, v. 198 p.92-102dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03134naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245009800205300001800303506007600321520138200397592002801779596007901807506003701886650002001923650001401943650002101957650002001978650002101998650000902019650001902028650001102047650001302058650001802071650001902089650000902108650001502117650001002132650002402142650001702166650001302183650001602196650002102212700001302233700001902246700001402265700002002279700001802299700001702317773013202334856008102466852000902547655001202556IND60603983220221207142857.0180716e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060398322DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-018-3243-62doi7 aPMC60460022pmcid7 a300654262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Liyou10aEffects of heat pretreatment of wet-milled corn germ on the physicochemical properties of oil  ap. 3154-3162.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCorn germ oil is removed from the milled germ using a conditioning (heating) process, followed by mechanical expelling and/or hexane extraction. In this study, the effect of pretreatment by oven roasting (OR) and microwave (MW) radiation on wet-milled corn germ was investigated. Three OR temperatures (125, 150, and 175 °C) were used with 60 min exposure, and MW pretreatments were established by combining two powers (440 and 800 W) and three pretreatment times (4, 6, and 8 min). The levels of red value, 1,3-diacylglycerol, total diacylglycerol, free fatty acid, and oleic acid increased substantially, while those of triacylglycerol (TAG), linoleic, and linolenic acid decreased significantly following OR. There were no significant differences in TAG compositions following OR and MW treatments. Both heat pretreatments significantly increased the total tocopherol content. δ-Tocopherol showed minimal changes, while β-tocopherol progressively increased after the heat treatments. No significant differences in phytosterols levels were observed among most samples. The MW radiation Proper roasting temperatures or MW radiation times could enrich the content of individual tocopherols and phytosterols, and improve the oxidative stability of oil. The MW radiation tends to be more applicable and sustainable for oil industry to improve the quality of corn germ oil.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0401405cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeta-tocopherol 3acorn germ 3adelta-tocopherol 3adiacylglycerols 3afree fatty acids 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahexane 3aindustry 3alinoleic acid 3alinolenic acid 3aoils 3aoleic acid 3aovens 3aoxidative stability 3aphytosterols 3aroasting 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols1 aJin, Jun1 aHuang, Jianhua1 aWang, Yue1 aKorma, Sameh A.1 aWang, Xingguo1 aJin, Qingzhe0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.3154-3162dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-018-3243-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245014700160520180600307592002802113650001902141650002102160650001702181650001502198650001802213650001002231650001302241650001102254650001302265650001402278650001402292700001802306700001702324700001602341700001702357700002102374700001802395773011902413856007802532852000902610655001202619IND60768358020221123013337.0220225e20220124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076835802DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130202102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Me-Sun 10aMarker-Assisted Backcrossing (MABc) to Improve Eating Quality with Thin Seed Coat and Aleurone Layer of Non-Glutinous Japonica Variety in Rice  aBrown rice is composed of rice bran, pericarp, seed coat, and aleurone layers, and the rice bran layer contains a large number of substances useful for the human body, such as dietary fiber, α-tocopherol, α-tocotrienol, and vitamins. However, more than 90% of these substances are removed when polished, and white rice has the disadvantage of losing food-related ingredients, such as umami-related amino acids, when compared to the unpolished group. In this study, we tried to develop new breeding lines with a thinner seed coat and aleurone layer to provide high eating quality with softer chewing characteristics and processability in rice grain. We detected an SNP for foreground selection for the backcross population by comparing genome sequences between Samgwang and Seolgaeng and developed high eating quality brown rice breeding lines by applying marker-assisted backcrossing (MABC) breeding programs to backcross populations between Samgwang and Seolgaeng using KASP markers. SNP markers for foreground selection were identified to improve eating and processability through SNP mapping of Samgwang and Seolgaeng with SSIIa as a target gene in this study. Line selection according to genotype of KASP markers was successful in BC₁F₁ and BC₂F₁ generations, with the recurrent parent genome recovery ratio ranging from 91.22% to 98.65%. In BC₂F₁ seeds of the selected lines, thickness of the aleurone layer was found to range from 13.82 to 21.67 μm, which is much thinner than the 30.91 μm of the wild type, suggesting that selection by MABc could be used as an additional breeding material for the development of highly processed rice varieties. These lines will be useful to develop new brown rice varieties with softer chewing characteristics and processability in rice grain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaleurone layer 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abackcrossing 3abrown rice 3adietary fiber 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahumans 3apericarp 3arice bran 3aseed coat1 aYu, Ju-Kyung 1 aKo, Seo-Rin 1 aKim, Ki-Jo 1 aJi, Hyeonso 1 aKang, Kwon-Kyoo 1 aCho, Yong-Gu 0 tGenes.g2022 Jan. 24, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130202103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014300165500002200308520170200330592002802032650001202060650002602072650000902098650002902107650002002136650001602156650001202172650002302184650001102207650001002218650001002228650000902238650001702247650001202264650001302276650002102289650001602310653001402326653002102340653002302361653003602384653001502420653001002435653000802445653000902453653001002462653000702472653000702479653000802486653000802494653000802502653000802510653000802518653000702526653000702533653000702540653000902547653000802556653000702564653000802571700001302579700001802592700001302610700001602623773009702639856008202736852000902818655001202827IND60564348820221120202519.0170712s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056434882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zixuan10aExenatide improves liver mitochondrial dysfunction and insulin resistance by reducing oxidative stress in high fat diet-induced obese mice  aPre-press version  aOxidative stress is associated with obesity and may be accompanied by liver insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction. Decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymatic activities and decreased insulin metabolic signaling may promote these maladaptive changes. In this context, exenatide has been reported to reduce hepatic lipid deposition, improve insulin sensitivity and improve mitochondrial dysfunction. We hypothesized that exenatide would attenuate mitochondrial dysfunction by reducing hepatic lipid deposition, blunting oxidant stress and promoting insulin metabolic signaling in a high fat diet-induced model of obesity and insulin resistance. Sixteen-week-old male C57BL/6 diet-induced obese (DIO) mices and age-matched standard diet (STD) mices were treated with exenatide (10 μg/kg twice a day) for 28 days. Compared with untreated STD mice, untreated DIO mice exhibited deposited excessive lipid in liver and produced the oxidative stress in conjunction with insulin resistance, abnormal hepatic cells and mitochondrial histoarchitecture, mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced organism metabolism. Exenatide reduced hepatic steatosis, decreased oxidative stress, and improved insulin resistance in DIO mice, in concert with improvements in the insulin metabolic signaling, mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymatic activation, adenine nucleotide production, organism metabolism and weight gain. Results support the hypothesis that exenatide reduces hepatic cells and mitochondrial structural anomaly and improves insulin resistance in concert with improvements in insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function activation, concomitantly with reductions in oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenine 3aanimal disease models 3adiet 3aelectron transport chain 3aenzyme activity 3afatty liver 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipids 3aliver 3amales 3amice 3amitochondria 3aobesity 3aoxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aweight gain 0aExenatide 0aOxidative stress 0aInsulin resistance 0aLiver mitochondrial dysfunction 0aObese mice 0aNAFLD 0aGLP 0aOGTT 0aIPITT 0aTC 0aTG 0aLDL 0aHDL 0aAST 0aALT 0aGA% 0aRC 0aCS 0aEC 0aVCO2 0aVO2 0aRQ 0aBMR1 aHou, Lin1 aHuang, Lanhui1 aGuo, Jun1 aZhou, Xinli0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017, dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245011300211300001400324520182400338592002802162650002402190650002602214650001402240650001502254650002302269650001702292650002102309650002202330650000902352650001002361650001902371650001302390650003202403650001502435650001502450650001502465653003302480653002202513653004002535653001002575653001502585653000902600653001502609700002002624700001702644700002102661700002302682700001902705773010002724856008602824852000902910655001202919IND60592310620221120073102.0190318e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059231062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.02.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeijer, Kristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1498-789210aAzoles additively inhibit cytochrome P450 1 (EROD) and 19 (aromatase) in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 73-81.  aAntifungal azoles are widely used in medicine, agriculture, and material protection and several antifungal azoles have been found in environmental samples. Although these compounds were designed to inhibit fungal enzymes such as lanosterol-14-demethylase (cytochrome P450 (CYP) 51), it is well established that the inhibitory actions of azoles are not specific for fungal CYP isozymes.We refined a gill filament assay to determine the inhibition of CYP1, measured as reduced 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity, in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) gill tissue ex vivo. The advantage of this method is that both induction and inhibition of EROD are performed ex vivo. Among thirteen azoles studied, the five that caused the strongest inhibition of gill EROD activity at a concentration of 5 μM were selected for concentration–response assessment. These compounds (bifonazole, clotrimazole, imazalil, miconazole, and prochloraz) showed IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 μM. CYP19 (aromatase) inhibition was measured using microsomes from rainbow trout brains. Concentration-response curves for CYP19 inhibition were determined for letrozole, bifonazole, clotrimazole, imazalil, miconazole and prochloraz, which gave IC50 values ranging from 0.02 to 3.3 μM. It was further found that mixtures of the five most potent azoles reduced both CYP1 and 19 catalytic activity in an additive fashion (IC50 = 0.7 μM and 0.6 μM, in the respective assay). Bifonazole (IC50 = 0.1 μM) is not previously known to inhibit CYP1 activity.The additive inhibition of CYP1 and CYP19 catalytic activity is an important finding of the present study. We conclude that this additive action of azoles could mediate adverse impacts on CYP regulated physiological functions in environmentally exposed fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aantifungal properties 3aaromatase 3abifonazole 3acatalytic activity 3aclotrimazole 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzyme inhibition 3afish 3afungi 3agene induction 3aimazalil 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amiconazole 3amicrosomes 3aprochloraz 0aCytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme 0aAromatase (CYP19) 0aEthoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) 0aAzole 0aInhibition 0aFish 0aAdditivity1 aJonsson, Maria,1 aShaik, Siraz1 aBehrens, Daphné1 aBrunström, Björn1 aBrandt, Ingvar0 tAquatic toxicology.g2018 May, v. 198 p.73-81dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33163x0166-445X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2018.02.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02109naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245009100166300001600257520098600273592002801259650002601287650000901313650001301322650002501335650001901360650002001379650001601399650001001415650002301425700001701448700001901465700001601484700001101500700001601511773010201527856008501629852000901714655001201723IND4446305520221117062858.0141111e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444630552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.10.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Shilei10aVariations in essential oil yield and composition during Cinnamomum cassia bark growth  ap. 248-252.  aTo extract essential oil for industrial use, the yields and compositions of bark oil during Cinnamomum cassia growth (1–3 years old for the branch bark; 5–12 years old for the stem bark) were determined. The branch bark fraction had a higher essential oil yield than the whole branch. The essential oil yield from branch bark varied within 2.70–3.11% (w/w), while that from stem bark was 0.41–2.61% (w/w) due to differences in age and segment (top, center and lower) of the tree. There were 41 volatile compounds identified in bark oil, among which the majority presented high fluctuations in percentage of composition both in different growth stages and segments. Variations in oil yields did not present the same pattern as the percentages of trans-cinnamaldehyde. The results suggest that choosing bark according to trees’ growth stages and separating stem barks into top, center and lower sections within a tree should significantly improve the extraction efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinnamomum aromaticum 3abark 3abranches 3adevelopmental stages 3aessential oils 3aindustrial oils 3atree growth 3atrees 3avolatile compounds1 aCui, Zhaoxue1 aHuang, Xinchao1 aChen, Yufen1 aXu, Di1 aXiong, Ping0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2011 Jan., v. 33, no. 1 p.248-252dElsevier B.V.x0926-66907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2010.10.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245006800159300001600227520092800243592002801171650001201199650001101211650001401222650001101236700002001247700001901267700001601286700001801302700002001320700001901340700001901359700001301378773009901391856004801490852000901538655001201547IND50072101420221116154033.0140121e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007210142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-013-0006-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Yan10aDirect Urca processes involving hyperons in neutron star matter  ap. 273-278.  aThe presence of the isovector scalar interaction in neutron star matter is considered by exchanging δ meson; we study the effects of δ mesons on the direct Urca processes involving hyperons. The calculation is based on the framework of the relativistic mean field theory. By our analysis, the hyperon direct Urca processes under beta equilibrium are open at lower densities due to δ mesons, which create a larger energy gap between two baryons in the reactions. The δ meson leads to an obvious enhancement of the neutrino emissivity for the hyperon direct Urca processes. In particular, the relativistic neutrino emissivity is found to be substantially larger than predicted in the non-relativistic approach whether δ mesons appear in an neutron star or not. In our results, δ mesons not only change the baryons properties, but also result in more rapid cooling rate of neutron stars by hyperon direct Urca processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling 3aenergy 3aequations 3amodels1 aLiu, Guang-Zhou1 aLiu, Cheng-Zhi1 aFan, Cun-Bo1 aHan, Xing-Wei1 aZhang, Xiao-Jun1 aWang, Hong-Yan1 aZhu, Ming-Feng1 aMeng, Yu0 tChinese science bulletin.g2014 Jan., v. 59, no. 3 p.273-278dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-013-0006-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010900166300001600275520101600291592002801307650001401335650001201349650001101361650002501372650001101397650001401408650001301422650001101435650001501446650001101461650001301472650001101485650002401496650001601520650001301536773009001549856004801639852000901687655001201696IND50062239320221121055810.0130420e201302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006223932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-012-2150-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, Tsutomu10aRespiration and ammonia excretion of euphausiid crustaceans: synthesis toward a global-bathymetric model  ap. 251-262.  aRespiration and ammonia excretion rates of 19–24 euphausiids from the epipelagic through bathypelagic zones of the world’s oceans were compiled. Body mass (expressed in terms of dry mass, carbon or nitrogen), habitat temperature and sampling depth were designated as parameters in multiple regression analysis. Results suggested that the three parameters were highly significant, contributing 71–89 % of the variance in respiration rates and 69–81 % of the variance in ammonia excretion rates. Atomic O:N ratios derived from simultaneous measurements of respiration and ammonia excretion rates ranged from 11 to 90 (median: 27), and no appreciable effects of the three parameters on O:N ratios were detected. If global-bathymetric models for the metabolism and chemical composition of copepods and chaetognaths are compared with those of euphausiids, it becomes evident that euphausiids are unique in that they maintain high metabolic rates and accumulate moderate amounts of energy reserves (lipids).  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aammonia 3acarbon 3achemical composition 3aenergy 3aexcretion 3ahabitats 3alipids 3ametabolism 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aoceans 3aregression analysis 3atemperature 3avariance0 tMarine biology.g2013 Feb., v. 160, no. 2 p.251-262dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-012-2150-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245015000162300002000312520159000332592002801922650001601950650000901966650001201975650002001987650002102007700002402028773010102052856007502153852000902228655001202237IND60576889520221119181926.0170806e20131217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057688952DNAL7 a10.1021/la402527r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChakrabarti, Aditi10aSurface Folding-Induced Attraction and Motion of Particles in a Soft Elastic Gel: Cooperative Effects of Surface Tension, Elasticity, and Gravity  ap. 15543-15550.  aWe report some experimental observations regarding a new type of long-range interaction between rigid particles that prevails when they are suspended in an ultrasoft elastic gel. A denser particle submerges itself to a considerable depth inside the gel and becomes elasto-buoyant by balancing its weight against the elastic force exerted by the surrounding medium. By virtue of a large elasto-capillary length, the surface of the gel wraps around the particle and closes to create a line singularity connecting the particle to the free surface of the gel. A substantial amount of tensile strain is thus developed in the gel network parallel to the free surface that penetrates to a significant depth inside the gel. The field of this tensile strain is rather long-range because of a large gravito-elastic correlation length and sufficiently strong to pull two submerged particles into contact. The particles move toward each other with an effective force following an inverse linear distance law. When more monomers or dimers of the particles are released inside the gel, they orient rather freely inside the capsules where they are located and attract each other to form closely packed clusters. Eventually, these clusters themselves interact and coalesce. This is an emergent phenomenon in which gravity, capillarity, and elasticity work in tandem to create a long-range interaction. We also present the results of a related experiment, in which a particle suspended inside a thickness-graded gel moves accompanied by the continuous folding and the relaxation of the gel’s surface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillarity 3agels 3agravity 3asurface tension 3atensile strength1 aChaudhury, Manoj K.0 tLangmuir.g2013 Dec. 17, v. 29, no. 50 p.15543-15550dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla402527r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245012500165300001600290520093800306592002801244650001701272650001201289650002201301650002701323650000901350650002701359650001401386650003001400700003001430700001801460700001601478700002101494700002201515700002101537773010601558856004801664852000901712655001201721IND4474933020221119232137.0121003e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447493302DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-012-9634-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKleven, Oddmund10aIdentification and evaluation of novel di- and tetranucleotide microsatellite markers from the brown bear (Ursus arctos)  ap. 737-741.  aWe here describe 34 novel microsatellite loci from the brown bear (Ursus arctos) identified using a next-generation sequencing approach.

Previous publications reported that SNMP1 is expressed on the dendrite membrane of pheromone‐sensitive neurons in Heliothis virescens and is an essential cofactor for pheromone detection in Drosophila. In this study, we cloned two SNMP genes (GenBank accession nos. JX469106 and JX469107) from the antenna of the beet armyworm moth Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Hübner). These SNMP genes are classified into two highly conserved subclades, indicating their importance in physiological activity of lepidopteran insects. SexiSNMP1 is antenna‐specific in male and female adults, while SexiSNMP2 is antenna‐abundant but also expressed in other chemosensory tissues, particularly proboscises and maxillary palps of adults both sexes. In situ hybridization revealed that both SNMPs are broadly expressed in long and short trichoid and basiconic sensilla. We infer that SNMP1 and SNMP2 act in the detection of the sex pheromone and general odorants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aadults 3agenes 3ain situ hybridization 3amembrane proteins 3amoths 3aodor compounds 3apalps 3asensilla 3asensory neurons 3asex pheromones 2aAnimals 2aArthropod Antennaexmetabolism 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aGenes, Insect 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aInsect Proteinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpodopteraxgenetics1 aZhang, Jin1 aLiu, Yang1 aWang, Guirong1 aDong, Shuanglin0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2014 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.114-126dWiley-Liss, Incx0739-44627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.21150  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008400163300001600247520175600263592002802019650001002047650002902057650001402086650001102100650001902111650001602130650002402146650001202170650001202182650002202194700001802216773012902234856008102363852000902444655001202453IND60081668220221120075809.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008166822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-013-9451-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMisra, A.K.10aModeling the impact of mitigation options on methane abatement from rice fields  ap. 927-945.  aThe enhanced concentration of methane (CH₄) in the atmosphere is significantly responsible for the ominous threat of global warming. Rice (Oryza) paddies are one of the largest anthropogenic sources of atmospheric CH₄. Abatement strategies for mitigating CH₄ emissions from rice fields offer an avenue to reduce the global atmospheric burden of methane and hence the associated menace of climate change. Projections on population growth suggest that world rice production must increase to meet the population’s food energy demand. In this scenario, those mitigation options are advocated which address both the objectives of methane mitigation and increased production of rice simultaneously. In this paper, we have formulated a nonlinear mathematical model to investigate the effectiveness and limitations of such options in reducing and stabilizing the atmospheric concentration of CH₄ while increasing rice yield. In modeling process, it is assumed that implementation rate of mitigation options is proportional to the enhanced concentration of atmospheric CH₄ due to rice fields. Model analysis reveals that implementation of mitigation options not always provides “win-win” outcome. Conditions under which these options reduce and stabilize CH₄ emission from rice fields have been derived. These conditions are useful in devising strategies for effective abatement of CH₄ emission from rice fields along with sustainable increase in rice yield. The analysis also shows that CH₄ abatement highly depends on efficiencies of mitigation options to mitigate CH₄ emission and improve rice production as well as on the implementation rate of mitigation options. Numerical simulation is carried out to verify theoretical findings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza 3aanthropogenic activities 3aemissions 3aenergy 3aglobal warming 3agrain yield 3amathematical models 3amethane 3apaddies 3apopulation growth1 aVerma, Maitri0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2014 Oct., v. 19, no. 7 p.927-945dSpringer-Verlagx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-013-9451-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02910naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245009300159300001600252520179300268592002802061650001102089650001702100650000902117650001202126650002402138650001702162650002902179650000902208650001402217650000902231650001102240650001602251651000902267700001902276700002202295773011502317856007102432852000902503655001202512IND60519115320221117015241.0160420e199311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051911532DNAL7 a10.2307/19421032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Richard E.10aStochastic Simulation for Characterizing Ecological Spatial Patterns and Appraising Risk  ap. 719-735.  aThe theory and a case study are presented for a class of techniques known as stochastic simulation. Stochastic simulations can characterize the certainty of estimates of spatially and/or temporally correlated ecological variables. Rather than merely providing a unique estimate, a conditional probability distribution is built for the unsampled location. This distribution provides the researcher with any summary statistic or confidence limit desired. Moreover, the techniques are flexible enough to incorporate expected economic losses into the analysis. A simple analogy of a jigsaw puzzle is used first to introduce key concepts. Then, the mathematical highlights of two leading stochastic simulation procedures are presented. Finally, one simulation method, known as sequential Gaussian conditional simulation, is used to generate multiple, equally probable images of adult corn rootworm densities over a large (225 x 150 km) area in northwestern Iowa during the summer of 1989. The results show the simulated density of rootworms to be influenced strongly by the choice of summary statistic and density threshold. Economic risk is appraised from the point of view of the farmer by incorporating the expected economic losses due to the use of a soil insecticide. Since the cost to the farmer of not using an insecticide when in fact it is needed is over three times greater than the cost of using one when it is not needed, the area identified as potentially requiring treatment is much larger than when a summary statistic like the mean or median is used. Stochastic simulation allows the environmental researcher, policy‐maker, or manager the opportunity to characterize uncertainty and economic or other losses, and to determine areas requiring treatment and additional samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acase studies 3acorn 3afarmers 3afinancial economics 3ainsecticides 3aprobability distribution 3arisk 3arootworms 3asoil 3asummer 3auncertainty 3aIowa1 aBorth, Paul W.1 aTollefson, Jon J.0 tEcological applications.g1993 Nov., v. 3, no. 4 p.719-735dThe Ecological Society of Americax1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19421033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245023100178300001600409500001400425520052800439592002800967650001500995650001601010650002101026650001601047651001201063651001401075653002501089653002401114653001201138653001801150653002501168653001601193653001301209700002201222773009501244856008201339852000901421655001201430IND60699099020221120050617.0210116e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069909902DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.770.242812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanta-Rita, Jose V.

Our investigations suggest that the EM of white truffles (e.g., Tuber rapaeodorum, Tuber puberulum, Tuber rufum) are common and abundant members of the forest communities in the area. The ITS sequences of 14 EM specimens and 46 additional fruitbody sequences from the GenBank were clustered into four main groups in phylogenetic analyses. In the ITS-1 region, a characteristic indel pattern was found, which supports the clades. Although our analyses indicate definite genetic distance between the groups of the phylogenetic tree, these clades do not correspond to the traditional taxons identified by fruitbody characteristics. Comparison of the ectomycorrhizae shows that neither is mycorrhizal anatomy a good tool to separate the groups, because the characters (like the epidermoid or angular mantle structure, cell wall thickness, the sape and size of cystidia) are too variable and overlap between the clades. The interspecific similarity, observed both in ectomycorrhizal and fruitbody characters, strengthen the sensu lato morpho-species concept of this group. Our study, which combines comprehensive molecular and anatomical approach to characterize and identify ectomycorrhizae of white truffles from natural samples, stress out the need of the taxonomical revision of this group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus 3aPopulus 3aQuercus 3acell walls 3adeciduous forests 3aectomycorrhizae 3aforest communities 3agenetic distance 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aphylogeny 3atruffles 2aBasidiomycotaxcytologyxgenetics. 2aMycorrhizaexcytologyxgenetics. 2aPhylogeny 2aPopulusxmicrobiology1 aJakucs, Erzsébet,0 tMycorrhiza.g2006 Nov., v. 16, no. 8 p.567-574dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl58547x0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-006-0071-83Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02689naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169500001400304520122500318592002801543650001301571650001001584650001601594650001201610650002501622650002201647650001101669650001801680653003201698653003901730653003101769653001901800700001901819700001701838700001801855700001901873700001701892700001501909700001701924700001701941700002101958700002001979773011301999856008602112852000902198655001202207IND60716262720221118144306.0210201e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071626272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Chengshan10aExperimental study on thermal runaway propagation of lithium-ion battery modules with different parallel-series hybrid connections  aNAL-light  aThermal runaway (TR) propagation significantly affects the safety of lithium-ion battery systems. In this study, the TR propagation behaviours in modules with different electrical connections were investigated. In detail, three different kind of modules were studied: 12 cells having no electrical connections, four cells in parallel and three in series, as well as three cells in parallel and four in series. Considering the maximum temperature and propagation time, the parallel-series connection types of the battery module appeared to have no significant influence on the TR propagation behaviour. An equivalent circuit model was built to calculate the transfer of electricity from the adjacent cells to the runaway cell. According to calculations, the transferred electricity led to a temperature increase of approximately 28.2 °C in the most severe condition. By integrating thermocouples inside the cells, the internal temperatures of the cells in the modules during TR propagation were measured and compared. The internal temperature was 160 °C higher (on average) than that on the cell surface. The significance of the temperature differences requires attention for the further modelling of TR propagation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior 3acells 3aelectricity 3ahybrids 3ainternal temperature 3alithium batteries 3amodels 3athermocouples 0aThermal runaway propagation 0aParallel-series hybrid connections 0aLithium-ion battery module 0aBattery safety1 aZhang, Fangshu1 aFeng, Xuning1 aJiang, Fachao1 aRen, Dongsheng1 aLu, Languang1 aYang, Yang1 aLiu, Guanwei1 aHan, Xuebing1 aFriess, Benedikt1 aOuyang, Minggao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 284 p.124749-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02905naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245006300175300001800238520147300256592002801729650001301757650001301770650001601783650001401799650001401813650001201827650003201839650002301871650001501894650002601909650004301935650001701978650003201995650001602027700003002043700002602073700002402099700002102123700003002144700003002174773011702204856008202321990002302403852000902426655001202435IND60091245520221119233658.0141103e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009124552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Flávia M.C.10aStructure-based identification of novel PPAR gamma ligands  ap. 5795-5802.  aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a nuclear receptor with an important role in the glucose metabolism and a target for type 2 diabetes mellitus therapy. The recent findings relating the use of the receptor full agonist rosiglitazone and the incidence of myocardial infarction raised concerns regarding whether receptor activation can actually be useful for diabetes management. The discovery of MRL-24 and GQ-16, ligands that can partially activate PPARγ and prevent weight gain and fluid retention, showed that a submaximal receptor activation can be a goal in the development of new ligands for PPARγ. Additionally, two previously described receptor antagonists, SR-202 and BADGE, were also shown to improve insulin sensitivity and decrease TNF-α level, revealing that receptor antagonism may also be an approach to pursue. Here, we used a structure-based approach to screen the subset ‘Drugs-Now’ of ZINC database. Fifteen ligands were selected after visual inspection and tested for their ability to bind to PPARγ. A benzoimidazol acetate, a bromobenzyl-thio-tetrazol benzoate and a [[2-[(1,3-dioxoinden-2-ylidene)methyl]phenoxy]methyl]benzoate were identified as PPARγ ligands, with IC₅₀ values smaller than 10μM. Molecular dynamic simulations showed that the residues H323, H449, Y327, Y473, K367 and S289 are key structural elements for the molecular recognition of these ligands and the polar arm of PPARγ binding pocket.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3achemistry 3adatabases 3aglucose 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsulin resistance 3ametabolism 3amyocardial infarction 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweight gain1 ados Santos, Jademilson C.1 aCampos, Jéssica L.O.1 aMafud, Ana Carolina1 aPolikarpov, Igor1 aFigueira, Ana Carolina M.1 aNascimento, Alessandro S.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 23, no. 21 p.5795-5802dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.09.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01871naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245015100171300001800322520074800340592002801088650002201116650004401138650002101182650000701203650001701210650001201227700002001239700002301259700002001282773011701302856008201419990002301501852000901524655001201533IND60091245620221119233820.0141103e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009124562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.08.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSochacka, Elzbieta10aDesulfuration of 2-thiouridine with hydrogen peroxide in the physiological pH range 6.6–7.6 is pH-dependent and results in two distinct products  ap. 5803-5805.  aThe 2-thiomodified nucleosides, located at first position of tRNAs anticodon, may constitute a primary target for oxidative attack under conditions of oxidative stress.

The partitioning of rainfall into infiltration and runoff is relevant to understand runoff generation, infiltration and soil erosion. Tillage manages soil surface properties and generates soil surface roughness (SSR) that affects the partitioning of the rainfall. The objective of this study was to quantify the amount of rainwater that infiltrates, is temporarily stored in surface depressions and flows out of the surfaces during rainfall events. A set of tillage-induced rough surfaces with slope steepness of 10° and 15° was used under simulated rainfall, and a smooth surface served as a control. Rainfall intensities were 60 and 120 mm h−1, and two soil erosion periods, overland flow erosion period (OFEP) and rill flow erosion period (RFEP), were monitored for each rainfall intensity. The results showed that for OFEP, infiltration water was 58% and 76% of the total rainwater on the rough surfaces and was approximately 1.5 and 2 times greater than that on the smooth surfaces for the different rainfall intensities. The surface runoff was consistently small for the OFEP but significantly increased for the RFEP. For example, for the RFEP, the amount of surface runoff was up to 78.66% of the total rainwater on the rough surfaces under rainfall of 120 mm h−1 in intensity. The amount of rainwater stored in surface depressions was significantly less than infiltration water and surface runoff for all conditions. The mean transformation ratio of rainwater into surface depression storage, infiltration water and surface runoff in the OFEP and RFEP was 0.07:0.49:0.44 for the rough surfaces and 0.01:0.29:0.70 for the smooth surfaces. For the tilled surfaces, more than 50% of rainwater was be harvested through tillage technique during a rainfall event, whereas for the smooth surfaces, only 29% of rainwater. Our result will be useful when evaluating the impact of tillage on soil moisture content and even studying soil erosion in agriculture land.  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aoverland flow 3arain 3arain intensity 3arainfall simulation 3arunoff 3asoil erosion 3asoil water content 3asurface roughness 3atillage 3atopographic slope 0aDepression storage 0aWater erosion 0aSoil infiltration 0aSurface runoff 0aTillage1 aHou, Rui1 aWu, Faqi1 aKeesstra, Saskia0 tSoil & tillage research.g2018 June, v. 179 p.47-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32961x0167-19877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.still.2018.01.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245006600206300001800272520092900290592002801219650001701247650000901264650002501273650001001298650001501308650001501323650002501338650002601363650001401389650001701403700001801420700001501438700001601453773011701469856008201586990002301668852000901691655001201700IND60091245720221119233816.0141103e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009124572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.08.1092doi7 aPMC38251032pmcid7 a240707842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Siyuan10aThree new resorcylic acid derivatives from Sporotrichum laxum  ap. 5806-5809.  aSporotrichum laxum ATCC 15155 is the producing strain of the potent anti-Helicobacter pylori natural product spirolaxine (1). Investigation of the secondary metabolites in this fungus led to the isolation of five phthalides (1, 2, 3, 6 and 9) and five resorcylic acid derivatives (4, 5, 7, 8 and 10), among which 5, 7 and 8 are new compounds. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analyses, and the absolute configurations of 7 and 8 were determined by Mosher’s method. Addition of soy flour into the potato dextrose agar has led to the increased production of 4–10. A biosynthetic pathway consisting of a highly reducing polyketide synthase (PKS), a nonreducing PKS and a series of tailoring enzymes was proposed to produce these fungal natural products. The resorcylic acid derivatives are proposed to result from early hydrolysis of the polyketide chain or incorporation of a longer fatty acyl starter unit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporotrichum 3aagar 3abiochemical pathways 3afungi 3ahydrolysis 3aphthalides 3apolyketide synthases 3asecondary metabolites 3asoy flour 3aspectroscopy1 aZhang, Shuwei1 aZhou, Tong1 aZhan, Jixun0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 23, no. 21 p.5806-5809dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2013.08.1093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245014200207300001800349506007600367520163300443592002802076506003702104650001602141650001802157650001202175650001902187650001202206650002102218650000902239650000902248650001902257650002202276650001802298650003102316650002502347700002502372700001802397700002302415773014802438856008202586852000902668655001202677IND60438134720221207073740.0190405e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043813472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-015-8720-42doi7 aPMC44779412pmcid7 a259432602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBöhme, Steffi10aExploring LA-ICP-MS as a quantitative imaging technique to study nanoparticle uptake in Daphnia magna and zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos  ap. 5477-5485.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe extent and the mechanisms by which engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) are incorporated into biological tissues are a matter of intensive research. Therefore, laser ablation coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is presented for the detection and visualization of engineered nanoparticles (Al₂O₃, Ag, and Au) in ecotoxicological test organisms (Danio rerio and Daphnia magna). While ENPs are not taken up by the zebrafish embryo but attach to its chorion, incorporation into the gut of D. magna is clearly visible by a 50-μm spot ablation of 40-μm-thick organism sections. During laser ablation of the soft organic matrix, the hard ENPs are mobilized without a significant change in their size, leading to decreasing sensitivity with increasing size of ENPs. To compensate for these effects, a matrix-matched calibration with ENPs of the same size embedded in agarose gels is proposed. Based on such a calibration, the mass of ENPs within one organism section was calculated and used to estimate the total mass of ENPs per organism. Compared to the amount determined after acid digestion of the test organisms, recoveries of 20–100 % (zebrafish embryo (ZFE)) and of 4–230 % (D. magna) were obtained with LODs in the low ppm range. It is likely that these differences are primarily due to an inhomogeneous particle distribution in the organisms and to shifts in the particle size distribution from the initial ENPs to those present in the organism. It appears that quantitative imaging of ENPs with LA-ICP-MS requires knowledge of the particle sizes in the biological tissue under study.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aDaphnia magna 3aagarose 3aaluminum oxide 3achorion 3adigestive system 3agels 3agold 3aimage analysis 3amass spectrometry 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size distribution 3awet digestion method1 aStärk, Hans-Joachim1 aKühnel, Dana1 aReemtsma, Thorsten0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 July, v. 407, no. 18 p.5477-5485dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-015-8720-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008900178300001600267520145200283592002801735650001201763650001901775650002501794650002701819650002201846650001501868650002201883650001201905650000901917650001601926651001401942651001801956651001101974773012901985856008102114852000902195655001202204IND60081668820221120075800.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008166882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-013-9455-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSosa-Rodriguez, Fabiola S.10aFrom federal to city mitigation and adaptation: climate change policy in Mexico City  ap. 969-996.  aClimate change is projected to affect Latin America and the Caribbean as a result of increased temperatures and changed rainfall patterns. The impacts of climate change are expected to be unevenly distributed throughout the region, due to differences in geographic location, demographic pressures, levels of poverty, and natural resource dependence. To date, few studies have explored these impacts and the governmental responses to cope with them at a city scale. This article examines the challenges faced by the Mexico City government as it translates the federal climate change policy into successful mitigation and adaptation. It analyzes climate change impacts on Mexico and Mexico City (also known as the Federal District), the federal and city’s mitigation and adaptation responses, and advances and contradictions in the implementation of these strategies at the national and city levels. Similar problems have limited the effectiveness of these actions at both the federal and city levels, including the overexploitation of natural resources, a lack of climate information and monitoring systems, and the subordination of climate change strategies to the objectives of economic growth and poverty reduction. These problems have resulted in poor coordination and collaboration among various levels of government to cope with climate change, in addition to avoiding local capacity building, particularly in regard to forest conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aeconomic development 3ageographical variation 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3anatural resources 3apoverty 3arain 3atemperature 3aCaribbean 3aLatin America 3aMexico0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2014 Oct., v. 19, no. 7 p.969-996dSpringer-Verlagx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-013-9455-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03386naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005500151245011000206500001400316520172600330592002802056650001502084650002202099650001202121650002302133650002702156650001402183650001602197650001302213650000902226650000702235650001802242650001502260650001002275650001002285650001102295650001502306650002502321653002302346653002202369653002302391700002102414700002402435700001602459700002402475700002002499700002002519700002602539700005902565773011302624856008602737852000902823655001202832IND60716263120221118143520.0210201e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071626312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVu, Minh T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5858-443810aPhosphorus removal from aqueous solution by steel making slag – Mechanisms and performance optimisation  aNAL-light  aThis study aims to evaluate a passive inexpensive process to remove the residual phosphorus (P) from wastewater treatment effluents prior to discharge to the environment. This work also differentiates between surface adsorption and chemical precipitation in the bulk solution as key P removal mechanisms by steel-making slag. Experimental results show that P removal efficiency is governed by steel-making slag particle size, initial P content and ratio of steel-making slag mass to aqueous solution volume. The results demonstrate the potential of steel-making slag for removing dissolved phosphate from wastewater especially as a polishing step. Even at an elevated concentration of P of 5 mg/L, 90% P removal was achieved using 5 kg steel-making slag with particle size of 0.15–0.6 mm for each m³ aqueous solution. Higher removal efficiency was also achievable through process optimisation. In particular, P removal by steel-making slag can be significantly enhanced, and nearly complete removal (>99%) can be achievable by buffering the aqueous solution at pH of 5.6. This study also established the isotherms and kinetics of the adsorption of P to steel-making slag to identify key removal mechanisms. Experimental data systematically indicate that P removal by steel-making slag is governed by both adsorption and chemical precipitation. At the early stage of the removal process, adsorption is the dominating removal mechanism, while the P removal via chemical precipitation can occur once the release of Ca²⁺ calcium into the aqueous phase is sufficient to form calcium phosphate precipitates. Overall, P removal by chemical precipitation depends on both pH and Ca²⁺ concentration in aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acalcium 3acalcium phosphates 3achemical precipitation 3aeffluents 3aenvironment 3akinetics 3amass 3apH 3aparticle size 3aphosphorus 3aslags 3asteel 3avolume 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aPhosphorus removal 0aSteel-making slag 0aEffluent polishing1 aNguyen, Luong N.1 aHasan Johir, Md Abu1 aNgo, Hao H.1 aSkidmore, Catherine1 aFontana, Andrea1 aGalway, Brendan1 aBustamante, Heriberto1 aNghiem, Long D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9039-57920 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 284 p.124753-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245011400189300001800303500001500321520168600336592002802022650001002050650001102060650001102071650002502082650002202107650001402129650001302143650001602156650002302172650001102195650002102206650001102227650002402238650001502262650001202277650001202289650001202301650001102313650002202324650002102346650002002367650002602387650002102413650001602434650001202450650002002462651002002482653001202502700003002514700002402544700001602568700002002584700002602604773010902630856004802739852000902787655001202796IND4467453020221119231831.0120921e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446745302DNAL7 a224373692pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-012-9627-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurzina, Svetlana A.10aOogenesis and lipids in gonad and liver of daubed shanny (Leptoclinus maculatus) females from Svalbard waters  ap. 1393-1407.  a2019-12-06  aOocyte and liver histomorphology of the daubed shanny (Leptoclinus maculatus) from Isfjorden and Kongsfjorden in Svalbard were investigated during three Arctic seasons: summer (July), autumn (October) and winter (April). Three oocyte developmental phases were observed: primary growth phase, secondary growth phase and maturation phase. We observed four different developmental stages: (1) perinucleolus stage with cortical alveolus formation, (2) lipid droplets formation, (3) vitellogenesis stage and (4) maturation. Late maturation stage of oocytes in the ovaries was from the autumn season. Females accumulated lipids in liver (up to 35.2 % dw) and deposited large amounts of lipids into gonads (up to 52.2 % dw) during maturation. Lipid classes in female gonads changed seasonally, with relative increase in cholesterol during summer and depletion of storage lipids (triacylglycerols and wax esters/cholesterol esters) during the winter. Lipid composition in liver changed during oocyte development and spawning, as neutral lipids were transferred to developing oocytes during summer to autumn. During winter, storage lipids were depleted during starvation. Based on the increase in gonadosomatic index (GSI) with length and observed maturation stages, females seem to mature at a length of about 125–130 mm. The GSI and hepatosomatic index of large females sampled in autumn (September–October) were significantly higher than for females in late winter (April) and spring (May). These results indicate that spawning takes place during winter in Isfjorden and that energy reserves stored in the liver are utilized by females during gonadal development and reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aliver 3awinter 3aautumn 3adevelopmental stages 3alipid composition 3aoogenesis 3aspawning 3acholesterol 3acholesteryl esters 3aspring 3atriacylglycerols 3asummer 3agonadosomatic index 3awax esters 3aoocytes 3afemales 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aLipidsxchemistry 2aLiverxchemistry 2aOceans and Seas 2aOogenesisxphysiology 2aOvaryxchemistry 2aPerciformes 2aSeasons 2aWater Pollution 0aArctic regions. 0aovaries1 aMeyer Ottesen, Camilla A.1 aFalk-Petersen, Stig1 aHop, Haakon1 aNemova, Nina N.1 aPoluektova, Oksana G.0 tFish physiology and biochemistry.g2012 Oct., v. 38, no. 5 p.1393-1407dSpringer-Verlagx0920-17427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10695-012-9627-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01812naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245012500173300001400298500001400312520065500326592002800981650001201009650001501021650001201036650001001048650001601058651001301074651001101087653002001098653001701118653001501135653001601150700004001166700003601206773009301242856008201335852000901417655001201426IND60699099620221118190354.0210116e20180705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069909962DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.771.249212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedroso, Denis Rafael10aComments on the genus Diplura C.

M.10aAdhesion Force between Cyclopentane Hydrate and Mineral Surfaces  ap. 15551-15557.  aClathrate hydrate adhesion forces play a critical role in describing aggregation and deposition behavior in conventional energy production and transportation. This manuscript uses a unique micromechanical force apparatus to measure the adhesion force between cyclopentane hydrate and heterogeneous quartz and calcite substrates. The latter substrates represent models for coproduced sand and scale often present during conventional energy production and transportation. Micromechanical adhesion force data indicate that clathrate hydrate adhesive forces are 5–10× larger for calcite and quartz minerals than stainless steel. Adhesive forces further increased by 3–15× when increasing surface contact time from 10 to 30 s. In some cases, liquid water from within the hydrate shell contacted the mineral surface and rapidly converted to clathrate hydrate. Further measurements on mineral surfaces with physical control of surface roughness showed a nonlinear dependence of water wetting angle on surface roughness. Existing adhesive force theory correctly predicted the dependence of clathrate hydrate adhesive force on calcite wettability, but did not accurately capture the dependence on quartz wettability. This comparison suggests that the substrate surface may not be inert, and may contribute positively to the strength of the capillary bridge formed between hydrate particles and solid surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acalcite 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3aliquids 3amodels 3aphysical control 3aquartz 3asand 3astainless steel 3asurface roughness 3atransportation 3awettability1 aLeith, William J.1 aGrasso, Giovanny A.1 aSloan, E.

Since most of the world’s liquid fresh water is groundwater, the knowledge of aquifer storage properties is essential. Moreover, there is a need to focus research on poor aquifers (i.e. capable of providing about 100m³/day) which will play an increasing role for supplying many human communities. This paper concerns a study carried out in a clayey sandstones aquifer in Northern Cambodia. Conventional hydraulic methods used to characterize aquifers are costly, time-consuming and thus they are usually not used in most of the water projects in developing countries. Therefore, geophysical methods can be useful if they improve aquifer characterization. As compared to other non-invasive geophysical methods, magnetic resonance sounding (MRS) is selective to groundwater. MRS results are the distribution of both water content and pore-size related-parameters as a function of depth. However, relationships between the field scale MRS results and hydrogeological storage-related properties have not been well established yet. We present in this paper a comparison of MRS results with both specific yield calculated from pumping tests and effective porosity calculated from tracer tests. We found that the MRS water content is equal or higher than the specific yield and the effective porosity, thus indicating that MRS also measures capillary water in unsaturated zone and part of the bound groundwater attached to the aquifer solid matrix. We also found that the MRS pore-size parameter is linearly correlated with both the effective porosity and the specific yield, thus suggesting that the hydrogeological storage properties are mainly controlled by the size of the pores of the aquifer. Consequently, we adapted an approach used in the oil industry for differencing gravitational water from capillary water and from bound water, based on the MRS pore-size parameter. In the clayey sandstones of Cambodia, our approach named MRS apparent cutoff time approach, allowed calculating specific yield with an average error of 23% (which is far less than the previous published results), and for the first time it allowed calculating effective porosity (with an average error of 11%). We conclude that the MRS apparent cutoff time approach is useful for estimating aquifer storage properties down to 50–80m deep, in a single day and at an affordable cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abound water 3adeveloping countries 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3ahuman settlements 3aindustry 3alabeling techniques 3aporosity 3asandstone 3awater distribution 3aCambodia1 aSokheng, S.1 aBruyere, O.1 aCaron, D.1 aArnout, L.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 458-459 p.51-58dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.06.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245011700152300001800269520140900287592002801696650002301724650001401747650002501761650001901786650002301805650002101828650001101849650001101860650001301871650001301884650001301897650000901910650001901919653003601938653002601974653001502000653002202015653001702037700001902054700001502073700002002088773013202108856007302240852000902313655001202322IND60569396420221118061126.0170527e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056939642DNAL7 a10.1021/pr50097242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Xin10aComprehensive Profiling of the Rice Ubiquitome Reveals the Significance of Lysine Ubiquitination in Young Leaves  ap. 2017-2025.  aProtein ubiquitination is a major post-translational modification that regulates development, apoptosis, responses to environmental cues, and other processes in eukaryotes. Although several ubiquitinated proteins have been identified in rice, large-scale profiling of the rice ubiquitome has not been reported because of limitations in the current analytical methods. Here, we report the first rice ubiquitome, determined by combining highly sensitive immune affinity purification and high resolution LC–MS/MS. We identified 861 di-Gly-Lys-containing peptides in 464 proteins in rice leaf cells. Bioinformatic analyses of the ubiquitome identified a variety of cellular functions and diverse subcellular localizations for the ubiquitinated proteins, and also revealed seven putative ubiquitination motifs in rice. Proteins related to binding and catalytic activity were predicted to be the preferential targets of lysine ubiquitination. A protein interaction network and KEGG analysis indicated that a wide range of signaling and metabolic pathways are modulated by protein ubiquitination in rice. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the significantly improved method for assaying proteome-wide ubiquitination in plants. The identification of the 464 ubiquitinated proteins in rice leaves provides a foundation for the analysis of the physiological roles of these ubiquitination-related proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aapoptosis 3abiochemical pathways 3abioinformatics 3acatalytic activity 3aeukaryotic cells 3aleaves 3alysine 3apeptides 3aproteins 3aproteome 3arice 3aubiquitination 0apost-translational modification 0alysine ubiquitination 0aproteomics 0amass spectrometry 0aOryza sativa1 aKang, Houxiang1 aLiu, Wende1 aWang, Guo-Liang0 tJournal of proteome research.g2015 May 01, v. 14, no. 5 p.2017-2025dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23605x1535-39077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/pr50097243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02818naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245021500167300001800382520135900400592002801759650003001787650002001817650001101837650005301848650001301901650001801914650001601932650002101948650001301969650003201982650001102014700001702025700002702042700002102069700001702090700002302107700002702130773014802157856008202305852000902387655001202396IND60438135020221120194830.0190405e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043813502DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-015-8702-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBosi, Valentina10aGold-nanoparticle extraction and reversed-electrode-polarity stacking mode combined to enhance capillary electrophoresis sensitivity for conjugated nucleosides and oligonucleotides containing thioether linkers  ap. 5405-5415.  aWe present a capillary electrophoresis method for determining two different C8-conjugated deoxyadenosines, and for oligonucleotides containing them, in which a psoralen or an acridine molecule is bonded to the base via a short alkyl chain containing sulfur ethers at both ends. The sensitivity of the micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method was increased by using two preconcentration techniques, micro solid-phase extraction (μSPE) followed by reversed-electrode-polarity stacking mode (REPSM). Variables that affect the efficiency of the extraction in μSPE and preconcentration by REPSM, including the type and volume of extraction nanoparticle, concentration, and injection time, were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, enrichment factors obtained were in the range 360–400. The limits of detection (LODs) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 ranged from 2 to 5 nmol L⁻¹. The relative recoveries of labelled adenosines from water samples were 95–103 %. The proposed method provided high enrichment factors and good precision and accuracy with a short analysis time. On the basis of the advantages of simplicity, high selectivity, high sensitivity, and good reproducibility, the proposed method may have great potential for biochemical applications.

During the simulated aging, the concentrations of the main 4 anthocyanins decreased in both the control wine and the wines added with yeasts, although at rates depending on the type of yeast and on the nature of anthocyanins. Peonidin-3-O-glucoside decreased by about 20% in the control wine and by ~ 50% in the wines added with yeast strains or the commercial yeast preparation. Malvidin-3-O-glucoside decreased by about 80% in the control wine and in the wine added with YCW and by about 96% in the wines added with W13 and BM45 strains. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside decreased by 47% in the control wine, by 65–66% in the wines added with W13 and BM45 strains, and by 73% in the wine added with YCW. Delphinidin-3-O-glucoside decreased by 100% already after 21–28 days of aging in all the wines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthocyanins 3acell walls 3aochratoxin A 3awine aging 3awines 3ayeasts1 aPetruzzi, L.1 aSinigaglia, M.1 aCorbo, M.

Aging and comorbidities as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, infectious diseases, or tumors, might increase the risk of dialysis. In addition, genetic susceptibility factors might modulate kidney damage evolution. We have analyzed, in a group of ESRD patients and matched controls, a set of SNPs of genes (Klotho rs577912, rs564481, rs9536314; FGF23 rs7955866; IGF1 rs35767; TNFA rs1800629; IL6 rs1800795; MIF rs755622, rs1007888) chosen in relation to their possible involvement with renal disease and concomitant pathologies. Analysis of the raw data did indicate that IL6 rs180795 and MIF rs755622 SNPs might be markers of genetic susceptibility to ESRD. In particular, the C positive genotypes of MIF rs755622, (dominant model) seem to be an independent risk factor for ESDR patients (data adjusted for age, gender, and associated pathologies). Stratifying results according to age MIF rs755622 C positive genotype frequencies are increased in both the two age classes considered (<59 and ≥59-year-old subjects). Analyses of data according to gender allowed us to observe that ESRD women shoved a significantly reduced frequency of genotypes bearing IL6 rs180795 C allele. In addition, MIF rs755622 might interact with diabetes or hypercholesterolemia in increasing susceptibility to ESRD. In conclusion, our data indicate that some polymorphisms involved in the regulation of both renal function and inflammatory response can influence the evolution of chronic kidney disease and suggest that the modulation of the activities of these and other genes should also be considered as therapeutic targets on to intervene with innovative therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3adiabetes 3adialysis 3aevolution 3agender 3agenotype 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3akidneys 3amodels 3arenal failure 3arenal function 3arisk factors 3atherapeutics1 aScola, Letizia 1 aGiarratana, Rosa Maria1 aBova, Manuela 1 aCarollo, Caterina 1 aVaccarino, Loredana 1 aCalandra, Leonardo 1 aLio, Domenico 1 aBalistreri, Carmela Rita1 aCottone, Santina 0 tGenes.g2022 Jan. 25, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130202263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001700165245004200182300001600224520110400240592002801344650002401372650001101396650002101407650001201428650000901440650001001449650002401459650001201483650002201495650002201517650001201539650001801551650004101569650003901610650004001649650001101689650001601700650004601716650002001762650002801782650003301810650003801843650001401881650002101895650004801916650003601964700002702000773011302027856008202140852000902222655001202231IND4461899120221119231559.0141111e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446189912DNAL7 a210783892pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIrles, Paula10aCitrus, a key insect eggshell protein  ap. 101-108.  aMolecular aspects of chorion synthesis in insects have been studied deeply in species with meroistic ovaries. Information available in insects with panoistic ovaries is principally structural whereas molecular information in these species is scarce. This paper seeks to balance the above situation by describing a novel chorion gene, Citrus, from the cockroach Blattella germanica, a phylogenetically basal hemimetabolan insect with reproduction regulated by juvenile hormone and with panoistic ovaries. During previous work we discovered a series of novel genes which were specifically expressed during chorion formation in B. germanica. One of them, herein named Citrus, was peculiar due to its high copy number and its very transient expression. In the present paper we characterize Citrus in terms of structure and function. The most prominent structural feature is that the protein contains a motif which is repeated 33 times encompassing almost all the sequence. By using RNAi techniques we have demonstrated that Citrus is a key player in the building of the endochorion of B. germanica eggs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlattella germanica 3aCitrus 3aRNA interference 3achorion 3aeggs 3agenes 3ainsect reproduction 3ainsects 3ajuvenile hormones 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChorionxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aCockroachesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEgg Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Dosage 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aMicroinjections 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOvaryxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aOvumxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA Interference 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aPiulachs, Maria-Dolors0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2011 Feb., v. 41, no. 2 p.101-108dElsevier Ltdx0965-17487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2010.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245007200167500001400239520114500253592002801398650001901426650001801445650001601463650001101479650002201490650000901512650001801521650001601539650001001555650001501565650001701580653002501597653002001622653001001642653000901652653001801661700001301679700001101692700001601703700001301719700001801732700001301750773011301763856008601876852000901962655001201971IND60716263820221118143531.0210201e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071626382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Ximing10aImpacts of urbanization process on PM2.5 pollution in "2+26" cities  aNAL-light  aThe urbanization process has some impacts on air quality. And PM₂.₅ is considered as the critical air pollutant. "2 + 26" Cities, the air pollution transmission channel cities of Jing-Jin-Ji, has been serious air pollution in recent years. Previous studies on "2 + 26" Cities urbanization process were few, and there were also few studies on the effects of different urbanization levels on PM₂.₅ pollution. Thus, the paper took "2 + 26" Cities as an example to assess the impacts of urbanization process and different urbanization levels on PM₂.₅ pollution. The panel data of population, economic and land aspects from 1999 to 2016 and fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) methods were utilized. It was found that there was significant positive relationship between urbanization process and PM₂.₅. The influential mechanisms of urbanization process on PM₂.₅ pollution varied with the cities’ developing levels. Therefore, the governments should take urban development levels into consideration to formulate appropriate PM₂.₅ concentrations control policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acities 3aissues and policy 3aland 3aleast squares 3amethodology 3apaper 3apopulation 3aurbanization 0aUrbanization process 0aPM2.5 pollution 0aFMOLS 0aDOLS 0a"2+26" cities1 aSun, Ken1 aLi, Li1 aWu, Sanmang1 aYan, Dan1 aFu, Xiangshan1 aLuo, Hui0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 284 p.124761-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02576naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009600167300001600263500001900279520125200298592002801550650001401578650001201592650001101604650001201615650001901627650002201646650002201668650001501690651001601705653002601721653001601747653001501763653001901778700001901797700001701816700001801833773021101851856008302062852000902145655001202154IND60672272420221118113206.0191214e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067227242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japb.2019.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sung-Yeol12aA phytosociological study of spring-type rice field vegetation in Angye Plains, South Korea  ap. 661-667.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis phytosociological study was carried out on spring-type rice field vegetation in the Angye Plains. Field surveys were based on the method developed by the Zürich–Montpellier School of Phytosociology, which emphasizes species composition and homogeneity of the phytocenosis, and 75 relevés were obtained. We analyzed the species performance of 63 plant species appearing in the obtained relevés through 9 levels of combined cover degree and relative net contibution degree (r-NCD). We classified syntaxa by grouping the relevés. Two associations, one subassociation, and one community were classified: the Stellario-Alopecuretum amurensis (typicum subassociation and persicaretosum hydropiperae subasso. nov. hoc loco), Alopecuro-Ranunculetum scelerati, Hemistepto-Capsellietum drabetosum nemorosae, and Cardamine fallax–Alopecurus aequalis community. This study identified the Stellario-Alopecuretum persicaretosum hydropiperae and Cardamine fallax–Alopecurus aequalis communities for the first time. The spring-type rice field vegetation in the Angye Plains was considered rice field vegetation of the dry type, which reflects impact of frequent human activity and rainless climate of the Daegu regional bioclimatic subdistrict.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCardamine 3aclimate 3ahumans 3apaddies 3aphytosociology 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation 3aSouth Korea 0aAlopecurion amurensis 0aAngye Plain 0aRice field 0aWeed community1 aKim, Moon-soon1 aRyu, Youn-Mi1 aAn, Seung-lak0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific biodiversity(Online).g2019 Dec. 01, v. 12, no. 4 p.661-667dElsevier B.V.aNational Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA)wJournal:23211x2287-884X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.japb.2019.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245014200165520127100307592002801578650001501606650001701621650002701638650000901665650002601674650002201700650001901722650001801741650002301759651001201782700001801794773012101812856008001933852000902013655001202022IND60704063920221120191425.0200722e20200531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070406392DNAL7 a10.3390/resources90600662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVateva, Iveta 10aGrain-Size Specific Characterisation and Resource Potentials of Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI) Bottom Ash: A German Case Study  aMunicipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) is a major element of modern waste management and produces annually around 5.7 million tonnes of bottom ash (BA) in Germany. In order to save natural resources and protect the environment, utilisable materials need to be recovered from BA. It was the aim of the present study to determine metal and mineral resource potentials of MSWI BA based on a characterisation study of raw and aged BA of the MSWI plant in Kassel (Germany). The BA investigated consisted of 82.2% mineral materials, 16.3% metals, and 1.5% unburnt organic matter. Overall, 12.1% and 3.6% of the MSWI BA were theoretically recoverable as native ferrous (Fe) and non-ferrous (NFe) metals, respectively. Assuming state-of-the-art recovery technology, 10.7% and 2.0% of the BA were actually extractable as Fe and NFe metals. The processed BA, as a mixture, did not comply with current German limit values for use as a construction material mainly due to excessive soluble salt contents. Coarser grain size fractions were less contaminated, resulting in a utilisable potential of less than 30% of the BA as a construction material. Hence, grain-size specific processing routes need to be developed for MSWI BA to fully exploit its mineral resource potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3abottom ash 3acase studies 3aconstruction materials 3airon 3amunicipal solid waste 3anatural resources 3aorganic matter 3asoluble salts 3awaste incineration 3aGermany1 aLaner, David 0 tResources.g2020 May 31, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21558x2079-92767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources90600663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245012900214300001600343520206800359592002802427596004502455650001402500650002302514650001502537650001202552650001202564650000902576650001502585650001102600650001602611650001402627650001602641650001902657650002102676650002302697650001002720650000902730650002402739651001702763700006202780700006102842773012902903856008303032852000903115655001203124IND60772927420221119005150.0220411e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077292742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10336-022-01963-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaji, Islamiat Abidemi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7083-722314aThe role of avian frugivores in the germination and dispersal of fleshy-fruited Ficus species in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa  ap. 395-404.  aFigs (Ficus spp.) are a diverse taxon of woody plants that play keystone ecological roles. They provide nutritional and aseasonal fruit crops that are consumed by many frugivores, often in times of fruit scarcity. In a mutually beneficial relationship, the plants also benefit from seed dispersal by birds and mammals away from the parent plants enhancing germination and plant recruitment. Here, we assessed the effect of ingestion of Ficus fruit by avian frugivores, compared with manually de-pulped fruit and whole fruits, on seedling emergence and cumulative germination of three Ficus spp. (F. sur, F. lutea and F. natalensis). Fruits of Ficus spp. were fed to Dark-capped Bulbuls Pycnonotus tricolor, Knysna Turacos Tauraco corythaix, Purple-crested Turaco Gallirex porphyreolophus, Red-winged Starlings Onychognathus morio, Speckled Mousebirds Colius striatus and invasive Rose-ringed Parakeets Psittacula krameri. We recorded seed retention time as the time from the ingestion of seeds to the first appearance when excreted by the birds. Seeds removed from excreta, manually de-pulped seeds, and whole fruit were planted concurrently in soil trays in a greenhouse. Seedling emergence was recorded daily, and the proportion of seed germinated was calculated as germination success. Germination success of avian ingested seeds increased significantly compared with seeds in whole fruit and manually de-pulped seeds, except seed germination for F. sur seeds ingested by Dark-capped Bulbuls. Ingested seeds germinated the fastest, followed by seeds in whole fruits and lastly, de-pulped seeds. Ficus sur and F. lutea ingested seeds had higher germination percentages than F. natalensis. Our results showed that ingestion by birds typically improved Ficus seed germination as well as the additional positive effects of seed movement such as long-distance seed dispersal. These findings have important implications with the potential to improve Ficus seed dispersal, promote regeneration and sustain populations of the many vertebrates that depend on fig fruit.  aPublisher supplied data  a98404cNational Research Foundation (ZA) 3aFicus sur 3aPsittacula krameri 3aPycnonotus 3aTauraco 3aexcreta 3afigs 3afrugivores 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3aingestion 3aornithology 3aseed dispersal 3aseed germination 3aseedling emergence 3aseeds 3asoil 3aspecies recruitment 3aSouth Africa1 aThabethe, Vuyisile1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3536-07571 aDowns, Colleen T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8334-15100 tJournal of ornithology.g2022 Apr., v. 163, no. 2 p.395-404dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001150x2193-71927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10336-022-01963-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005500144245010300199300002000302520126500322592002801587650001701615650001901632650001401651650002301665650001301688650001301701650001101714650001401725650001101739650002001750650002801770650001601798650000901814650001501823653001901838653002501857653001601882653002701898700001801925700001501943700001601958700005601974700005702030773014202087856007802229852000902307655001202316IND60676034020221120220309.0191113e20191021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067603402DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b140392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhong, Heng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4185-969010aNi and Zn/ZnO Synergistically Catalyzed Reduction of Bicarbonate into Formate with Water Splitting  ap. 42149-42155.  aConversion of CO₂ into value-added chemicals with a facile hydrogen source such as water is always of great interest for sustainable development. In this work, a simple and efficient method of reduction of bicarbonate to formate on a simple Ni powder catalyst with water as the facile hydrogen source and Zn as the regenerable reductant is proposed. The Ni catalyst and in situ formed Zn/ZnO exhibited a synergetic catalytic activity in the conversion of bicarbonate into formate, and a good formate yield of 81% was obtained. Detailed studies revealed that the synergetic catalytic activity between Ni and the in situ formed Zn/ZnO was mainly attributed to (i) the inhibited oxidation of Zn by Ni, leading to more interface of Zn/ZnO; (ii) the decreased growth of ZnO crystal along the [0001] direction, and thus increasing the more polar (0001) Zn face and the (0001̅) O face, which have high activity; and (iii) the enhanced generation of more oxygen vacancies at the Zn/ZnO interface to promote the formate yield. This research demonstrates an efficient method of using a simple and nonprecious metal catalyst for the CO₂ reduction into value-added chemicals and provides a better understanding of the synergistic catalytic mechanism of Ni and Zn/ZnO.  aPublisher supplied data 3abicarbonates 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aformates 3ahydrogen 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3areducing agents 3asustainable development 3avalue added 3azinc 3azinc oxide 0aCO2 conversion 0anonprecious catalyst 0aformic acid 0aheterogeneous catalyst1 aWang, Lunying1 aYang, Yang1 aHe, Runtian1 aJing, Zhenzi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8518-33651 aJin, Fangming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9028-88180 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Oct. 21, v. 11, no. 45 p.42149-42155dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b140393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02599naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012000170300001600290520100300306592002801309650001601337650002201353650001501375650002001390650001601410650002101426650001701447650001701464650001301481650001801494650001701512650001001529650002101539650001001560650001001570650001501580650001301595651001201608653002101620653002501641653002301666653001101689653002101700700003001721700002701751773021101778856008301989852000902072655001202081IND60672272720221118113125.0191214e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067227272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.japb.2019.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkulov, Evgeny N.10aExploring fauna of Microlepidoptera in South Siberia: novel regional records and interception of quarantine species  ap. 597-612.  aWe report the results of a faunistic study of Microlepidoptera performed in Southern Siberia using diverse sampling techniques allowing to cover various taxonomic groups.

Here we introduce in situ anomalous small-angle X-ray scattering (ASAXS) as a unique method to extract both real-time structural and ion-specific chemical information from one single experiment. Using a 1 M RbBr aqueous electrolyte and a hierarchical micro- and mesoporous carbon electrode, we identify different charging mechanisms for positive and negative applied potentials. We are able not only to track the global concentration change of each ion species individually, but also to observe their individual local rearrangement within the pore space.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon electrodes 3aions 3ananopores 3aporous media 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolvents 0asupercapacitor 0aEDLC 0ain situ 0aanomalous small-angle X-ray scattering 0aion-specific 0astructural sensitivity1 aPrehal, Christian1 aHaas, Sylvio1 aBoesecke, Peter1 aHuesing, Nicola1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2274-97791 aParis, Oskar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6475-22500 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Oct. 21, v. 11, no. 45 p.42214-42220dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b142423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245010300183520128100286592002801567650002201595650002801617650001401645650002201659650001901681650001201700650001301712650001501725650001801740650003101758650001301789650001801802650002201820653001801842653001801860653001701878653002201895653001501917653001301932700001601945700002901961700007601990773009302066856008602159852000902245655001202254IND60741577920221118095204.0220315e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074157792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e072672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashid, Erfan Suryani Abdul10aPhysico-chemical characteristics of nanocellulose at the variation of catalytic hydrolysis process  aIn this work, the influence of various sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) concentration is studied towards the crystallinity, particle size distribution, thermal stability, and morphology of the synthesized nanocellulose (NCC) during the esterification process. Different concentrations of H₂SO₄ (40%, 58%, 64% and 78%) was utilized to achieve the optimal properties of NCC. The as-produced NCC was characterized by Fourier Transmission Infra-Red (FTIR) analysis that confirmed the attachment of sulphate ions (SO4−3) to C-6 of the glucose ring. Moreover, the hydrogen ions (H⁺) weakened the C-6 of cellulose chains by attacking the glycosidic linkages resulting in the formation of NCC. The X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed an increase in the crystallinity index with increasing H₂SO₄ concentration till 78%. NCC represented a needle shaped like structure having a particle size of 10–18 nm in diameter as observed under Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Fourier Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM). Furthermore, Dynamic Light Scattering (DSL) analysis recorded the particle size of the NCC as less than 20 nm in diameter. Thus, owing to various H₂SO₄ concentration the particle size, crystallinity, and features of NCC are substantially affected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aesterification 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3asulfates 3asulfuric acid 3athermal stability 0aParticle size 0aCrystallinity 0aSurface area 0aFunctionalization 0aHydrolysis 0aCatalyst1 aGul, Ayesha1 aYehya, Wageeh Abdul Hadi1 aJulkapli, Nurhidayatullaili Muhd1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6672-79720 tHeliyon.g2021 June, v. 7, no. 6 p.e07267-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e072673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245014700165520188200312592002802194650002102222650001102243650003902254650001702293650001402310650002002324650002702344650002102371650001402392650002302406650001202429650002902441650001602470650001802486650001302504650001002517650002402527653001002551653001402561653002802575653002302603653002802626700002402654773011202678856008302790852000902873655001202882IND60672273020221118113207.0200621e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067227302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e008092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoo, Sinlan10aAmphibian conservation using assisted reproductive technologies: Cryopreserved sperm affects offspring morphology, but not behavior, in a toad  aWith increasing rates of global biodiversity decline, strategies such as reintroduction or supplementation, have become increasingly important in conserving our remaining biodiversity. To sustain reintroduction programs, insurance colonies are established and bred in captivity. Captive-bred offspring are then released to augment wild populations or establish new populations. A key issue determining the success of reintroduction programs, therefore, is the fitness of captive-bred individuals and their ability to survive once released. Unfortunately, little is known about the quality of captive-bred offspring produced using assisted reproductive technologies, such as gamete cryopreservation. To fill this gap in scientific knowledge and conservation practice, we examined differences in tadpole morphology, tadpole behavior, metamorph morphology, and duration of larval stage between Fowler's toad (Anaxyrus fowleri) offspring produced using cryopreserved sperm (experimental, cryo-derived individuals) and offspring produced by amplectant adults (control individuals). Results indicated cryo-derived individuals were smaller as tadpoles and emerged as smaller metamorphs. However, predator-avoidance behavior was not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Smaller body size in cryo-derived individuals can negatively affect their post-release survivorship and reproductive output, thus limiting the potential success of reintroduction programs. This pioneering study provides insights into the quality and competency of individuals produced using cryopreserved sperm across two distinct life-stages. We show that although cryopreservation has often been proposed as a promising way of contributing to wildlife conservation, more detailed examinations are needed to assess the quality of offspring produced for it to be an effective conservation tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnaxyrus fowleri 3aadults 3aassisted reproductive technologies 3abiodiversity 3abody size 3acaptive animals 3aconservation practices 3acryopreservation 3ainsurance 3apredator avoidance 3aprogeny 3areproductive performance 3aspermatozoa 3asurvival rate 3atadpoles 3atoads 3awildlife management 0aAnura 0aBufonidae 0aGamete cryopreservation 0aCarry-over effects 0aIn vitro fertilization1 aHinkson, Kristin M.0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2020 Mar., v. 21 p.e00809-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e008093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245010400161300001600265500001900281520117000300592002801470650001701498650001101515650001401526650001301540650001801553650001201571650001901583650001501602650000901617650001501626650001901641650001301660651001201673700002201685700001901707773013901726856007601865852000901941655001201950IND60731806820221123015533.0210324e20210219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073180682DNAL7 a10.1656/058.020.01142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDutta, Saranee10aNearshore Sediment Comparisons among Natural, Living, and Armored Shorelines in Mobile Bay, Alabama  ap. 135-151.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study was conducted to compare the sediment parameters of 2 project sites located near Dauphin Island, AL, which each contained a natural shoreline (NS), a living shoreline (LS), and a hardened shoreline (HS) treatment. We collected sediment core samples from the shallow intertidal zone along 3 replicate transects and sectioned them into shallow (0–15 cm) and deep (16–30 cm) fractions. We analyzed sediment subsamples for bulk density, sediment grain size, total carbon, total nitrogen, and extractable phosphorus. At both project sites, HS sediments contained significantly more sand (>90% percent) and higher bulk density than NS and LS sediments. The HS sediments also contained significantly less C and N than the LS and NS. These data suggest that LS treatments over time facilitate conditions that favor organic-matter rich and fine-grained sediments and approach the conditions found in the NS, in contrast to HS sediments that become less suitable for marsh development. These sediment changes in LS treatmnts promote habitat conditions that help facilitate marsh expansion and thereby provide important habitat for estuarine dependent wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acarbon 3aestuaries 3ahabitats 3alittoral zone 3amarshes 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3asand 3ashorelines 3atotal nitrogen 3awildlife 3aAlabama1 aBiber, Patrick D.1 aBoyd, Chris A.0 tSoutheastern naturalist.g2021 Feb. 19, v. 20, no. 1 p.135-151dHumboldt Field Research InstitutewJournal:jnl4053496x1528-70927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.020.01143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245016900171500001900340506002800359506003200387520133800419592002801757596007001785506003701855650003001892650001301922650002001935650001801955650001501973650002101988650002202009650000902031650001302040650001702053700001902070773012502089856008202214852000902296655001202305IND60704067820221207133326.0200722e20200424xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070406782DNAL7 a10.3390/soilsystems40200272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubicki, James  D.10aIntegrating Density Functional Theory Modeling with Experimental Data to Understand and Predict Sorption Reactions: Exchange of Salicylate for Phosphate on Goethite  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations are a quantum mechanical approach that can be used to model chemical reactions on an atomistic scale. DFT provides predictions on structures, thermodynamics, spectroscopic parameters and kinetics that can be compared against experimentally determined data. This paper is a primer on the basics of utilizing DFT for applications in mineral-water interfaces. In our case-study, we use DFT to model the surface complexes of phosphate and salicylate adsorbed onto the (101) and (210) surfaces of α-FeOOH (goethite), as an example of combining DFT and experiment. These three components are important in the phosphorus-organic matter interactions in soils, and by comparing the energies of the two surface complexes, the exchange energy of salicylate for phosphate onto goethite can be estimated. The structures of the surface complexes are predicted and the resulting vibrational frequencies calculated based on these structures are compared to previous observations. Upon verification of reasonable surface complex models, the potential energy of exchanging salicylate for phosphate is calculated and shown to be significantly exothermic. This model result is consistent with observations of plant exudates, such as salicylate freeing adsorbed phosphate in soils under P-limited conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgricultural Research Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000079170 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adensity functional theory 3agoethite 3aheat production 3amineral water 3aphosphates 3apotential energy 3aquantum mechanics 3asoil 3asorption 3aspectroscopy1 aOhno, Tsutomu 0 tSoil systems.g2020 Apr. 24, v. 4, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27147x2571-87897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems40200273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245010200168520138700270592002801657650002301685650002001708650001501728650001201743650001401755650001401769651001801783653001401801653001701815653002901832700002301861700002301884773011201907856008302019852000902102655001202111IND60672273120221118113126.0200621e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067227312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e008102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, Jacob E.10aProtected areas reduce poaching but not overall anthropogenic mortality of North American mammals  aProtected areas are established for diverse conservation strategies, but their effectiveness for conserving species varies widely. We compiled studies that used telemetry to determine cause-specific mortality of North American mammals and compared mortality sources of animals monitored in areas classified as protected by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and non-protected areas. Our dataset consisted of 358 studies which monitored the fates of 28,925 individuals and documented 9348 mortalities of known cause across 66 mammalian species. Although anthropogenic mortality was found to be higher in protected areas, we did not find evidence that protected area status was associated with that difference. However, poaching was 75% lower in protected areas. Within protected areas, we found no evidence that number of years since protection nor IUCN category of protection influenced any mortality source, but proportion of anthropogenic mortality on average decreased by 4% with each additional 50 km² in protected area size. Species body mass was an important factor determining susceptibility to harvest mortality and anthropogenic mortality overall. Protected areas in North America were associated with reduced poaching mortality of mammals, but the ecological importance of this reduction is likely influenced by population- and species-specific factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconservation areas 3adata collection 3aharvesting 3amammals 3amortality 3atelemetry 3aNorth America 0aTelemetry 0aConservation 0aCause-specific mortality1 aDeVault, Travis L.1 aBelant, Jerrold L.0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2020 Mar., v. 21 p.e00810-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2019.e008103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245012200167300001600289520102700305592002801332650001801360650001601378650003401394650001601428650001901444650003501463650003001498650003101528650001701559650002101576650001401597653002101611653002101632653001501653653002001668653003001688653001101718653000801729653000801737653000901745653000901754653000801763653000901771653001001780653000901790653000801799653000801807653000901815653000801824653000901832653000801841653001001849653001101859653000801870653001001878653001001888653000801898653000801906653001001914653000801924653000901932653001001941653001201951653000801963700002301971700002001994700002002014700004102034773012102075856008202196852000902278655001202287IND60582405820221120132444.0190206e20180205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058240582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2017.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, Celio10aPDZ domain containing protein 1 (PDZK1), a modulator of membrane proteins, is regulated by the nuclear receptor THRβ  ap. 215-225.  aGenome wide association studies revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located within the promoter of PDZ domain containing protein 1 (PDZK1) to be associated with serum uric acid levels. Since modulation of transporters and particularly of membrane proteins involved in uric acid handling by PDZK1 has previously been reported, the aim of this study was to analyze the impact of the polymorphisms rs1967017, rs1471633, and rs12129861 on promoter activity and thereby transcription of PDZK1. Cell-based reporter gene assays showed transactivation of the PDZK1-promoter by triiodothyronine mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (THR) α and β. In silico analysis verified localization of the polymorphism rs1967017 within the most likely THR binding site whose deletion reduced THR-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, our study shows regulation of PDZK1 by thyroid hormones, thereby providing a mechanistic basis for the previously reported associations between thyroid hormone status and uric acid homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3ablood serum 3agenome-wide association study 3ahomeostasis 3areporter genes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3athyroid hormone receptors 3atranscriptional activation 3atransporters 3atriiodothyronine 3auric acid 0aThyroid hormones 0aScaffold protein 0aPDZ-domain 0aGene regulation 0aThyroid hormone receptors 0a5-HT2A 0aABC 0aAhR 0aBCRP 0aCFTR 0aDR1 0aERα 0aFXRα 0aGRα 0aHDL 0aMRP 0aNHE3 0aOAT 0aOATP 0aPDZ 0aPDZK1 0aPPARα 0aPXR 0aRARβ 0aRXRα 0aSLC 0aSNP 0aSR-B1 0aTHR 0aTHRE 0aURAT1 0a5′UTR 0aVDR1 aPrestin, Katharina1 aHussner, Janine1 aZimmermann, Uwe1 aMeyer zu Schwabedissen, Henriette E.0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2018 Feb. 05, v. 461 p.215-225dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2017.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01416naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245013900153500001900292520043900311592002800750650001600778650001700794650001600811651001000827653001600837653001700853700001900870700001800889773011100907856007501018852000901093655001201102IND60728688720221119195509.0210308e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072868872DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.2.e9912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBijoy, C10aFirst report of the genus Conostigmus Dahlbom (Hymenoptera: Ceraphronoidea: Megaspilidae) from India with description of a new species  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe genus Conostigmus Dahlbom (Hymenoptera: Ceraphronoidea: Megaspilidae) is reported for the first time from India, along with description and illustration of Conostigmus neotubifer sp. n.

Kuntze) can hyperaccumulate fluoride (F) in leaves. Although, aluminum (Al) can alleviate F toxicity in C. sinensis, the mechanisms driving this process remain unclear. Here, we measured root length, root activity, soluble proteins content, and levels of peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, malondialdehyde (MDA), and chlorophyll in tea leaves after treatment with different F concentrations. In addition, we focused on the content of organic acids, the gene transcription of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glycolate oxidase (GO) and citrate synthase (CS) and the relative enzyme activity involved in the tolerance to F in C. sinensis. We also examined the role of Al in this process by analyzing the content of these physiological indicators in tea leaves treated with F and Al. Our results demonstrate that increased MDA content, together with decreased chlorophyll content and soluble proteins are responsible for oxidative damage and metabolism inhibition at high F concentration. Moreover, increased antioxidant enzymes activity regulates ROS damage to protect tea leaves during F stress. Furthermore, exogenous Al alleviated F stress in tea leaves through the regulation of MDA content and antioxidant enzymes activity. In addition, organic acids in exudate stimulated root growth in tea plants exposed to low F concentrations are regulated by MDH, GO, and CS. In addition, Al can stimulate the exudation of organic acids, and may participate in regulating rhizosphere pH of the roots through the interaction with F, eventually leading to the response to F stress in C. sinensis.  aPublisher supplied data  a31972458cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31770733cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aCARS-19cEarmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System  aJATS[2019]423cearmarked fund for Jiangsu Agricultural Industry Technology System 3a(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase 3aCamellia sinensis 3aaluminum 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3aenzyme activity 3aexudation 3afluorides 3aleaves 3alength 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amalondialdehyde 3ametabolism 3amolecular biology 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aproteins 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3aroots 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atea 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLi, Dongqin1 aZhu, Jiaojiao1 aShu, Zaifa1 aYe, Xiaoli1 aXing, Anqi1 aWen, Bo1 aMa, Yuanchun1 aZhu, Xujun1 aFang, Wanping1 aWang, Yuhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3126-26820 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2020 June, v. 26, no. 6 p.1127-1137dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-020-00813-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002000171245010000191300001600291520084900307592002801156650002001184650001501204650002501219650001901244650001401263650003101277650002901308650001801337653003701355653002401392653003501416700002001451700003201471700001701503773010601520856008701626852000901713655001201722IND50067652720221120024124.0190409e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006765272DNAL7 a237471742pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2013.05.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElMekawy, Ahmed10aInternal resistance of microfluidic microbial fuel cell: Challenges and potential opportunities  ap. 672-682.  aThe efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) is affected by several factors such as activation overpotentials, ohmic losses and concentration polarization. These factors are handled in micro-sized MFCs using special electrodes with physically or chemically modified surfaces constructed with specified materials. Most of the existing μLscale MFCs show great potential in rapid screening of electrochemically-active microbes and electrode performance; although they generate significantly lower volumetric power density compared with their mL counterparts because of their high internal resistance. This review presents the development of microfluidic MFCs, with summarization of their advantages and challenges, and focuses on the efforts done to minimize the adverse effects of internal resistance (ohmic and non-ohmic) on their performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aelectrodes 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amicroorganisms 3ascreening 2aBioelectric Energy Sources 2aElectrolytesxmetabolism 2aMicrofluidics 0aMicrofluidic microbial fuel cell 0aInternal resistance 0aMicroelectromechanical systems1 aHegab, Hanaa M.1 aDominguez-Benetton, Xochitl1 aPant, Deepak0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Aug., v. 142 p.672-682dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.05.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02629naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011400158300001800272500002000290520125500310592002801565650001701593650001901610650001801629650001201647650001001659650002301669650002201692650001001714650002401724650001001748650001801758650001601776650001301792650001101805650002001816650002801836650000901864650001901873650002401892650002101916700001701937773011101954856007302065852000902138655001202147IND60520070520221118022435.0160512e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052007052DNAL7 a10.1111/pbi.125002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBundó, Mireia10aEnhancing blast disease resistance by overexpression of the calcium‐dependent protein kinase OsCPK4 in rice  ap. 1357-1367.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRice is the most important staple food for more than half of the human population, and blast disease is the most serious disease affecting global rice production. In this work, the isoform OsCPK4 of the rice calcium‐dependent protein kinase family is reported as a regulator of rice immunity to blast fungal infection. It shows that overexpression of OsCPK4 gene in rice plants enhances resistance to blast disease by preventing fungal penetration. The constitutive accumulation of OsCPK4 protein prepares rice plants for a rapid and potentiated defence response, including the production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition and defence gene expression. OsCPK4 overexpression leads also to constitutive increased content of the glycosylated salicylic acid hormone in leaves without compromising rice yield. Given that OsCPK4 overexpression was known to confer also salt and drought tolerance in rice, the results reported in this article demonstrate that OsCPK4 acts as a convergence component that positively modulates both biotic and abiotic signalling pathways. Altogether, our findings indicate that OsCPK4 is a potential molecular target to improve not only abiotic stress tolerance, but also blast disease resistance of rice crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aabiotic stress 3ablast disease 3acallose 3acrops 3adisease resistance 3adrought tolerance 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglycosylation 3agrain yield 3aimmunity 3aleaves 3aprotein kinases 3areactive oxygen species 3arice 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3astress tolerance1 aCoca, María0 tPlant biotechnology journal.g2016 June, v. 14, no. 6 p.1357-1367dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1467-76447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pbi.125003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007600170520142200246592002801668650002101696650001601717650001601733650001101749650002501760650002301785650001701808650001001825650001301835650001501848650001701863650002501880653000901905653000801914653000801922653001301930653001701943653001601960653001601976653001701992700002402009700002102033700002402054773009902078856008602177852000902263655001202272IND60761122220221117173850.0220222e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076112222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, David14aThe mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes of the kelp, Ecklonia radiata  aEcklonia radiata is a dominant kelp across much of the southern hemisphere supporting vast economic, social and ecological values. It is also of emerging interest for aquaculture industries and in blue carbon sequestration. Despite its importance, genomic resources of this key species are scant, yet could provide important knowledge to better manage, cultivate and conserve this species in our changing oceans. In this study we report the complete mitochondrial and draft chloroplast genome for E. radiata. The mitochondrial genome is 37,696 bp in length and contains 66 annotated genes. Two alternative scaffold arrangements were recovered for the chloroplast genome, both of 130,955 bp and differing only in the orientation of a single ~ 43 kbp contig. Annotation of the plastid scaffolds identified 175 genes and two large inverted repeats that are typical of brown algal chloroplast genomes. Comparisons to other kelp genomes indicate that the gene sets reported here are likely complete. The recovery of two chloroplast scaffold assembly arrangements hints at the possibility of heteroplasmy in E. radiata though this requires further investigation. The genomic information reported here will aid in understanding functional response of E. radiata in changing oceans, enhance the development of E. radiata as an aquaculture resource and support efforts to conserve this ecologically important marine species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEcklonia radiata 3aaquaculture 3ablue carbon 3abotany 3acarbon sequestration 3achloroplast genome 3achloroplasts 3agenes 3agenomics 3amacroalgae 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 0aNCBI 0aSSC 0aLSC 0aGenomics 0aMitochondria 0aChloroplast 0aBrown algae 0aLaminariales1 aMinne, Antoine J.P.1 aWernberg, Thomas1 aColeman, Melinda A.0 tAquatic botany.g2022 Apr., v. 178 p.103485-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01799naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002000142245008200162300001600244500001900260520081400279592002801093650002201121650002301143650001101166650001101177650001001188651001601198700002301214773013901237856007601376961001201452852000901464655001201473IND60731807020221123030633.0210324e20210224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073180702DNAL7 a10.1656/058.020.01162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Susan B.10aAmerican Beavers (Castor canadensis) Use a Hollow Baldcypress Snag as a Lodge  ap.

We observed Beavers in a Mississippi swamp using a hollow Taxodium distichum (Baldcypress) snag as a lodge. In 2016, they had constructed a mound inside of the snag and were observed sitting out of the water inside of the snag. In subsequent years, they continued to use the snag and, in autumn of 2020, constructed a more traditional lodge against it. After being disturbed, Beavers took refuge in another nearby hollow snag on 2 occasions. Beavers are adaptable, occasionally using unusual materials to construct lodges or dams or occupying non-traditional structures, but we found no previous account of them residing inside of a standing hollow tree.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastor canadensis 3aTaxodium distichum 3aautumn 3aswamps 3atrees 3aMississippi1 aGelbard, Elaine M.0 tSoutheastern naturalist.g2021 Feb. 24, v. 20, no. 1 p.N22-N29dHumboldt Field Research InstitutewJournal:jnl4053496x1528-70927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.020.01163Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01500naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008600161500001900247520045000266592002800716650001500744650001700759650001900776650000900795650001600804650001900820651002100839651001000860651002000870653001300890653001500903700002500918773011100943856007501054852000901129655001201138IND60728688820221119195615.0210308e20140218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072868882DNAL7 a10.3897/BDJ.2.e9962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBharti, Himender12aA new carpenter ant, Camponotus parabarbatus (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) from India  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new species of carpenter ant, collected in the Shivalik range of Himalaya is described and illustrated based on the worker and gyne castes under the name Camponotus parabarbatus sp. n.

Domestic animals as a threat for wildlife conservation in Alpine protected areas  ap. 70.  aReview  aDiseases are natural regulating factors of wildlife populations, but some pathogens may become an important threat in wildlife conservation, especially for endangered species. The presence of domestic animals may foster the spread of diseases in natural population, although their role in the dynamic of infections in wildlife is not clear. In this study, we investigated the presence and prevalence of a range of multi-host pathogens in wild species (red fox, Eurasian badger, beech marten, pine marten, stoat for a total of 89 carcasses analysed) and domestic animals (n = 52 shepherd and n = 25 companion dogs) living in a protected area of the Alps (the Gran Paradiso National Park) and discussed the role of domestic dogs as possible source of infection for wild species. Our results showed that domestic dogs are potential shedder of three important pathogens: Canine distemper virus, Toxoplasma sp. and Neospora caninum. In particular, shepherd dogs seem to represent a threat for wildlife as they are exposed to multiple pathogens because of free-roaming, scavenging lifestyles and close proximity to livestock. However, also companion dogs more subject to veterinary care may foster the spread of pathogens. Our results highlight the importance of regulating the access of domestic dogs to protected areas that aim at preserving biodiversity and enhancing the conservation of endangered species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanine morbillivirus 3aMartes foina 3aMartes martes 3aMeles meles 3aMustela erminea 3aNeospora caninum 3aToxoplasma 3aVulpes vulpes 3abiodiversity 3aconservation areas 3aendangered species 3alivestock 3anational parks 3aresearch 3awildlife 3aAlps region1 aBrambilla, Alice1 aDi Blasio, Alessia1 aDondo, Alessandro1 aGoria, Maria1 aMasoero, Loretta1 aGennero, Maria Silvia1 aBassano, Bruno0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2021 Aug., v. 67, no. 4 p.70-70dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-021-01510-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245008600159300002000245520129300265592002801558650001701586650001601603650001401619650002101633650002601654650003101680650001801711653003201729653002401761653003401785653002001819653002601839700001801865700001801883700001701901700001901918700005201937700005801989700005402047773014202101856007802243852000902321655001202330IND60676034620221121014427.0191113e20191018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067603462DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b143422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Pan10aDrawing High-Definition and Reversible Hydrogel Paintings with Grayscale Exposure  ap. 42586-42593.  aHigh-definition and arbitrary grayscale hydrogel paintings that can appear reversibly with hydration/dehydration are realized through spatially grayscale exposure. Spatio-temporally grayscale images are used to guide the exposure of a hydrogel processor to dictate the gradient cross-linking density spatially, which thereafter results in the heterogeneity of hydrogels in swelling ratio, mechanical properties, and especially visible light transmittance, leading to swelling-induced patterns by gradient and local visible light scattering difference based on tunable mesh size and microphase separation. The resultant grayscale hydrogel patterns, with visible light transmittance adjustable, are reversible during hydration (in 1–2 s) and dehydration and possess the feature size of 70 μm and more pattern information compared with previous hydrogel patterning. Uniquely, the patterns can be realized not only on the outmost surface of hydrogels as usual but inside. Combining the unique grayscale exposure with three-dimensional printing technology, arbitrary hydrogel patterns that have plenty of details and even vary at different layers are fabricated readily, indicating its broad potential in smart anti-counterfeiting of security field, mechanics, engineering, and many others.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3aengineering 3ahydrogels 3alight scattering 3amechanical properties 3athree-dimensional printing 3atransmittance 0adigitally grayscale drawing 0ahydrogel patterning 0agradient crosslinking density 0ahigh definition 0areversible appearance1 aYan, Changyou1 aJi, Zhongying1 aGuo, Yuxiong1 aZhang, Xiaoqin1 aJia, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4114-86801 aWang, Xiaolong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4210-840X1 aZhou, Feng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7136-92330 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Oct. 18, v. 11, no. 45 p.42586-42593dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b143423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245009400161300002000255520093600275592002801211650001501239650001501254650001601269650001101285650001901296650001301315653002001328653002101348653001901369653002001388653002701408700005801435700001801493773014201511856007801653852000901731655001201740IND60676034720221121014249.0191113e20191016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067603472DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b143492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zhiling10aLaser-Graving-Assisted Fabrication of Foldable Supercapacitors for On-Chip Energy Storage  ap. 42172-42178.  aPlanar supercapacitors (SCs) have been regarded as promising energy devices for on-chip electronics and they should be evaluated by areal performances due to the very limited available areas. However, these SCs usually suffer from inevitable size increase for the requirement of substrates, current collectors, and sealants. This work presents a kind of freestanding, foldable, and quasi-solid-state SCs that single SC units were stacked in the thickness direction with a common electrode to reduce their occupied areas. The foldable SCs can be fabricated in desired patterns by laser graving and their areal performances increase linearly with the assembled units. The energy density of a 5-unit foldable SC is 177.9 μWh cm–² at the power density of 2.78 mW cm–², and it outperforms most planar SCs. Therefore, this work provides a new reference to improve the areal properties of on-chip SCs from the device design aspect.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollectors 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3asealants 0asupercapacitors 0acarbon nanotubes 0ananocomposites 0afoldable device 0aon-chip energy storage1 aLiu, Changhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8041-94551 aFan, Shoushan0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Oct. 16, v. 11, no. 45 p.42172-42178dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b143493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245012400208500001900332520055600351592002800907650001600935650001200951650002400963650001400987650002301001650002101024653002001045653001701065653001901082653002201101700002401123700006901147700006401216700003001280773009401310856008201404852000901486655001201495IND60736852820221119213919.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073685282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2021.1322142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGudla, Vanajakshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2544-141410aTriflic acid catalysed regioselective synthesis of substituted naphthalenes by benzannulation of carbonyls with alkynes  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn interesting and facile triflic acid catalysed annulation of α-aryl carbonyls with arylalkynes is presented for the regioselective synthesis of substituted naphthalenes.

Understanding the mechanisms supporting coexistence requires accounting for such a diversity. Because most works focus either on mutualism or predation, how pollination and herbivory interactively determine the stable coexistence in plant-pollinator-herbivore communities is still poorly understood. Studying the typical three-species module of such communities, we determine the conditions allowing stable coexistence then investigate how its maintenance constrains the relative interaction strengths. Our results show that coexistence is possible if pollination is sufficiently strong relative to herbivory, while its stability is possible if herbivory is sufficiently strong relative to pollination. A balance between pollination and herbivory is therefore required. Interestingly, shared preferences for plant phenotypes, that would favor such balance, have been frequently reported in the empirical literature. The identified ecological trade-off between attracting pollinators and deterring herbivores therefore also appears as an emergent property of stable plant-pollinator-herbivore communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aherbivores 3amutualism 3apollination 3apredation 0aCommunity ecology 0aHerbivory 0aLotka-Volterra 0aNetwork motif 0aPlant-animal interactions1 aLoeuille, Nicolas0 tEcological modelling.g2022 Mar., v. 465 p.109857-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2021.1098573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012200168300001800290520192300308592002802231650000802259650001202267650001302279650001202292650001902304650000902323650001502332650001102347650001302358650001102371650001102382650003102393650002602424650001702450650001402467650001602481700005502497773011902552856008702671852000902758655001202767IND60598758420221122055006.0180702e20170720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059875842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b012122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Chao10aBioslurry for Stationary Applications: Particulate Matter Emission during Combustion under Air and Oxyfuel Conditions  ap. 7241-7246.  aAs a new type of fuel, bioslurry is prepared from mixing bio-oil and biochar produced from biomass fast pyrolysis and is suitable for stationary combustion applications. This study reports the emission of particulate matter (PM) from bioslurry combustion in a lab-scaled drop-tube furnace at 1400 °C under various atmospheres, including air, 20% O₂/80% CO₂, and 30% O₂/70% CO₂. Similar to biomass combustion, the particle size distribution (PSD) of PM with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 μm (i.e., PM₁₀) during bioslurry combustion also follows a bimodal distribution. Increasing the char loading level in bioslurry leads to an increase in the emission of PM₁₀, especially PM₁–₁₀, as a result of the high contents of inorganic species in biochar. Emissions of PM₁ and PM₁–₁₀ during bioslurry combustion under 20% O₂/80% CO₂ conditions are lower than those under air conditions, apparently attributed to the lower char combustion temperature. However, under 30% O₂/70% CO₂ conditions, emission of PM₁₀ during bioslurry combustion is higher than that under air conditions. Such an increase in PM₁₀ is mainly contributed by increasing PM₁, which appears to be a result of enhanced sulfation of alkali species at an increased oxygen concentration. The PM₁₀ emission performance during the combustion of bioslurry was also benchmarked against those during the combustion of solid fuels, such as coal, biomass, or biochar, under similar conditions. The results show that the combustion of bioslurry emits considerably lower PM₁₀ than that of coal, biomass, or biochar on the basis of the same energy input, which is normally the case when bioslurry is used to replace solid fuels. The results suggest that, from the PM emission point of view, bioslurry is a competitive candidate for substituting other solid fuels in stationary combustion applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiochar 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3aenergy 3afurnaces 3amixing 3aoxygen 3aparticle size distribution 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aWu, Hongwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2816-749X0 tEnergy & fuels.g2017 July 20, v. 31, no. 7 p.7241-7246dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b012123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01515naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010200169520048000271592002800751650001800779650001200797650001600809650002000825653001800845653001000863653001100873653001200884700001900896700001700915700002000932700001700952773010200969856008501071852000901156655001201165IND60736852920221119213729.0220103e20210608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073685292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1531152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Seon Min12aA benzothiazole-based receptor for colorimetric detection of Cu2+ and S2− ions in aqueous media  aA benzothiazole-based azo compound was synthesized and evaluated as a probe for the selective sensing of cations and anions.

Additionally, we obtained the length-weight relationships (W=a Ltb) between individuals with parasites (a=0.0005; b=2.31) and those without (a=0.00003; b=2.91). Parameters a and b differed between groups (p<0.05).

An adult specimen of T. galeatus was collected in a gillnets during fieldwork in the Upper Paraná River Floodplain, Brazil. During the recent analysis of stomach contents a partially digested prey was observed. We identified this item as a juvenile L. fuscus. This is the first record of an amphibian anuran in the diet of the cangati catfish, T. galeatus. We believe that cases of anuran predation by T. galeatus are rare, and that the observed event was the result to an opportunistic feeding strategy of the fish. However, this report is particularly relevant because it demonstrates a possible effect of a non-native predator species on frogs in the Upper Paraná River Floodplain. Thus, future studies are essential for understanding the effects of the predatory behavior of non-native fishes on the anuran fauna on the floodplain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeptodactylus 3aTrachelyopterus 3aadults 3acatfish 3adiet 3afauna 3afeeding methods 3afloodplains 3afrogs 3agillnets 3ajuveniles 3apredation 3arivers 3astomach 3aBrazil 0adepredador oportunista 0aLeptodactylus fuscus 0aAmphibia 0aLeptodactylidae 0aTrachelyopterus galeatus 0aAuchenipteridae 0aopportunistic predator 0aLeptodactylus fuscus 0aAmphibia 0aLeptodactylidae 0aTrachelyopterus galeatus 0aAuchenipteridae1 aBellay, Sybelle1 aOrtega, Jean Carlo Gonçalves1 ade Paiva Affonso, Igor0 tRevista mexicana de biodiversidad.g2014 June, v. 85, no. 2 p.638-640dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de MéxicowJournal:23226x1870-34537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.7550/rmb.358593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001900142245008100161300001800242500000900260520136700269592002801636650003501664650001601699650002701715650003001742650003701772650001801809650001401827650002301841650001501864650002001879650001901899650002601918650002401944650001201968700001901980700001501999700001302014700002002027700001802047773013902065852000902204856007902213655001202292IND4423822320221120164647.0191228e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442382232DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2008.02662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Hong-sheng10aInfluence of Root Exudates of Watermelon on Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum  ap. 1150-1156.  aepub  aWatermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. & Nakai var. lanatus] production in the same field without rotation of crops leads to disease buildup and poor yields. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the influences of root exudates produced by watermelon cultivars susceptible or resistant to the pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON). At low concentrations of root exudates (<50 mg L⁻¹), the susceptible cultivar stimulated the growth of FON but the resistant cultivars inhibited FON at high concentration (200 mg L⁻¹). Mycotoxin production was increased more in the presence of exudates from susceptible than resistant cultivars and after flowering than before flowering. Activities of enzymes (protease, pectinase, cellulose, and amylase) were stimulated more in resistant than susceptible cultivars by FON. Also, there were higher ratios of antifungal phenolic acids (p-hydroxybenzoic, phthalic, gallic, coumaric, cinnamic, ferulic, salicylic, and sinamic acids) to fungus-stimulating phenolic acids (vanillic and syringic acids) in resistant cultivars than in susceptible ones both before and after flowering. Breeding of resistant cultivars containing more antifungal agents is a strategy that, if pursued, could lead to a reduction in the occurrence of watermelon wilt disease, especially when rotation of crops is not possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrullus lanatus var. lanatus 3awatermelons 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afungal diseases of plants 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum 3aroot exudates 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3amycotoxins 3aenzyme activity 3aphenolic acids 3aantifungal properties 3acontinuous cropping 3aconidia1 aLiu, Dong-yang1 aLing, Ning1 aBao, Wei1 aYing, Rong-rong1 aShen, Qi-rong0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2009 July, v. 73, no. 4 p.1150-1156dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2008.02663Available from publisher's site 7aarticle04050naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245023500174500001900409520215700428592002802585650002202613650001302635650001702648650001602665650001602681650001502697650002402712650001502736650001502751650001302766650000902779650001902788650002002807650001602827650000902843650001602852650001302868650001302881650002202894650002002916650001102936650002902947650001402976653001002990653002303000653001803023653001603041700002203057700002203079700002303101700002103124700002503145700006403170773010603234856008703340852000903427655001203436IND60740852620221121145812.0210904e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074085262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1030152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDosoky, Waleed M.14aThe influences of Tylosine and licorice dietary supplementation in terms of the productive performance, serum parameters, egg yolk lipid profile, antioxidant and immunity status of laying Japanese quail under heat stress condition  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBy reducing feed consumption, animals suffering from heat stress prefer to reduce their heat output. Heat exposure has also contributed to major adverse effects on the productive and reproductive performance of quails. Therefore, this research was intended to estimate the preventive function of licorice as a safe feed additive against the negative effects caused by heat stress conditions on laying quail productivity. A total number of 180 Japanese quail birds (120 females and 60 males), nine-weeks old were divided into five groups. Each group contained 36 birds in four replicates (nine birds) with completely randomized design. The dietary treatments were a basal diet without supplementation as control (T₁), basal diet + 100 mg Tylosine kg⁻¹ diet (T₂), (T₃), (T₄) and (T₅) fed basal diet + 250, 500 and 1000 mg licorice kg⁻¹ diet, in respect. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with different feed additives had no significant effects on egg-laying rate, egg number, average egg weight, egg mass and feed conversion ratio compared with control. Also, different treatments showed no significant variations on serum IgG, total protein, globulin, albumin, creatinine, ALT and TAC and caused significant (P ≤ 0.05) improvement in IgM, AST, ALP, uric acid and MDA concentrations as compared to the control. Results indicated that total serum lipids, triglycerides, total cholesterol and LDL concentrations were significantly decreased due to different feed additives. However, HDL concentrations and HDL/LDL ratios were markedly increased by the other treatments than the control group. In addition, yolk total lipids were significantly (P ≤ 0.001) decreased with increasing licorice root powder's dietary levels compared with the control group. Also, a significant (P ≤ 0.01) reduction in egg yolk cholesterol level was observed in the group fed with 500 mg licorice compared to other treatments. In conclusion, fortified laying quail diets with licorice powder could be a useful strategy to alleviate adverse effects induced by heat stress as alternative to antibiotics on laying Japanese quail.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoturnix japonica 3aalbumins 3aantioxidants 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3adietary supplements 3aegg masses 3aegg weight 3aegg yolk 3aeggs 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aimmunity 3alicorice 3alipid composition 3aprotein content 3aquails 3areproductive performance 3auric acid 0aQuail 0aLaying performance 0aLipid profile 0aAntioxidant1 aZeweil, Hassan S.1 aAhmed, Mohamed H.1 aZahran, Soliman M.1 aAli, Abdallah M.1 aAbdelsalam, Nader R.1 aNaiel, Mohammed A.E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8172-53660 tJournal of thermal biology.g2021 July, v. 99 p.103015-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.1030153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013000174300001600304520107400320592002801394650003401422650002401456650001701480650002901497650001801526650001501544650001601559650001301575650001801588650001201606650001801618650001101636650001801647650001901665650001801684650001801702650001701720650001201737650001401749650001901763650001601782653001301798653001601811653001801827653002001845653000801865700001701873700002301890700002001913700002001933700001801953773012901971856008602100852000902186655001202195IND60761528720221122062612.0220211e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076152872DNAL7 a10.1080/09540105.2021.19864712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBayazid, Al Borhan10aAnthocyanins profiling of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) extract that elucidates antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects  ap. 713-726.  aBilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) is a medicinal fruit known for its high content of anthocyanins, flavonoids, vitamins, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, tocopherols and phenolic acid. Bilberry has long been used in oriental medicine for the prevention and treatment of various diseases, such as visual acuity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, diabetes, cancer, obesity, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. In this study, we investigated using the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory of 70% ethanol extracts of bilberry in vitro. Antioxidant activities were measured with total phenolic, flavonoid and ascorbic acid contents. The bilberry extract (BE) showed significant free radical scavenging activities and inhibited oxidation of linoleic acid in a dose-dependent manner. BE also suppressed nitric oxide (NO) generation and reversed pro-inflammatory cytokines such as iNOS, COX-2, TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. From these results, we suggest that BE is a natural powerful antioxidant, and the anti-inflammatory agent being a rich source of anthocyanins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aVaccinium myrtillus 3aanthocyanins 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aascorbic acid 3abilberries 3acarotenoids 3adiabetes 3adose response 3aethanol 3afree radicals 3afruits 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainterleukin-6 3alinoleic acid 3anitric oxide 3aobesity 3aoxidation 3aphenolic acids 3atocopherols 0aBilberry 0aantioxidant 0ainflammations 0aRAW 264.7 cells 0aLPS1 aChun, Eun Mi1 aAl Mijan, Mohammad1 aPark, Seo-Hyun,1 aMoon, Sung-Kwon1 aLim, Beong Ou0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 32, no. 1 p.713-726dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45182x1465-34437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2021.19864713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02702naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008000171300001800251520134200269592002801611650001901639650002001658650001101678650001701689650002401706650001901730650002101749650001801770650001301788650001201801650001601813650002001829650001401849650001801863650001301881650001801894700002001912700001901932700001901951700005901970773011902029856008702148852000902235655001202244IND60598758920221122054949.0180702e20170720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059875892DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b013542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Jae Sun10aIntegration of Reforming and CO2 Removal Processes in a Gas-to-Liquid Plant  ap. 7352-7363.  aIn the current era of high energy prices and environmental issues, extensive research is being done to convert natural gas to useful products. For this purpose, the GTL (gas-to-liquid) process is considered an effective process which can produce high quality liquid petroleum products. However, the greenhouse gases produced in the reforming section contribute to global warming which makes the carbon dioxide capture process inevitable. In this work, a reformer reactor is used to produce the syngas, with H₂/CO mole ratio of 2, and the reforming process is integrated with the solvent based carbon dioxide capture process. Moreover, the conventional design exhibits enormous energy requirements due to the high energy demand in the reformer and solvent regenerator column. Heat integration and the heat transfer process offer an outline to reduce the energy load of the process. Therefore, different configurations are proposed by modifying the flow sheet, and heat integrations are applied to optimize the total heat duties. The optimized configurations ensure remarkable savings. All the proposed configurations are rigorously simulated by using Aspen HYSYS v 8.8. Economic analysis is also carried out for a comprehensive comparison which unveils the most optimum design configuration with minimum raw material and operating cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenergy requirements 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat transfer 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3anatural gas 3aoperating costs 3apetroleum 3araw materials 3asolvents 3asynthesis gas1 aFarāz, Qāsim,1 aBinns, Michael1 aHong, Sung kyu1 aPark, Sang-jin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2881-71620 tEnergy & fuels.g2017 July 20, v. 31, no. 7 p.7352-7363dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b013543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245012300179300001500302500001900317520076100336592002801097650001301125650001301138650001501151650001601166650001401182651001401196653001801210653002401228653002701252653002701279653003301306653002201339653001601361700001501377700001801392700001901410700001901429773011201448856009001560852000901650655001201659IND60731808020221122232721.0210324e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073180802DNAL7 a10.1655/HERPETOLOGICA-D-20-00044.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarvey, Michael B.12aA New Angle-Headed Dragon (Agamidae: Gonocephalus) from Montane Forests of the Southern Bukit Barisan Range of Sumatra  ap. 94-109.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe describe a new species of the Gonocephalus megalepis group and provide new morphological and distribution data for the three other species of the group.

We determined the relative tolerance of wild and domesticated tomatoes to simulated herbivory and evaluated plant characteristics that may contribute to tolerance. Wild and domesticated tomatoes were subjected to different levels of defoliation ranging from 0 to 70%. Single defoliation events at lower levels (15—30%) did not significantly affect total fruit mass produced in either wild or domesticated tomatoes. Increased defoliation resulted in significant reductions in total fruit mass per plant and mean mass per fruit. Reduction in fruit output by the cultivar was °3 times greater than the wild tomato for the first 8 wk of fruit production, whereas the loss in seasonal fruit production by the cultivar was 1.7 times greater than the wild tomato. We concluded that domestication of tomatoes may have decreased their relative tolerance to herbivory. Possible mechanisms for decreased tolerance include differences in leaf area index, light capture curves, and the relative allocation pattern to vegetative growth vs. reproductive structures. Optimization of potential life—history trade—offs between tolerance to herbivory and maximum fruiting abilities are proposed for cultivars of sustainable agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3acultivars 3adefoliation 3adomestication 3afruit growing 3afruiting 3aherbivores 3aleaf area index 3alife history 3aplant breeding 3asustainable agriculture 3atomatoes 3avegetative growth1 aSteggall, John W.0 tEcological applications.g1993 May, v. 3, no. 2 p.271-278dEcological Society of Americax1051-07617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19418303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010300165500001400268520169100282592002801973650001502001650002002016650001602036650001502052650001302067650001402080650001102094650001502105650001502120650001802135650001402153650002202167650001102189650000902200650001302209650002302222650001402245650001502259650002302274650001002297650002302307653002502330653002402355653000802379700001602387700001502403700001702418700001802435700001502453773011302468856008602581852000902667655001202676IND60716259920221118143858.0210114e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071625992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1246522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Ying10aUsing modified quartz sand for phosphate pollution control in cemented phosphogypsum (PG) backfill  aNAL-light  aCemented phosphogypsum (PG) backfill technology is a new alternative for massive disposal of PG as well as to provide a safe underground mining workplace. However, phosphate in bleeding water and leachates of backfill might be discharged into its surrounding environment. To reduce phosphate pollution with source control concept, modified quartz sand (MQS) was used during the mixing of backfill slurry. Experimental results showed that when the MQS was added in the backfill slurry, phosphate concentrations in the bleeding water decreased significantly with mixing time, which was attributed to a synergetic effect of MQS adsorption and binder hydration. As a result, phosphate concentration in the MQS-added backfill could be reduced to 0.3 mg/L in 20 min, therefore ensuring the phosphate concentration in bleeding water below the first grade discharge standard (0.5 mg/L, GB 8978–1996) in a short mixing time. In comparison, the time needed for control group to meet this discharge standard was over 60 min. Then, through phosphate adsorption static experiments, it is found that the MQS adsorption process was in accordance with the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model, illustrating that the MQS was a monolayer chemical adsorption for phosphate in the cemented PG backfill system. Furthermore, by monitoring the leachates of backfill with and without MQS, the phosphate concentrations were always less than 0.05 mg/L, indicating that the addition of MQS had no adverse effect on the phosphate release in the long run. Besides, the addition of MQS can promote hydration process and optimize aggregate gradation to enhance strength development of backfill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aadverse effects 3aenvironment 3ahemorrhage 3akinetics 3aleachates 3amixing 3amonitoring 3aphosphates 3aphosphogypsum 3apollution 3apollution control 3aquartz 3asand 3aslurries 3asorption isotherms 3asynergism 3atechnology 3aunderground mining 3awater 3aworking conditions 0aCemented PG backfill 0aPhosphate pollution 0aMQS1 aCheng, Ling1 aDao, Ming,1 aTong, SenSen1 aYao, Xiaojing1 aLiu, Yefan0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 283 p.124652-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1246523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01523naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245020400165300001400369500001400383520033600397592002800733650001700761650001000778650001200788651001300800653002100813653001700834653001200851653002400863653001400887653002600901700001900927700001800946773009400964856008201058852000901140655001201149IND60699096920221120225650.0210116e20180613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069909692DNAL7 a10.3897/zookeys.766.245442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerefe, Yonas10aDescription of the larva of Oecetis mizrain Malicky & Graf, 2012 (Trichoptera, Leptoceridae) and Lepidostoma scotti (Ulmer, 1930) (Trichoptera, Lepidostomatidae) from Chilimo Forest, Central Ethiopia  ap. 63-77.  aNAL-light  aThe Ethiopian caddisfly fauna comprises 85 species, including 10 Oecetis species and three Lepidostoma species.

The fixation index, or FST, is an important measure, which is routinely used to quantify this. Previous studies have shown that the FST estimated for selectively constrained regions was significantly lower than that estimated for neutral regions. By deriving the theoretical relationship between FST at neutral and constrained sites, we show that excess in the fraction of deleterious variations segregating within populations compared to those segregating between populations is the cause for the reduction in FST estimated at constrained sites. Using whole-genome data, our results revealed that the magnitude of reduction in FST estimates obtained for selectively constrained regions was much higher for distantly related populations compared to those estimated for closely related pairs. For example, the reduction was 47% for comparison between Europeans and Africans, 30% for the European and Asian comparison, 16% for the Northern and Southern European pair, and only 4% for the comparison involving two Southern European (Italian and Spanish) populations. Since deleterious variants are purged over time due to purifying selection, their contribution to the among-population diversity at constrained sites decreases with the increase in the divergence between populations. However, within-population diversities remain the same for all pairs compared; therefore, the FST estimated at constrained sites for distantly related populations are much smaller than those estimated for closely related populations. We obtained similar results when only the SNPs with similar allele frequencies at neutral and constrained sites were used. Our results suggest that the level of population divergence should be considered when comparing constrained site FST estimates from different pairs of populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aecology 3aevolutionary biology 3agenetic variation0 tGenes.g2022 Jan. 22, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130201943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245021800169300001600387520188700403592002802290650001902318650002902337650002002366650001402386650002502400650001302425650001902438700001702457773012102474856004802595852000902643655001202652IND50072099320221116154013.0140121e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007209932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-013-0622-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelletier, Nathan10aQuantifying anthropogenic mobilization, flows (in product systems) and emissions of fixed nitrogen in process-based environmental life cycle assessment: rationale, methods and application to a life cycle inventory  ap. 166-173.  aPURPOSE: Anthropogenic perturbation of the nitrogen cycle is attracting increasing attention as both an environmental and societal concern. Here, we provide the rationale and propose methods for independent treatment of anthropogenic mobilization, flows (in product systems) and emissions of fixed nitrogen in process-based environmental life cycle assessment. METHODS: We propose a simple methodology for aggregating N flows in life cycle assessment (LCA), with supporting characterization factors for all nitrogen-containing compounds on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development High Production Volume Chemical List for which specific chemical formulae are available, as well as all nitrogen-containing flows in the International Reference Life Cycle Data System. We subsequently apply our method and characterization factors to a life cycle inventory data set representing a subset of the consumption attributable to an average EU-27 consumer and compare the results against previously published estimates for nitrogen emissions at the consumer level that were generated using alternative methods/approaches. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We derive a suite of over 2,000 characterization factors for nitrogen-containing compounds. Overall, the results generated by applying our method and characterization factors to the European Commission Basket-of-Products life cycle inventory data set are consistent with those observed from studies having a similar scope but different methodological approach. CONCLUSIONS: This outcome suggests that anthropogenic mobilization, flows (in product systems) and emissions of fixed nitrogen can, indeed, be systematically inventoried and aggregated in process-based LCA for the purpose of better understanding and managing anthropogenic impacts on the global nitrogen cycle using the methods and characterization factors we propose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aanthropogenic activities 3adata collection 3aemissions 3alife cycle inventory 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle1 aLeip, Adrian0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2014 Jan., v. 19, no. 1 p.166-173dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-013-0622-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03267naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009600173300001600269520195900285592002802244650001502272650001602287650001902303650003502322650002102357650001702378650002802395650001302423651000902436653001302445653000802458653002902466700002602495700002502521700002002546700002002566700002902586773013502615856008602750852000902836655001202845IND60762712020221119025626.0220112e20220112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076271202DNAL7 a10.1080/09640568.2021.18878272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmarzadeh, Davoud12aA GIS-based multiple ecotourism sustainability assessment of West Azerbaijan province, Iran  ap. 490-513.  aEcotourism is a major tourism dimension that has received significant attention in recent years. It is widely known that the tourism industry, and in particular ecotourism, makes a significant contribution to sustainable development. In this context, the West Azerbaijan province is one of most important tourist destinations in Iran for attracting tourists interested in nature. The main purpose of this study was to analyze and map the potential for sustainable ecotourism development. The research methodology was developed based on GIS multi-criteria decision analysis (GIS-MCDA) techniques, using 28 spatial indicators. For this purpose, areas with the potential for attracting tourists were identified and the effective factors for increasing and decreasing tourism development activities were evaluated by GIS analysis. The method used as a multi-criteria spatial decision-making technique is based on the network analysis process and its combination with fuzzy logic is very effective for increasing the accuracy of the model and obtaining more realistic results. According to the results of this study, West Azerbaijan, due to its potential, including some areas unknown to tourists and even tourism planners, could be introduced as a nature tourism hub in the northwest of the country. The detailed tourism sustainability map obtained, at the scale of 1/25,000, could be used as a basis for regional planning and sustainable ecotourism development. In this context, the results could also be critical for tourism companies, agencies and local stakeholders and organizations for various applications, such as investment and development of tourism hospitality facilities and infrastructure in high potential areas. The research can also be considered as progressive in tourism research and supports future research on the selection of beneficial criteria and the application of efficient methods for tourism sustainability assessment and mapping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecotourism 3afuzzy logic 3ainfrastructure 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aresearch methods 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3atourists 3aIran 0aGIS-MCDA 0aANP 0aWest Azerbaijan province1 aPourmoradian, Samereh1 aFeizizadeh, Bakhtiar1 aKhallaghi, Hoda1 aSharifi, Ayyoob1 aKamran, Khalil Valizadeh0 tJournal of environmental planning and management.g2022 Jan. 12, v. 65, no. 3 p.490-513dRoutledgewJournal:12206x1360-05597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2021.18878273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009200165520155400257592002801811650001601839650002601855650001001881650002201891650001301913650001501926650001001941700002501951700002101976700002301997700002002020700002702040700002002067700002202087700002402109700002202133700001902155773011902174856007802293852000902371655001202380IND60768356420221120171234.0220225e20220122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076835642DNAL7 a10.3390/genes130201972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolosov, Anatoly 10aInvestigation of the Genetic Architecture of Pigs Subjected to Breeding Intensification  aPigs are strategically important animals for the agricultural industry. An assessment of genetic differentiation between pigs, undergone and not undergone to selection intensification, is of particular interest. Our research was conducted on two groups of Large White pigs grown on the same farm but in different years. A total of 165 samples were selected with 78 LW_А (n = 78, the Russian selection) and LW_B (n = 87, a commercial livestock). For genotyping, we used GeneSeek® GGP Porcine HD Genomic Profiler v1 (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). To define breeding characteristics of selection, we used smoothing FST and segment identification of HBD (Homozygous-by-Descent). The results of smoothing FST showed 20 areas of a genome with strong ejection regions of the genome located on all chromosomes except SSC2, SSC3, and SSC8. The average realized autozygosity in Large White pigs of native selection was in (LW_A)—0.21, in LW_В—0.29. LW_А showed 13,338 HBD segments, 171 per one animal, and LW_B—15,747 HBD segments, 181 per one animal. The ejections found by the smoothing FST method were partially localized in the HBD regions. In these areas, the genes ((NCBP1, PLPPR1, GRIN3A, NBEA, TRPC4, HS6ST3, NALCN, SMG6, TTC3, KCNJ6, IKZF2, OBSL1, CARD10, ETV6, VWF, CCND2, TSPAN9, CDH13, CEP128, SERPINA11, PIK3CG, COG5, BCAP29, SLC26A4) were defined. The revealed genes can be of special interest for further studying their influence on an organism of an animal since they can act as candidate genes for selection-significant traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3aagricultural industry 3afarms 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3agenotyping 3aswine1 aGetmantseva, Lyubov 1 aKolosova, Maria 1 aRomanets, Timofey 1 aBakoev, Nekruz 1 aRomanet︠s︡, Elena,1 aBakoeva, Ilona 1 aKostyunina, Olga 1 aPrytkov, I︠U︡.,1 aTretiakova, Olga 1 aBakoev, Siroj 0 tGenes.g2022 Jan. 22, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes130201973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01763naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245006000176300001600236520053300252592002800785650002300813650001400836650002200850650002000872650001000892650001000902650002000912650001900932650001100951650001600962651001200978653001400990653001401004653001701018653001501035700002101050700002201071700001901093773011801112856009001230852000901320655001201329IND60569393520221118061139.0170526e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056939352DNAL7 a10.7872/cryb/v38.iss2.2017.2232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilkinson, David M.10aEndozoochory of Large Bryophyte Fragments by Waterbirds  ap. 223-228.  aWe provide observations confirming that viable fragments of bryophytes are dispersed by migratory birds after surviving transit through the alimentary canal.

Endozoochory is likely to be an important dispersal mechanism for bryophyte fragments as well as spores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aBryophyta 3aVanellus vanellus 3adigestive tract 3afeces 3alakes 3amigratory birds 3aseed dispersal 3aspores 3awater birds 3aEngland 0aDidymodon 0adispersal 0aendozoochory 0awaterbirds1 aLovas-Kiss, Adam1 aCallaghan, Des A.1 aGreen, Andy J.0 tCryptogamie, Bryologie.g2017 Apr., v. 38, no. 2 p.223-228dAssociation des Amis des Cryptogamesx1776-09927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7872%2Fcryb%2Fv38.iss2.2017.2233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014900170300001600319520152200335592002801857650001501885650001101900650002601911650002701937650001401964650001501978650001401993650000902007653002402016653001902040653002102059653001902080653000902099653000802108653001102116653001102127653000802138653000902146653000902155700001702164700002402181773014602205856008302351852000902434655001202443IND60564347420221120180812.0190320e20170325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056434742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakakura, Michiko10aDevelopment of cell-based assay for predictively evaluating the FcγR-mediated human immune cell activation by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies  ap. 189-194.  aTherapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have important roles in treatments for various cancers and inflammatory diseases. Their highly target specificities provide controlled safety profiles. However, therapeutic mAbs commonly pose a risk of the induction of the release of cytokines, which may result in adverse events including infusion reaction and cytokine release syndrome. Several mechanisms are involved in the cytokine releases induced by therapeutic mAbs, and the activation of immune effector cells via Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) is one of the putative mechanisms for most IgG-subclass mAbs. The relationship between cytokine releases and mAbs' Fc functions is not fully understood. Here we developed a simple reporter cell-based assay for estimating the FcγR-mediated activation of human immune effector cells by mAbs. Our use of the cell-based assay to compare Fc-engineered mAbs with different FcγR-activation profiles revealed that the releases of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) induced by the mAbs were elevated by treatment with Fc-engineered mAbs with higher FcγR-activation properties. Our results also suggested the involvement of monocytic effector cells in the activation of hPBMCs as sources of released cytokines and chemokines, which may lead to the immune cell-mediated adverse events. Our new reporter cell assay is a promising tool for evaluating and predicting the activation of human immune cells by novel Fc-engineered mAbs.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemokines 3ahumans 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amononuclear leukocytes 3aneoplasms 3aprediction 3areceptors 3arisk 0aMonoclonal antibody 0aFcγ receptors 0aCytokine release 0aAdverse events 0aADCC 0aCRS 0aFcγRs 0ahPBMCs 0aLuc 0amAbs 0aNFAT1 aTada, Minoru1 aIshii-Watabe, Akiko0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Mar. 25, v. 485, no. 1 p.189-194dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.02.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245006900151300001600220520037800236592002800614650001000642650001800652650001400670650002000684650003000704650002400734700001900758700001700777773012100794856007200915852000900987655001200996IND60662218220221118055452.0190904e20031003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066221822DNAL7 a10.1039/b305191a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Lin10aRapid microwave-promoted Suzuki cross coupling reaction in water  ap. 615-617.  aWater is an inexpensive and nontoxic reaction medium for the microwave-promoted Suzuki cross coupling of arylboronic acids with aryl halides.

Twenty one of these are described as new (C. bara sp. n., C. berivelo sp. n., C. betsi sp. n., C. creolei sp. n., C. demeter sp. n., C. dota sp. n., C. hainteny sp. n., C. hiragasy sp. n., C. jajoby sp. n., C. kabosy sp. n., C. lova sp. n., C. mahafaly sp. n., C. malagasy sp. n., C. omasi sp. n., C. placida sp. n., C. raberi sp. n., C. salegi sp. n., C. sampi sp. n., C. tana sp. n., C. tanana sp. n., C. vazimba sp. n.), and two are redescribed, C. grandidieri Forel (= C. voeltzkowi Forel n. syn.) and C. nosindambo Forel. A lectotype is designated for C. nosindambo . C. creolei sp. n. is known only from Mauritius and Seychelles, C. grandidieri Forel is distributed in Comoros, Madagascar and Mayotte, and the other twenty-one species are endemic to Madagascar. Most of the Carebara species recorded in this work are endemic to a specific habitat (ecoregion), but some of them (C. bara sp. n., C. grandidieri Forel, C. jajoby sp. n., C. kabosy sp. n., and C. nosindambo Forel) are widespread within Madagascar across all major habitats. The worker caste of Carebara can be differentiated from other genera in the Myrmicinae subfamily by the presence of the following combination of characters: antennae of eight to eleven segments, with a two-segmented club; anterior clypeal margin without central isolated seta (rarely present in some species or specimens), and usually with four distinct setae; mandibles with four to seven teeth (except in one species from Ghana - C. crigensis with three teeth); and palp formula 2,2 or 1,2. We report that almost all Carebara species found in the Malagasy region have intermediates (distinct forms) in the major worker subcaste, with the largest major workers showing remnants of queen flight sclerites and ocelli. The widespread presence of intermediates in the major worker subcaste expands the morphological boundaries of Carebara. We present an overview of the natural history of Carebara in the Malagasy region, an illustrated key for the identification of the known Malagasy species of Carebara, as well as high-resolution images and distribution maps. Unique identifiers are used for all specimens studied, including type material, and the raw data that forms the basis of this study are available on www.antweb.org (open access).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFormicidae 3aecoregions 3aflight 3ahabitats 3ainsect castes 3alectotypes 3anatural history 3aocelli 3aComoros 3aGhana 3aMadagascar 3aMauritius 3aSeychelles 0aCarebara 0aCrematogastrini 0aIntercastes 0aIntermediates 0aMalagasy region 0aPheidologeton 0aPolymorphic 0aTaxonomy1 aFisher, Brian L.0 tZooKeys.g2018 June 18, v. 767 p.1-149dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.767.211053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02300naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009700167300001600264520090900280592002801189650001701217650002201234650001401256650001501270650002001285650001401305650001601319650001401335650001401349651001301363653001801376653001601394653001401410653001301424700003801437700002201475700001901497700002501516700002401541700002501565700002301590773011801613856009001731852000901821655001201830IND60569393820221118061109.0170526e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056939382DNAL7 a10.7872/crym/v37.iss4.2016.4492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jing10aFuscosporellales, a New Order of Aquatic and Terrestrial Hypocreomycetidae (Sordariomycetes)  ap. 449-475.  aFive new dematiaceous hyphomycetes isolated from decaying wood submerged in freshwater in northern Thailand are described.

While recent experimental literature indicates that the contact angle of water on graphite is in the range 90–95°, it has been suggested that the contact angle on graphene may either be as high as 127° or moderately enhanced in comparison with graphite. With the support of classical molecular dynamics simulations using empirical force-fields, we develop an argumentation to show that the value of 127° is an unrealistic estimate and that a value of the order of 95–100° should be expected. Our study establishes a connection between the variation of the work of adhesion of water on graphene-based surfaces and the interaction potential between individual water molecules and these surfaces. We show that a variation of the contact angle from 90° on graphite to 127° on graphene would imply that both of the first two carbon layers of graphite contribute approximately the same interaction energy with water. Such a situation is incompatible with the short-range nature of the interaction between water and this substrate. We also show that the interaction potential energy between water and the graphene-based substrates is the main contribution to the work of adhesion of water with a relative magnitude that is independent of the number of graphene layers. We introduce the idea that the remaining contribution is entropic in nature and is connected to the fluctuations in the water–substrate interaction energy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3acontact angle 3aenergy 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics1 aMarcon, Valentina1 avan der Vegt, Nico F.

In this work, for the first time, two different multidimensional approaches were developed and compared, in terms of peak capacity, for triacylglycerol characterization. In particular, silver ion chromatography with a silver-ion column and non-aqueous reverse-phase liquid chromatography with a C18 column were tested in both comprehensive (stop-flow) and off-line modes. The use of mass spectra attained by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization for both LC approaches, and the fatty acids methyl esters profile of menhaden oil obtained by gas chromatography analysis, greatly supported the elucidation of the triacylglycerol content in menhaden oil. The off-line approach afforded a better separation and, thus, higher peak capacity to allow identifying and semiquantifying more than 250 triacylglycerols. Such a huge number has never been reported for a menhaden oil sample.The main disadvantage of such an approach over the stop-flow one was the longer analysis time, mainly attributable to solvent exchange between the two dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrevoortia tyrannus 3aatmospheric pressure 3adietary supplements 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aion exchange chromatography 3aionization 3amenhaden 3amenhaden oil 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asilver 3asolvents 3atriacylglycerols1 aCosta, Rosaria1 aSullini, Giuseppe1 aGrasso, Elisa1 aCacciola, Francesco1 aDugo, Paola1 aMondello, Luigi0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2015 July, v. 407, no. 17 p.5211-5225dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-015-8718-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245014500175300001400320520164800334536012301982592002802105596001202133650001702145650001902162650001702181650003502198650001602233653002902249653001502278653003902293653001902332700002002351700001802371700001702389700001902406700002402425700002102449700001802470700002102488700002002509700001702529700002002546700002502566700002202591773011802613856008602731852000902817655001202826IND60762712420221119025746.0220112e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076271242DNAL7 a10.1080/1059924X.2020.18377032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDriscoll, Maryellen12aA Scoping Review of Safety and Health Interventions in the High-Risk Dairy Industry: Gaps in Evidence Point to Future Directions in Research  ap. 51-63.  aThe occupational injury rate of the dairy industry (6.6 per 100 full-time workers) is twice that of the national average across all industries (3.3 per 100 full-time workers). While dairy farms are becoming larger in size and fewer in number, this rate has not changed. A scoping review was conducted to identify published reports of occupational safety interventions in the dairy industry. An additional criterion was that the study included an evaluation of the intervention. Out of 22 articles that met the first criterion (discussion of interventions specific to the dairy industry), 19 met the second of having an evaluative component. These 19 articles corresponded to 16 unique studies, because 4 articles corresponded to the same study. Of the 16 unique studies, only 3 had a comparison of treatment vs. control effects, and none measured the impact of the intervention on injuries and fatalities. Of the 16 interventions, 6 were focused on training or informational campaigns in which the evaluations primarily measured knowledge acquisition. Additionally, none of these studies had a sufficient sample size to compare injury rates as an outcome. Our study demonstrates that the literature lacks any rigorous evaluation of whether dairy safety interventions are making an impact on injury prevention. Given this, it is not possible to determine how work-related injuries and deaths can be prevented in the dairy industry. Recommendations for future research include incorporating rigorous evaluation into research designs and attempting to develop low-cost, unobtrusive methods for collecting data on intermediate and final outcomes.  aThis work was supported by the NYS Department of Health-Occupational Health Clinic Network under Grant number C028937.  aPublisher supplied data  aC028937 3aagromedicine 3adairy industry 3adairy safety 3aoccupational health and safety 3asample size 0aWorker health and safety 0aprevention 0aagricultural injury and fatalities 0aevidence-based1 aDalton, Deborah1 aJenkins, Paul1 aTinc, Pamela1 aMurphy, Dennis1 aDouphrate, David I.1 aLundqvist, Peter1 aPate, Michael1 aLindahl, Cecilia1 aMeyerhoff, Anna1 aScott, Erika1 aCarrabba, James1 aHagevoort, G.

Physicochemical and sensory properties of muffins were evaluated. SSF was incorporated at two levels (10 and 20% w/w) in commercial gluten-free premix (control). Incorporation of SSF increased total dietary fiber content, protein and unsaturated fatty acids. The addition of SSF at 10% resulted in a muffin that did not differ significantly from the control muffin; and also that formulations with SSF at 20% caused an increase in the browning index. Browning was favored by the increase of SSF with higher levels of fiber content. Incorporation of SSF at 20% had a significant effect on the textural parameters (firmness and chewiness) of the muffin. Also, both formulations containing SSF showed a higher overall acceptability, particularly muffins with 20% of SSF that rendered the highest scores for sponginess, texture, taste and colour.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achewiness 3acolor 3adietary fiber 3afatty acids 3afiber content 3afirmness 3aflour 3agluten-free foods 3amuffins 3anutrient deficiencies 3asensory properties 3asquashes 3ataste 3atexture1 aEtcheverría, Analía I.1 aManrique, Guillermo D.0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2018 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.2955-2962dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl16929x0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-018-3213-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03366naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012400175500001400299520174400313592002802057650001302085650001202098650001902110650001902129650002602148650002802174650001402202650002202216650001602238650002502254650002402279650001302303650002002316650001502336650001402351650001102365650002202376650001502398651001302413653002102426653003302447653001702480653001802497653001402515653002602529653003602555700002502591773011302616856008602729852000902815655001202824IND60716260420221118143921.0210219e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071626042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWassie, Yibeltal T.10aAnalysis of potential fuel savings, economic and environmental effects of improved biomass cookstoves in rural Ethiopia  aNAL-light  aUnsustainable utilization of solid biomass fuels with inefficient traditional cookstoves has long been a major challenge to ensuring energy and environmental security in Ethiopia. Against the backdrop of this problem, several models of improved biomass cookstoves (ICSs) have been developed and distributed in the country. Yet, little is known about the effect of these ICSs on household’s fuelwood consumption and the environment. The aim of this study was to examine the potential woodfuel savings, economic and environmental effects of three ICSs (Mirt, Gonziye, and Tikikil) in rural Ethiopia from a cross-sectional study of 605 sample households and direct energy consumption measurements in four rural districts. Inferential statistics and cost-benefit analysis were used to analyse the data. The results showed that compared with the traditional open fire tripod; the use of ICSs could reduce household’s fuelwood consumptions on average by 1.72–2.08 tons per household per year. These fuelwood savings translate to potential emissions reductions of 2.82–3.43 tCO2e per stove per year. The results from the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) indicated that investment in these ICSs could provide a net economic benefit of ETB 7204 to 10,381 (US$ 265 to 382) during the 2–5 years lifespan of the stoves. The benefit-cost ratios of these ICSs were calculated between 16.5:1 and 35.0:1. The implication is that promoting the use of Mirt, Gonziye and Tikikil stoves is a viable option and an essential component of the strategy for improving the energy-efficiency and well-being of rural communities while also contributing to the sustainable utilization of biomass resources, and mitigation of climate change in Ethiopia and beyond.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acooking stoves 3acost benefit analysis 3across-sectional studies 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental impact 3afinancial economics 3afuelwood 3aheating systems 3ahouseholds 3alongevity 3amodels 3arural communities 3astatistics 3aEthiopia 0aRural households 0aImproved biomass cook-stoves 0aFuel-savings 0aCO2 emissions 0aReduction 0aCost-benefit analysis 0aSustainable biomass utilization1 aAdaramola, Muyiwa S.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 280 p.124700-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03243naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245011000206300001600316500002000332520182600352592002802178596004402206596003802250650001402288650001202302650002702314650001402341650001502355650001402370650001202384650000902396650001202405650001202417650001002429650001102439650003202450650001502482650002502497650001302522700005902535773010902594856007302703852000902776655001202785IND60643793220221120165508.0190514e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064379322DNAL7 a10.1111/eth.128622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Alexander D.

In the Wellington tree weta, Hemideina crassidens, males can mature at the 8th, 9th or 10th instar, while females mature at the 10th instar only. A number of morphological attributes including male head and mandible size correlate with final instar number, and as these attributes represent a form of weaponry, they are often used in mate/site guarding and male–male competition. Tenth instar males have larger head/mandible/body sizes and show a conventional (guarder) reproductive strategy, whereas smaller 8th instar males typically show an unconventional (sneaker) strategy. In contrast, 9th instar males are predicted to adopt a “jack‐of‐all‐trades” strategy whereby they can fight or sneak depending context. Here, we tested whether alternative reproductive morphs exhibit strategy‐specific differences in risk‐taking associated with refuge emergence, activity and antipredator behaviour and further, whether these traits correlate to form a behavioural syndrome. We found that tree weta show consistent and repeatable differences in activity and refuge use at the individual level; however, behavioural covariances suggest that only 8th instar males exhibit a behavioural syndrome. That 9th instar males show high plasticity and variance in their gallery‐related behaviours supports the hypothesis that these males are a “jack‐of‐all‐trades.” Contrary to our predictions, antipredator behaviour was not correlated with other traits, and differences in behaviour overall were consistently more pronounced between individuals rather than between male morphs or sexes.  aPublisher supplied data  cCanada Research Chairs Program (C.D.K.)  cAlfred Deakin Research Fellowship 3aHemideina 3aanimals 3aantipredatory behavior 3abody size 3acovariance 3aevolution 3afemales 3ahead 3ainsects 3ainstars 3amales 3amorphs 3apredator-prey relationships 3aprediction 3areproductive success 3avariance1 aKelly, Clint D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0693-72110 tEthology.g2019 June, v. 125, no. 6 p.380-391dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39008x0179-16137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eth.128623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245012100171300001400292520201200306592002802318650000902346650001002355650001802365650001102383650001502394650001002409650002202419650001202441650001902453650001002472650001002482650001302492650001802505650001902523650001102542650002302553650001702576650002102593650001602614650001302630650001602643651001202659700002302671700002002694700002202714700002202736700002702758700002802785700002702813773008702840856004802927852000902975655001202984IND4469284020221119232035.0120823e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446928402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-012-1170-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorvÃ¡th, ZsÃ³fia10aInvertebrate food sources for waterbirds provided by the reconstructed wetland of Nyirkai-Hany, northwestern Hungary  ap. 59-72.  aThe Nyirkai-Hany wetland reconstruction area in northwestern Hungary is now designated as a Ramsar and a Natura 2000 site. It was created in 2001â2002 by the FertÅ-HansÃ¡g National Park Directorate to restore a part of the formerly drained large wetland called HansÃ¡g and to offer waterbirds a suitable habitat for feeding and breeding. We focused on this aim of the restoration project and studied the temporal and spatial variation in abundance of birds and their invertebrate prey in this newly created wetland. From April 2007 until May 2008, we sampled plankton, nekton and benthos of different habitats monthly and monitored waterbirds weekly on the three different areas of the Nyirkai-Hany. During our investigations, 135 invertebrate and 53 waterbird species were recorded. Benthos and macrophyte decomposition accelerating guilds were the most abundant waterbird guildsâbesides the dominant grazing importer material transporter guild, represented primarily by geeseâin the Nyirkai-Hany. Zooplankton assemblages primarily consisted of small species not easily used as a food by planktivorous waterbirds. The low density of zoobenthic biomass and the small extent of shallow water mudflats probably accounted for the scarcity of the bioturbing guild group of birds. Nektonic biomass varied greatly among locations having different vegetation types, was greatest in the shallow water areas dominated by Typha, Carex and Phragmites species and lowest at offshore vegetation-free sites. Chironomids, mayflies and odonates were especially abundant and their biomass significantly correlated with several waterbird species, mainly belonging to the macrophyte decomposition accelerating guild (e.g. Anas platyrynchos, Fulica atra). This guild itself, which has increased in abundance in recent years, showed an exceptionally strong correlation with odonate abundance. These results indicate the growing importance of the Nyirkai-Hany wetland area as a foraging site for waterbirds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas 3aCarex 3aEphemeroptera 3aFulica 3aPhragmites 3aTypha 3abenthic organisms 3abiomass 3abreeding sites 3afoods 3ageese 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3anational parks 3anekton 3atemporal variation 3atransporters 3avegetation types 3awater birds 3awetlands 3azooplankton 3aHungary1 aFerenczi, MÃ¡rta1 aMÃ³ra, Arnold1 aVad, Csaba Ferenc1 aAmbrus, AndrÃ¡s1 aForrÃ³, LÃ¡szlÃ³1 aSzÃ¶vÃ©nyi, Gergely1 aAndrikovics, SÃ¡ndor0 tHydrobiologia.g2012 Nov., v. 697, no. 1 p.59-72dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-012-1170-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245012100170300001800291520187400309592002802183650001902211650001102230650001102241650001402252650002202266650001602288700002502304773009802329856007502427852000902502655001202511IND60576888120221119181538.0170806e20130205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057688812DNAL7 a10.1021/la30466752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNielsen, Mette

Spin-coating offers a convenient preparation method for stacked supported membranes, and in-depth thickness maps for such films can be measured by IE, thereby going beyond topography measurements of the top surface. We find that dry lipid films of POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) have a highly ordered multilamellar structure which allows counting of the number of individual bilayers in a thick film from the progression in a concentration series. The average film thickness is approximately proportional to the coating concentration with a constant of proportionality of 5.2 nm/mM and 6.2 nm/mM for POPC and DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphocholine), respectively. The root-mean-square roughness of the dry films is also approximately proportional to concentration with constants of 3.7 nm/mM (DSPC) and 0.87 nm/mM (POPC). Fully hydrated POPC membranes with several stacked bilayers show decreasing thickness for increasing temperature. An apparent excess in thickness by 1.2 nm for the proximal membrane can possibly be linked to the presence of a structured water film next to the solid support. This is supported by modeling of spectroscopic data. Thickness maps of double supported ternary membranes show resolvable liquid-ordered domains in the second membrane while domains are below the resolution limit in the proximal membrane. A thickness difference of 1.69 and 1.89 nm between the liquid-ordered (lo) and liquid-disordered (ld) phases is found for two different ternary membrane compositions. This is approximately twice the height difference measured by AFM on domains, thus indicating that the relative excess thickness of the lo phase is symmetrically distributed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimage analysis 3alipids 3amodels 3aroughness 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature1 aSimonsen, Adam Cohen0 tLangmuir.g2013 Feb. 05, v. 29, no. 5 p.1525-1532dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla30466753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245009100176500001400267520181100281592002802092650002702120650002002147650001202167650000902179650001802188650001602206650002202222650002202244650001402266650001702280650001302297650001702310650002802327651001102355651001002366651001002376653002802386653002202414653001202436653002102448653001902469700002502488700002202513700002502535700002202560700001802582700002402600773011302624856008602737852000902823655001202832IND60716260620221118143914.0210201e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071626062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangla, Sachin Kumar12aA framework to assess the challenges to food safety initiatives in an emerging economy  aNAL-light  aEmerging economies, e.g. India, China and Brazil etc., face challenges to adopt food safety (FS) practices in their food supply chains. Considering food industry’s operations and processes, this study identifies 25 challenges to the FS initiatives involving the opinions of practitioners from six major Indian food producers and academic experts. The challenges are grouped into five categories, viz. organisational, government and policy, global, knowledge and financial. We identify the best and worst challenges to the FS initiatives along with causality among them using combined Best Worst Method (BWM) and ‘Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory’ (DEMATEL) approaches. BWM prioritises these challenges, while DEMATEL identifies causal relationship maps for the prioritised challenges. The BWM results demonstrate that the government and policy related challenges are the key challenges followed by the organisational, global, knowledge and financial related challenges. The DEMATEL results exhibit the organisational, government and policy, and global related challenges as the cause group challenges. The knowledge and financial related challenges represent the effect group challenges. Mitigation of these challenges inherently necessitates stakeholders’ involvement in the food supply chains. We identify constructs for food safety initiatives policy in the emerging economies to raise public awareness while encouraging greater collaboration and efficiency in food supply chains to help achieve the second Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) for securing food for everyone. The results of the study offer guidance and deeper insights to supply chain managers about synergy requirements between the government policymakers and key players of the industry in the emerging economies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3adecision making 3aexperts 3aface 3afood industry 3afood safety 3afood supply chain 3aissues and policy 3aknowledge 3alaboratories 3amanagers 3astakeholders 3asustainable development 3aBrazil 3aChina 3aIndia 0aSupply chain management 0aBest worst method 0aDEMATEL 0aEmerging economy 0aSustainability1 aBhattacharya, Arijit1 aYadav, Alok Kumar1 aSharma, Yogesh Kumar1 aIshizaka, Alessio1 aLuthra, Sunil1 aChakraborty, Ratula0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 284 p.124709-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1247093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245019700173300001800370520156600388592002801954650002501982650002202007650001302029650001502042650001402057650001702071650002702088650002202115650002002137650001102157650001302168651001902181651001702200651001302217700002102230700001702251700002202268700002302290773009802313856008102411852000902492655001202501IND60081666720221120062816.0141009e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008166672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-014-0609-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Leary, Shannon J.10aGenetic diversity and effective size of Atlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrhinchus oxyrhinchus river spawning populations estimated from the microsatellite genotypes of marine-captured juveniles  ap. 1173-1181.  aJuvenile Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhinchus oxyrhinchus) forming aggregations at coastal sites in the mid-Atlantic Bight were subjected to a mixed stock analysis (MSA) and individual-based assignment using twelve microsatellite loci. We confirmed earlier findings from an analysis of mitochondrial DNA that three river spawning populations (Hudson, James and Delaware Rivers) are the primary sources of these particular marine aggregations. Of the 460 individuals sampled 322, 36 and 47 were assigned to the Hudson, James and Delaware Rivers, respectively. MSA estimated that the New York Bight Distinct Population Segment (Hudson River and Delaware River) contributed 83–90 % of individuals to the marine aggregations and the Chesapeake (James River) and Southeast Distinct Population Segments contributed 5.5–11 %. Mean M-ratios were lower than expected at equilibrium in all three rivers (Delaware = 0.726, Hudson = 0.748, James = 0.664), indicative of genetic bottlenecks affecting all three spawning populations. Further, there were low but detectable levels of inbreeding in all three rivers populations. Effective population size (Ne) was estimated for three populations: Hudson River (172–230 individuals), James River (40–100 individuals) and Delaware River (75–186 individuals). Despite these issues, simulations based on life-history information and the Ne estimates suggest that if ongoing management measures are effective, contemporary levels of population genetic diversity are likely to be retained over the next century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser oxyrinchus 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ainbreeding 3ajuveniles 3alife history 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation size 3arivers 3aspawning 3aDelaware River 3aHudson River 3aNew York1 aDunton, Keith J.1 aKing, Tim L.1 aFrisk, Michael G.1 aChapman, Demian D.0 tConservation genetics.g2014 Oct., v. 15, no. 5 p.1173-1181dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-014-0609-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03346naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245013500166300001800301520181600319592002802135650002202163650002202185650002502207650002802232650001602260650001602276650002602292650001402318650002302332650003002355650001702385650001102402650001002413650001502423650002302438650001902461650001002480650001602490650003702506650001302543650001202556650001502568650000902583700001902592700002302611773010702634856007802741852000902819655001202828IND60468415020221120084813.0151207e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046841502DNAL7 a10.1002/jobm.2015003232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhary, Bharti10aBiological control of toxigenic citrus and papaya‐rotting fungi by Streptomyces violascens MT7 and its extracellular metabolites  ap. 1343-1356.  aAn Indian indigenous, Loktak Lake soil isolate Streptomyces violascens MT7 was assessed for its biocontrol potential both in vitro and in vivo against toxigenic fruit‐rotting fungi. Strain MT7 exhibited broad‐spectrum antifungal activity against various pathogenic postharvest fungi of citrus and papaya. In shake‐flask fermentation, antagonist S. violascens MT7 highly produced extracellular antifungal metabolites in early stationary growth phase in glucose–yeast extract‐malt extract (M93) broth. Both extracellular culture fluid (ECF) and its n‐butanol extract showed significant broad‐spectrum fungal mycelial inhibition of several tested fruit‐rotting fungi. Antifungal metabolite was found to be heat stable, nonpeptidic, and polyene type antibiotic. The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of n‐butanol extract against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides MTCC 9664 and Aspergillus niger MTCC 281 was 0.0312 and 0.0625 mg/ml, respectively. Purification of n‐butanol extract through silica gel chromatography resulted in partial purification of bioactive metabolite and the TLC autobiography revealed the presence of single antifungal metabolite with Rf value of 0.755. In vivo bioassays demonstrated the biocontrol potential of tested biocontrol agents on fruit‐rotting fungi. Use of cell suspension of S. violascens MT7, extracellular metabolite(s), and n‐butanol extract significantly (p < 0.05) reduced sour‐rot development on Citrus reticulata Blanco (oranges) and soft‐rot development on papaya fruits. Therefore, these results strongly suggest a high potential for application of S. violascens MT7 and its extracellular metabolites as an effective eco‐friendly alternative to synthetic fungicides for controlling toxigenic citrus and papaya‐rotting fungi.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aCitrus reticulata 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aStreptomyces violascens 3aantagonists 3aantibiotics 3aantifungal properties 3abioassays 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3afermentation 3afruits 3afungi 3afungicides 3agel chromatography 3aheat stability 3alakes 3ametabolites 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3amycelium 3aoranges 3asilica gel 3asoil1 aNagpure, Anand1 aGupta, Rajinder K.0 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2015 Dec., v. 55, no. 12 p.1343-1356dAkademie-Verlagx0233-111X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2015003233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245008900177300001600266520106500282592002801347650002201375650001301397650002001410650003801430650001101468650002301479650003301502650002101535650001201556650002401568650001201592650001701604700002401621700002101645773010001666856008601766852000901852655001201861IND50067547820221122172814.0141111e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006754782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.09.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdrisi Sormoli, Mona14aThe effect of chitosan hydrogen bonding on lactose crystallinity during spray drying  ap. 541-548.  aThe effect of chitosan on the crystallization behavior of lactose has been studied during the spray drying of lactose/chitosan solutions. Solutions with different ratios of lactose and chitosan have been spray dried at an inlet temperature of 160°C using a laboratory-scale spray dryer. Water-induced crystallization, X-ray diffraction analysis and differential scanning calorimetry have been used to study the crystallinity of the spray-dried lactose/chitosan powders. Results show that, despite the ability of chitosan to retain moisture for a longer time during spray drying, the spray-dried powders were in the amorphous form. Moisture-induced crystallization and differential scanning calorimetry results suggest that the presence of chitosan delays lactose crystallization. This finding may be due to the high glass-transition temperature of chitosan, despite its ability to hydrogen bond with water, which was suggested previously by other researchers to be a reason for crystallizing lactose during spray drying in the presence of polyethylene glycol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3achitosan 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adryers 3adrying temperature 3aglass transition temperature 3ahydrogen bonding 3alactose 3apolyethylene glycol 3apowders 3aspray drying1 aImtiaz Ul Islam, Md1 aLangrish, T.A.G.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2012 Feb., v. 108, no. 4 p.541-548dElsevier Ltdx0260-87747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2011.09.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011500165300001600280520082800296592002801124650001901152650001501171650001201186650001601198650001701214650001501231700001801246700001601264773009901280856004801379852000901427655001201436IND50072100420221116154116.0140121e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007210042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-013-0012-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Yuanming10aCalculation theories and analysis methods of thermodynamic stability of embankment engineering in cold regions  ap. 261-272.  aThe calculation theories and analysis methods of thermodynamic stability of embankment engineering in cold regions are systematically summarized.

This article presents the results of the study of the bearing phases featuring these two radioelements within the Bois Noirs Limouzat tailings storage facility (Loire), the only site in France where the tailings (a sandy silt facies and a clayey silt facies) are currently stored only under water. The aim is to gain a better understanding of their respective mobility under current storage conditions. For this purpose, a multi-scale approach was adopted combining historical research and airborne image analysis to select the core location, chemical and radiological analyses, mineralogical characterizations supplemented by sequential extractions (two specifically developed protocols). The results show that U and ²²⁶Ra are mainly found in the clayey silt facies with an average U concentration of 243.3 ppm (132.3 ppm in the sandy silt facies) and an average ²²⁶Ra mass activity of 64.7Bq/g (18.0Bq/g in the sandy silt facies). These results are in accordance with the initial U grade of the ore (2‰), the extraction efficiency of the ore processing plant (95%) and the age of mineralization (305 Ma). The approach adopted made it possible to highlight several mineralogical traps available for each radioelement, regardless of the facies type. Thus, a significant part of the U is still trapped within the primary phases, resistant to treatment and therefore relatively immobile under current storage conditions (49.6%–77.8% for the sandy silt facies and 27.2%–36% for the clayey silt facies). Most of the leached U is mainly associated with weakly crystalised iron oxyhydroxides (8.7%–42.4% for the sandy silt facies and 50.9%–71.8% for the clayey silt facies) and to a lesser extent with clay minerals (5%–12.3% for the sandy silt facies and 0.8%–11.5% for the clayey silt facies). For the ²²⁶Ra, irrespective of the facies type, a significant part remains trapped within phosphate phases, resistant to the leaching process and therefore also relatively immobile under storage conditions (24.4%–38.9% for the silty sandy silt facies and 39.9%–98.9% for the clayey silt facies). Sequential extractions revealed a different geochemistry of ²²⁶Ra depending on the facies. For the silty sandy silt facies, most of the ²²⁶Ra is mainly associated with the clay minerals (6.4%–69.2%) and to a lesser extent with iron oxyhydroxides, barite or aluminum phosphate sulphate minerals (APS) (6.4%–33.9%). For the clayey silt facies, most of the ²²⁶Ra is mainly associated with iron oxyhydroxides, barite or APS (6.4%–53.3%) and to lesser extent clay minerals (0.4%–6.8%). The leaching process did not allow the differentiation between the contributions of each of these phases to the retention of ²²⁶Ra. At last, all the identified bearing phases demonstrate that the U is relatively immobile under the current storage conditions, irrespective of the facies. For the ²²⁶Ra, the bearing phases differ according to the facies. Within the sandy silt facies, the ²²⁶Ra is mainly borne by clay minerals and can be mobilised more easily. However, the sandy silt facies represents only one third of the tailings currently.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum phosphate 3abarite 3aclay minerals 3ageochemistry 3aimage analysis 3airon oxyhydroxides 3aleaching 3amine tailings 3amineralization 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3aradium 3asilt 3astorage conditions 3auranium 3aFrance 0aMill tailings 0aU 0a226Ra 0aSequential extractions 0aRetention1 aBeaucaire, Catherine1 aGerard, Martine1 aRoy, Régis1 aSavoye, Sébastien1 aDescostes, Michael0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2020 July, v. 218 p.106251-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2020.1062513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04065naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011700164300001800281520245900299592002802758650003502786650002802821650001002849650001402859650002102873650002302894650002902917650001402946650003302960650002002993650001903013650003703032650001403069653001403083653002703097653002003124653001503144653001403159653003603173700002003209700002203229700002403251700001903275700002103294700002303315773012703338856007303465852000903538655001203547IND60527362420170818000000.0160715e20121226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052736242DNAL7 a10.1021/am301389u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmberg, Rebecca
J.10aCharacteristics of Colored Passive Layers on Zirconium: Morphology, Optical Properties, and Corrosion Resistance  ap. 6487-6498.  aBrightly colored and uniform passive layers on Zr can be formed by applying alternating current (ac) voltage (Vₐc) for 10 s in 10 wt % aqueous Na₂SO₄ solution at T = 298 K. The coloration originating from iridescence can be fine-tuned by adjusting Vₐc in the 10–80 V range. Visible light microscopy analysis shows that different grains reveal two or three different colors due to the polycrystalline nature of Zr, and the resultant coloration is the sum of these contributions. Reflectance spectroscopy spectra show maxima that can be related to the coloration displayed by various grains. Surface morphology and roughness in the micrometer and nanometer ranges are examined using stylus surface profilometry and atomic force microscopy. The formation of colored passive layers on polished Zr makes them smoother but their formation on etched Zr decreases the roughness in the case of low Vₐc and increases in the case of high Vₐc. Focused ion beam and scanning electron microscopy are used to determine the thickness (d) of the colored passive layer on etched Zr. It is found that d is in the 51–264 nm range and increases linearly with Vₐc. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron back scattered diffraction measurements demonstrate that the colored passive layers are uniform and crystalline in nature. Corrosion behavior of the colored passive layers in 1 wt % aqueous NaCl solution is examined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The results indicate that the polished samples hardly undergo any corrosion and the amount of dissolved Zr does not exceed 12 ppb even after exposure for 56 days. On the other hand, the corrosion of the etched samples is ∼3 orders of magnitude greater than that of the polished ones, and the amount of dissolved Zr approaches 970 ppb after exposure for 56 days. Corrosion behavior of etched and colored passive layers on Zr in 1 wt % aqueous NaCl solution is also analyzed by recording potentiodynamic polarization curves in the −1.0 to 3.0 V vs RHE range at a scan rate of s = 1 mV s–¹ and at T = 298 K. They have similar shapes but the formation of colored passive layers decreases the current density (j) at any given potential (E), and the thicker the passive layer the greater the reduction in j. The development of colored passive layers on etched Zr increases the corrosion potential (Ecₒᵣᵣ) and decreases the corrosion current density (jcₒᵣᵣ).  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aatomic force microscopy 3acolor 3acorrosion 3alight microscopy 3aoptical properties 3areflectance spectroscopy 3aroughness 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asodium chloride 3asodium sulfate 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azirconium 0azirconium 0acolored passive layers 0aac polarization 0amorphology 0acorrosion 0aelectrochemical characteristics1 aBolduc, Sylvain1 aBeauchemin, Diane1 aJerkiewicz, Gregory1 aSchulz, Hubert1 aKohlhaas, Ulrich1 aStrzelecki, Henryk0 tACS applied materials .g2012 Dec. 26, v. 4, no. 12 p.6487-6498dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am301389u3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03534naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245010800205300002000313506007600333520175700409592002802166506003702194650000902231650001102240650001202251650001302263650001002276650002202286650002002308650001502328650003302343650001202376650001202388650001302400650001302413650001002426650001302436700002402449700002402473700001702497700002102514700002402535700002102559700001802580700002402598700002302622700002202645700002202667773017502689856008302864852000902947655001202956IND4481164520221207092943.0120502e20111108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448116452DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11158881082doi7 aPMC32150022pmcid7 a220428732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierce, Sarah B.10aGarrod's fourth inborn error of metabolism solved by the identification of mutations causing pentosuria  ap. 18313-18317.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPentosuria is one of four conditions hypothesized by Archibald Garrod in 1908 to be inborn errors of metabolism. Mutations responsible for the other three conditions (albinism, alkaptonuria, and cystinuria) have been identified, but the mutations responsible for pentosuria remained unknown. Pentosuria, which affects almost exclusively individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, is characterized by high levels of the pentose sugar L-xylulose in blood and urine and deficiency of the enzyme L-xylulose reductase. The condition is autosomal-recessive and completely clinically benign, but in the early and mid-20th century attracted attention because it was often confused with diabetes mellitus and inappropriately treated with insulin. Persons with pentosuria were identified from records of Margaret Lasker, who studied the condition in the 1930s to 1960s. In the DCXR gene encoding L-xylulose reductase, we identified two mutations, DCXR c.583ÎC and DCXR c.52(+1)G > A, each predicted to lead to loss of enzyme activity. Of nine unrelated living pentosuric subjects, six were homozygous for DCXR c.583ÎC, one was homozygous for DCXR c.52(+1)G > A, and two were compound heterozygous for the two mutant alleles. L-Xylulose reductase was not detectable in protein lysates from subjectsâ cells and high levels of xylulose were detected in their sera, confirming the relationship between the DCXR genotypes and the pentosuric phenotype. The combined frequency of the two mutant DCXR alleles in 1,067 Ashkenazi Jewish controls was 0.0173, suggesting a pentosuria frequency of approximately one in 3,300 in this population. Haplotype analysis indicated that the DCXR c.52(+1)G > A mutation arose more recently than the DCXR c.583ÎC mutation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aJews 3aalbino 3aalleles 3aancestry 3ablood 3adiabetes mellitus 3aenzyme activity 3ahaplotypes 3ainherited metabolic diseases 3ainsulin 3amutants 3amutation 3apentoses 3aurine 3axylulose1 aSpurrell, Cailyn H.1 aMandell, Jessica B.1 aLee, Ming K.1 aZeligson, Sharon1 aBereman, Michael S.1 aStray, Sunday M.1 aFokstuen, Siv1 aMacCoss, Michael J.1 aLevy-Lahad, Ephrat1 aKing, Mary-Claire1 aMotulsky, Arno G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Nov. 8, v. 108, no. 45 p.18313-18317dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11158881083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010900167300001600276500001900292520105600311536034801367592002801715596001601743596002201759596001601781650001201797650001101809650002101820653002201841653002501863653003001888653002401918653001301942700001501955700001601970773013001986856008502116852000902201655001202210IND60724346920221116173544.0210122e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072434692DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2020.17290552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Longxin10aAnalysis of tensile behaviour of hyperelastic auxetic cellular materials with re-entrant hexagonal cells  ap. 173-186.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHyperelastic auxetic cellular materials are negative Poisson’s ratio (NPR) and show transverse expansion when stretched and lateral contraction when compressed. The influence of the direction of force on the auxetic property, effect of cell angle on Poisson’s ratio, buckling property of RH structures has been discussed in this article. The results show that: re-entrant hexagon (RH) structure never shows non-auxetic behaivour when it is subjected to load vertical force while it shows non-auxetic performance when the force reach a certain value when it is subjected to load transverse force. When stretched in the vertical direction and within a certain displacement, RH structures with smaller angle requires smaller force. Meanwhile, RH structure with smaller angle has more obvious auxetic property. When the RH model was stretched, its Poisson’s ratio first decreases and then increases. Buckling occurs when RH is subjected to load longitudinally, and as the total width of the simple increases, the number of buckling curves increases.  aThis work is supported by the [Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities] under Grant [2232018G-01]; [Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities] under Grant [CUSF-DH-D-2018036]; [Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Textiles Inspection Technology (Fujian Fiber Inspection Bureau) of China] under Grant [2018-MXJ-01].  aPublisher supplied data  a2232018G-01  aCUSF-DH-D-2018036  a2018-MXJ-01 3afabrics 3amodels 3atensile strength 0aPoisson’s ratio 0are-entrant hexagonal 0afinite element simulation 0atensile performance 0abuckling1 aXu, Qiaoli1 aDu, Zhaoqun0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2021 Feb. 1, v. 112, no. 2 p.173-186dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2020.17290553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01366naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245008500163300001600248520042700264592002800691653002200719653002500741653002700766653001200793653002200805700002100827773014100848856007800989852000901067655001201076IND60130572720221119055005.0151127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013057272DNAL7 a10.3157/061.135.04042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Harold B.10aMiss Mattie Wadsworth (1862––1943): Early Woman Author in Entomological News  ap. 413-429.  aMiss Mattie Wadsworth, an amateur entomologist from rural Maine, stands out as one of the early women authors in Entomological News.

Kinetic studies and identification of the photodegradation products by HPLC–MS/MS  ap. 993-1001.  aIn this study, the relevance of photodegradation processes on the persistence of the fungicide thiram in waters was investigated. The photodegradation of thiram in Milli-Q water and in aqueous solutions of humic and fulvic acids, as well as the photodegradation in spiked river water were studied. Both pure thiram and one of its commercial formulations were used to prepare the solutions which were irradiated in a solar light simulator. In general, thiram photodegradation follows pseudo-first order kinetics. The half-life time of thiram 2mgL−1 in Milli-Q water was 28min. However, the degradation rate of thiram was significantly increased (p=0.02) by the inert components of the thiram commercial formulation as well as by commercial humic acids and by fulvic acids isolated from river water (p<0.004). Thus, the half-life time of thiram decreased to 24min in the presence of the inert formulation components, while, in the presence of both humic and fulvic acids (10mgL−1) it decreased to 22min. Furthermore, thiram photodegradation in natural river water showed that there is a significant enhancement of the degradation rate constant of thiram relatively to Milli-Q water, corresponding to a decrease of about 38% in its half-life time. This increase of the degradation rate in river water seems to be higher than that observed in the presence of FA, suggesting that beyond organic matter, other natural river components can increase the thiram photodegradation rate. These results allow us to conclude that photodegradation by solar radiation can be an important degradation pathway of thiram in natural waters. HPLC–MS/MS allowed to identify, for the first time, three products of the photodegradation of thiram in aqueous solution. Three compounds were identified and their structure was corroborated by the MSn spectra fragmentation profile. Pathways for the formation of the products from thiram photodegradation are proposed and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3afulvic acids 3ahalf life 3ahumic acids 3aphotolysis 3ariver water 3arivers 3asolar radiation 3athiram 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFungicides, Industrialxanalysisxchemistry. 2aHalf-Life 2aKinetics 2aModels, Chemical 2aPhotolysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSunlight 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aThiramxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 0aThiram 0aPhotodegradation 0aHumic substances 0aKinetics 0aHPLC–MS/MS1 aSantos, Sónia A.O.1 aDomingues, M.

Their inoculation with soluble P source viz., SSP and in combination with pressmud (PM) ascentuates their effect as P solubilizers. Enhanced uptake and higher tissue indices of P besides N and K were indicative of better nutrient use efficiency and their positive influence on various growth and yield parameters.

Consequently, alpha lichen diversity no longer represents an effective response variable for assessing trends in atmospheric pollutants over time. Here we investigated the value of the relationship between alpha diversity and different aspects of gamma diversity (similarity, replacement and differences in richness of species) together with that of beta diversity (calculated as the sum of replacement and difference in richness of species), for assessing complex variations in epiphytic lichen communities in response to a changing pollution scenario. We considered an area subjected to extreme variation in atmospheric pollution in recent decades and explored temporal and spatial aspects of lichen community succession over short-, intermediate- and long-term reference periods. We found that variation in lichen communities for long- and intermediate-term reference periods was strongly dependent on the alpha diversity of single trees at the beginning of the observation period. The occurrence of nitrophytic species, which responded to the decrease in SO₂ concentrations, contribute to this trend. The effect of land use was observed only over long observation periods, with trees in urban areas showing less variation than those located in rural areas. In particular, the analysis of similarity, species replacement and differences in richness of tree pairs demonstrated that trends and patterns within lichen communities are neither always nor to the same extent associated with alpha diversity. Our results show that a thorough study of gamma diversity, including beta diversity and similarity, is required to detect changes in air quality in long-term biomonitoring surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aepiphytes 3aland use 3alichens 3apollutants 3arural areas 3aspecies diversity 3asulfur dioxide 3asurveys 3atrees 3aurban areas 0alichen diversity 0anitrophytes 0aoxides of nitrogen 0aspecies replacement 0asulphur dioxide1 aBRUNIALTI, Giorgio1 aCALDERISI, Marco1 aMALASPINA, Paola1 aFRATI, Luisa0 tLichenologist.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.371-383dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25448x1096-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00242829180002213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02572naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004300113040001800156100002000174245011600194300001800310520095800328592002801286650001201314650001201326650001301338650001101351650001101362650001101373650001501384650001701399650001701416650000901433650001101442650001501453650000901468650002001477650000901497650002901506650004001535650001901575650002901594650005701623650002801680651002101708653001501729653001701744653001801761653001501779700002001794700001701814773007701831856008901908852000901997655001202006IND60112193820221119002021.0160901e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011219382DNAL7 a234536032pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Pyeong-Koo10aHeavy metal concentrations and contamination levels from Asian dust and identification of sources: A case-study  ap. 1018-1025.  aThe aims of this study were to determine concentrations of selected metals (As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Sb, Pb and Zn) in Asian and non-Asian dust collected in Daejeon, Korea between February 2007 and December 2007 and to estimate the pollution sources.

As, Cd, Cu, Sb, Pb, and Zn are the ones most strongly affected by anthropogenic inputs such as airborne pollutants. The 206Pb/207Pb ratios of Asian and non-Asian dust are similar to those of the airborne particles in some heavily industrialized Chinese cities and the soils of the Alashan desert.

Within a species, individuals often differ in behavior in a consistent and repeatable way (i.e., demonstrate animal personality). This consistency in behavior can be affected by differences in conditions experienced early in life. It is, however, unclear whether effects of developmental environments on animal personality are driven by changes in within- or between-individual variation. To investigate this, we measured activity, exploration, sociability, and boldness in adult male southern rainforest sunskinks, Lampropholis similis, incubated at either 23 °C or 26 °C, and compared behavioral phenotypes between these incubation treatments. We also compared the behavior of these incubation groups to a cohort of wild-caught skinks to determine whether rearing in captivity also affected the personality of the lizards. Skinks that had been incubated at a higher temperature were more explorative and demonstrated personality in a larger suite of traits compared to lizards incubated at a lower temperature or caught in the wild. These differences among developmental environment were primarily driven by within-individual variation, which tended to be higher among the high incubation treatment. We also found no evidence for a behavioral syndrome in either captive- or wild-reared skinks. Our results suggest the potential for greater behavioral plasticity in skinks incubated at a higher temperature, which may enable them to cope with environmental change, such as climate warming, in the short term. Overall, we show that effects of developmental environment are complex and play a pivotal role in shaping animal personality. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Experiences during development are expected to influence how animals develop, including their behavior. We tested early environment effects on behavior in adult southern rainforest sunskinks by comparing lizards incubated at different temperatures as well as comparing those reared in the wild with those reared in captive environments. We found that lizards incubated at the higher temperature were more exploratory. Furthermore, both incubation temperature and captivity/wild-rearing had pronounced effects on the consistency of behavior—in different directions for different traits—demonstrating developmental environments have strong effects on animal personality. Such changes in behavioral traits likely have flow-on effects for the animal’s fitness and biotic interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aDP170100684cAustralian Research Council  aDP170100684cAustralian Research Council 3aLampropholis 3aadults 3acaptive animals 3aclimate 3aecology 3amales 3apersonality 3aphenotype 3arain forests 3asociobiology 3atemperature1 aPhillips, Ben L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2580-23361 aLlewelyn, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5379-56311 aChapple, David G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7720-62801 aWong, Bob B.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and genetic basis for seed vigor remain unknown. High-density genetic linkage mapping is an effective method for genomic study and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. In this study, a high-density genetic map was constructed from a 148 BC₄F₃ population cross between ‘M03’ and ‘M08’ strains based on specific-locus amplified fragment (SLAF) sequencing. The constructed high-density genetic linkage map (HDGM) included 3876 SNP markers on ten chromosomes covering 2413.25 cM in length, with a mean distance between markers of 0.62 cM. QTL analysis was performed on four sweet corn germination traits that are related to seed vigor under artificial aging conditions. A total of 18 QTLs were identified in two seasons. Interestingly, a stable QTL was detected in two seasons on chromosome 10—termed qGR10—within an interval of 1.37 Mb. Within this interval, combined with gene annotation, we found four candidate genes (GRMZM2G074309, GRMZM2G117319, GRMZM2G465812, and GRMZM2G343519) which may be related to seed vigor after artificial aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosome mapping 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenomics 3agermination 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseeds 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asweetcorn 3avigor1 aFeng, Faqiang 1 aZhu, Yuzhong 1 aXie, Fugui 1 aYang, Jing 1 aGong, Jie 1 aLiu, Yu 1 aZhu, Wei 1 aGao, Tianle 1 aChen, Danyi 1 aLi, Xiaoqin 1 aHuang, Jun 0 tGenes.g2019 Dec. 28, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110100373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245008100172300001400253520089100267592002801158650001701186650001301203650002301216650001401239650001401253650002201267650001101289650001601300650000901316650001401325700002001339773011901359856008401478852000901562655001201571IND4487716020221120062145.0141110e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448771602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2010.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichardson, David M10aLearning from our mistakes: minimizing problems with invasive biofuel plants  ap. 36-42.  aOne of the environmental concerns associated with producing biofuels from alien plants is the risk of these species becoming invasive. We explored whether insights from commercial forestry and agroforestry could inform strategies to reduce future problems with invasive biofuel plants. The dynamics, dimensions, and extent of invasions of forestry species can be explained using models incorporating species traits, environmental features, stochastic factors associated with plantings, and residence time. Economic driving forces are crucial. Important lessons to be learnt from forestry for reducing problems with invasiveness of alien species for biofuel production include: the use of global databases and screening tools for identifying high-risk species; the design and configuration of plantations to minimize spread risk; and the use of biological control to reduce invasiveness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3abiofuels 3abiological control 3adatabases 3aeconomics 3aintroduced plants 3amodels 3aplantations 3arisk 3ascreening1 aBlanchard, Ryan0 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2011 Mar., v. 3, no. 1-2 p.36-42dElsevier B.V.x1877-34357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2010.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010500165300001600270520169700286592002801983650002502011650001402036650001102050650002202061650001002083650001402093650001102107650001502118650002202133650001002155650001402165650001602179650001602195650001302211650002002224650001402244650001302258700002802271700002202299773011102321856004802432852000902480655001202489IND4468618920221122043844.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446861892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-011-9873-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGranke, Leah L.10aDifferences in virulence of Phytophthora capsici isolates from a worldwide collection on host fruits  ap. 281-296.  aPhytophthora capsici causes root, crown, and fruit rot of vegetable and tropical hosts. Cucumber, zucchini, tomato, and pepper fruits were inoculated using 6-mm-diameter agar plugs of P. capsici, incubated in clear plastic boxes at room temperature (25âÂ±â2Â°C and 100% relative humidity), and virulence was estimated by measuring the lesion diameter, pathogen growth diameter, and pathogen sporulation density three (cucumber, zucchini) or four (tomato, pepper) days later. When isolates were grouped by genetic cluster, significant differences in virulence were observed on cucumber and zucchini, with isolates belonging to genetic cluster five causing larger lesions than isolates from genetic cluster six. On tomato, no significant differences were observed for isolates grouped by genetic cluster, but isolates from vegetable crops were generally more virulent than isolates from tropical hosts. Isolates from fabaceous hosts sporulated better on cucumber fruits than isolates from solanaceous hosts. Isolates from vegetable hosts sporulated better on zucchini than isolates from tropical hosts. No significant differences in lesion diameter were noted on pepper when isolates were grouped by host family of origin or genetic cluster, but differences in pathogen sporulation were apparent by host family. Our findings suggest that isolate characteristics such as host family of origin and genetic cluster membership may be used to guide initial isolate selection for cucurbit fruit resistance screening. Final isolate selection should incorporate the phenotypic and genetic diversity of P. capsici, including isolates with differing virulence to the host organ of interest.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhytophthora capsici 3acucumbers 3afruits 3agenetic variation 3ahosts 3apathogens 3apepper 3aplant rots 3arelative humidity 3aroots 3ascreening 3asporulation 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3avegetable crops 3avirulence 3azucchini1 aQuesada-Ocampo, Lina M.1 aHausbeck, Mary K.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2012 Feb., v. 132, no. 2 p.281-296dSpringer-Verlagx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-011-9873-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245018900167520128000356592002801636650002601664650002401690650001601714650001301730650001901743650001401762650001401776650002001790650001301810650002801823700002701851700002301878700002201901700002701923773011901950856007702069852000902146655001202155IND60702978820221117224635.0200719e20191228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070297882DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110100382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHambrook, Jacob  R.10aBiomphalaria glabrata Granulin Increases Resistance to Schistosoma mansoni Infection in Several Biomphalaria Species and Induces the Production of Reactive Oxygen Species by Haemocytes  aGastropod molluscs, which have co-evolved with parasitic digenean trematodes for millions of years, utilize circulating heamocytes as the primary method of containing and killing these invading parasites. In order to do so, they must generate suitable amounts of haemocytes that are properly armed to kill parasitic worms. One method by which they generate the haemocytes required to initiate the appropriate cell mediated immune response is via the production and post-translational processing of granulins. Granulins are an evolutionarily conserved family of growth factors present in the majority of eukaryotic life forms. In their pro-granulin form, they can elicit cellular replication and differentiation. The pro-granulins can be further processed by elastase to generate smaller granulin fragments that have been shown to functionally differ from the pro-granulin precursor. In this study, we demonstrate that in vivo addition of Biomphalaria glabrata pro-granulin (BgGRN) can reduce Schistosoma mansoni infection success in numerous Biomphalaria sp. when challenged with different S. mansoni strains.

In this work, silk yarn which was pretreated with a microcrystalline chitosan as well as a polydopamine, followed by dyeing with the P. macarthurii extract provided better depth of shade (K/S) and also gave better fastness to light and washing than the untreated dyed silk yarn. In addition, it was found that simultaneous mordanting with copper sulfate exhibited better fastness to light compared with the other samples. Post-mordanting silk yarn with a bio-mordant solution from Memecylon scutellatum leaves or alum gave good light and wash fastness of the resultant dyed yarn compared with the untreated dyed silk yarn. Moreover, the dyed silk yarn with this extract showed antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum and Candida albicans.  aThis research was partially supported by the new strategic research (P2P) project, Walailak University, Thailand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aCandida albicans 3aMemecylon 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aPtychosperma 3aalum 3aantifungal properties 3achitosan 3acopper sulfate 3afabrics 3aflavonoids 3apericarp 3asilk 0aPtychosperma macarthurii 0asilk dyeing 0amicrocrystalline chitosan 0amordants 0apolydopamine1 aWisessombat, Sueptrakool0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2021 Feb. 1, v. 112, no. 2 p.207-215dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2020.17321823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002300175245007900198300001400277520096800291592002801259650001301287650003001300650002001330650001801350650001301368650001801381650001601399650002501415650002101440650003201461650002501493700002501518700001901543700003001562773014901592856006801741856010001809990002301909852000901932655001201941IND60643224620221121020240.0190510e20091027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064322462DNAL7 a10.3791/16442doi7 aPMC31640582pmcid7 a198590552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConant, Carolyn G.10aPlatelet adhesion and aggregation under flow using microfluidic flow cells  ap. e1644.  aPlatelet aggregation occurs in response to vascular injury where the extracellular matrix below the endothelium has been exposed. The platelet adhesion cascade takes place in the presence of shear flow, a factor not accounted for in conventional (static) well-plate assays. This article reports on a platelet-aggregation assay utilizing a microfluidic well-plate format to emulate physiological shear flow conditions. Extracellular proteins, collagen I or von Willebrand factor are deposited within the microfluidic channel using active perfusion with a pneumatic pump. The matrix proteins are then washed with buffer and blocked to prepare the microfluidic channel for platelet interactions. Whole blood labeled with fluorescent dye is perfused through the channel at various flow rates in order to achieve platelet activation and aggregation. Inhibitors of platelet aggregation can be added prior to the flow cell experiment to generate IC50 dose response data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3ablood coagulation factors 3ablood platelets 3acell adhesion 3acollagen 3adose response 3aendothelium 3aextracellular matrix 3afluorescent dyes 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aplatelet aggregation1 aSchwartz, Michael A.1 aNevill, Tanner1 aIonescu-Zanetti, Cristian0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2009 Oct. 27, , no. 32 p.e1644-e1644dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/16443Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/1644/platelet-adhesion-aggregation-under-flow-using-microfluidic-flow  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011600170300001600286520100100302592002801303650002101331650001901352650001601371650002401387650001701411650004701428650001001475650001201485650003201497650001301529653001801542653001901560653001301579653001501592653002401607653002501631700002001656700002401676700002401700700002201724773008901746856005001835852000901885655001201894IND60791948420221120174337.0220902e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079194842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarttunen, Jenni10aNon-structural proteins P17 and P33 are involved in the assembly of the internal membrane-containing virus PRD1  ap. 225-233.  aBacteriophage PRD1, which has been studied intensively at the structural and functional levels, still has some gene products with unknown functions and certain aspects of the PRD1 assembly process have remained unsolved. In this study, we demonstrate that the phage-encoded non-structural proteins P17 and P33, either individually or together, complement the defect in a temperature-sensitive GroES mutant of Escherichia coli for host growth and PRD1 propagation. Confocal microscopy of fluorescent fusion proteins revealed co-localisation between P33 and P17 as well as between P33 and the host chaperonin GroEL. A fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assay demonstrated that the diffusion of the P33 fluorescent fusion protein was substantially slower in E. coli than theoretically calculated, presumably resulting from intermolecular interactions. Our results indicate that P33 and P17 function in procapsid assembly, possibly in association with the host chaperonin complex GroEL/GroES.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abacteriophages 3achaperonins 3aconfocal microscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence recovery after photobleaching 3agenes 3amutants 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3avirology 0aBacteriophage 0aMembrane virus 0aAssembly 0aChaperonin 0aFluorescent protein 0aProtein localisation1 aMäntynen, Sari1 aIhalainen, Teemu O.1 aBamford, Jaana K.H.1 aOksanen, Hanna M.0 tVirology.g2015 Aug., v. 482 p.225-233dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.049  aDNAL 7aarticle01897naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245005700162300001600219520106000235592002801295650001401323650001901337650001101356650001301367773016201380856008001542852000901622655001201631IND60480558420221119062251.0160128e20070201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048055842DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.73.2.1872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoli, Daniela12aA Rigorous Model for Spaceborne Linear Array Sensors  ap. 187-196.  a<p><i>A rigorous sensor model for the georeferencing of imagery from CCD linear array sensors with along-track stereo viewing is presented. The model is based on the classical collinearity equations, which are extended for the specific characteristics of the acquisition of CCD linear scanners. It includes the sensor position and attitude modeling with second-order piecewise polynomials depending on the acquisition time and a self-calibration for the correction of radial and decentering lens distortions, principal point(s) displacement, focal length(s) variation and CCD line(s) rotation in the focal plane. Using well-distributed GCPs and, additionally, Tie Points (TPs), the external orientation and self-calibration parameters, together with the TPs ground coordinates, are estimated in a least-square adjustment. In order to demonstrate the flexibility of the model, stereo images from pushbroom sensors with different characteristics have been oriented with sub-pixel accuracy in the checkpoints.

The results indicated that planting geometry which involved variations in both seed rate and spacing had significant positive effects on yield attributing factors as compared to planting with normal or double seed rate in 90 cm spaced rows. The planting geometry, viz, 30:90 cm significantly gave the highest yield (122.85 MT/ha) of sugarcane followed by 25:75 cm and 45:45 cm etc. This increase in yield was mainly brought about by significant increase in the number, girth and length of millable canes. Irrespective of planting geometry, the added dose of N increased the yield and yield related attributes, significantly. The effect of different treatments on juice quality was not well marked.Considering these results, workability of cultural operations and cost effectiveness, it is worthwhile to recommend that for obtaining higher productivity, sugarcane may be planted in paired rows, i.e. 30:90 cm row spacing.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3acanes 3acost effectiveness 3aexperimental design 3afield experimentation 3ageometry 3ajuice quality 3anitrogen 3aplanting 3aresearch institutions 3arow spacing 3aspring 3asugarcane 3ayields1 aVerma, R.

These materials were mixed with cement either without any treatment or after being extracted previously with a range of solvents (ranging from nonpolar to very polar). Other experiments were carried out in which extractives or calcium chloride were added to the cement paste. All lignocellulosic substrates have detrimental effects on cement setting, which is mostly seen by a delay in attaining the maximum temperature in the process. However, the addition of calcium chloride was able to overcome this disadvantage. Extraction of the substrates with some polar extraction agents before addition to the cement paste only slightly improved compatibility, and the addition of water-based extractives to a cement paste affects the setting much less than the lignocellulosic material by itself. Several thermal compatibility indices, including a new index proposed in this article, were calculated from data taken from temperature profiles, and conclusions are presented on the performance of the setting systems, as compared with a neat cement paste. In addition, comments are expressed on the level of accuracy offered by the indices applied in this study, and how such accuracy can be checked or improved by matching them to the physical properties of the wood-cement composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium chloride 3acork 3alignocellulose 3awood 3aEucalyptus globulus 3acement 3acuring (nonfood products) 3awood cement composites 3aQuercus robur 3atemperature 3aPinus pinaster 3aPortugal 0aphysical properties 0aPinus1 aCaldeira Jorge, Fernando1 aIrle, Mark1 aFerreira, José Maria0 tJournal of wood science.g2006 Aug., v. 52, no. 4 p.311-317dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-005-0774-z3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02383naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245011000173300001600283520091400299592002801213650001401241650002301255650001801278650000901296650001101305650003001316650002101346650003001367650001601397650001301413650001201426653002201438653001201460653002301472653002201495653002001517700001401537700001401551700001401565700001701579700001801596700001901614700001601633700001901649700001901668700001801687773008901705856005001794852000901844655001201853IND60791948520221120174439.0220902e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079194852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Tony Jianqiang,10aError-prone pcr-based mutagenesis strategy for rapidly generating high-yield influenza vaccine candidates  ap. 234-243.  aVaccination is the primary strategy for the prevention and control of influenza outbreaks. However, the manufacture of influenza vaccine requires a high-yield seed strain, and the conventional methods for generating such strains are time consuming. In this study, we developed a novel method to rapidly generate high-yield candidate vaccine strains by integrating error-prone PCR, site-directed mutagenesis strategies, and reverse genetics. We used this method to generate seed strains for the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and produced six high-yield candidate strains. We used a mouse model to assess the efficacy of two of the six candidate strains as a vaccine seed virus: both strains provided complete protection in mice against lethal challenge, thus validating our method. Results confirmed that the efficacy of these candidate vaccine seed strains was not affected by the yield-optimization procedure.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainfluenza 3ainfluenza vaccines 3amanufacturing 3amice 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areverse genetics 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3avaccination 3avirology 3aviruses 0aInfluenza A virus 0aVaccine 0aVaccine production 0aHigh-yield strain 0aError-prone PCR1 aWen, Feng1 aXu, Yifei1 aZhao, Nan1 aLong, Liping1 aSun, Hailiang1 aYang, Jialiang1 aCooley, Jim1 aTodd Pharr, G.1 aWebby, Richard1 aWan, Xiu-Feng0 tVirology.g2015 Aug., v. 482 p.234-243dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.03.051  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148245008800201300001800289520106400307592002801371596006501399596005901464650002801523650000901551650001101560650002401571650001301595650002001608650001101628650001601639650000901655651001001664700001501674700001601689700001601705773016201721856008301883852000901966655001201975IND60794435520221120084133.0220923e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079443552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-021-02149-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Meng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2422-832810aNonhomogeneous poisson process model of summer high temperature extremes over China  ap. 2649-2660.  aIn this study, nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) models arising from the extreme value theory have been fitted to summer high temperature extremes (HTEs) at 321 meteorological stations over China. The seasonality and six prominent atmospheric teleconnection patterns in Northern Hemisphere are incorporated in the NHPP models reflecting the non-stationarity of occurrence rate in Poisson process of HTEs. In addition, Poisson regression model has also been applied to link HTEs and these teleconnection patterns. The linkages of HTEs and teleconnection patterns have been identified in both NHPP modeling and Poisson regression. Composite maps of differences of 500-hPa geopotential height and wind fields in the positive and negative phases of teleconnection patterns are constructed to show the impacts of atmospheric circulation patterns on extreme heat events. The spatial pattern of the associated anticyclonic or cyclonic circulations with teleconnection patterns partly explains the spatial variability of the occurrences of summer HTEs over China.  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2020KF031cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  a31570423cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aatmospheric circulation 3aheat 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3asummer 3atemperature 3awind 3aChina1 aZhang, Han1 aZhang, Aidi1 aWang, Yueqi0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2022 Sept., v. 36, no. 9 p.2649-2660dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-021-02149-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01599naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011900158300001400277520056500291592002800856650001300884650000900897650001000906650001400916650001600930650001500946650001400961650001600975651001000991700001601001700001701017700001701034773010301051856007401154852000901228655001201237IND60621301320221118015608.0181116e200006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062130132DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029457452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, K.

Mapping such interactions proves useful for understanding disease regulations and discovering risk genes in genome-wide association studies. Some previous studies showed that machine learning methods, as computational alternatives to costly experimental approaches, performed well in predicting EPIs from local sequence and/or local epigenomic data. In particular, deep learning methods were demonstrated to outperform traditional machine learning methods, and using DNA sequence data alone could perform either better than or almost as well as only utilizing epigenomic data. However, most, if not all, of these previous studies were based on randomly splitting enhancer-promoter pairs as training, tuning, and test data, which has recently been pointed out to be problematic; due to multiple and duplicating/overlapping enhancers (and promoters) in enhancer-promoter pairs in EPI data, such random splitting does not lead to independent training, tuning, and test data, thus resulting in model over-fitting and over-estimating predictive performance. Here, after correcting this design issue, we extensively studied the performance of various deep learning models with local sequence and epigenomic data around enhancer-promoter pairs. Our results confirmed much lower performance using either sequence or epigenomic data alone, or both, than reported previously. We also demonstrated that local epigenomic features were more informative than local sequence data. Our results were based on an extensive exploration of many convolutional neural network (CNN) and feed-forward neural network (FNN) structures, and of gradient boosting as a representative of traditional machine learning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aartificial intelligence 3aepigenome 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3aneural networks 3anucleotide sequences 3aprediction 3arisk 3atranscription (genetics)1 aZhuang, Zhong 1 aPan, Wei 0 tGenes.g2019 Dec. 29, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110100413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01792naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245010100167300001600268520083200284592002801116653001301144653001201157653001501169653001601184653001801200653002101218700002101239773014301260856007801403852000901481655001201490IND60130573520221119055002.0151127e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013057352DNAL7 a10.3157/061.136.03012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZatwarnicki, Tadeusz12aA Revision of the nivea Group of the Shore-Fly Genus Ditrichophora Cresson (Diptera: Ephydridae)  ap. 199-215.  aSpecies of the nivea group (genus Ditrichophora Cresson) are revised.

Another Asian species, D. brunnicosa, previously placed in Diclasiopa, is transferred to this group (genus Ditrichophora) and is also reported from Mongolia. To facilitate identification of these rare species, we have included diagnoses of the tribe, genus, and species group and have also provided an annotated key to Holarctic genera of the tribe Discocerinini and to species of the nivea group within Ditrichophora.

The higher sulfur (S) content of HA in the anaerobic landfill leachate after a short stabilization time showed that the S released from the organic matter degradation was more easily stabilized under anaerobic conditions, which indicate that HA from anaerobic landfill leachate was more chemically reactive and played a more important role in mobilizing heavy metal, especially mercury, at early landfill stabilization times. However, the S content of HA from the semi-aerobic landfill increased over time, suggesting that more S was stabilized in HA as the landfill stabilization time was extended. The analytical results for the FTIR and NMR showed that the HA from the anaerobic landfill contained more aromatic groups, while HA from the semi-aerobic landfill had more oxygen-containing groups. The aromatic components of the HA from both the anaerobic and semi-aerobic landfills increased over time, suggesting that the maturity and humification degree of HA increased during the stabilization process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaerobic conditions 3aanaerobic conditions 3aelemental composition 3aheavy metals 3ahumic acids 3ahumification 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amercury 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asulfur 2aAerobiosis 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aHumic Substancesxanalysis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aRefuse Disposal 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 0aAerobic condition 0aHumic acid 0aLeachate 0aLandfill1 aYongxia, Hao1 aGuixiang, Liu1 aXin, Zhao1 aYoucai, Zhao0 tChemosphere.g2013 May, v. 91 p.1058-1063dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010400167520149600271592002801767650002101795650001901816650001301835650001901848650001901867650001901886650001501905650001701920650001101937650001701948653003101965653001901996653002002015653001202035653002102047700001802068700001802086700001702104700002002121700001602141700001402157773011302171856008502284852000902369655001202378IND60772373820221121010153.0220509e20220524xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077237382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4630112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Tiantian10aCore-shell MOFs-based composites of defect-functionalized for mixed-mode chromatographic separation  aThe micropores of the metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) endow with the advantages of size selectivity and large specific surface area, etc., but they limit their applications toward the control of diffusion and transport processes. Here, we report a strategy to prepare the hierarchical porous material, functional defect, which allows incorporation of L-Cysteine in the MOF by defect-loading. Silica microspheres were modified with these materials to form core-shell composites and used as mixed-mode stationary phases for chromatographic separations. Compared with the traditional MOFs-based stationary phase, it exhibited superior efficiency and selectivity for separation of various analytes and highlighted the role of defect of MOFs and function of L-Cysteine. In addition to the rapid separation of hydrophobic compounds, the stationary phase showed great potential in the separation of hydrophilic analytes, especially for separation of ten carbohydrates and eight sulfonamides. It showed excellent chromatographic reproducibility and stability, and the repeatability of preparation was investigated by relative standard deviations of retention time and/or column efficiency of objective compounds, which was among different batches less than 1.81%. This demonstration provided deep understanding of separation mechanism between MOF-based composites with functional defect and analytes, and stimulated the wide applications of such defective MOFs complexes in separations and analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical species 3achromatography 3acysteine 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicroparticles 3amicropores 3aporous media 3asilica 3asurface area 0aChromatographic separation 0aDefective MOFs 0aMesoporous MOFs 0aMOF-919 0aStationary phase1 aWang, Licheng1 aZhang, Haixia1 aLu, Xiaofeng1 aLiang, Xiaojing1 aWang, Shuai1 aGuo, Yong0 tJournal of chromatography.g2022 May 24, v. 1671 p.463011-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2022.4630113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245013000160300001600290520148400306592002801790650002101818650001201839650001601851650001301867650002101880650001001901650001801911650002301929650000901952650002001961650001701981650002801998650002602026650002102052653003502073653004502108653001302153653001202166700001602178700001402194700001602208700001302224700001902237700001502256700001902271700001902290773014602309856008302455852000902538655001202547IND60556374920221123015835.0181120e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055637492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.1602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Li10aLong-term fructose consumption prolongs hepatic stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 activity independent of upstream regulation in rats  ap. 643-648.  aDietary fructose is considered a risk factor for metabolic disorders, such as fatty liver disease. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of fructose is not well characterized. We investigated the hepatic expression of key regulatory genes related to lipid metabolism following fructose feeding under well-defined conditions. Rats were fed standard chow supplemented with 10% w/v fructose solution for 5 weeks, and killed after chow-fasting and fructose withdrawal (fasting) or chow-fasting and continued fructose (fructose alone) for 14 h. Hepatic deposition of triglycerides was found in rats from both groups. As expected, fructose alone increased mRNA levels of lipogenesis-related genes and correspondingly decreased mRNA levels of lipid oxidative genes in the liver. Interesting, hepatic levels of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)1 mRNA remained elevated under fructose withdrawn conditions, although expression levels of other genes, including two key transcription factors (carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c) fell to normal levels, indicating that long-term fructose intake increased SCD1 activity, independent of upstream regulatory genes, such as ChREBP and SREBP-1c. In conclusion, SCD1 overexpression in fatty liver disease is not affected by fasting after long-term fructose consumption in rats. Regulation of SCD1 plays an important role in fructose-induced hepatic steatosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding proteins 3afasting 3afatty liver 3afructose 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolic diseases 3arats 3aregulator genes 3arisk factors 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atranscription factors 3atriacylglycerols 0aStearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)1 0aNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 0aFructose 0aFasting1 aWang, Shang1 aYao, Ling1 aLi, Jin-xiu1 aMa, Peng1 aJiang, Li-rong1 aKe, Da-zhi1 aPan, Yong-quan1 aWang, Jian-wei0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Oct. 28, v. 479, no. 4 p.643-648dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.1603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02270naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245008400210300001600294500002000310520111700330592002801447650002101475650001201496650001901508650001301527650002501540650001501565650001701580650002801597650002401625650001501649650001601664650001301680773011201693856008201805852000901887655001201896IND60600064320221118030347.0220818e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060006432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10144-018-0612-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalanson, George P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9527-008610aIntraspecific variability may not compensate for increasing climatic volatility  ap. 287-295.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe role of intraspecific variability is being examined to improve predictions of responses to climate change or invasions and in research on diversity. Simultaneously, the probability and implications of increased high‐frequency climate variability have been raised. An agent based model simulated two species on an environmental gradient representing an alpine treeline; a trend in its volatility was added. The species have different levels of variability, and each individual has further unique heterogeneity. Environmental volatility and individual heterogeneity were based on tree ring data from Pinus albicaulis. Simulations show that increasing volatility leads to population declines, including extinctions, and to sharper ecotones, and this impact is only slightly lessened by higher heterogeneity. Some simulation runs reveal an unanticipated selection for greater individual variability when volatility creates strong negative anomalies that fall short of extinction events. Increasing volatility can have significant ecological impacts because negative anomalies are not balanced by positive ones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus albicaulis 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aecotones 3aenvironmental impact 3aextinction 3agrowth rings 3aintraspecific variation 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3aprobability 3atreeline0 tPopulation ecology.g2018 July, v. 60, no. 3 p.287-295dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl3871701x1438-38967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-018-0612-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010000160300001200260520104100272592002801313650001401341650002001355650002001375650001201395650002101407650001301428650001901441650002601460650002601486650001401512651001201526700001801538700001801556773009901574856007401673852000901747655001201756IND60621301520221118015544.0181116e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062130152DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029955762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWayagari, J.

Random and purposive samples of seventy and forty-five farmers respectively were interviewed for this study in Jigawa State. Rapid Rural Appraisal (RRA) technique and tested structured questionnaires were used for data collection. None of the farmers has discontinued or ceased to use the new package after previously adopting it. Ninety-nine pre cent of the “non-adopters” (from the previous study) have also adopted the package. This is an indication that 99 per cent of the sugarcane farmers had adopted the new package within three years of release in the state. Economic motive was the most significant factor that influenced rapid adoption of the package.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adisease control 3afarmers 3afertilizer rates 3aplanting 3aquestionnaires 3arapid rural appraisal 3aresearch institutions 3asugarcane 3aNigeria1 aMisari, S.

Recent studies have shown that humoral cross-reactivity of the CoVs, particularly of OC43, is focused on the S2 region of the Spike protein. Due to efforts utilizing CoV S2 regions to produce a cross-CoV vaccine, we wished to assess SARS-CoV-2 S2 reactivity in children with KD and assess if cardiac involvement in KD correlated with S2 CoV antibody targeting. The presence of cross-reactivity does not distinguish KD from febrile controls and does not correlate with cardiac involvement in KD. These findings support that, in relation to cardiac vascular inflammation, vaccines targeting the S2 region appear to be a safe approach, but there is disparity in the ability of CoV species to raise cross-reactive S2 targeted antibodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aantibodies 3across reaction 3ainflammation 3avaccines 3avirology 0aKawasaki disease 0aMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aCoronavirus 0aCross-immunity 0aCoronary aneurysms1 aChang, Arthur J.1 aWelliver, R.

There is a relatively large population in eastern North America, where it occurs mostly throughout the Appalachian Mountains and reaches its northernmost extent in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada. The ability to detect this species, and thus determine its habitat requirements, is critical for understanding how it might be affected by human-induced environmental degradation. Maximum entropy modelling with MaxEnt was used to predict the distribution of suitable habitat for this species in Nova Scotia using 62 presence locations, 1405 pseudo-absence locations and four environmental covariates: depth to water table (a proxy for relative soil moisture), distance to the coast and mean annual temperature and precipitation. Our predictive maps identify important habitat features and areas of high suitability in Nova Scotia with an area under the curve value of 0·85. The predicted distribution of this lichen was most affected by temperature. This study elucidates locations as well as species-habitat relationships for F. leucosticta, providing land managers with baseline data that can aid in the discovery of additional populations and provide a better understanding of its ecological requirements which will support the development of sound conservation strategies for this rare lichen.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aenvironmental degradation 3ahabitats 3alichens 3amodels 3asoil water 3atemperature 3awater table 3aAppalachian region 3aNew Brunswick 3aNova Scotia 0aconservation 0acyanolichen 0aMaxEnt 0ararity 0aSDM 0atertiary relic hotspots1 aCameron, Robert,1 aMCMULLIN, R.

In this study, we investigated microbiota from the colonic mucosa and content in healthy and PED piglets. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to identify inter-group differences. Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the top four affected phyla. The proportion of Proteobacteria was higher in infected than in healthy piglets, and the opposite was observed for Bacteroidetes (more than four-fold higher in the healthy group). In the infected group, Fusobacterium accounted for 36.56% and 21.61% in the colonic mucosa and contents, respectively, while in the healthy group, they comprised 22.53% and 12.67%, respectively. The percentage of Lactobacillus in healthy colons (15.63%) was considerably higher than that in the disease group (<10%). In both the colonic mucosa and contents, functional enrichment differed significantly between healthy and diseased groups. Overall, infection with the PED virus increased the proportion of harmful bacteria and decreased the proportion of beneficial bacteria in the colons of piglets. Targeting intestinal microbiota could be a promising method for PED prevention, thus opening new avenues for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aFusobacterium 3aLactobacillus 3aPorcine epidemic diarrhea virus 3aProteobacteria 3abeneficial microorganisms 3adiarrhea 3afinancial economics 3agastrointestinal diseases 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amucosa 3apiglets 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asuckling1 aDong, Wanting 1 aDing, Yaqun 1 aDing, Xiangdong 1 aZhang, Qin 1 aJiang, Li 0 tGenes.g2019 Dec. 30, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes110100443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02349naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245006100163300001600224520094400240592002801184650001201212650001901224650001201243650003501255650001101290650001001301650001901311650000901330650001901339650001901358650001401377650002201391650002501413650001801438650002301456650001501479700001701494700001201511700001701523700001401540700001601554700001601570700001801586773016201604856008001766852000901846655001201855IND60480558920221119062105.0160128e20070301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048055892DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.73.3.3192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaoling10aLUCC Impact on Sediment Loads in Subtropical Rainy Areas  ap. 319-327.  a<p><i>In this paper, we evaluate the impacts of land-use/cover changes (LUCC) on sediment loads at the outlets of five sub-watersheds of the Poyang Lake watershed by integrating remote sensing and GIS with statistical analysis. The intensively farmed watershed is characterized by a mountainous and hilly topography and a rainy climate. The primary goal of this paper is to help a better understanding of land-use/cover change and its driving forces. We discuss spatio-temporal variations in rainfall and sediment loads and identify factors contributing to those variations, analyze the comprehensive impacts of land-use/cover change on changing climate and human activities, and conclude that the changing rates of forest cover and climate regimes are primary factors for sediment discharges in the Poyang Lake watershed. Our results suggest that the eco-system still have large capacities to support human activities in the area.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3alakes 3apollution load 3arain 3aremote sensing 3asediment yield 3asediments 3aspatial variation 3astatistical analysis 3asubwatersheds 3atemporal variation 3atopography1 aBao, Shuming1 aLi, Hui1 aCai, Xiaobin1 aGuo, Peng1 aWu, Zhongyi1 aFu, Weijuan1 aZhao, Hongmei0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2007 Mar. 1, v. 73, no. 3 p.319-327dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.73.3.3193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245012200212300001800334520127700352592002801629650002301657650005201680650001001732650002001742650001101762650001801773650002401791650001301815650002001828650001601848651001001864700002601874773016201900856008302062852000902145655001202154IND60794436220221122155821.0220923e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079443622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-021-02166-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBriz-Redón, Álvaro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7976-353410aOn the association between COVID-19 vaccination levels and incidence and lethality rates at a regional scale in Spain  ap. 2941-2948.  aThe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to the deepest global health and economic crisis of the current century. This dramatic situation has forced the public health authorities and pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Currently, almost 80% of the population are vaccinated with the required number of doses in Spain. Thus, in this paper, COVID-19 incidence and lethality rates are analyzed through a segmented spatio-temporal regression model that allows studying if there is an association between a certain vaccination level and a change (in mean) in either the incidence or the lethality rates. Spatial dependency is included by considering the Besag–York–Mollié model, whereas natural cubic splines are used for capturing the temporal structure of the data. Lagged effects between the exposure and the outcome are also taken into account. The results suggest that COVID-19 vaccination has not allowed yet (as of September 2021) to observe a consistent reduction in incidence levels at a regional scale in Spain. In contrast, the lethality rates have displayed a declining tendency which has associated with vaccination levels above 50%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3adeath 3aeconomic crises 3amodels 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3aresearch 3arisk assessment 3avaccination 3aSpain1 aSerrano-Aroca, Ángel0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2022 Sept., v. 36, no. 9 p.2941-2948dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-021-02166-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245007500162520154200237592002801779650002801807650002401835650001101859650001601870650002101886650001901907650001901926650001501945650002401960650001301984650001501997650001602012653003502028653001302063653000902076653002002085653002602105700001502131700001402146700001802160700001802178700001702196700001602213773012102229856008502350852000902435655001202444IND60687886420221119065912.0200809e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068788642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1141662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Pan10aRhodopseudomonas sphaeroides treating mesosulfuron-methyl waste-water  aThe soybean processing wastewater (SPW) supplementation to facilitate the simultaneously treatment (SPW and mesosulfuron-methyl) of wastewater and production of biological substances by Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides (R. sphaeroides) was discussed. Compared with the control group, with the addition of SPW, mesosulfuron-methyl was removed, and the yields of single-cell proteins, carotenoids, and bacteriochlorophyll were increased. In the 3 mg/L dose group, the mesosulfuron-methyl removal rate reached 97% after 5 days. Molecular analysis revealed that mesosulfuron-methyl exhibited induction effects on expression of the cpm gene and regulation effects on the synthesis of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450) by activating HKs gene in TCS signal transduction pathway. For R. sphaeroides, this induction process required 1 day. The synthesis of P450 occurred 1 day after inoculation. Prior to expressing cpm gene and synthesizing P450, R. sphaeroides need a period of time to adapt to external mesosulfuron-methyl stimulation. However, the R. sphaeroides growth could not be maintained for more than 1 day due to the lack of organic matter in the raw wastewater. The SPW supplementation provided a sufficient carbon source in four groups with added SPW. After 5 days, R. sphaeroides became the dominant microflora in the wastewater. This new method could complete the treatment of mixed wastewater, the increased of biological substances output and the reuse of wastewater and R. sphaeroides cells as resources at the same time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3abacteriochlorophyll 3acarbon 3acarotenoids 3acytochrome P-450 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic matter 3aoxygenases 3asignal transduction 3asoybeans 3awastewater 3awater reuse 0aMesosulfuron-methyl wastewater 0acpm gene 0aP450 0aR. sphaeroides 0aBiological substances1 aLiu, Yuxin1 aSong, Xue1 aWang, Yanling1 aSheng, Luying1 aWang, Haimei1 aZhang, Ying0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 July, v. 262 p.114166-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1141663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245007300164300001800237520148300255592002801738650003801766650001601804650001301820650001001833650001701843650001601860700002401876700002001900700002001920773010501940856007502045852000902120655001202129IND60577728220180731000000.0170810e20120626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057772822DNAL7 a10.1021/ma300622k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoucher, Virginie M.10aEnthalpy Recovery in Nanometer to Micrometer Thick Polystyrene Films  ap. 5296-5306.  aThe physical aging of polystyrene (PS) free-standing films has been investigated as a function of the films thickness, ranging from several micrometers to tens of nanometers. In this range of thicknesses, unchanged segmental dynamics in comparison to the bulk was previously reported. This study has been carried out through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), by following the enthalpy recovery to monitor the physical aging process at different temperatures. The temperature marking the onset of nonequilibrium effects, that is the onset of the glass transtion temperature, Tgᵒⁿ, was also assessed, at different cooling rates. An acceleration of the physical aging process, and consequently a depression of Tgᵒⁿ, is found with decreasing the films thickness, already for thicknesses in the micrometer range. Moreover, the onset of nonequilibrium effects is shown to be cooling rate dependent, this being more pronounced when the PS films get thinner. The thickness effects on the typical signatures of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the films, namely their physical aging and Tgᵒⁿ, can be well accounted for by assuming an equilibration mechanism based on volume holes diffusion toward the interfaces of the films. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient obtained within this framework is found to crossover from Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann (VFT) to Arrhenius when decreasing the temperature. The implications of these results are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adiffusivity 3aenthalpy 3aglass 3apolystyrenes 3atemperature1 aCangialosi, Daniele1 aAlegría, Angel1 aColmenero, Juan0 tMacromolecules.g2012 June 26, v. 45, no. 12 p.5296-5306dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma300622k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03117naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002700149245012700176520182000303592002802123650001302151650002402164650002002188650001702208650001702225650001402242650001102256650001302267650001302280650001702293653001202310653001902322653001702341653002402358653002002382700002402402700001902426700002402445700002702469773009402496856008402590852000902674655001202683IND60723367120221119124923.0210423e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072336712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1051162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlom, Stephanie S.A.H.10aUnder pressure: Nudging increases healthy food choice in a virtual reality supermarket, irrespective of system 1 reasoning  aPrevious research has shown that nudging can effectively support people's healthy food choices. Yet, to date knowledge about the psychological premises of nudging is limited, highlighting the need for closer scrutiny to determine how and when nudging is most effective. In the current study, we assessed whether the presumed effect of nudging on healthy food choice is enhanced under time pressure, a condition probing alleged system 1 reasoning. Food choice was studied in a realistic virtual reality supermarket where healthier alternatives were nudged by making them more salient. We additionally explored possible differences in decision-making experiences related to nudging or time pressure. The study took place at a science festival where visitors could decide to participate in a study. Participants (n = 99) had to purchase four products, each from a different product category that was provided on a shopping list. In the nudging condition, one healthier option within each product category was nudged by making it more salient. While a main effect of nudging was found, showing in increased healthy food choices, this effect was not further qualified by time pressure, suggesting that the effectiveness of nudging is not enhanced under system 1 conditions. Relatedly, people who were and who were not aware of the nudges showed similar effects of nudging on healthy food choice. Furthermore, no differences in decision-making experiences showed, suggesting that people have similar experiences regarding impulsive and reflective decision-making irrespective of whether they are being nudged or put under time pressure. All in all, our findings are in line with recent viewpoints on the premises of nudges, suggesting that alleged system 1 conditions are not a prerequisite for nudging to be effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3acomputer simulation 3adecision making 3afood choices 3ahealthy diet 3aknowledge 3apeople 3apressure 3aresearch 3asupermarkets 0aNudging 0aHealthy eating 0aFood choices 0aVirtual supermarket 0aDual processing1 aGillebaart, Marleen1 aDe Boer, Femke1 avan der Laan, Nynke1 aDe Ridder, Denise T.D.0 tAppetite.g2021 May 01, v. 160 p.105116-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1051163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245014500159300001600304520040200320592002800722650002400750650002700774650001800801650002200819650001600841650001200857650001400869650001900883650001000902650000900912650001200921653002300933653001000956653004200966653002701008653001701035700002001052700002401072700002101096700001901117700001901136773014001155856008001295852000901375655001201384IND60131741920221118031908.0151127e20121214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013174192DNAL7 a10.1638/2012-0045R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWynne, Janna10aPreshipment testing success: resolution of a nasal sinus granuloma in a captive koala (phascolarctos cinereus) caused by cryptococcus gattii  ap. 939-942.  aA 3-yr-old female koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) was diagnosed with a nasal sinus granuloma caused by Cryptococcus gattii after a pre-shipment examination revealed a latex cryptococcal agglutination titer of 1:512.

However, this approach can be limited by several factors such as field accessibility, financial cost, area size, climate, and public disapproval. We recommend the use of multiscale hyperspectral remote sensing to mitigate the disadvantages of traditional exploration techniques. The proposed workflow analyzes a possible target at different levels of spatial detail. This method is particularly beneficial in inaccessible and remote areas with little infrastructure, because it allows for a systematic, dense and generally noninvasive surveying. After a satellite regional reconnaissance, a target is characterized in more detail by plane-based hyperspectral mapping. Subsequently, Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS)-mounted hyperspectral sensors are deployed on selected regions of interest to provide a higher level of spatial detail. All hyperspectral data are corrected for radiometric and geometric distortions. End-member modeling and classification techniques are used for rapid and accurate lithological mapping. Validation is performed via field spectroscopy and portable XRF as well as laboratory geochemical and spectral analyses. The resulting spectral data products quickly provide relevant information on outcropping lithologies for the field teams. We show that the multiscale approach allows defining the promising areas that are further refined using RPAS-based hyperspectral imaging. We further argue that the addition of RPAS-based hyperspectral data can improve the detail of field mapping in mineral exploration, by bridging the resolution gap between airplane- and ground-based data. RPAS-based measurements can supplement and direct geological observation rapidly in the field and therefore allow better integration with in situ ground investigations. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach at the Lofdal Carbonatite Complex in Namibia, which has been previously subjected to rare earth elements exploration. The deposit is located in a remote environment and characterized by difficult terrain which limits ground surveys.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3acase studies 3aclimate 3ageophysics 3ahyperspectral imagery 3ainfrastructure 3alandscapes 3alithology 3amodels 3aradiometry 3arare earth elements 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asurveys 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3aNamibia1 aZimmermann, Robert 1 aLorenz, Sandra 1 aGloaguen, R.q(Richard),1 aNex, Paul  A.

Although numerous methods had been developed for the detection of Hb in red blood cells, analytical technology for the monitoring of low-abundance Hb in serum or plasma is still a challenge. Herein, persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) with strong near-infrared (NIR) emission character behaving as a label-free probe for the highly sensitive and selective detection of Hb were developed. Further studies revealed that the sensing mechanism should be attributed to the Hb-induced dynamic quenching process. Moreover, the nanoprobe showed high selectivity to Hb against the common existing substances in human serum and a linear response to Hb ranging from 1 to 50 nM with an extremely high limit of detection (LOD) of 0.13 nM. Finally, applicability of the proposed probe for the detection of Hb in human serum samples was validated.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPersistent luminescence 0aLabel-free probe 0aNear-infrared emission 0aHemoglobin detection 0aHuman serum sample1 aWang, Yuhui1 aJiang, Kai1 aSun, Shan1 aQian, Sihua1 aWu, Qiaoping1 aLin, Hengwei0 tTalanta.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 206dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2019.1202063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002000168245013000188300001400318500000900332520174200341592002802083650002102111650002302132650001602155700001702171700001802188700001902206773011902225852000902344856009802353655001202451991625458280742620221118042801.0191122e197701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790375632DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1977.0011183X001700010022x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAckerson, R.

Moench, cv. ‘RS671’) were monitored on both a seasonal and diurnal basis. The effects of differential soil water availability on leaf water potential components were examined in order to ascertain the differences in the water relations of these two species. Decreasing availability of soil water was responsible for decreased morning and afternoon leaf water potentials in sorghum and cotton. The magnitude of degression in leaf water potential was greater in cotton than in sorghum at equivalent soil water potentials. Decreasesin osmotic potentials maintained positive turgor in both species when sufficient soil water was available. However, as water stress increased, turgor potentials became zero due to the failure of osmotic potentials to decrease more than water potentials. Diurnal changes in water potential components were distinctly different for each species. Leaf water potentials of sorghum came into approximate equilibrium with soil water potential in the early morning, whereas leaf water potentials of cotton did not. Concomitant changes in leaf osmotic potentials on a diurnal basis resulted in specific trends of increasing turgor in sorghum, while anomalous fluctuations were evident in cotton leaf turgor potentials. The relationship between leaf water potential and relative water content was determined for each species. The change in relative water content per unit change in leaf water potential was greater in cotton than in sorghum. Drought tolerance of these two species appears to be dependent on species speciIic relationships in leat water potential components.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops1 aKrieg, D.

During a time of heightened negative affect, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on eating behaviours, and further elucidate the ways in which emotional eating is related to emotion dysregulation and impaired abilities to identify emotions (i.e. alexithymia). The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom (n = 136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19. We discuss how these findings should be applied, and recommendations for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoronavirus infections 3aappetite 3aeating habits 3aemotions 3apandemic 3apopulation 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAlexithymia 0aEmotion dysregulation 0aEmotional eating 0aPandemic 0aMediation1 aMantzios, Michail1 aEgan, Helen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7967-83131 aWallis, Deborah J.0 tAppetite.g2021 June 01, v. 161 p.105120-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1051203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02033naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245007000163300001600233520085400249592002801103650001801131650001101149650001401160650001501174650001201189650000901201650001401210650002101224653002101245653001001266653001801276653002301294653001001317700001901327700001801346700003001364773014001394856008001534852000901614655001201623IND60131742220221118031912.0151127e20121214xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013174222DNAL7 a10.1638/2012-0068R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcAloose, Denise10aMultilobular tumor of bone in an african wild dog (lycaon pictus)  ap. 950-952.  aA 13-mo-old, captive-born, female African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) was presented with a progressively enlarging, firm mass on the dorsum of the head.

L.10aEvaluation of cis-acting elements in the rubella virus subgenomic RNA that play a role in its translation  ap. 327-346.  aThe subgenomic (SG) mRNA of rubella virus (RUB) contains the structural protein open reading frame (SP-ORF) that is translated to produce the three virion structural proteins: capsid (C) and glycoproteins E2 and E1. RUB expression vectors have been developed that express heterologous genes from the SG RNA, including replicons which replace the SP-ORF with a heterologous gene, and these expression vectors are candidate vaccine vectors. In the related alphaviruses, translational enhancing elements have been identified in both the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the SG RNA and the N-terminal region of the C gene. To optimize expression from RUB vectors, both the 5′UTR of the SG RNA and the C gene were surveyed for translational enhancing elements using both plasmids and replicons expressing reporter genes from the SG RNA. In replicons, the entire 5′UTR was necessary for translation; interestingly, when plasmids were used the 5′UTR was dispensable for optimal translation. The RUB C gene contains a predicted long stem-loop starting 62 nts downstream from the initiation codon (SLL) that has a structure and stability similar to SL’s found in the C genes of two alphaviruses, Sindbis virus (SIN) and Semliki Forest virus, that have been shown to enhance translation of the SG RNA in infected cells. However, a series of fusions of various lengths of the N-terminus of the RUB C protein with reporter genes showed that the SLL had an attenuating effect on translation that was overcome by mutagenesis that destabilized the SLL or by adding downstream sequences of the C gene to the fusion. Thus, for optimal expression efficiency from RUB expression vectors, only the 5′UTR of the SG RNA is required. Further investigation of the differing effects of the SLL on RUB and alphavirus SG RNA translation revealed that the SIN and RUB SLLs could enhance translation when expressed from a SIN cytopathic replicon, but not when expressed from a plasmid, a RUB replicon, or a SIN noncytopathic replicon. Thus, the SLL only functions in a “cytopathic environment” in which cell translation has been altered.  aPublisher supplied data 3a5' untranslated regions 3aRubella virus 3aSemliki Forest virus 3aSindbis virus 3acapsid 3agene fusion 3aglycoproteins 3amutagenesis 3aopen reading frames 3aplasmids 3areplicon 3areporter genes 3astart codon 3astructural proteins 3atranslation (genetics) 3avaccines 3avirion1 aTzeng, W.-P.1 aFrey, T.

The goodness of fit of these models was compared by considering the mean squared error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination for nonlinear regression (pseudo-R2). The Baranyi model yielded the lowest MSE and highest pseudo-R2 values. Therefore, the Baranyi model was selected as the best primary model. Maximum specific growth rate (rmax) and lag phase duration (λ) obtained from the Baranyi model were fitted to secondary models namely, the Ratkowsky and Arrhenius models. High pseudo-R2 and low MSE values indicated that the Arrhenius model has a high goodness of fit to determine the effect of temperature on rmax. Observed number of Pseudomonas spp. on sliced mushrooms from independent experiments was compared with the predicted number of Pseudomonas spp. with the models used by considering the Bf and Af values. The Bf and Af values were found to be 0.974 and 1.036, respectively. The correlation between the observed and predicted number of Pseudomonas spp. was high. Mushroom spoilage was simulated as a function of temperature with the models used. The models used for Pseudomonas spp. growth can provide a fast and cost-effective alternative to traditional microbiological techniques to determine the effect of storage temperature on product shelf-life. The models can be used to evaluate the growth behaviour of Pseudomonas spp. on sliced mushroom, set limits for the quantitative detection of the microbial spoilage and assess product shelf-life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aPseudomonas 3acost effectiveness 3agrowth models 3amathematical models 3amushrooms 3ashelf life 3aspecific growth rate 3aspoilage 3astorage temperature 0aPredictive microbiology 0aMushroom spoilage 0aMicrobiological change 0aGrowth behaviour 0aShelf-life1 aOzdemir, Murat1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9025-30681 aMelikoglu, Mehmet0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2018 Feb. 02, v. 266 p.274-281dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2017.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02161naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006900148245013700217520082600354592002801180650001101208650002301219650001101242650001901253650001201272650002701284651001001311653002401321653002201345653002501367653002401392653002701416653001001443700002101453700001701474700001901491700003501510773011501545856008201660852000901742655001201751IND60761249620221122013438.0220315e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076124962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1021492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTwumasi, Martinson Ankrah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8703-710214aThe impact of credit constraint on artisanal fishers’ technical efficiency: Stochastic frontier and instrumental variable approach  aThis study investigated the effects of credit constraints on the technical efficiency (TE) of artisanal fishers in Ghana. Survey data was collected from two regions and applied using an instrumental variable (IV) approach to estimate the stochastic frontier of the sector. The study found evidence of inefficiency among fishers. This study identifies fishers’ years of fishing experience, education level, credit constraint, and off-farm income as the most important determinants of technical efficiency. Whiles credit constraint and off-fishing income had a detrimental effect on technical efficiency, years of fishing experience and education level help improve efficiency. The study provides several policies that can promote credit accessibility for the fishers; hence, improving household and national development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acredit 3aeducational status 3aincome 3amarine science 3asurveys 3atraditional technology 3aGhana 0aArtisanal fisheries 0aCredit constraint 0aTechnical efficiency 0aStochastic frontier 0aInstrumental variables 0aGhana1 aJiang, Yuansheng1 aFosu, Prince1 aAddai, Bismark1 aEssel, Charles Hackman Kwamena0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2022 Feb., v. 50 p.102149-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1021493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010100160500001400261520130400275592002801579650001501607650002801622650002201650650001801672650002301690650001201713651001101725700002201736700002301758700003101781700003501812700002801847700002501875700002201900773012101922856007302043852000902116655001202125IND60729480120221119163733.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072948012DNAL7 a10.3390/v130202422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires, Lucas  C.10aKnowledge of Zika Virus Transmission and Its Prevention among High-Risk Pregnant Women in Brazil  aNAL-light  aRecent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection highlight the urgent need to evaluate the efficacy of current public health measures to educate susceptible groups about how to prevent infection, modes of viral transmission, and consequences of infection. We performed a cross-sectional study in the city of Jundiaí, São-Paulo, from March 2016 to August 2017. In 315 high-risk pregnant women we evaluated the rate of ZIKV infection, knowledge of pathways of ZIKV transmission, and the use of protective measures. Data were analyzed and correlated with sociodemographic variables. The rate of ZIKV infection was 10.8%. ZIKV transmission by mosquitoes was the best-known means of virus acquisition, while transmission of ZIKV by sexual intercourse as well as mother–fetus transmission was known by less than half of the women. The use of insect repellent, reported by 53% of participants, was correlated with higher education and personal directives from health professionals. Condom use was reported by 19.5% of subjects. Improved strategies to increase awareness of ZIKV infection and its consequences, designed to appeal to specific, targeted populations, are clearly necessary to more accurately prevent the spread of this infection and diminish adverse consequences in the pregnant population.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZika virus 3across-sectional studies 3ainsect repellents 3apublic health 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 3aBrazil1 aDantas, Luiza  R.1 aWitkin, Steven S.,1 aBertozzi, Ana  Paula A.

We studied the relationship between forest fragment size and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) colonization, and the AMF spore communities in the rhizosphere of two congeneric Euphorbia species (native and exotic/invasive). We hypothesized that these fungal variables will differ with fragment size and species status, and predicted that (a) AMF and DSE colonization together with AMF spore abundance and diversity would be positively related to forest fragment size; (b) these relationships will differ between the exotic and the native species; and (c) there will be a negative relationship between forest fragment size and the availability of soil nutrients (NH4 +, NO3 −, and phosphorus). This study was performed in the eight randomly selected forest fragments (0.86–1000 ha), immersed in an agricultural matrix from the Chaquean region in central Argentina. AMF root colonization in the native and exotic species was similar, and was positively related with forest fragment size. Likewise, AMF spore diversity and spore abundance were higher in the larger fragments. While DSE root colonization in the native host was positively related with forest fragment size, DSE colonization in the exotic host showed no relationship. Soil nutrients contents were negatively related with forest fragment size. In addition, NH4 + and NO3 − were negatively correlated with AMF spores abundance and root colonization and with DSE colonization in the native species. The results observed in this study show how habitat fragmentation might affect the interaction between key soil components, such as rhizospheric plant-fungal symbiosis and nutrient availability. These environmental changes may have important consequences on plant community composition and nutrient dynamics in this fragmented landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia 3abotanical composition 3acorrelation 3aendophytes 3aforests 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alandscapes 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3aspores 3asymbiosis 3aArgentina1 aUrcelay, Carlos1 aGaletto, Leonardo0 tPlant ecology.g2012 Jan., v. 213, no. 1 p.155-165dSpringer-Verlagx1385-02377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-011-9966-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012700165520169000292592002801982650002402010650001702034650002202051650001202073650004302085650001902128650001502147650002302162650001602185651001802201700002402219773012902243856007402372852000902446655001202455IND60675932720221120135028.0191112e20191026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067593272DNAL7 a10.3390/rs112125072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, Kathryn  I.12aA Statistical Model for Estimating Midday NDVI from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 16 and 17  aThe newest version of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite series (GOES-16 and GOES-17) includes a near infrared band that allows for the calculation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at a 1 km at nadir spatial resolution every five minutes throughout the continental United States and every ten minutes for much of the western hemisphere. The usefulness of individual NDVI observations is limited due to the noise that remains even after cloud masks and data quality flags are applied, as much of this noise is negatively biased due to scattering within the atmosphere. Fortunately, high temporal resolution NDVI allows for the identification of consistent diurnal patterns. Here, we present a novel statistical model that utilizes this pattern, by fitting double exponential curves to the diurnal NDVI data, to provide a daily estimate of NDVI over forests that is less sensitive to noise by accounting for both random observation errors and atmospheric scattering biases. We fit this statistical model to 350 days of observations for fifteen deciduous broadleaf sites in the United States and compared the method to several simpler potential methods. Of the days 60% had more than ten observations and were able to be modeled via our methodology. Of the modeled days 72% produced daily NDVI estimates with <0.1 wide 95% confidence intervals. Of the modeled days 13% were able to provide a confident NDVI value even if there were less than five observations between 10:00&ndash;14:00. This methodology provides estimates for daily midday NDVI values with robust uncertainty estimates, even in the face of biased errors and missing midday observations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3adata quality 3adiurnal variation 3aforests 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3astatistical models 3auncertainty 3aUnited States1 aDietze, Michael  C.0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Oct. 26, v. 11, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs112125073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011200170300001600282520148700298592002801785650002501813650001101838650001901849650001001868650001801878650001301896650001401909650001301923650001401936650001301950650001001963650002601973650002001999650001202019650001002031653000802041653001102049653000802060653000802068653000702076653000802083653000802091653000902099653003402108653002102142653002802163653001902191653002502210700001802235700001702253773011402270856008602384852000902470655001202479IND60564228520221121021949.0190408e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056422852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsthana, Pooja10aSomatic embryogenesis from sepal explants in Sapindus trifoliatus, a plant valuable in herbal soap industry  ap. 228-235.  aSomatic embryogenesis and complete plant regeneration were achieved in callus cultures derived from sepal explants of Sapindus trifoliatus, an important and valuable tree used in saponin and herbal soap industry. Embryogenic calli were induced on MS medium containing 5.0mgl−1 2, 4-D and 0.1mgl−1 Kin. Explant orientation markedly influenced on somatic embryogenesis. The calli induced on medium supplemented with 2, 4-D and Kin showed the formation of whitish or greenish nodular embryogenic structure on MS basal medium containing l-glutamine. These nodular embryogenic structures gave rise to somatic embryos or secondary nodular embryogenic structures or both. Nodular embryogenic structures separated from embryogenic calli and transferred to MS medium containing 200mgl−1l-glutamine produced maximum number of globular, heart and cotyledonary stage somatic embryos. Histological studies have revealed the development of different stages of somatic embryos from nodular embryogenic structure. The embryogenic competence of the culture could be maintained by recurrent production of nodular embryogenic structures and somatic embryos. Somatic embryos were germinated and converted into plantlet on MS basal medium containing 2% sucrose. Plants propagated in vitro from somatic embryos were hardened and successfully established in field condition. The improved and promising regeneration method reported here for the S. trifoliatus may be valuable in herbal soap industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSapindus trifoliatus 3acallus 3acallus culture 3acalyx 3aculture media 3aexplants 3aglutamine 3aindustry 3aplantlets 3asaponins 3asoaps 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 3asucrose 3atrees 0aBAP 0a2, 4-D 0aKin 0aIAA 0aMS 0aNAA 0aPFD 0aPGRs 0aNodular embryogenic structure 0aMicropropagation 0aPlant growth regulators 0aSomatic embryo 0aSapindus trifoliatus1 aRai, Manoj K.1 aJaiswal, Uma0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2017 June, v. 100 p.228-235dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2017.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003000139245020100169500001400370520159900384592002801983650002302011650005202034650001602086650001902102650001402121650002202135650001402157650001702171650002602188650001302214700002202227700002302249773012102272856007302393852000902466655001202475IND60729480320221119163824.0210228e20210204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072948032DNAL7 a10.3390/v130202432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroyano-Hernáez, Paloma 10aEvolution of SARS-CoV-2 Envelope, Membrane, Nucleocapsid, and Spike Structural Proteins from the Beginning of the Pandemic to September 2020: A Global and Regional Approach by Epidemiological Week  aNAL-light  aMonitoring acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genetic diversity and emerging mutations in this ongoing pandemic is crucial for understanding its evolution and assuring the performance of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and therapies against coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study reports on the amino acid (aa) conservation degree and the global and regional temporal evolution by epidemiological week for each residue of the following four structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. All, 105,276 worldwide SARS-CoV-2 complete and partial sequences from 117 countries available in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) from 29 December 2019 to 12 September 2020 were downloaded and processed using an in-house bioinformatics tool. Despite the extremely high conservation of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins (>99%), all presented aa changes, i.e., 142 aa changes in 65 of the 75 envelope aa, 291 aa changes in 165 of the 222 membrane aa, 890 aa changes in 359 of the 419 nucleocapsid aa, and 2671 changes in 1132 of the 1273 spike aa. Mutations evolution differed across geographic regions and epidemiological weeks (epiweeks). The most prevalent aa changes were D614G (81.5%) in the spike protein, followed by the R203K and G204R combination (37%) in the nucleocapsid protein. The presented data provide insight into the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins during the pandemic and highlights local and worldwide emerging aa changes of interest for further SARS-CoV-2 structural and functional analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3ainfluenza 3anucleocapsid 3anucleocapsid proteins 3apandemic1 aReinosa, Roberto 1 aHolguín, África 0 tViruses.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 13, no. 2dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v130202433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01589naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012900168300001600297520058200313592002800895650002300923650002000946650001300966653002300979653002001002653003601022700001801058773012001076856008201196852000901278655001201287IND60603561120221119214113.0180716e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060356112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csda.2015.07.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunke, Benedikt10aNonparametric density estimation for multivariate bounded data using two non-negative multiplicative bias correction methods  ap. 148-162.  aTwo new multiplicative bias correction techniques for nonparametric multivariate density estimation in the context of positively supported data are proposed.

The effective cross-linking approach used in this work allowed construction of a set of stress-free molecular models with high conversion degree containing up to 35000 atoms. The generated structures were used to investigate the influence of model size, length of epoxy strands, and degree of cure on thermo-mechanical properties. The calculated densities, coefficients of thermal expansion, and glass transition temperatures of the systems are found to be in good agreement with experimental data. The computationally efficient static deformation approach we used to calculate elastic constants of the systems successfully compensated for the large scattering of the mechanical properties data due to nanoscopically small volume of simulation cells and allowed comparison of properties of similar polymeric networks having minor differences in structure or chemistry. However, some of the elastic constants obtained using this approach were found to be higher than in real macroscopic samples. This can be attributed to both finite-size effect and to the limitations of the static deformation approach to account for dynamic effects. The observed dependence of properties on system size, in this work, can be used to estimate the contribution of large-scale defects and relaxation events into macroscopic properties of the thermosetting materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3adeformation 3aepoxides 3aglass transition temperature 3amechanical properties 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3apolymers 3aprediction 3aresins 3athermal expansion1 aTsige, Mesfin1 aPatnaik, Soumya S.1 aMukhopadhyay, Sharmila M.,0 tMacromolecules.g2012 June 26, v. 45, no. 12 p.5307-5315dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma30075873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011000169300001600279500001500295520125000310592002801560650001601588650001901604650001401623650001301637650001801650650001301668650002201681650002601703650002201729650003101751650002001782650001801802650001601820650002001836650001501856650001101871650000701882650001301889650002301902650001701925650001001942653002401952653001801976653002201994653002102016653001302037653001702050653001302067700001602080700001702096773010902113856008602222852000902308655001202317IND60625196320221121004529.0190401e20190227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062519632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2018.11.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerkins, M.L.10aPossible contribution of impact injury at harvest to anthracnose expression in ripening avocado: A review  ap. 785-790.  a2019-12-06  aIn spite of burgeoning global demand for avocados, meeting consumer expectations for fruit quality is an ongoing challenge. Flesh bruising and body rots (principally anthracnose) are the main postharvest quality defects of avocado fruit. Mechanical damage causes bruising more so in ripening fruit than in hard unripe fruit. As a result, current emphasis is on careful handling of avocado fruit during later supply chain stages. However, emerging evidence suggests mechanical injury to unripe avocado fruit may trigger body rot development. Fruit responses to impact injury and their possible relevance to the pathogenicity of fungi which cause anthracnose in avocado (i.e. various Colletotrichum species) are presented here. Research on impact-induced physiological and biochemical changes that occur in avocado fruit appears to be limited and contradictory. The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. in avocado is influenced by tissue pH, lipoxygenase activity, and concentrations of reactive oxygen species, antifungal compounds, epicatechin and mineral nutrients. Understanding how these parameters change in response to impact is important for predicting disease development and providing appropriate postharvest handling advice to industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepicatechin 3aColletotrichum 3anutrients 3aindustry 3afruit quality 3aavocados 3amechanical damage 3apostharvest treatment 3aantifungal agents 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3astorage quality 3apathogenicity 3aanthracnose 3aenzyme activity 3aprediction 3afruits 3apH 3aripening 3aconsumer attitudes 3asupply chain 3afungi 0aPostharvest disease 0aFruit quality 0aMechanical damage 0aPersea americana 0aBruising 0alipoxygenase 0aBody rot1 aJoyce, D.C.1 aCoates, L.M.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Feb. 27, v. 246 p.785-790dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2018.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245011500172300001600287520131800303592002801621650001301649650001601662650001701678650001101695650001101706650002101717650002201738700001901760700002301779773011001802856008101912852000901993655001202002IND60449307320221119141454.0151030e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044930732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-015-0721-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandez, Sheela S.10aLinseed Oil Plasticizer Based Natural Rubber/Expandable Graphite Vulcanizates: Synthesis and Characterizations  ap. 526-533.  aNatural rubber (NR)/expandable graphite (EG) vulcanizates have been prepared using linseed oil plasticizer. The effects of linseed oil on the cure and mechanical properties of the NR/EG vulcanizates such as cure time, tensile strength, tear strength, modulus, elongation at break and swelling behavior have been studied to evaluate its suitability as plasticizer. Naphthenic oil was used as a reference. The linseed oil vulcanizates showed good processing behavior in terms of torques and scorch. With the incorporation of linseed oil there was improvement in the cure time and the mechanical properties of the EG/NR vulcanizates. 2–4 phr linseed oil in the NR/EG vulcanizates showed maximum tensile strengths. The higher value of cross link density at 4 phr for the linseed oil vulcanizates indicates better reinforcement of the EG–rubber matrix. The NR/EG/linseed oil vulcanizates exhibited higher thermal stability compared to NR/EG vulcanizates. The scanning electron micrographs revealed that incorporation of linseed oil up to 4 phr hinders the crack formation apparently with no major crack present in the NR/EG/LO composites minimizing the failure when compared to similar composites with naphthenic oil. The results indicate that the optimum level of linseed oil in the vulcanizates is 2–4 phr.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3alinseed oil 3aplasticizers 3arubber 3ascorch 3atensile strength 3athermal stability1 aKunchandy, Sam1 aGhosh, Swapankumar0 tJournal of polymers and the environment.g2015 Dec., v. 23, no. 4 p.526-533dSpringer USx1566-25437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10924-015-0721-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02937naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001500172245008300187300001600270520128400286592002801570650001901598650001201617650001201629650001301641650001101654650001101665650002001676650001701696650000901713650001101722650001101733650001301744650001901757650002401776650001401800650001901814650001701833650001201850650001301862650002101875650000901896650006801905650002801973650002502001650003102026650003002057651001002087700001902097700001602116700001702132773010202149856008702251852000902338655001202347IND50059996720221119201022.0141112e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005999672DNAL7 a230796872pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.09.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hua14aThe effects of the Qinghai–Tibet railway on heavy metals enrichment in soils  ap. 240-248.  aThe impact of land transportation on local soil environments is an important topic in environmental and ecological sciences. The rapid development of transportation infrastructure lends increasing importance to studies that identify and evaluate related heavy metal pollution. This paper discusses the effects of railways on soil heavy metal enrichments in the Tibetan plateau. At a representative area along the Haergai–Delingha railway, lead, cadmium, copper, zinc, chromium, nickel, cobalt, and vanadium were measured in 127 topsoil samples (0–10cm depth). The results indicate that railway transport has a significant effect on the concentration of Zn, Cd and Pb in the soil, with levels of enrichment ranging from no pollution to significant pollution. The affected area was within 20m of the railway. The soil at Delingha was the most contaminated soil with heavy metals, and the enrichment level of Cd in the soil was the highest along the Qinghai–Tibet railway. The horizontal distributions of the three heavy metals present different characteristics at different sampling sites, which may be due to discrepancies in terrain and vegetation types. Alkaline soils and guardrails along the railway might reduce the effect of soil pollution on local people and animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline soils 3aanimals 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aedaphic factors 3aheavy metals 3alead 3anickel 3apeople 3aplateaus 3apolluted soils 3arail transportation 3arailroads 3asoil pollution 3asoil texture 3atopsoil 3avanadium 3avegetation types 3azinc 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aRailroadsxstandards 2aSoilxanalysisxstandards. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 0aChina1 aWang, Zhaofeng1 aZhang, Yili1 aHu, Zhongjun0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 439 p.240-248dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.09.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005100099040001800150100002000168245005900188300001400247500000900261520125400270592002801524650001901552650001901571700001601590773011901606852000901725856009801734655001201832991625457960742620221118042720.0191122e197701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790375492DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1977.0011183X001700010008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosielle, A.

Harvest index and its components, plant weight and grain yield, and heading date, plant height, and 100-seed weight, were studied in 15 crosses among 30 oat (Arena sativa L.) lines. F₂-derived lines from each cross, parents, and 10 check cultivars were tested in hill plots in 3 experiments. One experiment contained Fooderived lines tested in both F₃ and F₄, enabling direct comparisons between the two generations. Dominance was not of major importance in the inheritance of heading date, plant height, and 100-seed weight. These traits showed small deviations of cross means from midparental values, little change of means and variances from F₃ to F₄, and no appreciable skewness. Plant weight and grain yield showed substantial dominance, as indicated by large deviations of cross means from mid-parental values, large reductions in means and variances from F₃ to F₄ and negative skewness. Harvest index showed primarily additive gene action, although this conclusion was complicated by the occurrence of negative skewness. Crosses between parents that were both high in harvest index tended to show small phenotypic variation for harvest index and other traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant genetics 3aplant breeding1 aFrey, K.

Similar, but much less pronounced ridges were observed on seeds with a shiny luster. The thick texture layer of dull seeds could be removed by scraping and with a sodium hydroxide solution. In dull green seeds the texture layer was translucid, the green color originating from a shiny green seed testa underneath which was visible through the texture layer. In dull brown and brownish-black seeds the texture layer contained a brown pigment which masked the green or green-black mottled color of the shiny seed testa underneath. We suggest that the texture layer originates from the inner pod membrane Which contracts, becomes fractionated as it dries, and partly adheres to the seed surface. Therefore the texture layer is a reticulated deposit and not an outgrowth from the seed testa. Only thin remnants of the pod membrane maybe observed on shiny seeds, the amount depending on the depth at which the fracture of the membrane occurs. Chemical analyses support these observations. Tests of the texture layer for presence of waxes and pectins were negative. A test for carbohydrates was positive with quantity of carbohydrates in the texture layer from dull seeds three to four times that in the texture layer from shiny seeds. The component monosaccharides included glucose, xylose, arabinose, and galactose, supporting histological observations that the texture layer is made up of remnant cell walls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3afield crops 3aplant morphology 3aplant anatomy1 aPoehlman, J.

Recent studies highlighted the importance of species traits for understanding biodiversity–stability relationships. The species with high growth rates (‘fast’ species) are expected to be less resistant to environmental stress but recover faster if disturbed; in contrast, the species with slow growth rates (‘slow’ species) can be more resistant but recover more slowly if disturbed. Such a ‘fast–slow’ trait continuum provides a new perspective for understanding community stability, but its validity has mainly been examined in plant communities. Here, we investigate how ‘fast–slow’ trait composition, together with species richness and environmental factors, regulate avian community stability at a continental scale. We used bird population records from the North American Breeding Bird Survey during 1988–2017 and defined avian community stability as the temporal invariability of total community biomass. We calculated species richness and the community–weighted mean (CWM) and functional diversity (FD) of four key life‐history traits, including body size, nestling period (i.e. period of egg incubation and young bird fledging), life span and clutch size (i.e. annual total number of eggs). Environmental factors included temperature, precipitation and leaf area index (LAI). Our analyses showed that avian community stability was mainly driven by the CWM of the ‘fast–slow’ trait. Communities dominated by ‘fast’ species (i.e. species with small body size, short nestling period and life span and large clutch size) were more stable than those dominated by ‘slow’ species (i.e. species with large body size, long nestling period and life span and small clutch size). Species richness and the FD of the ‘fast–slow’ trait explained much smaller proportions of variation in avian community stability. Temperature had direct positive effects on avian community stability, while precipitation and leaf area index affected community stability indirectly by influencing species richness and trait composition. Our study demonstrates that composition of ‘fast–slow’ traits is the major biotic driver of avian community stability over North America. Temperature is the most important abiotic factor, but its effect is weaker than that of the ‘fast–slow’ trait. An integrated framework combining ‘fast–slow’ trait composition and temperature is needed to understand the response of avian communities in a changing environment.

METHODS: Maize and pigeon pea were grown intercropped in pots, with varying degrees of root interaction in order to understand the relative importance of biochemical versus physical rhizospheric interactions. Following harvest, soils were separated into aggregate fractions using wet-sieving, and the nutrient content of all fractions was assessed. RESULTS: The proportion of macroaggregates and microaggregates increased by 52 and 111%, respectively, in the intercropping treatment compared to sole maize, which significantly increased organic P storage in the microaggregates of intercropped compared to sole maize (84 versus 29 mg P kg⁻¹, respectively). Biologically fixed N increased from 89% in the sole pigeon pea to 96% in the intercropped system. CONCLUSIONS: Intercropping maize with pigeon pea can have a significant and positive impact on soil structure as well as nutrient storage in these high P-sorbing soils. This is caused primarily by physical root contact and to a lesser degree by biochemical activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCajanus cajan 3aLixisols 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrop production 3aintercropping 3amicroaggregates 3anitrogen fixation 3anutrient content 3apeas 3aphosphorus 3apigeon peas 3asoil aggregation 3asoil fertility 3asoil structure 3aMalawi1 aBünemann, E.

Highly contrasted results are reported from one study to another suggesting that drivers of classification errors are still under-explored. We evaluated the performances of single-year Formosat-2 time series to discriminate tree species in temperate forests in France and investigated how predictions vary statistically and spatially across multiple years. Our objective was to better estimate the impact of spatial autocorrelation in the validation data on measurement accuracy and to understand which drivers in the time series are responsible for classification errors. The experiments were based on 10 Formosat-2 image time series irregularly acquired during the seasonal vegetation cycle from 2006 to 2014. Due to lot of clouds in the year 2006, an alternative 2006 time series using only cloud-free images has been added. Thirteen tree species were classified in each single-year dataset based on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The performances were assessed using a spatial leave-one-out cross validation (SLOO-CV) strategy, thereby guaranteeing full independence of the validation samples, and compared with standard non-spatial leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV). The results show relatively close statistical performances from one year to the next despite the differences between the annual time series. Good agreements between years were observed in monospecific tree plantations of broadleaf species versus high disparity in other forests composed of different species. A strong positive bias in the accuracy assessment (up to 0.4 of Overall Accuracy (OA)) was also found when spatial dependence in the validation data was not removed. Using the SLOO-CV approach, the average OA values per year ranged from 0.48 for 2006 to 0.60 for 2013, which satisfactorily represents the spatial instability of species prediction between years.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3adata collection 3aforest trees 3aplantations 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asupport vector machines 3atemperate forests 3atime series analysis 3aFrance1 aDejoux, Jean-François1 aFauvel, Mathieu1 aWillm, Jérôme1 aMonteil, Claude1 aSheeren, David0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Oct. 26, v. 11, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs112125123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02130naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245008500174300001400259520109400273592002801367650001801395650001501413650002201428650001401450653003101464653003601495653001701531653002401548653002401572773011301596856008601709852000901795655001201804IND60603561720221119214222.0180716e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060356172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSecui, Dinu Calin12aA new modified artificial bee colony algorithm for the economic dispatch problem  ap. 43-62.  aIn this paper a new modified artificial bee colony algorithm (MABC) is proposed to solve the economic dispatch problem by taking into account the valve-point effects, the emission pollutions and various operating constraints of the generating units. The MABC algorithm introduces a new relation to update the solutions within the search space, in order to increase the algorithm ability to avoid premature convergence and to find stable and high quality solutions. Moreover, to strengthen the MABC algorithm performance, it is endowed with a chaotic sequence generated by both a cat map and a logistic map. The MABC algorithm behavior is investigated for several combinations resulting from three generating modalities of the chaotic sequences and two selection schemes of the solutions. The performance of the MABC variants is tested on four systems having six units, thirteen units, forty units and fifty-two thermal generating units. The comparison of the results shows that the MABC variants have a better performance than the classical ABC algorithm and other optimization techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aalgorithms 3aeconomic dispatch 3aemissions 0aEconomic/emission dispatch 0aArtificial bee colony algorithm 0aChaotic maps 0aValve-point effects 0aTransmission losses0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 89 p.43-62dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2014.09.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245010700177300001600284520130500300592002801605650001401633650002501647650003501672650001501707650001701722650001901739650000701758650001501765653001401780653002001794653001501814653001301829653002301842700002001865773010501885856008701990852000902077655001202086IND60564229120221121033617.0181015e20170505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056422912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Costa, J.I.10aEffect of surfactant loading and type upon the sorption capacity of organobentonite towards pyrogallol  ap. 676-685.  aIn this work, the bentonite surface nature was modified by adsorbing the cationic surfactants HexaDecylTriMethylAmmonium bromide (HDTMA), DoDecylTriMethylAmmonium bromide (DDTMA) and BenzylTriMethylAmmonium bromide (BTMA), and the organobentonites were designated as OBHDTMA, OBDDTMA and OBBTMA. The bentonite capacity for sorbing pyrogallol was negligible; however, it was considerably enhanced by the modification with the surfactant since the sorption capacity of OBHDTMA was 45 times higher than that of bentonite. The sorption capacity of organobentonites towards pyrogallol decreased as follows: OBHDTMA>OBDDTMA>OBBTMA. The capacity of OBHDTMA varied somewhat in the pH range of 3–7 but reduced considerably when the pH was raised from 7 to 9. The small capacity observed at pH=9 was due to the pyrogallol dissociation, which reduced the pyrogallol affinity for the organic phase of OBHDTMA. The pyrogallol was sorbed on OBHDTMA at pH=7 and then desorbed at pH 7 or 9. The desorption was irreversible and reversible when the desorbing solution pH was 7 and 9, respectively. The capacity of OBHDTMA was linearly increased by raising HDTMA loading; therefore, the pyrogallol sorption on OBHDTMA was due to a partition mechanism attributed to hydrophobic and organophilic interactions at pH≤7.  aPublisher supplied data 3abentonite 3acationic surfactants 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adesorption 3adissociation 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3apyrogallol 0aBentonite 0aOrganobentonite 0aPyrogallol 0aSorption 0aSurfactant loading1 aLeyva-Ramos, R.0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 May 05, v. 520 p.676-685dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245011600162300001800278520156900296592002801865650001501893650001801908650002101926650003001947650004901977650002202026650001302048650001802061650001302079650002102092650001102113650001402124650001702138650001502155650001502170650001902185650001002204700002702214700002302241700002202264700002702286773010502313856007502418852000902493655001202502IND60577729720180713000000.0170810e20120626xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057772972DNAL7 a10.1021/ma30080642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalevée, Jacques,10aPhotosensitized Formation of Phosphorus-Centered Radicals: Application to the Design of Photoinitiating Systems  ap. 5032-5039.  aThe processes involved in the photosensitized decomposition of phosphorus-containing compounds in the presence of a photoinitiator PI were investigated and characterized by laser flash photolysis, electron spin resonance, and molecular modeling (density functional theory calculations). They lie on (i) a photoinitiator/phosphorus-containing compound electron transfer from phosphinites a, b and phosphites c, leading to a phosphoniumyl radical ion R₃P•⁺ or a photoinitiator/phosphorus-containing compound hydrogen abstraction reaction from labile P–H bonds in phosphine oxides d, phosphonates e, and trialkylphosphine salts f, g and (ii) the subsequent production of phosphorus centered radicals P• in a–e and a radical ion P•⁺ in f, g. The interaction rate constants for the key processes (photoinitiator/phosphorus-containing compound, alkoxyl radical/phosphorus-containing compound, and peroxyl radical/phosphorus-containing compound), the associated transient absorption, and electron spin resonance–spin trapping spectra were determined. The recorded acrylate polymerization profiles show that the photoinitiator/phosphorus-containing compound (a–g) systems are often efficient. Compared to reference systems, they can lead, in some cases (with benzophenone or a thiopyrylium salt as photoinitiator), to similar or even better polymerization rates. The cationic photopolymerization of epoxides was also feasible with f, g, thereby demonstrating that photoinitiator/f (or g) couples behave as dual radical/cationic photoinitiating systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abenzophenones 3achemical bonding 3adensity functional theory 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aelectron transfer 3aepoxides 3afree radicals 3ahydrogen 3amolecular models 3aoxides 3aphosphine 3aphosphonates 3aphosphorus 3aphotolysis 3apolymerization 3asalts1 aMorlet-Savary, Fabrice1 aTehfe, Mohamad Ali1 aGraff, Bernadette1 aFouassier, Jean Pierre0 tMacromolecules.g2012 June 26, v. 45, no. 12 p.5032-5039dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma30080643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011100176300001600287520105200303592002801355650002701383650002301410650001501433650002601448650001301474650001201487650002401499650002201523650001201545650002301557650002401580650001301604650001201617650001501629650001501644650001401659650002301673650001801696650001101714650001101725650001701736650002101753650002001774653001901794653002101813653002301834653002201857653002301879700001901902700001901921700002001940700001801960700001701978700002001995773010502015856008702120852000902207655001202216IND60564229220221121033751.0181015e20170505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056422922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.02.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYee, Maxine Swee-Li10aEnhanced marine antifouling performance of silver-titania nanotube composites from hydrothermal processing  ap. 701-711.  aMarine fouling is an age-old problem which continues to plague the maritime industry. The fouling process progresses from an initial formation of bacterial biofilm on unprotected surfaces. Silver is a well-known antimicrobial agent which is well-tolerated by mammals, while titania nanotubes have enhanced properties due to a greater specific surface area on the inner and outer surfaces of the tubular structure. A novel 2-step hydrothermal synthesis of a silver-titania nanotube (Ag/TNT) composite material is presented. The morphology, particle size, chemical content, crystal structure, optical properties and surface area were systematically characterized. Determination of biofilm inhibitory properties revealed that Ag/TNT with the lowest silver content (0.95wt% Ag) decorated with Ag nanoparticles of ca. 3nm reduced biofilm formation of marine bacterium Halomonas pacifica by 98% compared to pure titania nanotubes and bulk silver alone. Growth inhibition of marine microalgae Dunaliella tertiolecta and Isochrysis sp. were also observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDunaliella tertiolecta 3aHalomonas pacifica 3aIsochrysis 3aanti-infective agents 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3acomposite materials 3acrystal structure 3afouling 3agrowth retardation 3ahot water treatment 3aindustry 3amammals 3amicroalgae 3ananosilver 3ananotubes 3aoptical properties 3aparticle size 3aplague 3asilver 3asurface area 3atitanium dioxide 3atrinitrotoluene 0aTiO2 nanotubes 0aAg nanocomposite 0aMarine antifouling 0aBiofilm inhibitor 0aHalomonas pacifica1 aKhiew, Poi Sim1 aLim, Siew Shee1 aChiu, Wee Siong1 aTan, Yuen Fen1 aKok, Yih-Yih1 aLeong, Chee-Onn0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 May 05, v. 520 p.701-711dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.02.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245008700163300001600250520125400266592002801520650002501548650002401573650002701597650002201624650001501646650003901661650000901700650001801709650001801727650000901745650002001754650001401774650001001788650001301798651001301811651001201824653001401836653001601850653001101866700001801877700002101895700002301916700002101939773013001960856007702090852000902167655001202176IND60795237220221121052456.0221004e20221003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079523722DNAL7 a10.1653/024.105.03032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampbell, Haylee10aTick (Acarina: Ixodidae) Species and Life Stages Collected from Arkansas Wild Pigs  ap. 194-199.  aWild pigs (Sus scrofa L.; Artiodactyla: Suidae) are found in every Arkansas county and are spreading throughout the southeastern USA.

Between Feb 2019 and Jan 2020, over 3,110 ticks were collected from 220 hogs from 11 Arkansas counties. Four tick species (Acarina: Ixodidae) were collected: Amblyomma americanum (L.) (95.4%; n = 2,966), Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (2.4%; n = 76), Amblyomma maculatum (Koch) (0.6%; n = 18), and Ixodes scapularis (L.) (0.3%; n = 9). Amblyomma americanum was collected from Jan to Nov 2019, and was the only species found in immature life stages. Dermacentor variabilis was collected from Apr 2019 to Oct 2019. Amblyomma maculatum was collected at 1 site in May 2019, and I. scapularis was collected at 1 site in Nov 2019.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aAmblyomma maculatum 3aDermacentor variabilis 3aIxodes scapularis 3aSus scrofa 3aU.S. Cooperative Extension Service 3aUSDA 3aanimal health 3aentomologists 3afish 3ahuman resources 3alivestock 3aticks 3awildlife 3aArkansas 3aFlorida 0aAmblyomma 0aDermacentor 0aIxodes1 aLoftin, Kelly1 aSzalanski, Allen1 aSteinkraus, Donald1 aSmith, Elizabeth0 tFlorida entomologist.g2022 Oct. 3, v. 105, no. 3 p.194-199dFlorida Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44725x1938-51027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.105.03033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02773naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008600171300001600257520130900273536008001582592002801662596001501690650002501705650001201730650002001742650001201762650001701774650001201791650001301803650001201816650001301828650002101841653000901862653001801871653000701889700002101896700002201917700001901939700001901958700002001977700002001997700002302017700001802040773012602058856008602184852000902270655001202279IND60794432320221117183317.0220923e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079443232DNAL7 a10.1080/13416979.2022.20489872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarahnak, Moein10aSoil pH and divalent cations after clear-cutting on a Japanese cypress plantation  ap. 363-370.  aAlthough Chamaecyparis obtusa reduces soil pH and cation levels, limited information is available regarding their alterations after clear-cutting. We examined the soil pH and base cations on the upslopes and downslopes of individual trees and stumps of C. obtusa at two distances (0.5 m and 1.0 m) and three depths (0–5, 5–10, and 10–30 cm) in intact- and cut-tree plots. The soil pH was higher in the cut-tree plot than in the intact-tree plot, indicating the recovery of soil pH after clear-cutting. The recovery was more evident in the surface soils (0–5 cm) of downslope areas (0.5 m) than in other soil depths, which implies that the recovery of soil pH was caused by the lack of H⁺ supply from stumps after clear-cutting. The results of H⁺ (in H₂O: water-soluble and KCl: exchangeable) suggested a lack of soluble H⁺ in the cut-tree plot. Soil Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ levels in the surface soil (0–5 cm) were 1.86-fold and 1.93-fold higher in the cut-tree plot than in the intact-tree plot, respectively, implying that the recovery of divalent cations after clear-cutting was caused by a reduction in cation loss through cation exchange with H⁺ derived from the stemflow. Collectively, soil pH and divalent cations were recovered after clear-cutting because the stemflow had ceased.  aThis work was supported partly by the JSPS KAKENHI JP19H03088 [JP18H04152].  aPublisher supplied data  aJP19H03088 3aChamaecyparis obtusa 3acalcium 3acation exchange 3acations 3aclearcutting 3aforests 3aresearch 3asoil pH 3astemflow 3awater solubility 0aCa2+ 0aclear-cutting 0aH+1 aMitsuyasu, Keiji1 aIde, Jun’ichiro1 aChiwa, Masaaki1 aEnoki, Tsutomu1 aJeong, Seonghun1 aOtsuki, Kyoichi1 aShimizu, Kuniyoshi1 aKume, Atsushi0 tJournal of forest research.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 27, no. 5 p.363-370dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2022.20489873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01906naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008400164300001600248520075200264592002801016650001601044650001601060650001801076650002501094650001601119650001301135650001601148650004401164650002001208650001001228650002201238650001601260650003001276700002001306773010401326856008101430852000901511655001201520IND60621298520221118105505.0181116e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062129852DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-011-0081-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUppal, S.

For this fine bagasse sample of two varieties was prepared and analyzed for its chemical composition. Then bagasse was treated with variable concentrations (1, 2 and 3 M) of different acids (acetic acid, formic acid, phosphoric acid and nitric acid) and autoclaved for 180, 300 and 420 min with solid–liquid ratio of 1:15 at 110°C temperature and 1.05 kg cm⁻² steam pressure for furfural production. The reaction of bagasse with 3.0 M nitric acid for 300 min gave the highest yields of furfural (119.94 mg/g). Furfural was extracted and identified on the basis of thin layer chromatography, boiling point, IR and NMR data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aautoclaving 3aboiling point 3achemical composition 3aformic acid 3afurfural 3anitric acid 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphoric acid 3asteam 3asugarcane bagasse 3atemperature 3athin layer chromatography1 aKaur, Ramandeep0 tSugar tech.g2011 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.166-169dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-011-0081-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245006800169300001400237520088200251592002801133650001701161650001501178650001801193650001501211650001601226650001801242650001401260650001601274650000901290650001601299650001301315653001501328653001301343653001201356653001201368653001701380700002401397700002601421700002501447700002301472700002101495700001901516700002301535700002201558773008701580856005001667852000901717655001201726IND60791945920221121042941.0220902e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079194592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeaver, Eric A.10aMucosal vaccination by adenoviruses displaying reovirus sigma 1  ap. 60-66.  aWe developed adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) vectors displaying the sigma 1 protein from reovirus as mucosal vaccines. Ad5-sigma retargets to JAM-1 and sialic acid, but has 40-fold reduced gene delivery when compared to Ad5. While weaker at transduction, Ad5-sigma generates stronger T cell responses than Ad5 when used for mucosal immunization. In this work, new Ad5-fiber-sigma vectors were generated by varying the number of fiber β-spiral shaft repeats (R) between the fiber tail and sigma. Increasing chimera length led to decreasing insertion of these proteinsAd5 virions. Ad-R3 and R14 vectors effectively targeted JAM-1 in vitro while R20 did not. When wereused to immunize mice by the intranasal route, Ad5-R3-sigma produced higher serum and vaginal antibody responses than Ad5. These data suggest optimized Ad-sigma vectors may be useful vectors for mucosal vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdenoviridae 3aReoviridae 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3agene transfer 3aserotypes 3asialic acid 3atail 3avaccination 3avirology 0aAdenovirus 0aReovirus 0aSigma 1 0aMucosal 0aImmunization1 aCamacho, Zenaido T.1 aHillestad, Matthew L.1 aCrosby, Catherine M.1 aTurner, Mallory A.1 aGuenzel, Adam J.1 aFadel, Hind J.1 aMercier, George T.1 aBarry, Michael A.0 tVirology.g2015 Aug., v. 482 p.60-66dElsevier Inc.wJournal:2802x0042-68227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.050  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014400160300001800304520130500322592002801627650002201655650003701677650002201714650002201736650002101758650001401779650003701793650001501830650001301845650002401858650001501882650001801897650001401915650003301929650001601962650003701978653002802015653002002043653002702063653002402090653001902114653001502133700001702148773012702165856007302292852000902365655001202374IND60527360620170818000000.0160715e20121128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052736062DNAL7 a10.1021/am30191462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkbayrak, Serdar10aRuthenium(0) Nanoparticles Supported on Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube As Highly Active Catalyst for Hydrogen Generation from Ammonia–Borane  ap. 6302-6310.  aRuthenium(0) nanoparticles supported on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (Ru(0)@MWCNT) were in situ formed during the hydrolysis of ammonia–borane (AB) and could be isolated from the reaction solution by filtration and characterized by ICP-OES, XRD, TEM, SEM, EDX, and XPS techniques. The results reveal that ruthenium(0) nanoparticles of size in the range 1.4–3.0 nm are well-dispersed on multiwalled carbon nanotubes. They were found to be highly active catalyst in hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of AB with a turnover frequency value of 329 min–¹. The reusability experiments show that Ru(0)@MWCNTs are isolable and redispersible in aqueous solution; when redispersed they are still active catalyst in the hydrolysis of AB exhibiting a release of 3.0 equivalents of H₂ per mole of NH₃BH₃ and preserving 41% of the initial catalytic activity even after the fourth run of hydrolysis. The lifetime of Ru(0)@MWCNTs was measured as 26400 turnovers over 29 h in the hydrolysis of AB at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C before deactivation. The work reported here also includes the kinetic studies depending on the temperature to determine the activation energy of the reaction (Eₐ = 33 ± 2 kJ/mol) and the effect of catalyst concentration on the rate of the catalytic hydrolysis of AB, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afiltration 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrolysis 3ananoparticles 3aruthenium 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aruthenium nanoparticles 0acarbon nanotube 0aheterogeneous catalyst 0ahydrogen generation 0aammonia borane 0ahydrolysis1 aÖzkar, Saim0 tACS applied materials .g2012 Nov. 28, v. 4, no. 11 p.6302-6310dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am30191463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245006600167300001600233520121800249592002801467650002401495650001201519650001701531650001101548650001501559650002601574653001601600653001201616653002901628653002201657653001301679700002901692700001701721700001801738700002001756773012101776856008201897852000901979655001201988IND60556372220221120211911.0161102e20161104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055637222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfrin, Tanjina10aBuckling of microtubules on elastic media via breakable bonds  ap. 132-138.  aBuckling of microtubules observed in cells has been reconstructed on a two-dimensional elastic medium consisting of kinesins grafted over compressible substrates, enabling precise control of experimental conditions and quantitative analysis. However, interpretations of the observations have ambiguities due to inevitable experimental difficulties. In this study, with computer simulations, we investigated importance of the mode of interaction of microtubule with elastic medium in the buckling behavior of microtubule. By taking into consideration of forced-induced detachments of kinesins from microtubules, our simulations reproduced the previous experimental results, and showed deviations from predictions of the elastic foundation model. On the other hand, with hypothetical linkers permanently bound to microtubules, our simulation reproduced the predictions of the elastic foundation model. By analyzing the results of the simulations, we investigated as to why the difference arose. These findings indicate the importance of the mode of interaction of microtubule with the medium in the buckling behavior of microtubule. Our findings would bring new insights on buckling of microtubules in living cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3akinesin 3amicrotubules 3amodels 3aprediction 3aquantitative analysis 0aMicrotubule 0aKinesin 0aElastic foundation model 0aMechanical stress 0aBuckling1 aKabir, Arif Md.

We added our results to a meta-analysis based on searches until November 2018.In fully adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models in our prospective study, there was an inverse association between total fat (HR: 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.82, 0.99, Q4 vs Q1) and PUFA (0.81, 0.78–0.84) consumption and all-cause mortality, whereas SFA were associated with the increased mortality (1.08, 1.04–1.11). In the meta-analysis of 29 prospective cohorts (n = 1,164,029) we found a significant inverse association between total fat (0.89, 0.82–0.97), MUFA (0.94, 0.89–0.99) and PUFA (0.89, 0.84–0.94) consumption and all-cause mortality. No association was observed between total fat and CVD (0.93, 0.80–1.08) or CHD mortality (1.03 0.99–1.09). A significant association between SFA intake and CHD mortality (1.10, 1.01–1.21) was observed. Neither MUFA nor PUFA were associated with CVD or CHD mortality. Inverse associations were observed between MUFA (0.80, 0.67–0.96) and PUFA (0.84, 0.80–0.90) intakes and stroke mortality.We showed differential associations of total fat, MUFA and PUFA with all-cause mortality, but not CVD or CHD mortalities. SFA was associated with higher all-cause mortality in NHANES and with CHD mortality in our meta-analysis. The type of fat intake appears to be associated with important health outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aconfidence interval 3acoronary disease 3adietary fat 3afat intake 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3amortality 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprospective studies 3asaturated fatty acids 3astroke 0aDietary fats 0aCoronary heart disease 0aStroke 0aMortality 0aDiabetes 0aMeta-analysis1 aMikhailidis, Dimitri P.1 aSattar, Naveed1 aToth, Peter P.1 aJudd, Suzanne1 aBlaha, Michael J.1 aHernandez, Adrian V.1 aPenson, Peter E.1 aBanach, Maciej2 aInternational Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) & Lipid and Blood Pressure Meta-analysis Collaboration (LBPMC) Groupeauthor0 tClinical nutrition.g2020 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.3677-3686dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.03.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245009500165520180300260592002802063650003302091650002702124650001302151650000902164650001902173650002102192650001002213650003402223650001302257650002902270650001402299650001702313650001702330650003002347650002002377650001302397650002502410650002002435650001502455650002802470650003502498700001802533700002002551700002502571700001802596700002302614700001902637700002202656700002502678700002902703773011902732856007802851852000902929655001202938IND60702976420221117224522.0200719e20191223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070297642DNAL7 a10.3390/genes110100162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNyaga, Christine 10aGenome-Wide Analyses and Prediction of Resistance to MLN in Large Tropical Maize Germplasm  aMaize lethal necrosis (MLN), caused by co-infection of maize chlorotic mottle virus and sugarcane mosaic virus, can lead up to 100% yield loss. Identification and validation of genomic regions can facilitate marker assisted breeding for resistance to MLN. Our objectives were to identify marker-trait associations using genome wide association study and assess the potential of genomic prediction for MLN resistance in a large panel of diverse maize lines. A set of 1400 diverse maize tropical inbred lines were evaluated for their response to MLN under artificial inoculation by measuring disease severity or incidence and area under disease progress curve (AUDPC). All lines were genotyped with genotyping by sequencing (GBS) SNPs. The phenotypic variation was significant for all traits and the heritability estimates were moderate to high. GWAS revealed 32 significantly associated SNPs for MLN resistance (at p < 1.0 × 10⁻⁶). For disease severity, these significantly associated SNPs individually explained 3–5% of the total phenotypic variance, whereas for AUDPC they explained 3–12% of the total proportion of phenotypic variance. Most of significant SNPs were consistent with the previous studies and assists to validate and fine map the big quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions into few markers’ specific regions. A set of putative candidate genes associated with the significant markers were identified and their functions revealed to be directly or indirectly involved in plant defense responses. Genomic prediction revealed reasonable prediction accuracies. The prediction accuracies significantly increased with increasing marker densities and training population size. These results support that MLN is a complex trait controlled by few major and many minor effect genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMaize chlorotic mottle virus 3aSugarcane mosaic virus 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adisease course 3adisease severity 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotyping by sequencing 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3ainbred lines 3amarker-assisted selection 3amixed infection 3anecrosis 3aphenotypic variation 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3aquantitative trait loci 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aGowda, Manje 1 aBeyene, Yoseph 1 aMuriithi, Wilson  T.1 aMakumbi, Dan 1 aOlsen, Michael  S.1 aSuresh, L.

We investigated the effects of X-ray irradiation on the disinfestation of six floriculture insect pests (Tetranychus urticae, Myzus persicae, Bemisia tabaci, Liriomyza trifolii, Spodoptera litura, and Frankliniella intonsa) placed in the top, middle, and bottom sections of rose and chrysanthemum boxes. After irradiation with an X-ray dose of 150Gy, the development of nymphs and adults of M. persicae and eggs, nymphs, and adults of B. tabaci was prevented at every position in the boxes. When T. urticae nymphs were irradiated at 200Gy, newly emerged adults laid eggs in the bottom section of rose boxes only. However, hatching was completely inhibited. When L. trifolii adults were irradiated at 200Gy, hatching of the F₁ generation was completely inhibited in every section of both the rose and chrysanthemum boxes. The hatchability of S. litura was not completely inhibited in the bottom sections, even at 200Gy. In F. intonsa, the hatchability of eggs and emergence of nymphs were prevented at 150Gy. However, at 200Gy, the hatching of the F₁ generation was completely inhibited only in the chrysanthemum boxes. These results suggest that the required dose of X-ray irradiation may depend on the type of flower, the species of insect pest, and the insect location within the box.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBemisia tabaci 3aChrysanthemum 3aFrankliniella intonsa 3aLiriomyza trifolii 3aMyzus persicae 3aRosa 3aSpodoptera litura 3aTetranychus urticae 3aX-radiation 3aadults 3acut flowers 3adisinfestation 3aeggs 3afloriculture 3aflowers 3ahatching 3ainsect pests 3airradiation 3anymphs 3aquarantine 3aKorean Peninsula 0aX-ray 0aCut flower 0aInsect pest 0aQuarantine1 aKoo, Hyun-Na1 aKim, Hyun Kyung1 aYang, Jeong-Oh1 aKim, Gil-Hah0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2016 Mar., v. 19, no. 1 p.31-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2015.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100001500175245008000190300001400270520185900284592002802143650001102171650001702182650001502199650002202214650002202236650002002258650001402278650001002292650003302302650001902335650001202354650001202366650001302378650001302391650001702404700002402421700001602445700002202461773014902483856006802632856010002700990002302800852000902823655001202832IND60643223220221120203047.0190510e20091210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064322322DNAL7 a10.3791/16142doi7 aPMC31522462pmcid7 a200105402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Van B.10aIntranuclear microinjection of dna into dissociated adult mammalian neurons  ap. e1614.  aPrimary neuronal cell cultures are valuable tools to study protein function since they represent a more biologically relevant system compared to immortalized cell lines. However, the post-mitotic nature of primary neurons prevents effective heterologous protein expression using common procedures such as electroporation or chemically-mediated transfection. Thus, other techniques must be employed in order to effectively express proteins in these non-dividing cells. In this article, we describe the steps required to perform intranuclear injections of cDNA constructs into dissociated adult sympathetic neurons. This technique, which has been applied to different types of neurons, can successfully induce heterologous protein expression. The equipment essential for the microinjection procedure includes an inverted microscope to visualize cells, a glass injection pipet filled with cDNA solution that is connected to a N2(g) pressure delivery system, and a micromanipulator. The micromanipulator coordinates the injection motion of microinjection pipet with a brief pulse of pressurized N2 to eject cDNA solution from the pipet tip. This technique does not have the toxicity associated with many other transfection methods and enables multiple DNA constructs to be expressed at a consistent ratio. The low number of injected cells makes the microinjection procedure well suited for single cell studies such as electrophysiological recordings and optical imaging, but may not be ideal for biochemical assays that require a larger number of cells and higher transfection efficiencies. Although intranuclear microinjections require an investment of equipment and time, the ability to achieve high levels of heterologous protein expression in a physiologically relevant environment makes this technique a very useful tool to investigate protein function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acell culture 3acell lines 3acomplementary DNA 3aelectrophysiology 3aelectroporation 3aequipment 3aglass 3aheterologous gene expression 3aimage analysis 3amammals 3aneurons 3aproteins 3atoxicity 3atransfection1 aWilliams, Damian J.1 aWon, Yu-Jin1 aIkeda, Stephen R.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2009 Dec. 10, , no. 34 p.e1614-e1614dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/16143Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/1614/intranuclear-microinjection-dna-into-dissociated-adult-mammalian  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245008400152300001800236520129300254592002801547650002501575650002101600650003401621650002301655650001501678650001601693650001401709650002501723650001301748650001901761650001401780650002401794650001301818650001801831650001701849653001901866653002101885653002101906653002001927653002501947653003201972700001302004700001502017700001802032700001502050700001402065700001602079700001802095773012402113856007502237852000902312655001202321IND60527360820221121233949.0160715e20121128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052736082DNAL7 a10.1021/am30193672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, He10aPEGylated Graphene Oxide-Mediated Protein Delivery for Cell Function Regulation  ap. 6317-6323.  aDelivery of proteins into cells may alter cellular functions as various proteins are involved in cellular signaling by activating or deactivating the corresponding pathways and, therefore, can be used in cancer therapy. In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that PEGylated graphene oxide (GO) can be exploited as a nanovector for efficient delivery of proteins into cells. In this approach, GO was functionalized with amine-terminated 6-armed polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecules, thereby providing GO with proper physiological stability and biocompatibility. Proteins were then loaded onto PEG-grafted GO (GO-PEG) with high payload via noncovalent interactions. GO-PEG could deliver proteins to cytoplasm efficiently, protecting them from enzymatic hydrolysis. The protein delivered by GO-PEG reserves its biological activity that regulates the cell fate. As a result, delivery of ribonuclease A (RNase A) led to cell death and transport of protein kinase A (PKA) induced cell growth. Taken together, this work demonstrated the feasibility of PEGlyated GO as a promising protein delivery vector with high biocompatibility, high payload capacity and, more importantly, capabilities of protecting proteins from enzymatic hydrolysis and retaining their biological functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatibility 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3acell communication 3acell death 3acell growth 3acytoplasm 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3aneoplasms 3apolyethylene glycol 3aproteins 3aribonucleases 3atherapeutics 0agraphene oxide 0aloading capacity 0aprotein delivery 0acellular uptake 0aenzymatic hydrolysis 0aregulation of cell function1 aLiu, Min1 aHe, Huixin1 aZhang, Liming1 aHuang, Jie1 aChong, Yu1 aDai, Jianwu1 aZhang, Zhijun0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 Nov. 28, v. 4, no. 11 p.6317-6323dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam30193673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245009800156300001600254520139500270592002801665650001901693650001601712650001101728650001401739650001101753650001801764650001401782650001001796650001101806650001401817650001001831650001301841650001601854651001201870653001801882653002401900653002101924653003001945700001701975700001201992700001302004700001502017700001402032773013002046856007702176852000902253655001202262IND60795237520221121042802.0221004e20221003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079523752DNAL7 a10.1653/024.105.03062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, Bing10aPerformance of Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) Reared Under Different Methods  ap. 211-218.  aSoybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is an important soybean pest in North America. In this study, A. glycines was fed on detached leaves of Glycine max (L.) Merrill (Fabaceae) at 20, 23, 26, 29, and 32 °C under 3 rearing methods: leaf-disc method, filter paper method, and moisturized cotton method. Aphis glycines life parameters, including nymph stage duration, adult lifespan, adult fecundity, adult body size, and intrinsic rate of increase were measured. There were no significant differences in nymph stage duration among these rearing methods at 20 to 32 °C. Within this temperature range, the filter paper method and the moisturized cotton method resulted in similar or greater adult lifespans, adult fecundities, adult body sizes, and intrinsic rates of increase in comparison to the leaf-disc method. When nymphs of A. glycines were reared at 20 to 29 °C, the experimental labor required for the moisturized cotton method was less than that for the filter paper method and the leaf-disc method. Considering the development, reproduction, and experimental labor, the moisturized cotton method is recommended as a good detached leaf method for rearing individual A. glycines. These conclusions will be useful and informational for researchers who study A. glycines, especially when selecting methods to rear A. glycines individually in the laboratory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphis glycines 3aGlycine max 3aadults 3abody size 3acotton 3aentomologists 3afecundity 3alabor 3aleaves 3alongevity 3apests 3asoybeans 3atemperature 3aFlorida 0asoybean aphid 0afilter paper method 0aleaf-disc method 0amoisturized cotton method1 aTian, Zhenqi1 aGao, Bo1 aLiu, Zhe1 aWang, Ling1 aLiu, Jian0 tFlorida entomologist.g2022 Oct. 3, v. 105, no. 3 p.211-218dFlorida Entomological SocietywJournal:jnl44725x1938-51027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.105.03063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02537naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009000158300001800248520122500266592002801491650004401519650002201563650001401585650002301599650000901622650001801631650001901649650001901668650001301687650001601700650001901716650001301735650001401748653002201762653002501784653001801809653001801827653002301845700001501868773012401883856007502007852000902082655001202091IND60527360920221121233947.0160715e20121128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052736092DNAL7 a10.1021/am30194172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Hye-Seon10aAu/Au@Polythiophene Core/Shell Nanospheres for Heterogeneous Catalysis of Nitroarenes  ap. 6324-6331.  aMonodisperse Au/Au@polythiophene core/shell nanospheres were facilely prepared through the reduction of gold precursor, AuCl₄⁻, by 2-thiopheneacetonitrile in an aqueous solution. Concomitantly, 2-thiopheneacetonitrile polymerized during this redox process. As a result, Au nanoparticle was encapsulated by conductive polymer shell to afford novel core/shell nanospheres. Interestingly, the shell was composed of very tiny Au nanoparticles surrounded with thiophene polymers. Thus, the new material is best described as Au/Au@polythiophene core/shell nanospheres. FT-IR spectroscopy revealed that the Au nanoparticles were coordinated by the CN groups of the polythiophene shell. Some of the CN groups were partially hydrolyzed into COOH groups during the redox process because of the acidic reaction condition. The shell was conductive based on the typical ohmic behavior found in electrical measurement. The Au/Au@polythiophene core/shell nanospheres were found to be very active catalysts for the hydrogenation of various nitroarene compounds into corresponding aminoarene compounds in the presence of NaBH₄. Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic nitroarenes were efficiently hydrogenated under mild conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agold 3ahydrogenation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananogold 3ananospheres 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3athiophene 0agold nanoparticle 0acore/shell structure 0ahydrogenation 0ananostructure 0aRaman spectroscopy1 aHuh, Seong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2012 Nov. 28, v. 4, no. 11 p.6324-6331dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam30194173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007200170300001600242520110300258592002801361650002101389650002001410650001101430650001601441650001601457650001501473653002601488653002901514653002801543653002401571700002501595773014001620856008601760852000901846655001201855IND60794432920221117183349.0220923e20220903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079443292DNAL7 a10.1080/15428052.2020.18620082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYarış, Ahmet10aIntentions to Adopt Eco-friendly Practices in Restaurant Operations  ap. 430-452.  aThis study aims to investigate the intentions of restaurant managers/owners to adopt eco-friendly practices in their restaurants. A model was used based on the theory of innovation diffusion and the theory of planned behavior. First, each of the scales used to measure variables was subjected to internal consistency analyses and confirmatory factor analysis. Then hypotheses in the model were tested with the structural equation modeling. It was found that perceived innovation characteristics influenced the intention to adopt eco-friendly practices significantly. Moreover, attitude toward behavior and perceived behavioral control significantly influenced behavioral intention, but subjective norm did not significantly influence behavioral intention. Moreover, it was found that the attitude towards behavior partially mediated the relationship between perceived innovation characteristics and behavioral intention. In light of findings, policymakers are advised to encourage restaurants to “go green”. Also, restaurants are advised to adopt green marketing strategies for this new market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aculinary science 3afactor analysis 3amodels 3anew markets 3arestaurants 3atechnology 0aEco-friendly practice 0aeco-innovation diffusion 0aeco-innovation behavior 0arestaurant managers1 aYazicioğlu, İrfan,0 tJournal of culinary science & technology.g2022 Sept. 03, v. 20, no. 5 p.430-452dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000102x1542-80447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15428052.2020.18620083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010200165300001600267520176600283592002802049650000802077650001502085650001702100650003302117650001502150650001502165650002902180650001402209650001902223650001302242650001302255650001202268650001702280650002302297650001702320650001702337650001202354651001002366651002902376653001602405653002202421653001702443653001602460700002302476700002002499700002102519773011602540856008102656852000902737655001202746IND60650572820221121192656.0190710e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065057282DNAL7 a10.1017/S00242829170007312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNimis, P. L.,10aExploring patterns of commonness and rarity in lichens: a case study from Italy (Southern Europe)  ap. 385-396.  aThis paper, based on data from the latest checklist of Italy, analyzes the distribution patterns of rare and common lichen species within biogeographically homogeneous versus heterogeneous areas of Italy, and the relationships with some main drivers of rarity and commonness. The following data were used: 1) commonness-rarity values of 2565 species in nine ecoregions; 2) frequency of 353 nationally rare and 387 nationally common species in 21 administrative regions. The following functional and ecological traits were considered: growth form, photobiont(s), type of reproduction, substrata, bioclimatic range, ecological indicator values for aridity and eutrophication, and poleophoby. Within each ecoregion, rare species by far outweigh common species but about one third of these are common in other ecoregions. At the level of regional floras, rarity is significantly associated with epiphytic substrata, non-trebouxioid photobionts and high air humidity, while commonness is associated with saxicolous substrata, trebouxioid photobionts and eutrophication. Rarity seems to mainly depend on two factors, bioclimate (many rare species are outside the limit of their bioclimatic optima) and reduced availability of suitable habitats (e.g. old-growth forests), while commonness is mainly related to disturbance (eutrophication, creation of drier habitats). Most of the nationally rare lichens belong to an oceanic-suboceanic element with tropical affinities or to a small set of continental species with their optima in the dry steppe biome, which suggests that many rare species can persist in microrefugia, that is sites with microclimates that support small populations of species beyond the boundaries of the climatic limits of their main distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abioclimate 3acase studies 3adry environmental conditions 3aecoregions 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental indicators 3aepiphytes 3aeutrophication 3ahabitats 3ahumidity 3alichens 3amicroclimate 3aold-growth forests 3arare species 3areproduction 3asteppes 3aItaly 3aSouthern European region 0adisturbance 0afunctional traits 0amicrorefugia 0aphotobionts1 aMARTELLOS, Stefano1 aSPITALE, Daniel1 aNASCIMBENE, Juri0 tLichenologist.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.385-396dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25448x1096-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00242829170007313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009800167520110000265592002801365650001601393650001301409650001301422650001701435650002101452650001301473650001501486653002601501653001301527653000901540653002801549653002901577700001701606700005601623700001801679773010501697856008501802852000901887655001201896IND60772371420221120235657.0220906e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077237142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1132172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Seong-Ji10aPreliminary study on the effect of using heat-not-burn tobacco products on indoor air quality  aIn this study, the effect of the use of heat-not-burn (HnB) products on indoor air quality (IAQ) was evaluated. To do this, the concentrations of nicotine, propylene glycol (PG), and vegetable glycerin (VG) directly emitted when using HnB products were analyzed and compared to those from conventional cigarettes. Furthermore, the levels of VOCs, aldehydes, nanoparticle, and particulate matter (PM) detected when subjects used HnB products in the exposure chamber were evaluated the effect on IAQ. As a result, the range of nicotine levels transferred by HnB products (0.8–1.2 mg cigarette⁻¹) is lower than that by conventional cigarettes (2.4–3.6 mg cigarette⁻¹). On the other hand, the range of VG levels emitted from HnB products (3.1–5.9 mg cigarette⁻¹) were higher than that emitted from conventional cigarettes (0.6–3.0 mg cigarette⁻¹). In addition, although the amount generated from HnB products was small compared to those from conventional cigarettes, various kinds of VOCs, aldehydes, nanoparticle and PM were produced, and these were confirmed to affect IAQ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aglycerol 3anicotine 3aparticulates 3apropylene glycol 3aresearch 3avegetables 0aHeat-not-burn product 0aNicotine 0aVOCs 0aParticulate matter (PM) 0aIndoor air quality (IAQ)1 aKwon, Min-Ku1 aChoi, Wonsik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2988-72421 aSon, Youn-Suk0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Sept., v. 212 p.113217-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1132173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010600171300001600277520067100293592002800964650000800992650001401000650002301014650002201037650003101059650003901090650002001129650003101149650001001180650001101190650001901201650002601220650003701246650002001283650002201303653001501325653002401340653002501364653001901389653001601408700002201424700001301446700001801459700006801477773014601545856008301691852000901774655001201783IND60556372620221120212026.0181120e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055637262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLui, Eric Lik-Hang10aInorganic polyphosphate triggers upregulation of interleukin 11 in human osteoblast-like SaOS-2 cells  ap. 766-771.  aPolyphosphate (polyP) is abundant in bone but its roles in signaling and control of gene expression remain unclear.

In the Neotropics, species in this genus grow on the ground or on shrubs in the páramos, and as epiphytes in the montane rainforests. We describe here a new species from the páramos of Colombia, Bunodophoron crespoae Soto, M. Prieto & Wedin sp. nov., and discuss its distinction from another large and common páramo species Bunodophoron flabellatum (Hue) Soto, M. Prieto & Wedin comb. nov. Both species are primarily terrestrial in the páramos, although B. flabellatum may occasionally also grow as an epiphyte. Bunodophoron crespoae is characterized by the white, c. 10–13 cm long, subterete to narrowly flattened, main branches. It differs from the otherwise similar B. flabellatum by being distinctly subterete, more abundantly branched, and by having smaller ascospores. Both are distinguished from the primarily epiphytic B. melanocarpum by the considerably larger thallus size, with the main branches of B. melanocarpum rarely exceeding 3·5 cm in length and 2 mm in width.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBunodophoron 3aNeotropics 3aascospores 3abranches 3achemistry 3aepiphytes 3alichens 3anew combination 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3arain forests 3ashrubs 3athallus 3aColombia 0alichenized fungi 0anomenclature 0aspecies boundaries 0asystematics 0ataxonomy1 aPRIETO, Maria1 aWedin, Mats,0 tLichenologist.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 3 p.255-266dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl25448x1096-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00242829170007433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245008800154300001800242520107900260592002801339650001301367650001101380650001801391650001901409650001301428653002001441653001801461653002901479653002301508653001901531653002701550700001501577700001801592700001501610700001801625700001601643700001201659773012701671856007301798852000901871655001201880IND60527361120221121234052.0160715e20121128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052736112DNAL7 a10.1021/am301946t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOu, Junfei10aTunable Water Adhesion on Titanium Oxide Surfaces with Different Surface Structures  ap. 5737-5741.  aTunable water adhesion with high static contact angle (SCA) on titanium oxide surfaces was achieved by a two-step process: first, titanium oxide surfaces with different structures were obtained by immersion the titanium alloy substrates into H₂O–H₂O₂–HF solution at 140 °C for different time of 30, 60, and 120 min; then, low-surface-energy molecules of 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorooctyltrichlorosilane (PFOTS) were deposited thereon. SCA for all so-fabricated samples were higher than 150° and sliding angle (SA) for different immersion time of 30 min, 60 min, and 120 min is 180ᵒ, 31±2ᵒ, and 8±1ᵒ, respectively. To analyze the correlation between the surface structures and the dynamic wetting behaviors, we adopted, three contact modes (i.e., Wenzel, Cassie impregnating, and Cassie modes). The analyses showed that the surface adhesion was influenced greatly by water/solid interfacial interaction and could be artificially tuned between Wenzel state with high adhesion to Cassie state with low adhesion through the design of appropriate microstructures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalloys 3acontact angle 3amicrostructure 3atitanium 0adynamic wetting 0asliding angle 0acontact angle hysteresis 0asurface structures 0atitanium oxide 0ahydrothermal treatment1 aHu, Weihua1 aLi, Changquan1 aWang, Ying1 aXue, Mingshan1 aWang, Fajun1 aLi, Wen0 tACS applied materials .g2012 Nov. 28, v. 4, no. 11 p.5737-5741dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am301946t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04358naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002100175245006700196300001400263520268100277592002802958650001702986650001103003650001803014650001303032650001903045650001503064650001803079650001703097650001303114650001103127650002903138650001203167650001403179650000903193650001403202650001503216650001903231650001403250650001803264650001203282700002103294700002403315700001703339700002203356700003603378700002003414773014903434856006803583856009703651990002303748852000903771655001203780IND60643223520221120211808.0190510e20091130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064322352DNAL7 a10.3791/16202doi7 aPMC31578492pmcid7 a199493732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDohle, Daniel S.10aChick ex ovo culture and ex ovo cam assay: how it really works  ap. e1620.  aChicken eggs in the early phase of breeding are between in vitro and in vivo systems and provide a vascular test environment not only to study angiogenesis but also to study tumorigenesis. After the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) has developed, its blood vessel network can be easily accessed, manipulated and observed and therefore provides an optimal setting for angiogenesis assays. Since the lymphoid system is not fully developed until late stages of incubation, the chick embryo serves as a naturally immunodeficient host capable of sustaining grafted tissues and cells without species-specific restrictions. In addition to nurturing developing allo- and xenografts, the CAM blood vessel network provides a uniquely supportive environment for tumor cell intravasation, dissemination, and vascular arrest and a repository where arrested cells extravasate to form micro metastatic foci. For experimental purposes, in most of the recent studies the CAM was exposed by cutting a window through the egg shell and experiments were carried out in ovo, resulting in significant limitations in the accessibility of the CAM and possibilities for observation and photo documentation of effects. When shell-less cultures of the chick embryo were used1-4, no experimental details were provided and, if published at all, the survival rates of these cultures were low. We refined the method of ex ovo culture of chick embryos significantly by introducing a rationally controlled extrusion of the egg content. These ex ovo cultures enhance the accessibility of the CAM and chick embryo, enabling easy in vivo documentation of effects and facilitating experimental manipulation of the embryo. This allows the successful application to a large number of scientific questions: (1) As an improved angiogenesis assay5,6, (2) an experimental set up for facilitated injections in the vitreous of the chick embryo eye7-9, (3) as a test environment for dissemination and intravasation of dispersed tumor cells from established cell lines inoculated on the CAM10-12, (4) as an improved sustaining system for successful transplantation and culture of limb buds of chicken and mice13 as well as (5) for grafting, propagation, and re-grafting of solid primary tumor tissue obtained from biopsies on the surface of the CAM14. In this video article we describe the establishment of a refined chick ex ovo culture and CAM assay with survival rates over 50%. Besides we provide a step by step demonstration of the successful application of the ex ovo culture for a large number of scientific applications. Daniel S. Dohle, Susanne D.

The environmental impact of its exponential growth means extreme mining, hazardous labour practices including child labour, and exposure burden to inorganic and organic hazardous chemicals for the environment and current and future human generations. Globally, processes such as in-country reduce, reuse and recycle have so far received less attention than outer-circle strategies like the uncontrolled dumping of e-waste in countries that are unprotected by regulatory frameworks. Here, in the absence of infrastructures for sound hazardous e-waste management, the crude recycling, open burning and dumping into landfills of e-waste severely expose people, animal and the environment. Along with economic, political, social, and cultural solutions to the e-waste global problem, the scientific approach based on risk analysis encompassing risk assessment, risk management and risk communication can foster a technical support to resist transgenerational e-waste exposure and health inequalities. This paper presents the latest public health strategies based on the use of integrated human and animal biomonitoring and appropriate biomarkers to assess and manage the risk of e-waste embracing the One Health approach. Advantages and challenges of integrated biomonitoring are described, along with ad-hoc biomarkers of exposure, effect and susceptibility with special focus on metals and metalloids. Indeed, the safe and sustainable management of novel technologies will benefit of the integration and coordination of human and animal biomonitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOne Health initiative 3abiomarkers 3achild labor 3aelectronic wastes 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ahumans 3apeople 3apolitics 3apublic health 3aresearch 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk communication 0aE-Waste exposure 0aOne Health 0aMetals and metalloids 0aHuman and animal biomonitoring 0aRisk assessment and management1 aRuggieri, Flavia1 aBattistini, Beatrice1 aOrisakwe, Orish E.1 aIgbo, Juliet Kelechi1 aBocca, Beatrice0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Sept., v. 212 p.113227-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1132273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013600164300001600300520186300316592002802179650002302207650002702230650002402257650002702281650001702308650001402325650002702339650001802366650001202384650002802396650001402424650001002438650001102448650001102459650001502470650001402485650001402499700002202513700001902535773010402554856008102658852000902739655001202748IND60621299220221118110122.0181116e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062129922DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-011-0080-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrikanth, J.13aAn Improved Bioassay Method for Entomopathogenic Fungi of Sugarcane Pests and Its Evaluation in Studies of Virulence in Subcultures  ap. 156-165.  aAn improved bioassay method was developed for evaluating entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) using pests and fungi from sugarcane crop system. Third instar larvae of white grub Holotrichia serrata F. (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) and shoot borer Chilo infuscatellus Snellen (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) surface-contaminated with suspensions (10⁸ spores/ml) of Beauveria brongniartii (Sacc.) Petch and Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Criv.) Vuill., respectively were subjected to starvation and feeding regimes. Holotrichia serrata grubs maintained in starvation regime showed lower overall mortality and higher LT₅₀ values than those kept in feeding regime in one test; the trend was, however, opposite in the second test. On the other hand, C. infuscatellus larvae in starvation regime produced higher mortality and lower LT₅₀ values than those in feeding regime in both tests. Further, spore output per C. infuscatellus larval cadaver was equal in both regimes. In degeneration studies, spore output of Metarhizium anisopliae Metch. maintained on nutrient broth for 15 continuous subcultures showed overlapping differences and a decreasing trend after the first six subcultures. In virulence studies with M. anisopliae from eight subcultures against diet-reared C. infuscatellus, third instar larvae treated with the fungus and maintained under starvation regime showed two peaks of LC₅₀ and LT₅₀ values. In comparative studies with field-collected C. infuscatellus, third instar larvae treated with 10⁸ spores/ml of the fungus from 15 subcultures and fed with sugarcane shoots showed indistinct peaks in per cent mortality which reached significantly lowest value in the 15th subculture. The advantages of the modified bioassay method in virulence tests and the importance of degeneration studies for candidate EPF such as B. brongniartii are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBeauveria bassiana 3aBeauveria brongniartii 3aChilo infuscatellus 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3aScarabaeidae 3abioassays 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3alethal concentration 50 3amortality 3apests 3ashoots 3aspores 3astarvation 3asugarcane 3avirulence1 aSanthalakshmi, G.1 aNirmala, Ār.,0 tSugar tech.g2011 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.156-165dSpringer IndiawJournal:J000000155x0972-15257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12355-011-0080-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02864naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009000161300001100251500001900262500001100281520161900292592002801911650002201939650001501961650001901976650001101995650001402006650002202020650004302042650001402085650001202099700001402111700005502125700002002180700001902200700002802219773011502247856008302362852000902445655001202454IND60724341120221116172946.0210228e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072434112DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-021-02642-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavina, 12aA changing trend in diagnostic methods of Influenza A (H3N2) virus in human: a review  ap. 87.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aThe influenza virus is classified into four types A, B, C, and D, but type A and B are responsible for major illnesses in people with influenza A being the only virus responsible for flu pandemics due to the presence of two surface proteins called hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) on the virus. The two subtypes of influenza A virus, H1N1 and H3N2, have been known to cause many flu pandemics. Both subtypes change genetically and antigenically to produce variants (clades and subclades, also know as groups and subgroups). H3N2 tends to change rapidly, both genetically and antigenically whereas that of H1N1 generally tends to have smaller changes. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses have evolved to form many separate, genetically different clades that continue to co-circulate. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have caused significant deaths as per WHO report. The review describes methods for detection of influenza A(H3N2) viruses by conventional serological methods as well as the advanced methods of molecular biology and biosensors. All these methods are based on different parameters and have different targets but the goal is to improve specificity and increase sensitivity. Amongst the molecular methods, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered a gold standard test due to its many advantages whereas a number of other molecular methods are time-consuming, complex to perform or lack specificity. The review also considers bio-sensing methods for simple, rapid, highly sensitive, and specific detection of H3N2. The classification and principle of various H3N2 biosensors are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3abiosensors 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3ainfluenza 3amolecular biology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asialidase 3aviruses1 aManjeet, 1 aMohan, Hari1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1990-72381 aNarang, Jagriti1 aPundir, Shikha1 aPundir, Chandra Shekhar0 t3 Biotech.g2021 Feb., v. 11, no. 2 p.87-87dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-021-02642-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03242naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002600175245009100201300001400292520189100306592002802197650002502225650001002250650001002260650001202270650001802282650001302300650002102313650002302334650001202357650006202369700001902431700002802450773014902478856006802627856010502695990002302800852000902823655001202832IND60643223620221120191326.0190510e20091202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064322362DNAL7 a10.3791/16222doi7 aPMC31522472pmcid7 a199560822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatkins, Katherine H.12aA rapid high-throughput method for mapping ribonucleoproteins (rnps) on human pre-mrna  ap. e1622.  aSequencing RNAs that co-immunoprecipitate (co-IP) with RNA binding proteins has increased our understanding of splicing by demonstrating that binding location often influences function of a splicing factor. However, as with any sampling strategy the chance of identifying an RNA bound to a splicing factor is proportional to its cellular abundance. We have developed a novel in vitro approach for surveying binding specificity on otherwise transient pre-mRNA. This approach utilizes a specifically designed oligonucleotide pool that tiles across introns, exons, splice junctions, or other pre-mRNA. The pool is subjected to some kind of molecular selection. Here, we demonstrate the method by separating the oligonucleotide into a bound and unbound fraction and utilize a two color array strategy to record the enrichment of each oligonucleotide in the bound fraction. The array data generates high-resolution maps with the ability to identify sequence-specific and structural determinates of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) binding on pre-mRNA. A unique advantage to this method is its ability to avoid the sampling bias towards mRNA associated with current IP and SELEX techniques, as the pool is specifically designed and synthesized from pre-mRNA sequence. The flexibility of the oligonucleotide pool is another advantage since the experimenter chooses which regions to study and tile across, tailoring the pool to their individual needs. Using this technique, one can assay the effects of polymorphisms or mutations on binding on a large scale or clone the library into a functional splicing reporter and identify oligonucleotides that are enriched in the included fraction. This novel in vitro high-resolution mapping scheme provides a unique way to study RNP interactions with transient pre-mRNA species, whose low abundance makes them difficult to study with current in vivo techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-binding proteins 3acolor 3aexons 3aintrons 3amessenger RNA 3amutation 3aoligonucleotides 3aribonucleoproteins 3asurveys 3asystematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment1 aStewart, Allan1 aFairbrother, William G.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2009 Dec. 02, , no. 34 p.e1622-e1622dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/16223Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/1622/a-rapid-high-throughput-method-for-mapping-ribonucleoproteins-rnps-on  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03862naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245012300176506011700299506007600416520185200492592002802344506003702372650002202409650001102431650002302442650001202465650003502477650001302512650001102525650001502536650001602551650001602567650002002583650001502603650001602618650002202634650002402656650001902680650001902699650002102718650001502739650002402754650002602778650003202804650001002836651001002846653001602856653002102872653001802893653000802911653002602919653002402945700002102969700002302990700001803013773009503031856008903126852000903215655001203224IND60687884320221207071554.0220614e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068788432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1046252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchürmann, Alina10aAssessing the relationship between land tenure issues and land cover changes around the Arabuko Sokoke Forest in Kenya  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLand as an essential resource is becoming increasingly scarce due to population growth. In the case of the Kenyan coast, population pressure causes land cover changes in the Arabuko Sokoke Forest, which is an important habitat for endangered species. Forest and bushland have been changed to agricultural land in order to provide livelihood for the rural population who are highly dependent on small-scale farming. Unclear land rights and misbalanced access to land cause uncontrolled expansion and insecure livelihoods. Secure land rights are crucial to improve living conditions for the local smallholders. Socio-economic and land tenure conditions were assessed in a study area close to Malindi in south-east Kenya to understand the human-induced changes in land cover. A combination between biophysical and socio-economic methods was used to identify the relationship between land cover change, land tenure and other socio-economic factors. Analyses in Geographic Information System (GIS) were chosen to examine in historical photographs and recent satellite imagery land cover changes between 1954 and 2017. This analysis was combined with quantitative questionnaires conducted on-site in 2017 and 2018 to identify factors influencing the land cover changes and especially to analyze the effects of land tenure on sustainable land use to reduce further land conversion. Moreover, this study statistically investigated the impact of land tenure issues on the tree population of the respective land plots using non-parametric tests as well as dependency analyses. We found significant relationships between the income of the interviewees and the tree population on land plots. It also appears that the fragmentation of land cover on a plot differs between respondents who have inherited their land and respondents who have purchased their land.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3acoasts 3aendangered species 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3ahabitats 3aincome 3aland cover 3aland rights 3aland tenure 3aland use change 3alivelihood 3aphotographs 3apopulation growth 3apopulation pressure 3aquestionnaires 3aremote sensing 3arural population 3ashrublands 3asmall-scale farming 3asocioeconomic factors 3asustainable land management 3atrees 3aKenya 0aLand rights 0aLand investments 0aMixed methods 0aGIS 0aSocio-economic survey 0aPopulation pressure1 aKleemann, Janina1 aFürst, Christine,1 aTeucher, Mike0 tLand use policy.g2020 June, v. 95 p.104625-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.1046253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245011400166300001800280520100000298592002801298650001501326650001501341650001001356650001501366700001601381700002101397773016501418856008201583852000901665655001201674IND60480556920221119062121.0160128e20071101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048055692DNAL7 a10.14358/PERS.73.11.12532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkel, Nizar Abo10aOrthogonal Polynomials Supported by Region Growing Segmentation for the Extraction of Terrain from Lidar Data  ap. 1253-1266.  a<p><i>Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) systems supply a massive amount points in 3D space with no semantic information helping knowing the objects they represent. To identify points that were reflected from the terrain, numerous algorithms have been developed in recent years. Many of them apply local operators that tend to face difficulties with complex scenes while their performance also varies between landscapes. In this paper, we present a filtering method that integrates a global approach using orthogonal polynomials with a local one that is region-based. The algorithm makes use of only a few parameters, and no fine-tuning is required between landscapes. Applying the algorithm over areas with varying topography and objects such as bridges, tunnels, and complex building, shows an improved performance compared to results obtained by others. This improvement is reflected in a lower than usual rate of misclassification errors for data acquired over different landscapes.</i></p>  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3alandscapes 3alidar 3atopography1 aFilin, Sagi1 aDoytsher, Yerach0 tPhotogrammetric engineering and remote sensing.g2007 Nov. 1, v. 73, no. 11 p.1253-1266dAmerican Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensingx0099-11127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.14358%2FPERS.73.11.12533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01784naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245008800185300001800273520057800291536009000869592002800959596001500987650002101002650000901023650002201032650001701054650001801071650002001089650001501109650001001124653001101134653001401145700003101159773012501190856008601315852000901401655001201410IND60794433420221120054143.0220923e20221117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079443342DNAL7 a10.1080/87559129.2020.18315272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehlomakulu, Ngwekazi Nwabisa10aNutritional Quality of Wet and Dry Processed Moringa oleifera Lam.

Whole water samples collected at the Everglades stormwater treat area 1 West (STA-1 W) were fractionated using a batch ultrafiltration method to separate organic compounds based on apparent molecular weight (AMW). Each AMW fraction of DOM was characterized for phosphorus, carbon, nitrogen, UV absorbance, and fluorescence. The DOP content of the Everglades water matrix was characteristically variable constituting 4–56% of total phosphorus (TP) and demonstrated no correlation with dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Measured values for DOP exceeded 14μgL−1 in four out of five sampling dates making phosphorus load reductions problematic for the stormwater treatment areas (STAs), which target inorganic phosphorus and have a goal of 10μgL−1 as TP. The molecular weight distributions revealed 40% of DOP is high molecular weight, aromatic-rich DOM. The results of this research are expected to be of interest to environmental chemists, environmental engineers, and water resources managers because DOP presents a major obstacle to achieving TP levels <10μgL−1.  aPublisher supplied data 3ainorganic phosphorus 3amanagers 3aabsorbance 3afluorescence 3anitrogen 3aorganic compounds 3astormwater 3aultrafiltration 3aengineers 3adissolved organic carbon 3achemists 3amolecular weight 3awater resources 2aAgriculture 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aMolecular Weight 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aSolubility 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWetlands 0aFlorida 0aStormwater treatment areas 0acarbon 0aphosphorus 0aDissolved organic carbon 0aMolecular weight ultrafiltration 0aSpecific ultraviolet absorbance 0aDissolved organic phosphorus 0aEverglades Agricultural Area1 aBoyer, Treavor H.0 tChemosphere.g2013 May, v. 91 p.921-927dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011100162300001800273520147200291592002801763650001601791650002101807650003001828650001201858650001501870650000901885650001401894650001901908650001601927650001201943650002301955650000901978650001601987650002002003650001002023650000902033650001202042650002302054650001002077650001502087650002302102653001202125653001102137653001202148653001202160700001602172700001502188700001902203700002002222700001802242700002002260700001702280773015402297856007902451852000902530655001202539IND60550826520221119080753.0190318e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055082652DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-109102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLejonklev, J.10aShort communication: Effect of oregano and caraway essential oils on the production and flavor of cow milk  ap. 7898-7903.  aMany essential oils and their terpene constituents display antimicrobial properties, which may affect rumen metabolism and influence milk production parameters. Many of these compounds also have distinct flavors and aromas that may make their way into the milk, altering its sensory properties. Essential oils from caraway (Carum carvi) seeds and oregano (Origanum vulgare) plants were included in dairy cow diets to study the effects on terpene composition and sensory properties of the produced milk, as well as feed consumption, production levels of milk, and methane emissions. Two levels of essential oils, 0.2 and 1.0g of oil/kg of dry matter, were added to the feed of lactating cows for 24d. No effects on feed consumption, milk production, and methane emissions were observed. The amount and composition of volatile terpenes were altered in the produced milk based on the terpene content of the essential oils used, with the total amount of terpenes increasing when essential oils were added to the diet. Sensory properties of the produced milk were altered as well, and milk samples from animals receiving essential oil treatment were perceived as having a fresher aroma and lower stored aroma and flavor. The levels of essential oils used in this study mimic realistic levels of essential oils in herbs from feed, but were too low to affect milk production and methane emissions, and their inclusion in the animal diet did not adversely affect milk flavor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarum carvi 3aOriganum vulgare 3aanti-infective properties 3acaraway 3adairy cows 3adiet 3aemissions 3aessential oils 3afeed intake 3amethane 3amethane production 3amilk 3amilk flavor 3amilk production 3aodors 3aoils 3aoregano 3arumen fermentation 3aseeds 3aterpenoids 3avolatile compounds 0acaraway 0aflavor 0amethane 0aoregano1 aKidmose, U.1 aJensen, S.1 aPetersen, M.A.1 aHelwing, A.L.F.1 aMortensen, G.1 aWeisbjerg, M.R.1 aLarsen, M.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Oct., v. 99, no. 10 p.7898-7903dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-109103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012100166300001600287520133700303592002801640650001501668650001601683650000801699650001601707650002501723650002301748650001101771650001101782650001201793650001401805650002501819650001401844650003001858650001201888653003801900653001701938653001401955700002001969700002101989700001902010700002202029700001702051700002402068700001802092773014602110856008302256852000902339655001202348IND60556373120221122225724.0181120e20161028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055637312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMori, Tomoaki10aCleavage of influenza RNA by using a human PUF-based artificial RNA-binding protein–staphylococcal nuclease hybrid  ap. 736-740.  aVarious viruses infect animals and humans and cause a variety of diseases, including cancer. However, effective methodologies to prevent virus infection have not yet been established. Therefore, development of technologies to inactivate viruses is highly desired. We have already demonstrated that cleavage of a DNA virus genome was effective to prevent its replication. Here, we expanded this methodology to RNA viruses. In the present study, we used staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) instead of the PIN domain (PilT N-terminus) of human SMG6 as an RNA-cleavage domain and fused the SNase to a human Pumilio/fem-3 binding factor (PUF)-based artificial RNA-binding protein to construct an artificial RNA restriction enzyme with enhanced RNA-cleavage rates for influenzavirus. The resulting SNase-fusion nuclease cleaved influenza RNA at rates 120-fold greater than the corresponding PIN-fusion nuclease. The cleaving ability of the PIN-fusion nuclease was not improved even though the linker moiety between the PUF and RNA-cleavage domain was changed. Gel shift assays revealed that the RNA-binding properties of the PUF derivative used was not as good as wild type PUF. Improvement of the binding properties or the design method will allow the SNase-fusion nuclease to cleave an RNA target in mammalian animal cells and/or organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA viruses 3aRNA 3aRNA viruses 3aRNA-binding proteins 3abinding properties 3agenome 3ahumans 3ahybrids 3ainfluenza 3amicrococcal nuclease 3aneoplasms 3arestriction endonucleases 3aviruses 0aArtificial RNA restriction enzyme 0aRNA cleavage 0aRNA virus1 aNakamura, Kento1 aMasaoka, Keisuke1 aFujita, Yusuke1 aMorisada, Ryosuke1 aMori, Koichi1 aTobimatsu, Takamasa1 aSera, Takashi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 Oct. 28, v. 479, no. 4 p.736-740dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.09.1423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006300166300001600229520069600245592002800941650000900969650001000978650001200988650001101000650002001011650001601031650001501047650001201062650001401074700002001088700001901108700002101127700002601148773010501174856008101279852000901360655001201369IND60621299620221118105433.0181116e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062129962DNAL7 a10.1007/s12355-011-0096-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHussain, Zahid14aThe Effect of Contact Surface on the Properties of Jaggery  ap. 250-252.  aThe composition of the products of the sugar cane mainly jaggery or gur is very important in term of their food value, color and shelf life.

We assumed that a high pH value at slightly calcareous soil properties should retain tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones even at high manure loads, whereas it should facilitate leaching of sulfonamides. Hence, we investigated the transport of manure-added antibiotics in a soil developed from calcareous parent material on a farm in peri-urban Beijing, China. Leachate was collected from zero-tension samplers, installed at 40cm depth under undisturbed soil, which was treated according to (i) routine farm practice and (ii) worst-case conditions (high antibiotic concentrations, irrigation imitating heavy rainfall). Additionally, the soil depth distribution of pharmaceuticals at the end of the leaching experiment was analysed. Under routine farm practice, sulfamethazine was repeatedly detected in the leachate with a maximum concentration of 0.12μgL−1. All applied substances were still detected in soil after 53days, suggesting that there was no overall rapid and complete dissipation. Worst-case conditions enhanced vertical translocation; all leachate samples contained sulfonamides (up to 653μgL−1 sulfamethazine), and even tetracyclines were found in the leachate once, with doxycycline reaching the highest concentration (0.19μgL−1). The concentrated simultaneous occurrence of sulfonamides with the bromide tracer in leachate samples pointed to preferential flow as underlying transport process. The high pH values did not prevent the single leaching event for tetracyclines and hardly affected overall leaching behaviour. The applied fluoroquinolones were not significantly translocated below 4cm depth, irrespective of irrigation and high manure addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcareous soils 3acropland 3adoxycycline 3aedaphic factors 3afarms 3afluoroquinolones 3airrigation 3aleaching 3amanure spreading 3apH 3apreferential flow 3arain 3asamplers 3asoil depth 3asoil properties 3asulfonamides 3aveterinary drugs 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxstatistics & numerical data 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aVeterinary Drugsxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina 0aVeterinary antibiotics 0aManure 0aLysimeter 0aPreferential flow 0aChina1 aSiemens, Jan1 aWelp, Gerhard1 aXue, Qiaoyun1 aLin, Xianyong1 aLiu, Xuejun1 aAmelung, Wulf0 tChemosphere.g2013 May, v. 91 p.928-934dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.01.1103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245005600134300001600190520194500206650002202151650001202173650001902185650001602204650001502220650000802235650001002243653002302253700001802276773019802294852000902492930003302501945001302534946001302547655001202560IND2048475520221117214137.0951026e199509  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204847552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteenbergen, W. van10aLiver disturbances in obesity and diabetes mellitus  ap. S27-S36.  aAbnormal liver tests, right upper quadrant pain and hepatomegaly occuring in an obese or in a diabetic patient may point to the presence of fat or of glycogen accumulation in the liver parenchymal cells. Marked hepatomegaly due to cytoplasmic glycogen deposition is mainly found in poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetic patients. If accompanied by cushingoid features, growth retardation and by delayed puberty, a diagnosis of Mauriac syndrome can be made. Hyperglycaemia, insulin administration and increased concentrations of the counterregulatory hormone cortisol may all play a role in the glycogen deposition by their concerted actions on the glycogen phosphorylase and synthase enzymes, promoting the accumulation of glycogen. Hypercortisolism may be responsible for growth retardation and delayed puberty in Mauriac patients. Regression of hepatomegaly and of the associated clinical characteristics may be obtained by a better metabolic control due to the administration of long-acting insulin and the change from single to twice daily injections. Fatty liver is rare in insulin-dependent diabetic patients and is indicative of a poor diabetic control. This process is quickly reversible by adequate insulin treatment. Steatosis is frequently found in maturity-onset diabetics and in obese patients. The pathogenetic mechanisms leading to the accumulation of triglycerides and of fatty acids in the hepatocytes can easily be understood from the normal cycling of fatty acids between the adipose tissue and the liver. Histologic features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can also be found in obese and in diabetic patients. Steatohepatitis may rarely evolve into cirrhosis. In general, there is no correlation between the degree of the biochemical alterations and the severity of the histological findings. Treatment of fatty liver and of nonalcoholic steatonecrosis mainly consists of weight loss by adequate dietary measures. 3adiabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aliver diseases 3afatty acids 3ametabolism 3amen 3awomen 0aliterature reviews1 aLanckmans, S.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g1995 Sept., v. 19, no. suppl. 3 p.S27-S36x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle03646naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001600163245007000179300001600249500001500265520184100280650001902121650002002140650001002160650001702170650002302187650002002210650002402230650001702254650001502271650001202286650002002298650001002318650003502328650002002363650004102383650002402424650001102448650001102459650003202470650003102502650001602533650004502549650002902594653001902623700001302642700001702655700001302672700001502685773019002700852000902890856006202899930003302961945002502994946001303019655001203032IND4382078420221117214141.0060718e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438207842DNAL7 a164325442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Methods: Forty-two obese women (Body mass index (BMI)=40+/-3 kg/m2, mean age 45+/-9 years) and compared age-matched (BMI=22+/-1 kg/m2, mean age 41+/-6 years) twenty-five non-obese women were included in our study. Maximum and minimum P-wave duration, P-wave dispersion (difference between the maximum and the minimum P-wave duration), maximum and minimum QTc interval, and QTc dispersion (the difference between the maximum and the minimum QTc interval) were measured from 12-lead ECG. ECG's were transferred to a personal computer via a scanner and then used for magnification of 400 times by Adobe Photoshop software. Results: There was significant difference in BMI (40+/-3 vs 22+/-1 kg/m2, P<0.001, respectively) between obese and non-obese women. Obese women had higher Max. P-wave duration (116+/-11 vs 94+/-14 ms, P<0.001), P-wave dispersion (51+/-15 vs 26+/-11 ms, P<0.001), Max. QTc interval (449+/-38 vs 419+/-30 ms, P<0.001) and QTc dispersion (57+/-23 vs 38+/-15 ms, P<0.001) compared to non-obese women. A significant correlation was found between BMI and Max. P-wave duration (r=0.584, P<0.001), P-wave dispersion (r=0.621, P<0.001), Max. QTc interval (r=0.410, P<0.001), and QTc dispersion (r=0.429, P<0.001). In the linear regression analysis, compared to co-morbidity factors such as age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and smoking, there was significant association between only BMI and electrocardiographic values (P-wave and QTc dispersion). Conclusion: We concluded that obesity caused significant increase in P-wave and QTc dispersion. Therefore, obese women may not only be under the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, but also they may under the risk of atrial arrhythmias. 3ahuman diseases 3aheart ventricle 3awomen 3arisk factors 3amiddle-aged adults 3arisk assessment 3aelectrocardiography 3aheart atrium 3aarrhythmia 3aobesity 3abody mass index 2aAdult 2aArrhythmias, Cardiacxetiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxcomplications 2aElectrocardiography 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxcomplications 2aLong QT Syndromexetiology 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplicationsxphysiopathology. 2aSmokingxadverse effects 0aheart diseases1 aDuru, M.1 aKuvandik, G.1 aKaya, H.1 aYalcin, F.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2006 June, v. 30, no. 6 p.957-961x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.nature.com/ijo/index.html3electronic resource  a20060913b20061003c00000000  aINDd4CTe2006/09/07  aOther US 7aarticle02614naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009400126300001600220500013300236500002400369520134200393650001401735650001201749650001801761650001601779650002101795650001101816650001201827650001401839650000701853650001301860650000901873650002001882650001501902651001001917700001601927700001601943700001601959773012201975852000902097856008602106655001202192IND4469265920221117214152.0130705s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446926592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanik, B.C.10aHigh density orchard systems for 'Himsagar' mango in the new alluvial zone of West Bengal  ap. 241-246.  aPaper presented at the IV International Symposium on Tropical and Subtropical Fruits, held November 3-7, 2008, Bogor, Indonesia.  aIncludes references  aHigh density orcharding appears to be the most appropriate solution to overcome low productivity and the long gestation period for early return and export of mangoes. To identify a suitable planting system for 'Himsagar' mango, a semi-vigorous popular cultivar, an investigation with different planting systems (viz., square (100 plants per ha), hedge row (166 plants ha-1), double hedge row system (222 plants ha-1), paired planting (133 plants ha-1) and cluster planting (177 plants ha-1)) was carried out at the Central Research Farm, Gayeshpur, Bidhan Chandra KrishiViswavidyalaya, Nadia, West Bengal (India) during 2003-2006. The soils of the experimental site were sandy loam having pH 6.8 and the climate was sub-tropical. Amongst the different planting systems studied, it was noted that greatest growth was recorded with the square planting system. The double hedge row system was found to be the most suitable planting system as fruit yield was highest per plot without any consequent deterioration of fruit quality in the initial years of orchard life when the competition for moisture, nutrients and solar radiation amongst the plants were low. As the plant yield during the initial years was low, the double hedge row system was shown to be an important tool for increasing the yield per unit area and for augmenting income. 3acultivars 3aexports 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3agestation period 3aincome 3amangoes 3anutrients 3apH 3aplanting 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3asubtropics 3aIndia1 aMaity, P.K.1 aHasan, M.A.1 aGhosh, S.N.0 tActa horticulturae.g2013 Feb., , no. 975 p.241-246dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/975/975_26.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03242naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245008900144300001800233520182700251650001202078650001202090650002502102650000802127650001002135650002102145650002002166650001702186650001902203650004202222650004502264650001102309650001102320650000902331650004402340650001602384650002602400650001602426653002202442653001802464700001802482773019202500852000902692930003302701945001302734946001302747655001202760IND2328832020221117214158.0020906e200108  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232883202DNAL7 a114774962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWest, J.A.10aWeight loss in overweight subjects following low-sucrose or sucrose-containing diets  ap. 1122-1128.  aOBJECTIVES: To compare the response by overweight individuals, counselled in a work environment, to energy-reduced diets in which the amount of sucrose-containing foods is varied. DESIGN: Two energy-reduced diets were designed as a weight-reducing programme. A low-sugar diet (LSD) providing 5% of its energy from sucrose and a sugar-containing diet (SCD) providing 10% of its energy from sucrose incorporated as sweet foods were devised. Both diets were constructed to contain about 33% of the energy from fat. The diets, designed to provide a deficit of 2.51 MJ/day (600 kcal/day) per individual, were randomly allocated to subjects in an 8 week parallel design study. SUBJECTS: Ninety-five subjects were recruited from a large service industry if they were more than 7 kg (1 stone) in weight above body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2. Sixty-eight subjects completed the programme. MEASUREMENTS: Fortnightly body weight measurements were taken using calibrated scales; BMI at baseline and week 8; and nutrient intake using 2 day food record diaries at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 8. RESULTS: Weight loss over the 8 weeks was 2.2 kg (LSD) and 3.0 kg (SCD). BMI changed from 29.2 on the LSD and 30.1 kg/m2 SCD at baseline to 28.2 and 28.8 kg/m2 at week 8 respectively. The actual prescribed commercially added sucrose intakes were 5% energy (LSD) or 10% energy (SCD). Reported percentage energy from fat was significantly lower on the SCD (and would seem to support the theory of an inverse relationship between fat and sugar) than on the LSD, where there was seen to be no significant reduction. There was no evidence of micronutrient dilution that could be directly attributed to the sucrose content of the diets. CONCLUSION: These results provide no justification for the exclusion of added sucrose in weight-reducing diets. 3aobesity 3asucrose 3adietary carbohydrate 3amen 3awomen 3alow calorie diet 2aBody Mass Index 2aDiet Records 2aDiet, Reducing 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMicronutrientsxadministration & dosage 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxdiet therapy 2aWeight Loss 0aweight loss diets 0aweight losses1 aDe Looy, A.E.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2001 Aug., v. 25, no. 8 p.1122-1128x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01943naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001500148245015100163300001800314500002400332520069600356650001901052650002001071650001201091650001901103650001101122650002701133650001101160650001501171650002501186700001601211700001801227700001701245700001701262700001901279700001701298700002001315773010101335852000901436856008801445655001201533IND4420805720221117213505.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442080572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiu, T.Y.14aThe significance of sample mass in the analysis of steroid estrogens in sewage sludges and the derivation of partition coefficients in wastewaters  ap. 4923-4926.  aIncludes references  aOptimization of an analytical method for determination of steroid estrogens, through minimizing sample size, resulted in recoveries >84%, with relative standard deviations <3% and demonstrated the significance of sample size on method performance.

Aerobic bacteria, indigenous to the ground-water aquifer, were utilized for biodegradation of the venous contaminants. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that biodegradation occurred only under aerobic and not under anaerobic conditions. Analysis of the ground water in the site indicated that levels of oxygen were below 1 mg/l. Thus, it is suggested that oxygen limitation prevented the biodegradation of pollutants in the aquifer. Phosphate amendment (5 mg/l) into slurries of contaminated sediment and ground water resulted in enhanced degradation rates. Columns filled with aquifer material and leached with contaminated ground water were used to simulate possible in situ bioremediation. Reduction in concentration of the different compounds in column effluents ranged between 40 and 80%, with 2,3-, 2,6-, and 3,5-lutidine degrading at lower rates than other contaminants. In addition to in situ treatment, the potential of using aboveground systems for treatment was explored. A mixed culture capable of degrading 14 different alkylpyridines was isolated from the subsurface sediment. This culture was used to seed a two-stage fixed film reactor. The reactor was fed with a mixture of organic acids and alkylpyridines that simulated the ground-water composition. The reactors were very effective in removing the pollutants from the waste stream. The efficiency, of alkylpyridine removal was between 98 and 100% and overall COD removal was 97%, when operating at a loading rate of 4.32 g COD/L-h and hydraulic retention time of 3 h. These results imply that a combined approach which utilizes both in situ and aboveground treatments should be used for the bioremediation of polluted ground water. 3agroundwater contamination 3apyridines 3abioremediation 3aaquifers 3abiodegradation 3aaerobes 3aaerobic conditions 3anutrient availability 3abioreactors 3aphosphates 3awater purification 0abiological fixed-film systems 0agroundwater extraction 0asimulation 0apump and treat1 aBollag, J.M.1 aHsu, C.H.1 aYoung, J.C.0 tGround water.g1996 , v. 34, no. 2 p.194-199x0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02163naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002200149245005800171300001600229500002400245520103200269650002101301650002801322650002201350650001501372650001701387650001701404650001801421650001301439650001501452700001901467700002301486700002301509700002001532700002801552773009901580852000901679856008901688655001201777IND4420812720221117213531.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442081272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanbari, Hossein10aPolymeric heart valves: new materials, emerging hopes  ap. 359-367.  aIncludes references  aHeart valve (HV) replacements are among the most widely used cardiovascular devices and are in rising demand. Currently, clinically available devices are restricted to slightly modified mechanical and bioprosthetic valves. Polymeric HVs could represent an attractive alternative to the existing prostheses, merging the superior durability of mechanical valves and the enhanced haemodynamic function of bioprosthetic valves. After early unsatisfactory clinical results, polymeric HVs did not reach commercialization, mainly owing to their limited durability. Recent advances in polymers, nanomaterials and surface modification techniques together with the emergence of novel biomaterials have resulted in improved biocompatibility and biostability. Advances in HV design and fabrication methods could also lead to polymeric HVs that are suitable for long-lasting implantation. Considering all these progresses, it is likely that the new generation of polymeric HVs will find successful long-term clinical applications in future. 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acommercialization 3adurability 3aheart valves 3ahemodynamics 3ananomaterials 3apolymers 3aprostheses1 aViatge, Helene1 aKidane, Asmeret G.1 aBurriesci, Gaetano1 aTavakoli, Mehdi1 aSeifalian, Alexander M.0 tTrends in biotechnology.g2009 June, v. 27, no. 6 p.359-367dElsevier Sciencex0167-77997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2009.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01268naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245006200129300001300191500001500204520041700219650001400636650002300650650001300673650001700686650003500703650001300738650001800751653002800769773008200797852000900879939003300888945000800921946001300929655001200942991619853850742620221117213453.0930112e199205  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930001512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolor, A.10aVitamin C promises to fight cancer as well as runny noses  ap. 1, 6.  a2019-12-04  aVitamin C holds promise for preventing high blood pressure, cataracts, certain types of cancer and in lessening the symptoms of severe colds.

The He/N2 technique is based on drying of sand columns by circulating helium gas to drag oil droplets in a cold trap (liquid nitrogen). With this technique, residual diesel measurement can be performed easily immediately after alcohol/surfactant washing and in the same lab. For high residual diesel content in Ottawa sand (25 to 30 g/kg, the technique is much more accurate (+/- 2% or 600 mg/kg) than the standard analytical methods for the determination of mineral oil and grease. The average relative error on partial diesel dissolution in sand column estimated after alcohol/surfactant flooding (residual saturation of 10 to 15 g/kg) is as low as 5%. The precision of the He/N2 technique is adequate to compare relative efficiency of washing solutions when partial extraction of residual oil in Ottawa sand columns is performed. However, this technique is not adapted for determination of traces of oil in sediment or for environmental control of contaminated soils. Each diesel determination by the He/N2 technique costs less than 8 $US in chemical products (helium and liquid nitrogen). A simple laboratory drying setup can be built for less than 400 $US which makes this technique valuable for diesel analyses when a large number of tests are required. 3agroundwater contamination 3aaquifers 3asand 3aextraction 3aalcohols 3asurfactants 3ameasurement 3ahelium 3anitrogen 3aanalytical methods 3adiesel fuel 0aresidues 0arecovery 0asimulation 0agravimetry1 aGelinas, P.J.0 tGround water.g1996 , v. 34, no. 1 p.162-167x0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle00727naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245001800131300001700149520013100166650002100297653001200318773009200330852000900422939003300431945000800464946001300472655001200485991619853600742620221117214008.0930112e19920920xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930001712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreeman, L.10aFighting trim  ap. 126, 128.  aWith the cuts in the defense budget in fiscal 1993, food service personnel are being pressed to identify ways to reduce costs. 3amilitary rations 0abudgets0 tRestaurant business.g1992 Sept. 20, v. 91, no. 14 p.126, 128-126, 128x0097-80437nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02218naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002700148245017100175300001800346500002400364520079600388650001901184650002801203650003501231650001901266650001701285650002301302650004301325650002101368650002601389650003901415650002701454700002401481700001801505700002101523700001801544700001501562700002101577773010101598852000901699856008801708655001201796IND4420805520221117214012.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442080552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrzeskowiak, Julita K.10aTwo-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis for comparison of affinity and non-affinity based downstream processing of recombinant monoclonal antibody  ap. 4902-4912.  aIncludes references  aAlthough Staphylococcus Protein A (SpA) affinity chromatography is the state of the art capture step for antibody purification, non-affinity methods are more economical.

Efficiencies were similar in sodium dodecylsulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and size-exclusion chromatography; however, 2-D DIGE revealed higher efficiency with SpA than with CEX capture. Thus, 2-D DIGE is a valuable tool for downstream process development. 3aStaphylococcus 3aaffinity chromatography 3acation exchange chromatography 3acultured cells 3afluorescence 3agel chromatography 3ahydrophobic interaction chromatography 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3asodium dodecyl sulfate1 aTscheliessnig, Anne1 aToh, Poh Choo1 aChusainow, Janet1 aLee, Yih Yean1 aWong, Niki1 aJungbauer, Alois0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 June 12, v. 1216, no. 24 p.4902-4912dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02199naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011600167300001600283520092000299650002701219650001501246650002601261650002201287650001401309650002701323650001301350650001001363650001401373651001101387653001401398653000801412700002601420700002101446700003101467700002701498773011301525852000901638856008601647930003301733946001101766655001201777IND4391482920221117213337.0070522e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439148292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-006-9013-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚliwka, Jadwiga 10aMating Type, Virulence, Aggressiveness and Metalaxyl Resistance of Isolates of Phytophthora Infestans in Poland  ap. 155-166.  aA total of 93 single-lesion isolates of Phytophthora infestans were collected from late blight diseased potatoes grown in several locations in Poland, in the years 2002-2004. They were tested for mating type, virulence, aggressiveness and metalaxyl resistance. Sixty one percent of the isolates was of the A1 and 39% of the A2 mating type. Regarding virulence, complex races predominated. Most of the isolates were highly and moderately aggressive. Among isolates, tested together with 38 previously collected (1995-2001) ones, 14.5% was metalaxyl resistant, 3.5% intermediately resistant and 82.0% of the isolates was sensitive to metalaxyl. In addition, 14 isolates tested with three simple sequence repeat markers showed high genetic diversity. These data indicate that Polish population of P. infestans is diverse and aggressive, with potential for sexual recombination and spreading of fungicide insensitivity. 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aaggression 3agenetic recombination 3agenetic variation 3ametalaxyl 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apotatoes 3araces 3avirulence 3aPoland 0adiversity 0aSSR1 aSobkowiak, Sylwester 1 aLebecka, Renata 1 aAvendaño-Córcoles, Jose 1 aZimnoch-Guzowska, Ewa 0 tPotato research.g2006 Oct., v. 49, no. 3 p.155-166dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0014-30657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-006-9013-23Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245010100166300001800267520149900285650000801784650002501792650001401817650001201831650001801843650001401861650002301875650000901898650003101907650001501938650001801953650003001971650000902001650002802010650003002038650001302068650002902081650003302110650006602143650002402209650005502233653003202288653002802320653002802348700001402376700001502390773008002405852000902485939003302494946001302527655001202540IND9300222320221117213943.0930112e199212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930022232DNAL7 a13315192pmid7 aPMC2404282pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarlix, J.L.10aAnalytical study of avian reticuloendotheliosis virus dimeric RNA generated in vivo and in vitro  ap. 7245-7252.  aThe retroviral genome consists of two identical RNA molecules associated at their 5' ends by a stable structure called the dimer linkage structure. The dimer linkage structure, while maintaining the dimer state of the retroviral genome, might also be involved in packaging and reverse transcription, as well as recombination during proviral DNA synthesis. To study the dimer structure of the retroviral genome and the mechanism of dimerization, we analyzed features of the dimeric genome of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) type A and identified elements required for its dimerization. Here we report that the REV dimeric genome extracted from virions and infected cells, as well as that synthesized in vitro, is more resistant to beat denaturation than avian sarcoma and leukemia virus, murine leukemia virus, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 dimeric RNA. The minimal domain required to form a stable REV RNA dimer in vitro was found to map between positions 268 and 452 (KpnI and SalI sites), thus corresponding to the E encapsidation sequence (J. E. Embretson and H. M. Temin, J. Virol. 61:2675-2683, 1987). In addition, both the 5' and 3' halves of E are necessary in cis for RNA dimerization and the extent of RNA dimerization is influenced by viral sequences flanking E. Rapid and efficient dimerization of REV RNA containing gag sequences in addition to the E sequences and annealing of replication primer tRNA(Pro) to the primer-binding site necessitate the nucleocapsid protein. 3aRNA 3anucleotide sequences 2a3T3 Cells 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Line 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDogs 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGenes, gag 2aGenome, Viral 2aMacromolecular Substances 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotides 2aPlasmids 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Transfer, Proxgenetics 2aRNA, Viralxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aReticuloendotheliosis virusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aavian reticuloendotheliosis 0amolecular sequence data 0adimer linkage structure1 aGabus, C.1 aAllain, B.0 tJournal of virology.g1992 Dec., v. 66, no. 12 p.7245-7252x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03611naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001800146245013300164300001800297500001500315520178100330650001702111650001302128650001202141650001602153650001002169650004102179650004602220650005202266650001302318650002302331650002402354650002402378650001102402650001102413650000902424650001602433650005102449650002202500650003002522653001502552653001602567700001802583700001702601700001602618700001802634700001402652700001502666700001302681700001402694700001602708773019302724852000902917930003302926945002502959946001302984655001202997IND4364460420221117213402.0040915e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436446042DNAL7 a153112182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Although evaluated in a number of trials, its efficacy remains in dispute. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of chitosan for weight loss in overweight and obese adults. DESIGN AND SETTING: A 24-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at the University of Auckland between November 2001 and December 2002. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 250 participants (82% women; mean (s.d.) body mass index, 35.5 (5.1) kg/m2; mean age, 48 (12) y) INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive 3 g chitosan/day (n = 125) or placebo (n = 125). All participants received standardised dietary and lifestyle advice for weight loss. Adherence was monitored by capsule counts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in body weight. Secondary outcomes included changes in body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage, blood pressure, serum lipids, plasma glucose, fat-soluble vitamins, faecal fat, and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: In an intention-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward, the chitosan group lost more body weight than the placebo group (mean (s.e.), -0.4 (0.2) kg (0.4% loss) vs + 0.2 (0.2) kg (0.2% gain), P = 0.03) during the 24-week intervention, but effects were small. Similar small changes occurred in circulating total and LDL cholesterol, and glucose (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups for any of the other measured outcomes. CONCLUSION: In this 24-week trial, chitosan treatment did not result in a clinically significant loss of body weight compared with placebo. 3ablood lipids 3achitosan 3aobesity 3aweight loss 2aAdult 2aAnti-Obesity Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aChitinxanalogs & derivativesxtherapeutic use. 2aChitosan 2aCholesterolxblood 2aDietary Supplements 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxbloodxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWeight Lossxdrug effects 0aoverweight 0abody weight1 aPoppitt, S.D.1 aMcGill, A.T.1 aLeahy, F.E.1 aBennett, D.A.1 aLin, R.B.1 aOrmrod, D.1 aWard, L.1 aStrik, C.1 aRodgers, A.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g2004 Sept., v. 28, no. 9 p.1149-1156x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a20060410b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/04/10  aOther US 7aarticle02996naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006900126300001600195500001500211520192600226650002102152650001902173650001402192650001502206650000902221650002302230650001102253650002502264650002202289650002102311650001102332653002202343653002302365653001802388653001102406700001702417700001602434773007102450852000902521939003302530946001102563655001202574IND9300230320221117213714.0930112s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930023032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeber, M.A.10aGenetic differences in clonal demography in Eichhornia crassipes  ap. 329-341.  a2019-12-04  aThe demography of four clones of Eichhornia crassipes, each grown in isolation, was studied to determine: (i) if clones derived from four locations varied genetically, in the growth of leaf and ramet populations, in leaf morphology and in biomass; (ii) how developmental processes accounted for clonal variation in demography; and (iii) how clones differed in their response to increasing ramet population density. Plants from each clone were grown outdoors, and the births of all leaves, ramets and inflorescences were recorded. Clones differed in the growth of leaf and ramet populations, because of differences in rates of leaf production and flowering rather than in rates of ramet production per leaf axillary bud. Leaves and inflorescences arise from apical meristems while ramets are the products of leaf axillary buds. Thus developmental processes involving apical meristems rather than axillary buds accounted for demographic variation between clones. Clones with the higher rates of leaf production had larger populations of leaves and ramets. However, because flowering consumes the apical meristem and temporarily slows leaf and ramet production, flowering intensity, was negatively correlated with vegetative growth among clones. Total biomass and the components of biomass varied between clones harvested after 1-5 and 40 days of growth. Leaf or ramet population sizes were not correlated with clone biomass, because clones with few leaves and ramets tended to have large leaves and ramets, and vice versa. Eichhornia is heterophyllic, producing float leaves with small blades and expanded petioles or canopy leaves with large blades and long petioles. Clones differed in their propensity to produce float or canopy leaves. In response to increasing ramet density, all clones shifted leaf morphology, reduced ramet production, and increased flowering, but they, differed in the magnitude of their responses. 3aapical meristems 3ainflorescences 3aflowering 3ademography 3abuds 3abiomass production 3aclones 3aEichhornia crassipes 3agenetic variation 3aplant morphology 3aleaves 0aplant development 0ageographical races 0aplant anatomy 0aramets1 aWatson, M.A.1 aFurnish, R.0 tJournal of ecology.g1992, v. 80, no. 2 p.329-341x0022-04777nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02435naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011100125300001600236500001500252520132400267650001901591650001601610650002101626650001901647650001501666650002301681650003201704650001601736650002301752651001701775651001501792653001601807653002201823700001701845700002001862773010001882852000901982939003301991946001302024655001202037IND9303888720221117212259.0930629e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930388872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, B.D.10aIn situ measurement of microbial activity and controls on microbial CO2 production in the unsaturated zone  ap. 647-659.  a2019-12-04  aCarbon dioxide concentrations were measured at various depths and times in the unsaturated zones of two hydraulically and geochemically contrasting field sites, one in southeastern Washington state, and the other in south central Saskatchewan. In situ CO2 production rates were calculated from a mass balance that accounted for diffusive fluxes and partitioning of CO2 into an adverting aqueous phase. Production rates were compared with (1) microbial abundance and (2) subsurface temperature to determine whether subsurface CO2 production rates could be expressed as a simple function of these two variables. At the Washington site, subsurface production was successfully expressed as a function of microbial abundance and temperature for a large portion of the year, but not near the end of the growing season. Although subsurface microbes and organic carbon were more abundant at the Saskatchewan site, subsurface CO2 production rates were generally several orders of magnitude lower than at the Washington site, and no correlation could be established between microbial numbers, temperature, and production rate. The cases where production rates could not be expressed as a function of microbial numbers and temperature suggested conditions in which some other factor, such as nutrient limitations, was controlling. 3acarbon dioxide 3acorrelation 3asoil temperature 3abioremediation 3asoil depth 3aseasonal variation 3abiological activity in soil 3ameasurement 3amicrobial activity 3aSaskatchewan 0aWashington 0arespiration 0asubsurface layers1 aKeller, C.K.1 aJohnstone, D.L.0 tWater resources research.g1993 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.647-659wJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01356naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009100127300001600218520051400234650001500748650001000763650001100773650001500784650002400799650001400823650001300837650001900850653001800869773010200887852000900989939003300998946001101031655001201042IND9303888020221117212316.0930629e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930388802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, M.C.12aA mathematical model of the force exerted by the teatcup liner on the dairy cow's teat  ap. 211-217.  aA mathematical model has been developed in an attempt to provide a means of predicting the force applied to a cow's teat by the teatcup liner during milking.

Two calves were vaccinated with culture-derived B. divergens exoantigens, and two others were treated with control supernatant; both preparations were adjuvanted with Quil-A saponin. A parasite-specific humoral response was observed after the first vaccine injection and was boosted by two succeeding vaccine injections. Sera from the two vaccinated calves immunoprecipitated eight major parasitic proteins (with molecular masses ranging between 17 and 110 kDa) whose patterns were close to those observed in gerbil vaccine assays. The cellular immune response, monitored by lymphoproliferation assays, was slightly delayed in comparison with the humoral response; a significant proliferation occurred only after the second vaccine injection. Mononuclear cell proliferation was dose dependent in the presence of (i) lysates of B. divergens-parasitized erythrocytes, (ii) exoantigens of the whole supernatant, or (iii) protective exoantigens of two low-molecular-mass fractions obtained after supernatant gel filtration chromatography. An infectious challenge was administered 3 weeks after the third vaccine injection, with 3.6 X 10(10) B. divergens-parasitized erythrocytes. Erythrocyte count, rectal temperature, and parasitemia of the animals were monitored daily until they returned to initial values. All parameters indicated that the exoantigens induced protection from B. divergens infection for the two vaccinated calves. 3acattle 3aBabesia divergens 3aimmune response 3avaccination1 aPrecigout, E.1 aL'Hostis, M.1 aCarcy, B.1 aGorenflot, A.1 aSchrevel, J.0 tInfection and immunity.g1993 Feb., v. 61, no. 2 p.734-741x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01337naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010000126300001600226500001500242520036500257650002900622650001600651650001600667650002300683653002800706653003100734653002000765653003300785700001500818700001600833700001600849773006900865852000900934939003300943946001100976655001200987IND9300228120221117212742.0930112s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930022812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPassoth, V.14aThe electrophoretic banding pattern of the chromosomes of Pichia stipitis and Canadida shehatae  ap. 429-431.  a2019-12-04  aThe electrophoretic karyotype of fu1ur strains of P. stipitis and five strains of C. shehatae were compared by means of OFAGE and TAFE techniques.

Polyclonal antibodies against three proteins (SpvA, -B, and -C) expressed from a 4.1-kb EcoRI subclone of the plasmid virulence region were generated. These antibodies were used to detect expression of the Spv proteins when S. dublin was grown in vitro under stress-inducing conditions, such as nutrient deprivation and increased temperature, that the bacteria may encounter during the course of infection within the host. Glucose starvation resulted in expression of all three proteins shortly after the lag phase. When the bacteria were grown to the late-log phase without glucose, heat shock strongly induced expression of SpvA but not SpvB or SpvC. The addition of 0.2% glucose to the medium resulted in loss of expression of the proteins until the late-log to stationary phase. Iron limitation or lowered pH induced expression of the proteins during exponential growth even in the presence of glucose. Insertion mutations into the positive regulator gene spvR upstream from spvABC and insertions into spvA and spvC resulted in loss of expression of SpvA, -B, and -C, suggesting a complex regulation of expression. These studies define a variety of environmental conditions that induce expression of the Spv virulence proteins from the wild-type plasmid pSDL2 in S. dublin in vitro. 3avirulence 3aSalmonella Dublin 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aIronxmetabolism 2aPlasmids 2aRabbits 2aSalmonellaxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aTemperature 2aVirulence 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin1 aChikami, G.K.1 aMiller, V.L.0 tInfection and immunity.g1993 Feb., v. 61, no. 2 p.705-713x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02707naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245014900125300001800274500001500292520170700307650001502014650002202029650002002051650001402071650001902085650002002104650002502124650001002149650001902159653001802178700001602196773009202212852000902304939003302313946001102346655001202357IND9300228820221117212758.0930112e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930022882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolf, S.J.10aAnalysis of in vivo protein synthesis and histological studies of haustorial formation in root cultures of witchweed (Striga asiatica L. Kuntze)  ap. 1339-1348.  a2019-12-04  aWe recently described an in vitro approach that uses root cultures to study haustorial formation in Striga asiatica. Previous studies have used haustoria formed on intact radicles of Striga seedlings. In vitro cultured roots formed haustoria that appeared morphologically similar to those formed by Striga radicles, but were 5-10-fold larger. In this study, we provide biochemical and histological evidence to support further the similarity of root culture haustoria to haustoria formed on radicles of seedlings. We examined in vivo protein synthesis during haustorial development on root cultures and radicles by 2-D PAGE. Four proteins increased in abundance in both root cultures and radicles after 6 h of haustorial induction. All four proteins appeared transiently in root cultures and radicles, being more abundant at 6 h, and less abundant after 24 h of haustorial induction. Only three of the four haustorial-specific proteins were more abundant in root cultures after 2 h of haustorial induction: all four had increased in abundance after 12 h of haustorial induction. Using light microscopic analysis we compared the ontogeny of root culture haustoria to that of haustoria on radicles. These studies revealed that root culture haustoria undergo developmental changes similar to those reported for radicle haustoria such as early expansion of cortical cells, the emergence of haustorial hairs from epidermal cells, and the development of densely staining cells at the haustorial apex. In addition, these changes occurred within a similar time-frame and sequence in root culture and radicle haustoria. Finally, root culture haustoria were found to be capable of attaching to sorghum host roots. 3aparasitism 3aprotein synthesis 3aStriga asiatica 3ahistology 3aplant proteins 3aSorghum bicolor 3acell differentiation 3aroots 3atissue culture 0aplant anatomy1 aTimko, M.P.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1992 Oct., v. 43, no. 255 p.1339-1348x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02566naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245008900142300001600231520117700247650001501424650002001439650001901459650001201478650003401490650002101524650002501545650001501570650002401585650001101609650004301620650002001663650001001683650000901693650002501702650004701727650004401774650003601818650003801854650002601892650002901918700001301947773007101960852000902031939003302040946001102073655001202084IND9303886720221117212834.0930630e19930415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930388672DNAL7 a80966272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreig, S.10aHomeotic genes autonomously specify one aspect of pattern in the Drosophila mesoderm  ap. 630-632.  aTransplantation and ablation experiments have led to the generalization that in insects the mesoderm is naive, and that pattern is imposed upon it by the ectoderm. This has been demonstrated directly by mosaic analysis for the can of one muscle in Drosophila. The unique character of this muscle depends on the activity of sex-determining and homeotic genes, not in the muscle itself, but in the nerve that innervates it. Indirect evidence suggests, however, that homeotic genes specify some aspects of mesoderm patterning autonomously. Homeotic genes are expressed in the mesoderm, and are regulated in a segment-specific pattern analogous to, but different from, that seen in the ectoderm. Moreover, the effects of homeotic mutations on the muscles do not always mirror transformations seen in the epidermis. Here we examine this problem directly, by expressing homeotic genes ectopically in the mesoderm without altering their expression in the overlying ectoderm. We find that the pattern of adult muscle precursor cells characteristic of the thorax can be converted to that seen in the abdomen by expressing the homeotic gene abdominal-A specifically in the mesoderm. 3aDrosophila 3agene expression 3amuscle tissues 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aDrosophila 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aFemale 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Homeobox 2aLarva 2aMale 2aMesodermxmetabolism 2aMusclesxcytologyxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aTranscription Factors 2aTwist-Related Protein 1.1 aAkam, M.0 tNature.g1993 Apr. 15, v. 362, no. 6421 p.630-632x0028-08367nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02507naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245013900149300001600288500001500304520055700319650002400876650002100900650001000921650002000931650002500951650002200976650002200998650002501020650001301045650001701058650001901075650005301094650002401147650004601171650001801217650002501235650002901260650002301289650000801312650003001320650002601350650003401376650003201410650002801442650002501470650002401495650003401519653001401553653002101567653001101588653001601599653002801615653002301643653002301666700001701689700001701706773006901723852000901792939003301801946001101834655001201845IND9300228020221117212841.0930112s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930022802DNAL7 a14237302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScaramuzzi, C.D.10aIdentification of a chloroplast-encoded secA gene homologue in a chromophytic alga: possible role in chloroplast protein translocation  ap. 421-427.  a2019-12-04  aSecA is one of seven Sec proteins that comprise the prokaryotic protein translocation apparatus. A chloroplast-encoded secA gene has been identified from the unicellular chromophytic alga Pavlova lutherii. The gene predicts a protein that is related to the SecA proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The presence of seca, as well as the previously described secY and hsp70 genes, on the chloroplast genome of P. lutherii suggests that this eukaryotic organism utilises protein translocation mechanisms similar to those of bacterial cells. 3arestriction mapping 3astructural genes 3aalgae 3achloroplast DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3amembrane proteins 3aprotein transport 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 3achloroplasts 3aplant proteins 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aEukaryotaxmetabolism 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aMembrane Transport Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProteinsxmetabolism 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0amembranes 0apavlova lutherii 0agenome 0aembl/x65961 0amolecular sequence data 0aalgae and seaweeds 0asecretory proteins1 aHiller, R.G.1 aStokes, H.W.0 tCurrent genetics.g1992, v. 22, no. 5 p.421-427x0172-80837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01878naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009700168300001600265520088500281650001901166650001201185650001301197653002301210653000801233653001101241700002301252700002501275773011301300852000901413856008601422930003301508946001101541655001201552IND4391483420221117212802.0070522e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439148342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-007-9019-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDöring, Thomas F.10aRepresentation of Potato Virus Y Control Strategies in Current and Past Extension Literature  ap. 225-239.  aThe aphid-vectored Potato virus Y (PVY) is currently seen as an important limiting factor in the production of potatoes in many countries. Using a content-analysis approach, we investigated the German extension literature for recommendations regarding the control of PVY. Media included articles from periodicals addressing farmers and agricultural textbooks published in the last five decades (1955-2004). In the current literature (1995-2004), the clearly dominating strategy was found to be insecticidal control, although this strategy has been subject to some criticism in the scientific literature. Over the last five decades we also found a strongly increasing representation of insecticidal strategies. Furthermore, over this period of time, information diversity, measured as the number of different strategies proposed per article or per textbook, decreased consistently. 3aPotato virus Y 3afarmers 3apotatoes 0aKnowledge transfer 0aPVY 0aVector1 aSchrader, Joachim 1 aSchüler, Christian.0 tPotato research.g2006 Oct., v. 49, no. 3 p.225-239dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0014-30657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11540-007-9019-43Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03396naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100002100174245008000195300001600275500002400291500001500315520151500330650001601845650002301861650002101884650001101905650002701916650002301943650002101966650001601987650001602003650001702019650002002036650001502056650001602071650001002087650002802097650000902125650001702134650002102151650001102172650001102183650000902194650002302203650002102226650002702247650002102274650001602295651001202311651002702323653000902350653001802359653001702377700001702394700002802411773010502439852000902544856008602553930003302639945002502672946001302697655001202710IND4436667320221117212630.0100507e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443666732DNAL7 a200834392pmid7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2008.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aOlumakaiye, M.F.10aFood Consumption Patterns of Nigerian Adolescents and Effect on Body Weight  ap. 144-151.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aObjective: Association between nutritional status of adolescents and food consumption pattern. Design: Data on number of meals and snacks consumed daily were collected using structured questionnaires. Nutritional status was assessed as weight-for-age body mass index score less than fifth percentile of the National Center for Health Statistics/World Health Organization International Growth Reference. Setting: Cross-sectional studies of adolescents using multistage random sampling procedure. Participants: 401 adolescents from 32 secondary schools in Osun State, Nigeria. Analysis: Frequency counts, percentages, and cross-tabulation analysis were used to analyze data, analysis of variance was used to test the differences, as well as chi-square analysis. Level of significance was taken at .05 and .01 levels. Results: 66.1% of adolescents ate 3 meals daily; this percentage was higher among rural (75.4%) than urban (61.4%) children (P < .001). About 33.0% consumed snacks daily but to a varying degree, which was higher among urban than rural adolescents (P = .002). Prevalence of underweight was 20.1%, more common in rural (22.1%) than urban adolescents (18.7%). Underweight prevalence was highest among those who ate 3 meals and no snacks daily (28.6%) and least among those who ate 3 meals and snacks twice daily (15.9%). Conclusion: Snacks are important in food consumption among adolescents; when snacks are consumed in addition to 3 meals, they will improve the nutritional status of adolescents. 3afood intake 3anutritional status 3arural population 3asnacks 3ageographical variation 3adisease prevalence 3aurban population 3aunderweight 3aadolescents 3afood choices 3abody mass index 2aAdolescent 2aBody Weight 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiet 2aDiet Surveys 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aRural Population 2aThinnessxepidemiology 2aUrban Population 2aYoung Adult 3aNigeria 0aNigeriaxepidemiology. 0adiet 0aeating habits 0ameals (menu)1 aAtinmo, Tola1 aOlubayo-Fatiregun, M.A.0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2010 , v. 42, no. 3 p.144-151dDeckerx1499-40467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2008.12.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100722b20100807c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/06/03  aOther US 7aarticle02601naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245004900200300001600249500002400265500001500289520086700304650000901171650001201180650001601192650000901208650001501217650001401232650001701246650002401263650002001287650001101307650001001318650001501328650002201343650003201365650002701397650001501424650001201439650002501451650002701476650002701503650002101530650003201551651000901583653001501592653002101607653003701628700001901665700001601684773010001700852000901800856008501809930003301894945002501927946001101952655001201963IND4436666620221117212627.0100507e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443666662DNAL7 a201532442pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2010.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aOuyang, Yidan10aHybrid sterility in plant: stories from rice  ap. 186-192.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aHybrid sterility is the most common form of postzygotic reproductive isolation in plants. The best-known example is perhaps the hybrid sterility between indica and japonica subspecies of Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.). Major progress has been reported recently in rice in identifying and cloning hybrid sterility genes at two loci regulating female and male fertility, respectively. Genetic analyses and molecular characterization of these genes, together with the results from other model organisms especially Drosophila, have advanced the understanding of the processes underlying reproductive isolation and speciation. These findings also have significant implications for crop genetic improvement, by providing the feasibility and strategies for overcoming intersubspecific hybrid sterility thus allowing the development of intersubspecific hybrids. 3arice 3ahybrids 3agrain crops 3aloci 3aandroecium 3agynoecium 3aOryza sativa 3agenetic improvement 3aplant fertility 3azygote 3agenes 3aprovenance 3amolecular cloning 3ainterspecific hybridization 3areproductive isolation 3aDrosophila 2aAlleles 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Locixgenetics 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPlant Infertilityxgenetics 3aAsia 0aspeciation 0ahybrid sterility 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aLiu, Yao-Guang1 aZhang, Qifa0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2010 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.186-192dPergamonx1369-52667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2010.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20110614b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03325naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007400126300001600200500001500216520221000231650003202441650001002473650001802483650001502501653002602516653001302542700001602555700001802571700001502589700001902604700001602623700002602639700001602665773019002681852000902871930003302880945001302913946001302926655001202939IND2196281120221117212341.0990105e199807  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219628112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamboni, M.10aSagittal abdominal diameter as a practical predicator of visceral fat  ap. 655-660.  a2019-12-05  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships between the supine sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) and visceral fat, as well as to evaluate intra- and inter-observer reliability of sagittal diameter measurement. PATIENTS: Twenty-eight women ranging in age from 27-78y with a body mass index (BMI) ranging from 16.9-48.1 kg/m2 and 23 men ranging in age from 32-75y with BMI ranging from 20-41.6 kg/m2. MEASUREMENT: Body fat distribution was measured by waist circumference, waist to hip ratio (WHR), SAD, anthropometrically assessed and a single slice of computed tomography (CT) at the L4-L5 level. RESULTS: In both genders, a significant association was found between visceral adipose tissue (AT) and SAD, as evaluated by CT (women r = 0.80; men r = 0.83, P < 0.001), and SAD by anthropometry (women r = 0.76; men r = 0.82, P<0.001), as well as between visceral AT and waist circumference (women r = 0.76, men r = 0.86, P<0.001) and WHR (women r = 0.57, P < 0.01, men r = 0.80, P < 0.001). A significant association was also found between subcutaneous AT and SAD by anthropometry (women r = 0.79, men r = 0.74, P < 0.001). After adjusting for BMI, the association between subcutaneous AT and SAD was no longer significant in men and only moderately significant in women (r = 0.42, P<0.05), while the association between visceral AT and SAD by anthropometry remained significant in both genders (women r = 0.63, P < 0.001; men r = 0.66, P < 0.001). When the subjects were divided into two groups according to BMI (lean to moderately overweight women with BMI < 28 and men with BMI < 30 and obese women with BMI > 28 and men with BMI > 30) we found that the relationships between SAD by anthropometry, as well as SAD by CT and visceral AT, were higher in lean to moderately overweight subjects than in those who were obese. High inter-observer correlation was found concerning SAD measurement (r = 0.99, P < 0.001). Intra- and interobserver precision as evaluated by coefficient of variation and intraclass correlation coefficient for SAD measurement was very high. CONCLUSION: Our study shows the usefulness of SAD by anthropometry to predict visceral fat and its very high inter- and intra-observer precision. 3aanthropometric measurements 3awomen 3aabdominal fat 3aprediction 0abody fat distribution 0abody fat1 aTurcato, E.1 aArmellini, F.1 aKahn, H.S.1 aZivelonghi, A.1 aSantana, H.1 aBergamo-Andreis, I.A.1 aBosello, O.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g1998 July, v. 22, no. 7 p.655-660x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02710naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168072000900186100001900195245005200214300001600266500002400282500001500306506007600321520079800397506003701195650001701232650002201249650002601271650001701297650001401314650001601328650001401344650001401358650001101372650002501383650001501408650002001423650001401443650001301457650001901470650000801489650003101497650001301528650001001541650002501551650003801576650002801614650002701642650002001669650002101689650001501710653001101725653001501736700002201751773010001773852000901873856008501882930003301967945002502000946001102025655001202036IND4436666120221207125144.0100507e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443666612DNAL7 a200314772pmid7 aPMC28805712pmcid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2009.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aJackson, Scott10aGenomic and expression plasticity of polyploidy  ap. 153-159.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolyploidy or whole genome duplication (WGD) occurs throughout the evolutionary history of many plants and some animals, including crops such as wheat, cotton, and sugarcane. Recent studies have documented rapid and dynamic changes in genomic structure and gene expression in plant polyploids, which reflects genomic and functional plasticity of duplicate genes and genomes in plants. Common features of uniparental gene regulation and nonadditive gene expression in regulatory pathways responsive to growth, development, and stresses in many polyploids have led to the conclusion that epigenetic mechanisms including chromatin modifications and small RNAs play central roles in shaping molecular and phenotypic novelty that may be selected and domesticated in many polyploid plants and crops.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aplant growth 3aplant development 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aplant stress 3aphenotype 3aepigenetics 3achromatin 3aevolution 3agenome 3abiochemical pathways 3apolyploidy 3agene expression 3aGossypium 3agenomics 3aabiotic stress 3aRNA 3agene expression regulation 3aTriticum 3acrops 2aBiological Evolution 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenome, Plantxgenetics 2aHybridization, Genetic 2aModels, Genetic 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPolyploidy 0aplants 0asmall RNAs1 aChen, Z.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional design to compare body composition estimated by BIA to body composition measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which was the reference method. SUBJECTS: One hundred twenty three overweight women participated in this study, of which 43 women were African-American (aged 37.2 +/- 5.6 y; BMI, 32.3 +/- 4.9 kg/m2) and 80 were Caucasian (aged 36.1 +/- 5.7 y; BMI, 31.9 +/- 3.5 kg/m2). MEASUREMENTS: Body composition was estimated from BIA using both a generalized and an obesity-specific equation. These estimations were compared to body composition measured by DEXA, which was the reference method. RESULTS: The generalized BIA equation underestimated lean body mass (LBM) by 2.6 +/- 3.1 kg in Caucasian women and 0.4 +/- 3.2 kg in African-American women, with the difference between the ethnic groups being significant (P<0.001). The obesity-specific equation underestimated LBM in Caucasians by 0.9 +/- 3.1 kg and overestimated LBM in African-Americans by 1.2 +/- 2.8kg (P<0.001). An ethnic-specific equation is proposed, and cross-validation of this equation indicates that it provides a reasonable estimate of body composition in overweight women. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of BIA to estimate body composition appears to be affected by the ethnicity of the individual. Therefore, an ethnic-specific equation for overweight women is proposed. However, further validation of this prediction model in an ethnically diverse population is necessary. 3amathematical models 3awomen 3abody composition 3abody measurements 3aobesity 3anutrition assessment 3aBlacks 3aadults 0aevaluation 0abioelectric potential 0anationalities and ethnic groups 0aimpedance1 aWing, R.R.1 aLang, W.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g1998 Mar., v. 22, no. 3 p.243-249x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02717naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002100191245008100212300001600293500002400309500001500333520094600348650001401294650001901308650001201327650002401339650002101363650002501384650002001409650001501429650002101444650002601465650001301491650002401504650002801528650001601556650003101572650001001603650004001613650002501653650003401678650001201712650001301724650001401737653001101751653002301762653001801785700002501803773010001828852000901928856008501937930003302022945002502055946001102080655001202091IND4436665620221117212411.0100507e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443666562DNAL7 a200222892pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2009.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF100 0aF6001 aFriesen, Maren L10aAdapting genomics to study the evolution and ecology of agricultural systems  ap. 119-125.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the face of global change, agriculture increasingly requires germplasm with high yields on marginal lands. Identifying pathways that are adaptive under marginal conditions is increasingly possible with advances at the intersection of evolutionary ecology, population genetics, and functional genomics. Trait-based (reverse ecology) approaches have connected flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana to single alleles with environment-specific effects. Similarly, genetic dissection of rice flooding tolerance enabled the production of near-isogenic lines exhibiting tolerance and high yields. An alternative gene-forward (forward ecology) approach identified candidate genes for local adaptation of Arabidopsis lyrata to heavy-metal rich soils. A global perspective on plant adaptation and trait correlations provides a foundation for breeding tolerant crops and suggests populations adapted to marginal habitats be conservation priorities. 3agermplasm 3aplant breeding 3aalleles 3agenetic correlation 3acropping systems 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3acrop yield 3aplant adaptation 3aenvironmental factors 3agenomics 3apopulation genetics 3aplant genetic resources 3aagriculture 3agene expression regulation 3acrops 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aBiological Evolution 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aEcology 2aGenomics 2aPhenotype 0agenome 0aliterature reviews 0aplant ecology1 avon Wettberg, Eric J0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2010 Apr., v. 13, no. 2 p.119-125dPergamonx1369-52667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2009.11.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02729naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168072000900186072000900195100002900204245009000233300001600323500002400339500001500363506007600378520074300454506003701197650002601234650002001260650001301280650001101293650001901304650002501323650002601348650002301374650001801397650001301415650001501428650001801443650001501461650003101476650001701507650001601524650001001540650003801550650003901588650002201627650002101649650002001670650003801690653002301728653001101751700002001762700002201782773010001804852000901904856008501913930003301998945002502031946001102056655001202067IND4436665720221207125142.0100507e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443666572DNAL7 a200366122pmid7 aPMC28620832pmcid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2009.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF6001 aMoreno-Risueno, Miguel A10aOmics meet networks—using systems approaches to infer regulatory networks in plants  ap. 126-131.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany genomic-scale datasets in plants have been generated over the last few years.

Because hyperinsulinemia frequently accompanies abdominal obesity, it is unclear whether each is independently related to lipid abnormalities. Dietary saturated fat may influence these associations since it is associated with elevated lipid levels, obesity and hyperinsulinemia. Abdominal obesity (indexed as abdomen-to-hip circumference ratio), serum insulin level and dietary saturated fat intake were examined in relation to serum levels of lipids and lipoproteins in 878 male participants of the Normative Aging Study. Abdomen-to-hip ratio and insulin level were inversely related to high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (r = -0.17 and -0.21, respectively), and positively related to triglycerides (r = 0.25 and 0.36, respectively). Saturated fat intake was positively related to body mass index (r = 0.20), abdomen-to-hip ratio (r = 0.13), and insulin level (r = 0.10). in multiple linear regression models, abdomen-to-hip ratio was positively related to triglycerides and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after adjusting for the effects of body mass index, alcohol intake, age, cigarette smoking and physical activity level, but was not significantly related to HDL-C. When serum insulin level was included as a covariate, abdomen-to-hip ratio remained significantly related to LDL-C and triglycerides, although its relationship with triglycerides was attenuated, insulin level remained inversely related to HDL-C and triglycerides in multivariate models which adjusted for the effects of abdomen-to-hip ratio and BMI. Further adjustment for saturated fat intake did not significantly influence any of the relationships of abdomen-to-hip ratio or insulin level with the lipid variables. These cross-sectional data suggest that abdominal obesity is related to triglycerides and LDL-C, although part of the influence of abdominal obesity appears to be mediated by hyperinsulinemia. Saturated fat intake is associated with abdominal obesity and hyperinsulinemia but does not appear to influence the relationships of obesity and hyperinsulinemia with lipids and lipoproteins. 3aobesity 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3ainsulin 3alipoproteins 3asaturated fatty acids 3amen 3aabdominal fat 0aaging1 aSparrow, D.1 aVokonas, P.S.1 aWillett, W.C.1 aLandsberg, L.1 aWeiss, S.T.0 tInternational journal of obesity and related metabolic disorders : journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity.g1994 Mar., v. 18, no. 3 p.137-144x0307-05657nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle01725naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245004800165300001400213520067700227650001300904650001400917650002000931650001400951650001300965650001900978650001300997653002101010653001301031700002201044700002001066700002201086773010501108852000901213856008501222930003301307946001101340655001201351IND4399459920221117213019.0071230e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439945992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-007-9028-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Berloo, R. 13aAn Online Potato Pedigree Database Resource  ap. 45-57.  aAt the Laboratory of Plant Breeding of Wageningen University, a large amount of pedigree data on current and historic potato cultivars and progenitors has been collected over many years.

We compared in growing and in adult uremic rats diets containing limited or usual amounts of protein (12%, 20% for growing rats, and 10% and 16% for adult rats) with diets containing 50% or 60% less casein plus a KA/EAA mixture providing KA at an equimolar amount of removed EAA or at higher amounts. The latter supplement caused stunting, the former caused no anorexia, a slight growth deficit when added to the lowest basal casein diets, and almost normal growth when added to higher casein diets. Growth was normal with EAA supplements. The plasma EAA changes were unrelated to intake and to growth. Thus, KA utilization is maximal, provided that basal protein is sufficient and KA are not in excess. 3auremia 3aexperimental diets 3aketo acids 3anutritional adequacy 3aessential amino acids 3afood intake 3aweight gain 3anitrogen metabolism 3acarcass composition 3arats 2aAmino Acids, Branched-Chainxblood 2aAmino Acids, Essentialxadministration & dosagexbloodxtherapeutic use. 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEating 2aKeto Acidsxadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aMale 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aUreaxblood 2aUremiaxdiet therapy 2aWeight Gain 0agrowth 0aanalogs1 aLaouari, D.1 aBurtin, M.1 aParvy, P.R.1 aKleinknecht, C.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1992 Dec., v. 56, no. 6 p.1025-1033x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02716naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245011300162300001600275500001500291520110400306650001301410650001501423650001101438650002301449650002301472650001801495650002201513650002201535650001501557650001401572650001201586650003101598650001401629650003201643650001101675650001901686650006501705650007901770650000901849650001301858650001601871650001401887653001201901700001801913700001401931700001501945700001701960700001701977773008901994852000902083939003302092946001302125655001202138IND9300216020221117212711.0930112e199105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930021602DNAL7 a19053232pmid7 aPMC2699212pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPine, L.10aCytopathogenic effects in enterocytelike Caco-2 cells differentiate virulent from avirulent Listeria strains  ap. 990-996.  a2019-12-04  aWe have developed a simple test that differentiates between virulent and avirulent Listeria species as defined by the mouse 50% lethal doses (LD50S). The assay is based on trypan blue-revealed cytopathogenic effects that are produced during the infection of the human enterocytelike cell line Caco-2. These effects were elicited only by Listeria strains that had an intraperitoneal mouse LD50, less than 10(6) and were not produced by nonhemolytic, avirulent strains of Listeria monocytogenes generated spontaneously or by Tn916 mutagenesis or by avirulent Listeria species. A negative test was also obtained with hemolysin-producing, avirulent L. monocyotogenes NCTC5105 and Listeria ivanovii KC1786. The test was negative with avirulent L. monocytogenes strains which are strong inducers of opacity in egg yolk agar. However, a strain which has a low LD50, such as 10(4), may show less severe cytopathogenic effects than a strain having a higher LD50, such as 10(8). The test has been effectively used to screen for virulent listerial isolates, spontaneous mutants, and transposon-induced mutants. 3aListeria 3ahemolysins 3aassays 3afood contamination 3astrain differences 3arapid methods 3acytopathogenicity 3agenetic variation 3acell lines 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aBacteriological Techniques 2aCell Line 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aHumans 2aLethal Dose 50 2aListeriaxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aListeria monocytogenesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aMice 2aMutation 2aTrypan Blue 2aVirulence 0astrains1 aKathariou, S.1 aQuinn, F.1 aGeorge, V.1 aWenger, J.D.1 aWeaver, R.E.0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g1991 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.990-996x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03447naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011100164300001300275520189900288650002302187650001202210650001002222650001502232650001402247650002702261650001602288650002602304650002002330650001102350650001102361650000902372650001402381650001302395650002002408650002102428650002202449651001002471653001602481653001502497653002302512653002102535653002102556700001902577700001802596700001802614700001902632773010402651852000902755856008502764930003302849946001102882655001202893IND4399459620221117212724.0071230e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439945962DNAL7 a10.1007/s11540-007-9023-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParveen Kumar.10aInfluence of Source and Time of Potassium Application on Potato Growth, Yield, Economics and Crisp Quality  ap. 1-13.  aField studies were conducted at the Central Potato Research Institute Campus, Modipuram (India), during two seasons (2003-2004 and 2004-2005), with two processing cultivars (cvs Kufri Chipsona-1 and Kufri Chipsona-2) and nine combinations of potassium source (K-chloride, K-sulphate and K-nitrate) and time of K application (basal dressing, split application and split application + foliar spray) to investigate their effect on tuber yield and processing attributes for crisp production under subtropical conditions. Yearly variations were observed for most of the variables studied. Between cultivars, the tuber and biomass yield was higher in cv. Kufri Chipsona-1, whereas specific gravity, tuber dry-matter percentage and crisp recovery were higher in cv. Kufri Chipsona-2. Stem number, plant height and compound leaf number were not influenced by sources of K fertilizer or application time. Processing-grade tuber yield, total tuber yield and biomass yield were statistically similar for K-chloride and K-sulphate and lower for K-nitrate. K sources affected both specific gravity and tuber dry-matter percentage significantly; K-sulphate and K-nitrate gave significantly higher values than K-chloride. The application time had no significant effect on processing grade and total tuber yield or on tuber specific gravity and dry-matter percentage. Values for crisp colour and reducing sugars were within the acceptable range for all treatments. Crisp yields were calculated to be highest and oil percentage of the crisps to be lowest when K-sulphate was applied as K fertilizer. Net income and benefit:cost ratio were highest for K-chloride followed by K-sulphate and lowest for K-nitrate. The study suggests that for crisping potatoes, K-sulphate is more suited than K-chloride, as it not only increased tuber dry-matter percentage and crisp yield, but also decreased crisp oil percentage. 3aapplication timing 3abiomass 3acolor 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3afertilizer application 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3afoliar spraying 3aincome 3aleaves 3aoils 3apotassium 3apotatoes 3areducing sugars 3aspecific gravity 3asplit application 3aIndia 0aCrisp yield 0aDry matter 0aK-fertilizer forms 0aProcessed potato 0aSplit fertilizer1 aPandey, S.

This high value product requires high quality fresh meat to avoid processing problems. The Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1 (SREBF1) is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of fatty acid synthesis in muscle and adipose tissues. The SREBF1 gene, its regulating genes SCAP and MBTPS1, and one of its target genes, SCD, were investigated for associations with several meat quality traits of San Daniele hams. Significant associations of some gene markers were found with carcass weight, lean percentage, backfat thickness, ham green weight, ham fat cover thickness, shear force (WBSF), salting losses and instrumental colour of both lean and fat. These findings provide initial evidences that SNPs in SREBF1, SCAP, MBTPS1 and SCD are associated with San Daniele ham quality and may be considered as markers for selective breeding programs. 3adried meat 3athickness 3aswine breeds 3acarcass weight 3asalting 3atraditional foods 3araw meat 3agenetic markers 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3acured meats 3atranscription factors 3ashear strength 3aadipose tissue 3aham 3aselection criteria 3abackfat 3alipid content 3ameat quality 3acolor 3alean meat 3abreeding lines 2aAnimals 2aColor 2aDietary Fats 2aFood Technology 2aGenetic Markers 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMeatxstandards 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMuscle Proteinsxgenetics 2aMuscle, Skeletalxmetabolism 2aOrgan Size 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProprotein Convertasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStearoyl-CoA Desaturasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStress, Mechanical 2aSwinexgenetics 3aItaly 0abinding proteins1 aPiasentier, E.1 aFan, B.1 aVitale, M.1 aPrandi, A.1 aRothschild, M.F.0 tMeat science.g2010 July, v. 85, no. 3 p.441-445dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.02.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20100615b20100703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/06/15  aNon-US 7aarticle01054naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245008500134300001600219500005700235500003600292520011500328650002700443650001300470650001400483650001200497653003800509653002400547653002800571773006800599852000900667939003300676945000800709946001100717655001200728991619831290742620221117212413.0831028e198305  xx |||||o|||||||||||rus||7 aPAR830095992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharpilo, V.P.10aReptiles of the fauna of the USSR, intermediate and reservoir hosts of helminths  ap. 177-184.  aTitle in original language could not be transcribed.  aIn Russian; Summary in English.  aroles of reptiles as intermediate or paratenic hosts of helminths, ecological and evolutionary factors, review 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aNematoda 3aevolution 3aecology 0aAcanthocephal[a] (Acanthocephala) 0aCestod[a] (Cestoda) 0aTrematod[a] (Trematoda)0 tParazitologiia.g1983 , v. 17, no. 3 p.177-184x0031-18477nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831028c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03408naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195100001900204245013300223300001600356500002400372520114200396650000901538650001301547650002401560650001901584650002101603650002201624650002601646650002701672650002501699650002901724650001701753650001801770650001701788650001701805650001701822650001501839650001801854650003001872650002301902650001701925650001901942650001801961650001201979650002601991650001302017650001102030650002202041650001902063650002202082650002002104650001102124650001802135650003502153650002102188650001402209650001802223650001002241650001102251653002302262700001802285700001602303700001602319773008802335852000902423856008902432930003302521945002502554946001102579655001202590IND4436985020221117212350.0100514e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443698502DNAL7 a204167992pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ302 0aQ112 0aQ202 0aQ5021 aCastellano, P.10aProtective action of Lactobacillus curvatus CRL705 on vacuum-packaged raw beef.

For this purpose, L. curvatus CRL705, producer of lactocin 705 and lactocin AL705, was inoculated on the meat surface (10⁶ cfug⁻¹). This microorganism became the dominating population throughout the storage period controlling the growth of Brochothrix thermosphacta and spoilage lactic acid bacteria naturally present on the meat. When the microstructural characteristics of the meat were evaluated using light microscopy, beef samples inoculated with the bioprotective culture showed a 10days delay for the appearance of tissue degradation signs. Sensory analysis demonstrated that beef samples treated with L. curvatus CRL705 only developed an “acid” off-flavor after 60days of refrigerated storage, and no undesirable off-odors were found. Therefore, inoculation with this bacteriocinogenic strain would provide an additional hurdle to improve storage life of refrigerated vacuum-packaged beef without affecting its sensory and structural characteristics. 3abeef 3araw meat 3ameat packing plants 3afood packaging 3avacuum packaging 3anatural additives 3afood biopreservatives 3aLactobacillus curvatus 3alactic acid bacteria 3aantibacterial properties 3alactococcins 3afood surfaces 3afood storage 3acold storage 3astorage time 3ashelf life 3afood spoilage 3aBrochothrix thermosphacta 3asensory evaluation 3abeef quality 3amicrostructure 3arefrigeration 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agents 2aBacteria 2aCattle 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Packaging 2aFood Preservation 2aFood Technology 2aHumans 2aLactobacillus 2aMeatxmicrobiologyxstandards. 2aMuscle, Skeletal 2aOdorants. 2aRefrigeration 2aTaste 2aVacuum 0aprotective culture1 aGonzález, C.1 aCarduza, F.1 aVignolo, G.0 tMeat science.g2010 July, v. 85, no. 3 p.394-401dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2010.02.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100615b20100703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/06/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02418naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001400168245011400182300001600296500002400312500001500336520091200351650001801263650001301281650001901294650001801313650002601331650002101357650002201378650001401400650001601414653001201430653001501442653006501457653001601522653001601538653001501554700001901569700001601588700001801604700001701622773009301639852000901732856009001741930003301831945002501864946001101889655001201900IND4436984220221117212346.0100514e20101001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443698422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ200 0aQ5001 aZhang, Yu10aMulti-wall carbon nanotube film-based electrochemical sensor for rapid detection of Ponceau 4R and Allura Red  ap. 909-913.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe monitoring of synthetic colourants in foods is very important due to their potential toxicity and pathogenicity. Herein, an electrochemical sensor for rapid and simple detection of Ponceau 4R and Allura Red was constructed using multi-wall carbon nanotube (MWNT) sensing film. In pH 7.0 phosphate buffer, two oxidation peaks are observed at 0.56 and 0.68V for Ponceau 4R and Allura Red. Because of its large surface area and high accumulation efficiency, the MWNT film sensor remarkably enhances the oxidation signals of Ponceau 4R and Allura Red. The detection parameters such as pH value, amount of MWNT, accumulation potential and time were optimised. The MWNT film sensor possesses high sensitivity to Ponceau 4R and Allura Red, and the limits of detection are as low as 15 and 25μgL⁻¹. Finally, the MWNT sensor was successfully used to detect Ponceau 4R and Allura Red in different soft drinks. 3afood analysis 3aazo dyes 3ananotechnology 3arapid methods 3aequipment performance 3afood composition 3aartificial colors 3adetection 3afood safety 0asensors 0aAllura Red 0amulti-wall carbon nanotube film-based electrochemical sensor 0anew methods 0amethodology 0aPonceau 4R1 aZhang, Xiaojun1 aLu, Xiaohua1 aYang, Jinquan1 aWu, Kangbing0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 1, v. 122, no. 3 p.909-913dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0353Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01159naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115245015100136300001600287500003700303520017300340650001000513651001000523653002300533653007100556653002700627653003100654700001800685773008100703852000900784939003300793945000800826946001100834655001200845991619830830742620221117212355.0831102e198305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830097132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrivastava, R.K.10aRetrocerebral endocrine complex of a phthirapteran parasite, Laemobothrion percnopteri (Mallophaga: Amblycera), infesting Indian scavenger vulture  ap. 106-112.  aSummaries in German and Russian.  aLaemobothrion percnopteri, description of retrocerebral endocrine complex, first report of presence of neurosecretory cells, neurosecretory material, and their pathways 3abrain 3aIndia 0aGlands, Arthropoda 0aLaemobothrion percnopteri (Arthropoda)Neophron percnopterus (Host) 0aMorphology, Arthropoda 0aNervous system, Arthropoda1 aAgarwal, G.P.0 tAngewandte Parasitologie.g1983 May, v. 24, no. 2 p.106-112x0003-31627nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831102c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02422naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100001800186245012700204300001600331500002400347500001500371520086500386650002101251650002101272650003101293650001601324650001301340650002101353650002301374650001501397650002101412653001101433653001501444653002301459700001201482700001401494700001901508700001401527700001601541700001301557700002001570700001701590773009301607852000901700856009001709930003301799945002501832946001101857655001201868IND4436983020221117212535.0100514e20101001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443698302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aS200 0aT300 0aX3801 aBai, Naisheng10aFlavonoids from Rabdosia rubescens exert anti-inflammatory and growth inhibitory effect against human leukemia HL-60 cells  ap. 831-835.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEight flavonoids, 5,8,4′-trihydroxy-6,7,3′-trimethoxyflavone (1), 5,4′-dihydroxy-6,7,8,3′-tetramethoxyflavone (2), nodifloretin (3), pedalitin, (4), penduletin (5), cirsiliol (6), luteolin (7), and quercetin (8), were isolated from the aerial parts of Rabdosia rubescens.

Of the three doses, 1.0kGy was most effective in maintaining a high level of firmness. Samples treated with 1.0kGy also exhibited smaller initial declines in soluble protein, higher increases in total sugar content and lower levels of malondialdehyde accumulation. Furthermore, 1.0kGy promoted the accumulation of phenolics compound and showed higher antioxidant ability during storage. At higher doses, 2.0kGy resulted in a higher microbial reduction, but showed negative effects on texture, chemical properties and functional components. All the gamma irradiation were effective in retarding mushroom sensory deterioration. Thus, application of gamma irradiation in combination with MAP can extend the storage life of shiitake mushroom up to 20d. 3agamma radiation 3afood irradiation 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aphysicochemical properties 3amicrobiological quality 3aLentinula edodes 3amushrooms 3afood processing quality 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3ashelf life1 aLuo, Shasha1 aChen, Qiuping1 aShen, Lirong1 aYing, Tiejin0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 1, v. 122, no. 3 p.761-767dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0503Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02135naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245012000169300001600289500002400305520095700329650002101286650001801307650001001325650001601335650001401351650002101365650001201386650001001398700002701408700002201435700001801457700002701475700003101502700002201533773010001555852000901655856008501664655001201749IND4420919220221117212603.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442091922DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-009-0483-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, Klaus-Peter14aThe hybrid histidine kinase Slr1759 of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp.

Among these are hybrid histidine kinases with one or two response regulator domains as well as numerous Hiks with several sensory domains. One example is the hybrid histidine kinase Slr1759 (Hik14) that has two PAS domains arranged in tandem linked to a predicted GAF domain. Here, we show that a Slr1759 derivative recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli has a flavin cofactor. Using truncated Slr1759 variants, it is shown that the flavin associates with the first PAS domain. The cofactor reconstitutes the activity of d-amino acid oxidase apoprotein from pig kidney, indicating that the flavin derivative is FAD. Furthermore, the Slr1759 histidine kinase domain indeed undergoes autophosphorylation in vitro. The phosphorylated product of a recombinant Slr1759 derivative is sensitive to acids, pointing to a histidine residue as the phosphate-accepting group. 3aEscherichia coli 3aSynechocystis 3aacids 3aapoproteins 3ahistidine 3ahistidine kinase 3akidneys 3aswine1 aSchröder, Ann-Kristin1 aZimmermann, Maike1 aBrandt, Sonja1 aPistorius, Elfriede K.1 aFrankenberg-Dinkel, Nicole1 aStaiger, Dorothee0 tArchives of microbiology.g2009 June, v. 191, no. 6 p.553-559dSpringer-Verlagx0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-009-0483-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01915naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245010900174300001600283500002400299520069800323650002801021650002101049650001401070650001501084650002401099650001401123650001401137650001001151650002801161650001201189650002401201700002201225700002101247700002901268700002601297773010001323852000901423856008501432655001201517IND4420918720221117212600.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442091872DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-009-0475-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarreño-López, Ricardo10aCharacterization of chsA, a new gene controlling the chemotactic response in Azospirillum brasilense Sp7  ap. 501-507.  aIncludes references  aWe report, here, the characterization of a mutant strain of Azospirillum brasilense Sp7 impaired in surface motility and chemotactic response.

Genetic complementation and nucleotide sequencing led to the identification of a new gene, named chsA. The deduced translation product, ChsA protein, contained a PAS sensory domain and an EAL domain.

The coupled model includes the regional climate model (RegCM3) as atmospheric component and the regional ocean modeling system (ROMS) as oceanic component. The two-way coupled model system exchanges sea surface temperature (SST) from the ocean to the atmospheric model and surface wind stress and energy fluxes from the atmosphere to the ocean model. The coupled model is run for four years 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the results are compared with observations and atmosphere-only model runs employing Reynolds SSTs as lower boundary condition. It is found that the coupled model captures the main features of the Indian monsoon and simulates a substantially more realistic spatial and temporal distribution of monsoon rainfall compared to the uncoupled atmosphere-only model. The intraseasonal oscillations are also better simulated in the coupled model compared to the atmosphere-only model. These improvements are due to a better representation of the feedbacks between the SST and convection and highlight the importance of air-sea coupling in the simulation of the Indian monsoon. 3aclimate models 3aenergy 3amonsoon season 3arain 3asurface temperature 3awind1 aGiorgi, Filippo1 aKaginalkar, Akshara1 aCozzini, Stefano0 tClimate dynamics.g2009 July, v. 33, no. 1 p.119-139dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-008-0433-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03356naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002000184245014600204300001600350500002400366500001500390520174900405650001702154650001902171650000902190650001602199650001402215650001302229650001702242650002402259650001802283650002002301650001602321650002702337650002302364650002102387650002802408650001202436651000902448653001602457653001602473653001702489700002702506773009102533852000902624856008802633930003302721945002502754946001102779655001202790IND4436976720221117213037.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443697672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2009.12.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF820 0aE200 0aH000 0aJ7101 aBrown, Peter R.10aChanges in farmers' knowledge, attitudes and practices after implementation of ecologically-based rodent management in the uplands of Lao PDR  ap. 577-582.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRodents are a severe and chronic pest for farmers in the upland farming system of Lao PDR where upland rice is the predominant subsistence crop. Farmers participated in developing and implementing a series of ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM) strategies designed to reduce the impact of rodents in their upland farming system. These were tested in replicated Treatment and Reference sites in two provinces of northern Laos. A survey was conducted with farmers to determine their knowledge, attitudes and practices prior to and after the implementation of EBRM. This paper reports on the results of the post-implementation survey and compares results with the pre-implementation survey. The survey revealed that rodents remained the most important pest for these farmers. The mean estimated yield loss of upland rice was 12%. There was a significant reduction in the yield loss from pre- to post-treatment, but the time by treatment interaction was not significant. Trapping rodents in the fields remained the most important control strategy for these farmers and also was considered the most effective method. There was an increase in effort expended by farmers in controlling rodents post-treatment on Treatment sites in Luang Namtha, but no difference for other sites. The money spent on controlling rodents was lower on all sites post-treatment except for Treatment sites in Luang Namtha. Farmers on the Treatment sites in Luang Namtha had the lowest effort during the pre-treatment period and thought they needed to increase their rodent management efforts because of their involvement in this project. As a result of the project, farmers were more aware of the problems of rodents and were interested in adopting EBRM strategies. 3afarm surveys 3arodent control 3arice 3agrain crops 3aknowledge 3atrapping 3aOryza sativa 3aextension education 3acost analysis 3aeconomic impact 3agrain yield 3aagricultural education 3afarmers' attitudes 3avertebrate pests 3asustainable agriculture 3arodents 3aLaos 0amethodology 0anew methods 0ayield losses1 aKhamphoukeo, Khamouane0 tCrop protection.g2010 June, v. 29, no. 6 p.577-582dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2009.12.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20100808b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/01  aNon-US 7aarticle03398naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001800184245015500202300001600357500002400373520151500397650001801912650001601930650001601946650001801962650002701980650001802007650002502025650002902050650001702079650001402096650001402110650002802124650004102152650002202193650002302215650001702238650001902255650001402274650002002288650002302308650002502331650002402356650002102380650001602401700002102417700001602438700002102454700002802475773009102503852000902594856008802603930003302691945002502724946001102749655001202760IND4436976920221117213019.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443697692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2010.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF500 0aF300 0aF1201 aKumar, Harish10aWilt disease management and enhancement of growth and yield of Cajanus cajan (L) var.

Both strains produced IAA, siderophore, solubilized insoluble phosphate, showed chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase activities, and strongly inhibited the growth of Fusarium udum. It also caused degradation and digestion of cell wall components, resulting in hyphal perforations, empty cell (halo) formation, shrinking and lysis of fungal mycelia along with significant degeneration of conidia. LPK2 produced volatile cyanogen (HCN). Combinations of S. fredii KCC5 and P. fluorescens LPK2 with half dose of chemical fertilizers showed a significant increase in seed germination (94%) while seed germination with co-inoculated strains (KCC5 + LPK2), KCC5 and LPK2 alone was 90, 84 and 82% respectively as compared to control 77%. After 120 days of sowing, per plant number of pods, nodules, shoot length, root length, shoot weight and root weight were greater for the combination with half dose of chemical fertilizers compared to the control. Combinations of S. fredii KCC5 and P. fluorescens LPK2 with half dose of chemical fertilizers resulted in an 82% increase in grain yield per hectare compared to the control. Both strains KCC5 and LPK2 led to proto-cooperation as evidenced by synergism, aggressive colonization of the roots, and enhanced growth, suggesting potential biocontrol efficacy against Fusarium wilt in C. cajan. 3aCajanus cajan 3apigeon peas 3afield crops 3aFusarium udum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aFusarium wilt 3aSinorhizobium fredii 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aroot nodules 3asymbiosis 3asymbionts 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3asuppressive soils 3aindole acetic acid 3asiderophores 3abeta-glucanase 3achitinase 3aenzyme activity 3afungal antagonists 3acell wall components 3amechanism of action 3aseed germination 3afertilizers1 aBajpai, Vivek K.1 aDubey, R.C.1 aMaheshwari, D.K.1 aKang, S.

However, minimal information is available on their effectiveness, including Dalotia (formerly Atheta) coria ria (Kraatz), which is a reported biological control agent of fungus gnats (Bradysia spp.) in greenhouses. In this study, predation by D. coriaria on Bradysia sp. nr. coprophila, was investigated in small containers (473 ml) in the laboratory using different numbers and ratios of predators and prey. In tests with 1-5 rove beetle adults and 10-40 fungus gnat larvae, predation was greatest at each prey density when four rove beetle adults were released, and lowest at three of four prey densities when five adult rove beetles were released. Per capita prey consumption was greatest when only one rove beetle was present, and predation efficiency decreased as predator numbers increased. This inverse relationship was strongest at the highest prey density (40 fungus gnat larvae). Thus, while using four rove beetle adults in conjunction with 10-40 fungus gnat larvae increased overall effectiveness (number of prey consumed), increasing the number of predators negatively affected predation efficiency. When predator and prey numbers were increased, the level of predation also increased, but only at the highest predator-prey ratio (1 :5). At lower predator- prey ratios (1:10 and 1:20), adjusting numbers of predators and prey had no effect on predation. Based on our results, when used appropriately, D. coria ria may be a viable augmentative biological control agent of fungus gnats in greenhouse production systems. 3aparasitoids 3aStaphylinidae 3acrystal proteins 3afield experimentation 3apest resistance 3aadults 3agreenhouses 3asoil ecology 3abiological control agents 3aproduction technology 3aplant-incorporated protectants 3apredatory arthropods 3aplant pests 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3atemporal variation 3asoil arthropods 3aisogenic lines 3aZea mays 3afungus gnats 3aRhopalosiphum padi 3agreenhouse production 3aBradysia 3acorn 3apredation 3alarvae 3anontarget organisms 3aadverse effects 3agrain crops 3atransgenic plants 3acontainers 3aHungary 0a

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Secondary analyses of data from 6,562 diabetic individuals aged greater-than-or-equal18 years from the nationally representative Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2002 to 2005 were performed. Outcome measures included receipt of seven diabetic services plus five barriers to care. RESULTS: More than 84% of diabetic individuals in the U.S. had full-year coverage and a USC; 2.3% had neither one. In multivariate analyses, the uninsured with no USC had one-fifth the odds of receiving A1C screening (odds ratio 0.23 [95% CI 0.14-0.38]) and one-tenth the odds of a blood pressure check (0.08 [0.05-0.15]), compared with insured diabetic individuals with a USC. Similarly, being uninsured without a USC was associated with 5.5 times the likelihood of unmet medical needs (5.51 [3.49-8.70]) and three times more delayed urgent care (3.13 [1.53-6.38]) compared with being insured with a USC. Among the two groups with either insurance or a USC, diabetic individuals with only a USC had rates of diabetes-specific care more similar to those of insured individuals with a USC. In contrast, those with only insurance were closer to the reference group with fewer barriers to care. CONCLUSIONS: Insured diabetic individuals with a USC were better off than those with only a USC, only insurance, or neither one. Policy reforms must target both the financing and the delivery systems to achieve increased receipt of diabetes services and decreased barriers to care.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3ablood pressure 3adiabetes 3afunding 3ahealth insurance 3ahealth services 3aissues and policy 3amultivariate analysis 3aodds ratio 3ascreening 3asurveys 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aRacial Groups. 2aDelivery of Health Carexeconomicsxstandards. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxeconomics 2aEducational Status 2aEmploymentxstatistics & numerical data 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aInsurance, Healthxeconomicsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aMedically Uninsuredxstatistics & numerical data 2aMinority Groupsxstatistics & numerical data 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aSocioeconomic Factors. 2aYoung Adult 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aTillotson, Carrie J.1 aWallace, Lorraine S.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.983-989dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc09-00253Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01341naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245004200151300001600193500002300209520019300232650002600425650001000451650001800461650001500479650001000494650002300504650001800527650001100545650003000556650001800586650001900604650000900623650002500632650002600657650002500683653001700708700001900725773009000744852000900834939003300843945000800876946001100884655001200895991619827330742620221117212422.0831123e198309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830103182DNAL7 a63565302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnongbu, I.C.10aPlasma lipid changes in human malaria  ap. 193-196.  aSummary in German.  aPlasmodium falciparum patients, increase in plasma levels of phospholipids and triglycerides was statistically significant, decrease in plasma cholesterol was not statistically significant 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3ablood 2aAcute Disease 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCholesterolxblood 2aConvalescence 2aHumans 2aHyperlipidemiasxetiology 2aLipidsxblood 2aMalariaxblood 2aMale 2aPhospholipidsxblood 2aPlasmodium falciparum 2aTriglyceridesxblood 0aLipids, Host1 aOnyeneke, E.C.0 tTropenmedizin und Parasitologie.g1983 Sept., v. 34, no. 3 p.193-196x0303-42087nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831123c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02604naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002500168245009800193300001600291500002400307520134300331650002501674650001501699650002001714650001801734650002101752650002401773650002801797700001701825700001801842700002101860700002201881700001801903773009301921852000902014856009002023930003302113945002502146946001102171655001202182IND4436981020221117212459.0100514e20101001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443698102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ5001 aIsolabella, Santiago10aStudy of the bioactive compounds variation during yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) processing  ap. 695-699.  aIncludes references  aIlex paraguariensis St. Hil. (Aquifoliaceae) (yerba mate) is one of the most used plant species in South America due to its nutritional and medicinal properties. The industrial processing involves different stages (green leaves, zapecado, drying, forced or natural aging) which can modify the qualitative and quantitative composition and the pharmacological activities. In this work, the main compounds, caffeoyl derivatives (caffeic acid, mono- and dicaffeoylquinic acids), methylxanthines (caffeine and theobromine) and flavonoids (rutin, quercetin and kaempferol) were studied by HPLC in extracts obtained by decoction of samples of a large amount of I. paraguariensis during its industrial process stages. The comparative quantitative analysis of all the samples indicated that those obtained after the zapecado, drying and aging stages possess higher content of biologically active principles when compared with green leaves. No differences were found between the natural and forced aging processes. This is the first complete report on the quantitative variation of the bioactive compounds of I. paraguariensis during each step of the industrial processing. The results obtained in this work provide a guideline for the obtention of extracts enriched in biological principles for the pharmaceutical, food and cosmeceutical industry. 3abioactive properties 3ayerba mate 3afood processing 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aIlex paraguariensis 3afood processing quality1 aCogoi, Laura1 aLópez, Paula1 aAnesini, Claudia1 aFerraro, Graciela1 aFilip, Rosana0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 1, v. 122, no. 3 p.695-699dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0393Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03361naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002400178245013100202300001800333500002400351506007600375520108000451506003701531650002201568650001401590650002001604650002001624650001401644650001201658650001201670650000801682650004301690650001201733650001501745650001701760650002401777650000901801650002201810650003401832650002001866650001901886650001901905650003401924650004901958650002902007650002102036650001502057650004702072650001102119650000902130650001602139650004502155650002402200650002402224700001902248700001502267700001602282700002102298700002002319700002402339700002202363700001802385700002202403773010402425852000902529856007702538655001202615IND4420881920221207125145.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442088192DNAL7 a192898582pmid7 aPMC26810252pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-22162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColangelo, Laura A.10aAssociation of Endogenous Sex Hormones With Diabetes andImpaired Fasting Glucose in Men: Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis  ap. 1049-1051.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To assess associations of sex hormones with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and type 2 diabetes in men. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 3,156 African American, Non-Hispanic white, Hispanic, and Chinese-American men aged 45-84 years who participated in the baseline visit of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) were included. Oddsratios and95% CIs for type 2 diabetes and IFG compared with normal fasting glucose for quartiles of hormones were estimated. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, ethnicity, BMI, and waist circumference, IFG and diabetes were associated inversely with total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and positively with estradiol (E2). Dehydroepiandrosterone was positively associated with IFG but not with diabetes. Associations did not differ across ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of obesity, total testosterone and SHBG were associated inversely and E2 was associated positively with IFG and diabetes in men. Further research is warranted to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aHispanics 3aatherosclerosis 3abody mass index 3aestradiol 3afasting 3aglucose 3amen 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3aprasterone 3atestosterone 3awaist circumference 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAtherosclerosisxepidemiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aCohort Studies 2aRacial Groups. 2aDehydroepiandrosteronexblood 2aDiabetes Complicationsxbloodxepidemiology. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxblood 2aEstradiolxblood 2aEthnicity. 2aGlucose Intolerancexbloodxcomplications. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSex Hormone-Binding Globulinxmetabolism 2aTestosteronexblood 2aWaist Circumference1 aOuyang, Pamela1 aLiu, Kiang1 aKopp, Peter1 aGolden, Sherita.1 aDobs, Adrian S.1 aSzklo, M.q(Moyses)1 aVaidya, Dhananjay1 aCushman, Mary1 aGapstur, Susan M.0 tDiabetes care.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.1049-1051dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-22163Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02779naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002100178245010600199300001800305500002400323506007600347520085200423506003701275650002901312650001501341650004001356650001401396650002201410650000901432650001001441650002001451650005601471650004501527650001801572650001101590650003701601650001101638650002001649650002401669650001401693650004201707650003601749650002401785650002601809700001901835700001601854700002601870700002801896700002401924700002301948700001601971773010401987852000902091856007702100655001202177IND4420881820221207125141.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442088182DNAL7 a192650242pmid7 aPMC26810382pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-20612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Dorte M.10aPeri-Conceptional A1C and Risk of Serious Adverse Pregnancy Outcome in 933 Women With Type 1 Diabetes  ap. 1046-1048.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To study the association between peri-conceptional A1C and serious adverse pregnancy outcome (congenital malformations and perinatal mortality). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prospective data were collected in 933 singleton pregnancies complicated by type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: The risk of serious adverse outcome at different A1C levels was compared with the background population. The risk was significantly higher when peri-conceptional A1C exceeded 6.9%, and the risk tended to increase gradually with increasing A1C. Women with A1C exceeding 10.4% had a very high risk of 16%. Congenital malformation rate increased significantly at A1C above 10.4%, whereas perinatal mortality was increased even at A1C below 6.9%.

Bunge, using a combination of ammonium sulphate fractionation and affinity chromatography. AML was found to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 31.5kDa. Biochemical characterisation revealed that it is a glycoprotein containing 10.7% neutral sugars. The N-terminus of AML was blocked but amino acid sequences of internal tryptic peptides showed moderate sequence identities with some other known lectins. Amongst the various carbohydrates tested, the lectin was best inhibited by d-galactose and its derivatives with pronounced preference for o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (8.3mM). The lectin was stable in the pH range of pH 5.0-12.0 and temperatures up to 55°C for 30min. AML inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and K562 cell lines. Thus, the lectin displays a high potential for antitumour activity. 3alectins 3aAstragalus membranaceus 3acell proliferation 3aherbal medicines 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aroots 3aplant extracts 3achemical analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3ahemagglutination inhibition test 3acell culture 0amonomeric lectin1 aZhu, Lifen1 aKumar, Narasimha1 aJiang, Zhengqiang1 aHuang, Linhua0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 1, v. 122, no. 3 p.589-595dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.03.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01040naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002100115242008100136245007400217300001800291500002400309520010800333650002600441651001600467653002100483700002000504700001900524700001800543773010400561852000900665939003300674945000800707946001100715655001200726991619827140742620221117212403.0831128e19821127xx |||||o|||||||||||dut||7 aPAR830103372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijkmans, B.A.C.12aA strain of Trichomonas vaginalis with reduced sensitivity for metronidazole14aEen voor metronidazol verminderd gevoelige Trichomonas vaginalis-stam  ap. 2193-2195.  aSummary in English.  aTrichomonas vaginalis, woman, case report, vaginitis, reduced sensitivity to metronidazole: Netherlands 3aTrichomonas vaginalis 3aNetherlands 0aResistance, Drug1 aPolderman, A.M.1 aHeintz, A.P.M.1 avan Furth, R.0 tNederlands Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde.g1982 Nov. 27, v. 126, no. 48 p.2193-2195x0028-21627nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19831128c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03169naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002800178245012500206300001800331500002400349506007600373520107600449506003701525650001601562650001301578650001901591650002001610650001201630650002201642650001501664650001501679650003001694650001001724650001901734650002701753650003401780650001101814650003101825650002701856650001101883650000901894650003601903650003701939650002401976650003102000650003202031650001602063700002102079700002002100700002302120700001902143700001902162700001802181700002402199700001802223700001602241700001902257700001702276773010402293852000902397856007702406655001202483IND4420881220221207125144.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442088122DNAL7 a192793042pmid7 aPMC26810162pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-19252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Riordan, Stephen M.P.10aValidation of Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Children and Adolescents With Cystic Fibrosis: A prospective cohort study  ap. 1020-1022.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To validate continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Paired oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) and CGM monitoring was undertaken in 102 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (age 9.5-19.0 years) at baseline (CGM1) and after 12 months (CGM2). CGM validity was assessed by reliability, reproducibility, and repeatability. RESULTS: CGM was reliable with a Bland-Altman agreement between CGM and OGTT of 0.81 mmol/l (95% CI for bias ± 2.90 mmol/l) and good correlation between the two (r = 0.74-0.9; P < 0.01). CGM was reproducible with no significant differences in the coefficient of variation of the CGM assessment between visits and repeatable with a mean difference between CGM1 and CGM2 of 0.09 mmol/l (95% CI for difference ± 0.46 mmol/l) and a discriminant ratio of 13.0 and 15.1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis, CGM performed on two occasions over a 12-month period was reliable, reproducible, and repeatable.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3achildren 3acohort studies 3acystic fibrosis 3aglucose 3aglucose tolerance 3amonitoring 2aAdolescent 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aChild 2aCohort Studies 2aCystic Fibrosisxblood 2aDiabetes Complicationsxblood 2aFemale 2aGlucose Intolerancexblood 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMonitoring, Ambulatoryxmethods 2aMonitoring, Physiologicxmethods 2aProspective Studies 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aYoung Adult1 aHindmarsh, Peter1 aHill, Nathan R.1 aMatthews, David R.1 aGeorge, Sherly1 aGreally, Peter1 aCanny, Gerard1 aSlattery, Dubhfeasa1 aMurphy, Nuala1 aRoche, Edna1 aCostigan, Colm1 aHoey, Hilary0 tDiabetes care.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.1020-1022dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-19253Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03996naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002100178245013300199300001800332500002400350506007600374520174300450506003702193650002002230650001802250650001302268650001402281650002002295650001102315650001402326650001902340650001102359650002102370650003602391650001202427650001502439650001402454650002402468650001002492650001502502650001002517650001902527650005202546650002302598650001502621650002702636650003802663650001102701650001902712650001102731650000902742650005602751650005902807650001402866650004202880650001602922650002002938650001602958651003302974700002403007700002203031700001903053773010403072852000903176856007703185655001203262IND4420881420221207125156.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442088142DNAL7 a192792992pmid7 aPMC26810412pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-21052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVahratian, Anjel10aFamily-Planning Practices Among Women With Diabetes and Overweight and Obese Women in the 2002 National Survey for Family Growth  ap. 1026-1031.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To examine contraceptive practices among diabetic women and obese women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the responses of 5,955 participants aged 20-44 years in the 2002 National Survey for Family Growth. Diabetes, BMI, desire for pregnancy, history of infertility treatment, sexual activity, parity, and demographic variables (age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, income, insurance, and smoking history) were obtained by self-report. Lack of contraception was defined as absence of hormonal-, barrier-, or sterilization-based methods. Associations among contraception, diabetes, and BMI category were assessed in multivariable logistic regression models in nonsterile, sexually active women. RESULTS: In unadjusted comparisons among sexually active women who were not sterilized, women with diabetes were more likely to lack contraception than women without diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 2.61 [95% CI 1.22-5.58]). Women with BMI greater-than-or-equal35 kg/m² were more likely to lack contraception than women with BMI <25 kg/m²(1.63 [1.16-2.28]), but associations between contraception use and lesser degrees of overweight and obesity were not significant. In multivariable models, women who were older (aged greater-than-or-equal30 vs. 20-29 years), were of non-Hispanic black race, were cohabitating, had a history of infertility treatment, and desired or were ambivalent about pregnancy were significantly more likely to lack contraception. The associations among diabetes, BMI, and contraception were no longer significant after these adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Older women with diabetes and obesity who desire pregnancy, regardless of pregnancy intention, should be targeted for preconceptive management.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3acontraception 3adiabetes 3aeducation 3afamily planning 3aincome 3ainsurance 3amarital status 3amodels 3anational surveys 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aobesity 3aodds ratio 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aRacial Groups. 2aDiabetes Mellitusxphysiopathologyxpsychology. 2aEducational Status 2aEthnicity. 2aFamily Characteristics 2aFamily Planning Servicesxmethods 2aFemale 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMale 2aObesityxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxpsychology. 2aOverweightxepidemiologyxphysiopathologyxpsychology. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complicationsxepidemiology 2aProbability 2aSexual Behavior 2aYoung Adult 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology.1 aBarber, Jennifer S.1 aLawrence, Jean M.1 aKim, Catherine0 tDiabetes care.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 6 p.1026-1031dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc08-21053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03214naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002000178245007000198300001800268500002400286506007600310520094600386506003701332650002001369650004301389650001501432650001301447650001501460650001701475650001601492650002401508650000901532650001601541650001601557650006001573650001101633650003501644650001101679650002501690650000901715650001601724650004201740650002301782650002001805650007401825650001701899650003001916650007601946650002702022650002402049700002102073700002102094700001702115700002602132700002002158700002202178700001802200700001802218700002602236700002002262700002002282773010402302852000902406856007702415655001202492IND4420881120221207125154.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442088112DNAL7 a192793032pmid7 aPMC26810242pmcid7 a10.2337/dc08-17762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, Gary D.10aObstructive Sleep Apnea Among Obese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes  ap. 1017-1019.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To assess the risk factors for the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among obese patients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Unattended polysomnography was performed in 306 participants. RESULTS: Over 86% of participants had OSA with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) greater-than-or-equal5 events/h. The mean AHI was 20.5 ± 16.8 events/h. A total of 30.5% of the participants had moderate OSA (15 [less-than or equal to] AHI <30), and 22.6% had severe OSA (AHI greater-than-or-equal30). Waist circumference (odds ratio 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.1; P = 0.03) was significantly related to the presence of OSA. Severe OSA was most likely in individuals with a higher BMI (odds ratio 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be particularly cognizant of the likelihood of OSA in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, especially among individuals with higher waist circumference and BMI.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aphysicians 3arisk factors 3asleep apnea 3awaist circumference 2aAged 2aBody Height 2aBody Weight 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxanalysis. 2aHumans 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPolysomnography 2aRespiration Disordersxclassificationxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aRisk Factors 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aSleep Apnea, Obstructivexcomplicationsxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aSleep, REMxphysiology 2aWaist Circumference1 aSanders, Mark H.1 aMillman, Richard1 aZammit, Gary1 aBorradaile, Kelley E.1 aNewman, Anne B.1 aWadden, Thomas A.1 aKelley, David1 aWing, Rena R.1 aPi-Sunyer, F.

Postharvest and processing times and temperatures were monitored at five different processing stages, in order to evaluate their impact on product quality and to compare their biochemical vs. their chronological age. Postmortem muscle spoilage indices were analysed (pH, nitrogen from total volatile bases, trimethylamine, histamine, peroxide value, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) and the K value was analysed as the freshness indicator. Inadequate temperature increments were detected during the canning process. Spoilage indices remained constant throughout the process, indicating that no deterioration occurred in the raw material. Concerning the K value, although sardine showed a good quality for canning, its freshness reduction occurred three times faster than would otherwise occur under optimum handling conditions (0°C), thus affecting (increasing) its biochemical age. Actual sardine management and treatment by the processor require better control during the canning process, thus reducing their impact on the freshness and biochemical age of sardine intended for this process. 3afood spoilage 3asardines 3aSardinops sagax 3amuscle tissues 3aseafoods 3acanning 3acanning quality 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3afreshness 3aquality control 0aMonterey sardines 0aSardinops sagax caerulea1 aVillalba-Villalba, A.G.1 aPacheco-Aguilar, R.1 aRamirez-Suarez, J.C.1 aLugo-Sánchez, M.E.1 aGarcía-Sánchez, G.1 aCarvallo-Ruíz, M.G.0 tFood chemistry.g2010 Oct. 1, v. 122, no. 3 p.482-487dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.05.0713Available from publisher's Web site  a20100804b20100903c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/06/23  aNon-US 7aarticle02199naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002100177245008400198300001600282500002400298520092800322650001101250650001601261650002401277650002701301650001601328650001301344650001801357650002301375650001201398653002001410653002901430700001601459700001701475773009301492852000901585856009001594930003301684945002501717946001101742655001201753IND4436978120221117212440.0100514e20101001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443697812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ124 0aQ504 0aQ1041 aMoayedallaie, S.10aBread improvers: Comparison of a range of lipases with a traditional emulsifier  ap. 495-499.  aIncludes references  aThis study compares three generations of lipase enzymes with the emulsifier, diacetyl tartaric esters of mono-glycerides (DATEM), on white wheat flour bread.

The field study was supplemented with spray-deposition measurements showing a throughfall at the soil surface of 15-45%, depending on the time of fungicide application. When propiconazole was amended to the soil in low dosages in laboratory conditions, the soil respiration was stimulated. Even at the very high and agriculturally unrealistic dosages in the laboratory experiment, the mean, daily soil respiration almost recovered within the incubation period of 30 days. Given the present conditions, the results did, however, also show that side-effects of the application of the fungicide were provoked at lower dosages in the field, and that they lasted for a considerably longer time than in the laboratory indicating the importance of indirect effects of fungicide application in field conditions. Possible reasons for the dose-response relationship in the field being different from the one found in the laboratory are discussed. 3acarbon dioxide 3athroughfall 3apropiconazole 3asoil depth 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiological activity in soil 3aapplication rate 0asurface layers 0amatric potential 0arespiration 0adeposition 0aincubation duration0 tPesticide science.g1992, v. 34, no. 2 p.139-146x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02716naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007900127300001500206500001500221520162700236650002301863650001501886650001501901650002501916650000901941650001501950650002201965650001101987651001401998653001902012653002102031653001402052653002402066653001702090700001802107700001702125700001802142773008102160852000902241939003302250946001102283655001202294IND9303891220221117212756.0930629e19930501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930389122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, G.V.10aField-scale transport from a buried line source in variably saturated soil  ap. 83-109.  a2019-12-04  aLateral subsurface flow through the upper soil layers (stormflow zone) during storm events has been shown to be a dominant mechanism of contaminant transport in forested watersheds. Data bases for multi-region flow and transport modeling for hydrogeologic conditions where stormflow predominates are lacking. Direct measurement of the tracer flux under field-scale conditions are non-existent. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the significance of three hydrologic pore regions to stormflow. Two tracer releases were made from a buried line source during storm events and the spatial and temporal variability in solute concentration and the tracer fluxes were measured. During one of the injections, macropore flow was extremely rapid with solute transport to a downslope trench 65 m from the line source taking just 3.2 h. Mesopore flow appeared to be significant for short distances in that tracer movement to solution samplers just 3 m downslope of the line source occurred within 3 h of the release. Soil sampling 6 months after the second release revealed that the tracer plume was refracted in the direction of the fractured bedding plane, and therefore did not coincide with the array of samplers for distances greater than 13 m downslope of the source. Soil sampling data suggested that micropores served as a sink/source for Br- with 47% of the non-reactive tracer remaining immobilized by micropores at the termination of the study. Interaction between the upper 2 m of the stormflow zone and the groundwater system was believed minimal; however, lateral flow below 2 m was concluded to be significant. 3atemporal variation 3amacropores 3amicropores 3asaturated conditions 3aflow 3awatersheds 3aspatial variation 3astorms 3aTennessee 0asurface layers 0alateral movement 0astormflow 0atransport processes 0acontaminants1 aJardine, P.M.1 aO'Dell, J.D.1 aCollineau, M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1993 May 1, v. 145, no. 1/2 p.83-109x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02504naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014800127300001400275520137600289650001501665650001601680650002101696650002701717650002001744650001801764650001301782650002201795651002201817653002601839653001401865653001701879653002401896653001801920700001601938700001901954773008001973852000902053939003302062946001102095655001202106IND9303890920221117212828.0930629e19930501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930389092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalama, R.B.10aPredictive modelling of management options for the control of dryland salinity in a first-order catchment in the wheatbelt of Western Australia  ap. 19-40.  aA prototype flow model has been developed for Cuballing catchment using MODFLOW. The results of the simulations showed that, in a first-order catchment, the management strategies most likely to arrest salinity were reforestation and pumping. The study confirmed that complete reforestation would arrest groundwater discharge and lead to the restoration of salinized land within the catchment. It also showed that replanting the top 25% of the catchment was sufficient to reverse the salinity trend by reducing groundwater discharge to an acceptable level. Drainage along the main stream line was also effective in reducing groundwater levels in the unconfined aquifer and constrained the discharge in the area adjacent to the stream. The simulations also showed that pumping reduced groundwater pressures in both the unconfined and confined aquifers. A single windmill discharging at a rate ranging from 15 to 25 m3 day-1 was sufficient to reduce water levels in the unconfined aquifer by more than 5 m and in the confined aquifer by more than 10 m. However, the pumping well must be correctly located in the catchment. The preferred location is in highly transmissive areas with adequate aquifer thickness and upstream from geological structures restricting groundwater flow. In Western Australia, these areas are usually along drainage lines and within discharge areas. 3awatersheds 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aland management 3aafforestation 3adrainage 3asimulation models 3aWestern Australia 0ahydraulic engineering 0adischarge 0asalinization 0agroundwater pumping 0amodflow model1 aLaslett, D.1 aFarrington, P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1993 May 1, v. 145, no. 1/2 p.19-40x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02692naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007800125300001400203500002400217520183100241650001302072650003102085650001102116650001502127650001202142651001702154773014802171852000902319856008602328655001202414IND4420373420221117212745.0090511s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442037342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Henry10aOpportunities and Challenges for Interdisciplinary Research and Education  ap. 83-91.  aIncludes references  aInterdisciplinary research and education (IDRE) holds center stage in current academic discussions. Despite the widespread agreement on the promises of IDRE, barriers for effective IDRE implementation remain significant. This study explored the opportunities and challenges of IDRE in integrated soil and water sciences at the Pennsylvania State University through a faculty survey and an educational project. The study revealed that: (1) co-advising graduate student is a common practice as a means of IDRE, and the overall positive aspects out-weigh the negative aspects; (2) joint faculty appointments receive mixed reactions, and are viewed by some as advantageous for the university but difficult for the faculty; (3) people issues are absolutely a critical aspect of successful IDRE; however, IDRE could also be accomplished by small groups or individuals; (4) synergistic approaches have not yet been commonly implemented, because IDRE collaborations often consist of faculty continuing piece-meal contributions independent of one another; (5) a new/renewed interdisciplinary undergraduate program in integrated soil and water sciences remains questionable as a viable solution to the declining undergraduate enrollment; (6) a potential new and broader graduate program appears to be promising, with a possible target on the emerging Critical Zone science (an interdisciplinary science that advocates the holistic studies of the Earth's near-surface environments, which extend from the top of vegetations to the bottom of aquifers); and (7) reward system needs to be enhanced to truly facilitate IDRE, and should be considered as a focus from both administration and practicality points of view. It is hoped, through such a study, that more true synergies can be realized through enhanced IDRE in academic environments. 3aaquifers 3ainterdisciplinary research 3apeople 3asoil water 3asurveys 3aPennsylvania0 tJournal of natural resources and life sciences education.g2008, v. 37 p.83-91dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl47890x1059-90537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.jnrlse.org/view/2008/e07-0001.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01665naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245006800132300001400200500002400214520082900238650001301067650001301080650002201093650001501115700002701130773014801157852000901305856008501314655001201399IND4420373320221117212810.0090511s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442037332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaville, David J.10aStatistical Measures, Hypotheses, and Tests in Applied Research  ap. 74-82.  aIncludes references  aThis article reviews and discusses the use of statistical concepts in a natural resources and life sciences journal on the basis of a census of the articles published in a recent issue of the Agronomy Journal and presents a flow chart and a graph that display the inter-relationships between the most commonly used statistical terms.

Gambier and quebracho tannins, among the condensed tannins, exhibited a rapid color change in the direction of red and yellow, while mimosa showed a slower color shift. Tara, among the hydrolysable tannins, exhibited a slower color shift than the others. At the end of 24 hours, the color changes, observed as darkening in all the tannin groups reached a maximum point after which color lightening was observed with extended time. 3aMimosa 3acattle 3achemists 3acolor 3airradiation 3aleather 3alight 3aproanthocyanidins 3atannins 3avegetables 3axenon0 tJournal of the American Leather Chemists Association.g2008 Oct., v. 103, no. 10 p.345-351x0002-97267nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20120327  aOther US 7aarticle03272naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245007400184300001600258520121500274650002301489650001401512650001301526650001601539650001001555650002501565650002201590650001501612650002201627650002501649650001901674650002001693650001501713650002001728650001201748650005001760650002601810650003301836650004401869650002501913650003801938650002201976650001401998650003302012650001402045650001402059651001002073651001502083653004102098653004502139653003902184653001802223653002002241700002602261700002002287700001702307700002302324773010102347852000902448856008502457930003302542946001102575655001202586IND4397098720221117210033.0071028e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439709872DNAL7 a172165502pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-006-9134-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarita, Satoko 10aMolecular phylogeography of two sibling species of Eurema butterflies  ap. 241-253.  aThe common yellow butterfly Eurema hecabe is widely distributed in East Asia, and is one of the most burdensome species for taxonomists due to the numerous geographic and seasonal wing colour patterns. Moreover, within this species, individuals with a yellow wing fringe that occur in temperate regions of Japan (Y type) proved to be biologically different from others that occur widely in subtropical regions of Japan and all over East Asia (B type). To unveil the genetic variation within and between the two types, a total of 50 butterflies collected at 18 geographic localities in East Asia were examined for nucleotide sequence variation of three mitochondrial regions: cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (COIII) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5). In addition, they were also examined for infection status with the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia. The three mitochondrial sequences consistently showed that (i) Y type and B type were highly divergent, (ii) nucleotide variation within B type was very small although sampled from a geographically wide range, and (iii) a weak association existed between mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and Wolbachia infection status. 3aNADH dehydrogenase 3aWolbachia 3abacteria 3abutterflies 3acolor 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeography 3asibling species 3asubtropics 3atemperate zones 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Infectionsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aButterfliesxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenetic Variation 2aGeography 2aNADH Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aWolbachia 3aJapan 0aEast Asia. 0aCytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) 0aCytochrome c oxidase subunit III (COIII) 0aNADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) 0aEurema hecabe 0aSibling species1 aNomura, M.q(Masashi)1 aKato, Yoshiomi 1 aYata, Osamu 1 aKageyama, Daisuke 0 tGenetica.g2007 Nov., v. 131, no. 3 p.241-253dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-006-9134-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20071028b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01588naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245006500143300001600208500008500224520036900309650001800678650002400696650002800720650004800748650002100796650001400817650002300831650002100854650002300875650002200898653002600920700001400946700001800960700001800978700002100996773007101017852000901088930003301097945002501130946001101155655001201166IND4375699720221117210117.0051102s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437569972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The mechanism(s) by which numts transfer from the mitochondrion to the nucleus is uncertain, but their insertions may be mediated in part by chromosomal repair mechanisms. If so, then lineages where chromosomal rearrangements are common should be good models for the study of numt evolution. Arvicoline rodents are known for their karyotypic plasticity and numt pseudogenes have been discovered in this group. Here, we characterize a 4 kb numt pseudogene in the arvicoline vole Microtus rossiaemeridionalis. This sequence is among the largest numts described for a mammal lacking a completely sequenced genome. It encompasses three protein-coding and six tRNA pseudogenes that span ~25% of the entire mammalian mitochondrial genome. It is bordered by a dinucleotide microsatellite repeat and contains four transposable elements within its sequence and flanking regions. To determine the phylogenetic distribution of this numt among the arvicolines, we characterized one of the mitochondrial pseudogenes (cytochrome b) in 21 additional arvicoline species. Average rates of nucleotide substitution in this arvicoline pseudogene are estimated as 2.3 x 10-⁸ substitutions/per site/per year. Furthermore, we performed comparative analyses among all species to estimate the age of this mitochondrial transfer at nearly 4 MYA, predating the origin of most arvicolines. 3aMicrotus 3aage determination 3achromosome aberrations 3acytochrome b 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3amodels 3anuclear genome 3aphylogeny 3aplants (botany) 3apseudogenes 3atransfer RNA 3atransposons 3avoles 2aAnimals 2aArvicolinaexclassificationxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aCytochromes bxgenetics 2aGenes, Mitochondrial 2aGenomexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPseudogenes 2aRNA, Transferxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0aChromosomal rearrangements 0aMitochondrial genome 0anumt1 aDeWoody, J.

Mean COI diversity within populations was 0.63 ± 0.33 and 0.81 taken over all populations. Diversities averaged over microsatellite loci were high (mean number of alleles/locus >=7.4; mean H E >= 65%) in all populations. Diversities averaged across populations were greater in East Africa (mean number of alleles = 22 ± 2.6; mean h e = 0.773 ± 0.033) than in southern Africa (mean number of alleles = 18.7 ± 4.0; mean h e = 0.713 ± 0.072). Differentiation among all populations was highly significant (R ST = 0.25, F ST = 0.132). Nei's G ij statistics were 0.09 and 0.19 within regions for microsatellites and mitochondria, respectively; between regions, G ij was 0.14 for microsatellites and 0.23 for mitochondria. G ST among populations was 0.23 for microsatellite loci and 0.40 for mitochondria.

Circulating polyphenols are far lower than the nominal value in foods. In the rare studies dealing with polyphenol bioavailability, it was noted that their active concentrations in the blood are <1% of their food concentration. In the present study we investigated the effect of four polyphenols (resveratrol, and the flavonoids quercetin, catechin and epicatechin, major constituents of wine) in the hormone-sensitive human cancer cell line T47D, at concentrations compatible with their calculated plasma concentrations after ingestion of a moderate quantity of wine (nM or pM). Our results indicate that cell growth was decreased, with cells being arrested at the S phase of the cycle. In addition, we provide evidence of a bimodal modulation of the NO/NOS system, affecting its activity and transcription. We show that modulation of this system is sufficient to explain polyphenol action on this cell line. This result suggests a potential importance of wine ingestion and possibly the consumption of other polyphenol-rich dietary foods and drinks in the control of breast cancer cell growth. 3acell lines 3abreast neoplasms 3ahumans 3apolyphenols 3aresveratrol 3acatechin 3aepicatechin 3aquercetin 3acell cycle 3aantioxidant activity 3anutrient availability 3acarcinogenesis 3awines 3acell growth 3aanticarcinogenic activity1 aKampa, M.1 aAlexaki, V.I.1 aNotas, G.1 aCastanas, E.0 tJournal of dairy research.g2005, v. 72 p.44-50x0022-02997nnas  aDNAL  a20080422b20080502c00000000  aINDd1CTe2005/12/21  aNon-US 7aarticle03230naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012100184300001600305520138300321650001301704650002301717650002201740650001301762650001401775650003901789650001001828650002001838650001601858650001901874650002501893650001801918650001801936650001201954650002301966650003101989650004002020650001602060650002602076650003602102650003502138650002402173651001402197651001402211653001402225653000802239653001202247653001302259700002202272700002402294700002702318700002002345773010102365852000902466856008502475930003302560946001102593655001202604IND4394855220221117205854.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439485522DNAL7 a171604352pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-006-9123-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNirchio, Mauro 10aCytogenetic analysis of three species of the genus Haemulon (Teleostei: Haemulinae) from Margarita Island, Venezuela  ap. 135-140.  aThis paper describes the karyotype analysis of Haemulon aurolineatum, Haemulon bonariensis and Haemulon plumierii, by Giemsa staining, C-banding, Ag-staining and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), to locate the 18S and 5S rRNA genes. Diploid modal count in the three species was 2n = 48 acrocentric elements. Except for pair 24, which exhibited an unmistakable secondary constriction in all three species, it was not possible to classify them as homologous to each other because differences in chromosome size were too slight between adjacent pairs within a size-graded series. Ag-NOR clusters were located in pair 24 in the three species with signal located on the secondary constriction of these chromosomes. C-banding demonstrated that the three species share the same distribution pattern of the constitutive heterochromatin with centromeric heterochromatic blocks in the 23 chromosome pairs and a pericentromeric block in pair 24 which is coincident with the NORs. FISH experiments showed that 18S rDNA sequences were located coincident with the Ag-NOR site in the three species; however, differences in both the number and chromosome distribution of 5S-rDNA cluster were detected among them. Our data suggest that chromosome evolution of Haemulon has been preserved from major changes in the karyotypic macrostructure, whereas microstructural changes have occurred. 3aHaemulon 3achromosome banding 3achromosome number 3adiploidy 3aevolution 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3aheterochromatin 3akaryotyping 3amicrostructure 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Banding 2aDNA, Ribosomalxmetabolism 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aKaryotyping 2aPerciformesxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxmetabolism 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 5Sxmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity 3aVenezuela 0aVenezuela 0aC-banding 0aNOR 0a5S rDNA 0a18S rDNA1 aGaviria, Juan I. 1 aOliveira, Cláudio.1 aFerreira, Irani Alves 1 aMartins, Cesar 0 tGenetica.g2007 Oct., v. 131, no. 2 p.135-140dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-006-9123-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03740naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245015700187300001600344520157600360650001901936650001901955650002701974650001402001650000902015650003902024650002102063650001002084650001502094650001602109650001002125650001202135650001202147650003102159650001402190650001302204650001802217650001902235650004602254650001202300650002902312650002302341650002602364650002702390650004102417650001602458650004902474650002202523650000902545650004302554650003802597650002402635653002402659653001902683653000902702653001502711700002302726700001802749700002402767773010102791852000902892856008502901930003302986946001103019655001203030IND4394855320221117205831.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439485532DNAL7 a171436512pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-006-9124-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBombarová, Marta 10aDivergent location of ribosomal genes in chromosomes of fish thorny-headed worms, Pomphorhynchus laevis and Pomphorhynchus tereticollis (Acanthocephala)  ap. 141-149.  aWe studied distribution of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences along with chromosomal location of the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) in males of two fish parasites, Pomphorhynchus laevis and Pomphorhynchus tereticollis (Acanthocephala). Fluorescence in situ hybridization with 18S rDNA probe identified two clusters of rDNA in each species, but revealed a remarkable difference in their location on chromosomes. In P. laevis, the rDNA-FISH signals were found in long arms of the first chromosome pair and in short arms of the second pair. Whereas in P. tereticollis, rDNA clusters were located in long arms of both the first and second chromosome pairs. The divergent location of rDNA clusters in the chromosome No. 2 supports current classification of P. tereticollis, previously considered a synonym of P. laevis, as a separate species. A possible scenario of the second chromosome rearrangement during karyotype evolution of the two species involves two successive pericentric inversions. In both species, one or two prominent nucleoli were apparent within interphase nuclei stained with either silver nitrate or a fluorescent dye YOYO-1. However, a single large nucleolus was observed in early stages of mitosis and meiosis I regardless the number of rDNA clusters. Nevertheless, two bivalents with silver-stained NORs in diakinesis and two silver-stained sites in early prophase II nuclei indicated that all NORs are active. This means that each Pomphorhynchus NOR generates a nucleolus, but the resulting nucleoli have a strong tendency to associate in a large body. 3aAcanthocephala 3acell nucleolus 3achromosome aberrations 3aevolution 3afish 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afluorescent dyes 3agenes 3ainterphase 3akaryotyping 3amales 3ameiosis 3amitosis 3anucleolus organizer region 3aparasites 3aprophase 3aribosomal DNA 3asilver nitrate 2aAcanthocephalaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aAnimals 2aBenzoxazolesxmetabolism 2aChromosome Banding 2aChromosomesxgenetics 2aDNA Probesxmetabolism 2aDNA, Ribosomalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aGenes, rRNA 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescencexmethods 2aLarvaxmetabolism 2aMale 2aNucleolus Organizer Regionxmetabolism 2aQuinolinium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity 0aKaryotype evolution 0aPomphorhynchus 0arDNA 0aSyndermata1 aMarec, František 1 aNguyen, Petr 1 aŠpakulová, Marta 0 tGenetica.g2007 Oct., v. 131, no. 2 p.141-149dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-006-9124-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070909b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03039naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002900164245009700193300001400290520139600304650002201700650001801722650001601740650001101756650001301767650003101780650003001811650001801841650001401859650001701873650001201890650002601902650002301928650002901951650002501980650001902005650001402024650004002038650000902078651001902087653003102106653002102137653001202158653001002170653002602180700002102206700002002227773010402247852000902351856006902360930003302429946001102462655001202473IND4390167620221117210108.0070408e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439016762DNAL7 a168974592pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-006-0017-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruvo-Mađarić, Branka 10aWide distribution of related satellite DNA families within the genus Pimelia (Tenebrionidae)  ap. 35-42.  aMajor satellites of species in the genus Pimelia comprise large portions of their genomes and belong to seven major satellite families which all originate from a common ancestral sequence. Here we present the results of comprehensive screening of 26 Pimelia species belonging to three distinct geographic groups (Ibero-Balearic, African and Canary Islands) for the presence of different Pimelia satellite families in their genomes. Dot-blot hybridization experiments suggest that together with one dominant, highly abundant satellite family, other families are also present in genomes of the majority of examined Pimelia species, but as low-copy number repeats. The estimated abundance of these underrepresented repeats is about 4,000 copies per haploid genome. Signals of highly abundant satellite family from P. scabrosa (PSCA) in examined congeneric species, obtained after PCR amplification and Southern hybridization under high stringency conditions, corroborate sequence preservation of low-copy representatives of satellite families. PRINS localized low-copy repeats within the pericentromeric regions of all chromosomes. These results point to the existence of an extensive library of repetitive DNAs that was already present in the genome of the common ancestor of extant Pimelia taxa, and shifts the period of diversification of Pimelia satellites far in the history of this genus. 3aSouthern blotting 3aTenebrionidae 3achromosomes 3agenome 3ahaploidy 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asatellite DNA 3ascreening 3azoogeography 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxgenetics. 2aBlotting, Southern 2aDNA, Satellitexanalysis 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGene Frequency 2aGeography 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aMale 3aCanary Islands 0aDifferential amplification 0aLow-copy repeats 0aPimelia 0aPRINS 0aSatellite DNA library1 aPlohl, Miroslav 1 aUgarković, D. 0 tGenetica.g2007 May, v. 130, no. 1 p.35-42dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-006-0017-23electronic resource  a20070408b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02208naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245010600170300001600276500002400292520102000316650004901336650001701385650001801402650001601420650000901436650004401445650003301489650001201522650002101534650001201555700001601567700002101583700002001604700001801624773011601642852000901758856005501767655001201822IND4405729820221117205023.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440572982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00983.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNovotny, E.H.10aEffect of residual vanadyl ions on the spectroscopic analysis of humic acids: a multivariate approach  ap. 439-444.  aIncludes references  aIn a study of the vanadyl (VO²⁺)-humic acids system, the residual vanadyl ion suppressed fluorescence and specific electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and NMR signals. In the case of NMR, the proton rotating frame relaxation times (T₁ρH) indicate that this suppression is due to an inefficient H-C cross polarization, which is a consequence of a shortening of T₁ρH. Principal components analysis (PCA) facilitated the isolation of the effect of the VO²⁺ ion and indicated that the organic free radical signal was due to at least two paramagnetic centres and that the VO²⁺ ion preferentially suppressed the species whose electronic density is delocalized over O atoms (greater g-factor). Additionally, the newly obtained variables (principal components - PC) indicated that, as the result of the more intense tillage a relative increase occurred in the accumulation of: (i) recalcitrant structures; (ii) lignin and long-chain alkyl structures; and (iii) organic free radicals with smaller g-factors. 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afluorescence 3afree radicals 3ahumic acids 3aions 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprotons 3aresidual effects 3atillage1 aKnicker, H.1 aMartin-N.eto, L.1 aAzeredo, R.B.V.1 aHayes, M.H.B.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2008 June, v. 59, no. 3 p.439-444dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00983.x 7aarticle03155naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002100186245012600207300001800333520160100351650002801952650002301980650001202003650004302015650001202058650006402070650007402134650001102208650003502219650003302254650005602287650004002343653002802383653002302411653001702434653001102451773010902462852000902571856008502580930003302665946001102698655001202709IND4437784320221117204415.0100528e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443778432DNAL7 a203611782pmid7 aPMC28773382pmcid7 a10.1007/s00125-010-1684-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeFronzo, R.

The Claude Bernard Lecture 2009  ap. 1270-1287.  aInsulin resistance is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is associated with a metabolic and cardiovascular cluster of disorders (dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obesity [especially visceral], glucose intolerance, endothelial dysfunction), each of which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple prospective studies have documented an association between insulin resistance and accelerated CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as in non-diabetic individuals. The molecular causes of insulin resistance, i.e. impaired insulin signalling through the phosphoinositol-3 kinase pathway with intact signalling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, are responsible for the impairment in insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and contribute to the accelerated rate of CVD in type 2 diabetes patients. The current epidemic of diabetes is being driven by the obesity epidemic, which represents a state of tissue fat overload. Accumulation of toxic lipid metabolites (fatty acyl CoA, diacylglycerol, ceramide) in muscle, liver, adipocytes, beta cells and arterial tissues contributes to insulin resistance, beta cell dysfunction and accelerated atherosclerosis, respectively, in type 2 diabetes. Treatment with thiazolidinediones mobilises fat out of tissues, leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity, improved beta cell function and decreased atherogenesis. Insulin resistance and lipotoxicity represent the missing links (beyond the classical cardiovascular risk factors) that help explain the accelerated rate of CVD in type 2 diabetic patients. 3acardiovascular diseases 3ainsulin resistance 3aobesity 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAnimals 2aAtherosclerosisxdrug therapyxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapyxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aLipid Metabolismxphysiology 2aObesityxdrug therapyxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aThiazolidinedionesxtherapeutic use 0aEndothelial dysfunction 0aInsulin signalling 0aLipotoxicity 0aReview0 tDiabetologia.g2010 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.1270-1287dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-010-1684-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02975naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245012800180300001600308520117800324650000801502650001501510650002501525650001501550650001101565650001301576650001701589650001601606650001601622650001401638650003701652650001401689650000901703650001201712650003201724650001601756650002101772650001501793650001101808650004301819650002801862650002301890650004001913650004801953650003102001651001002032651001402042653002102056700001702077700001702094773012402111852000902235856008502244930003302329946001102362655001202373IND4437087120221117204522.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443708712DNAL7 a204678552pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-008-9243-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTse, C.

We have used DNA damage in liver cells, as determined by the comet assay, to assess the impact of SS on the orange-spotted grouper Epinephelus coioides. Seabed sediments were collected from a heavily polluted site in Victoria Harbor and two less polluted sites in Port Shelter and Mirs Bay. Sediments from Victoria Harbor contained higher levels of copper (Cu) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) than those from the other sites. In a 10-day experiment, SS from all three sites induced significant increase in comet tail length, but not in percentage (%) tail DNA. In a 20-day experiment, fish exposed to polluted SS from Victoria Harbor exhibited a significant increase in comet tail length after 5 days and % tail DNA after 10 days. After a 10-day recovery period, however, DNA damage was reduced as tail length and % tail DNA returned to control levels. These results suggest that DNA damage measured by the comet assay is a highly sensitive biomarker for assessing the genotoxic effects of SS to marine fish. 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aEpinephelus coioides 3abiomarkers 3acopper 3adredging 3agenotoxicity 3ahepatocytes 3amarine fish 3amortality 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asediments 3atail 2aAnimals 2aBassxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aComet Assay 2aCopperxtoxicity 2aDNA Damage 2aFemale 2aHepatocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMetals, Heavyxtoxicity 2aMutagensxtoxicity 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxtoxicity 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutantsxtoxicity 3aChina 0aHong Kong 0aSuspended solids1 aChan, K.

Addition of pectin/guar gum decreased creaming percentage, and no creaming was detected in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) pectin/guar gum as a result of increasing viscosity. At the end of 10 h, creaming percentage decreased from 61 to 57% with the addition of 0.05% (w/v) guar gum and to 39% with the addition of 0.2% (w/v) guar gum. Microscopic observations represented the droplet aggregation arising from the presence of nonabsorbing biopolymers. At [graphic removed] = 10 s⁻¹, a tenfold increase in viscosity was observed in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) guar gum compared to the presence of 0.1% guar gum due to the thickening effect of polysaccharide. Increasing gum concentrations enhanced the viscosity and hence the consistency index. All emulsions, except for those containing 0.5% (w/v) guar gum, reflect the near-Newtonian behaviour with flow behaviour index, n, of 0.9-1.0. All emulsions exhibited a liquid-like behaviour at low frequencies (<7.0 Hz) where G″ values were higher than G′. Both G′ and G″ showed a frequency dependency and these two moduli crossed each other at higher frequencies (>7.0 Hz), G′ became greater than G″ and the system behaved like an elastic solid. Addition of pectin at all levels cause no significant change in G′ and G″ values, whereas addition of guar gum, especially at a concentration of 0.5% (w/v), significantly improved these values. 3abiopolymers 3acreaming 3aegg yolk 3aemulsions 3afood research 3aguar gum 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3apH 3apectins 3arheology 3asoybeans 3aviscosity 0aEgg yolk plasma 0aPolysaccharide 0aCreaming stability1 aIbanoğlu, Esra 0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2010 June, v. 231, no. 2 p.297-302dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-010-1276-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02465naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245007200188300001800260520102900278650002401307650001201331650002201343650001001365650002001375650001101395650002101406650001201427650002501439650003801464650001101502650000901513650004201522650003401564650002301598653002501621653001201646653001601658700001701674700001701691773013001708852000901838856009201847930003301939946001101972655001201983IND4439935820221117205305.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443993582DNAL7 a205460892pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02033.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHARMA, M.D.10aFemale mate preferences in Drosophila simulans: evolution and costs  ap. 1672-1679.  aFemale mate preference is central to sexual selection, and all indirect benefit models require that there is genetic variation in female preference. This has rarely been tested however, with relatively few studies documenting heritable variation in female preference and even fewer that have directly selected on mate preference to unequivocally show that it can evolve. Additionally, costs of mate preference are poorly understood even though these have implications for preference evolution. We selected on female preference for ebony-males in replicate Drosophila simulans lines, and generated a rapid evolutionary response in both replicates, with the proportion of females mating with ebony-males increasing from approximately 5% to 30% after five generations of selection. This increase was independent of changes in ebony-males as only females were included in our selection regime. We could detect no cost to mate preference itself other than that associated with the fitness consequences of mating with ebony males. 3aDrosophila simulans 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3amales 3amating behavior 3amodels 3asexual selection 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aDrosophilaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMating Preference, Animalxphysiology 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSelection, Genetic 0aartificial evolution 0aisoline 0amate choice1 aTREGENZA, T.1 aHOSKEN, D.J.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2010 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.1672-1679dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02033.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03431naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245015200187300001600339520140900355650001701764650002301781650002401804650001101828650001701839650001201856650001901868650002201887650002101909650002701930650002501957650003801982650002102020650002102041650004002062650002502102650002302127650001602150650002302166650002002189650001602209650001002225653002802235653001302263653001802276653001202294653003002306653003602336653001202372700001402384700001402398700002302412700002502435700002902460700002202489773011302511852000902624856009202633930003302725946001102758655001202769IND4437986820221117205330.0100604e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443798682DNAL7 a204124452pmid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03256.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xuhui10aConcurrent and lagged impacts of an anomalously warm year on autotrophic and heterotrophic components of soil respiration: a deconvolution analysis  ap. 184-198.  aPartitioning soil respiration into autotrophic (RA) and heterotrophic (RH) components is critical for understanding their differential responses to climate warming. Here, we used a deconvolution analysis to partition soil respiration in a pulse warming experiment. We first conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters can be identified by soil respiration data. A Markov chain Monte Carlo technique was then used to optimize those identifiable parameters in a terrestrial ecosystem model. Finally, the optimized parameters were employed to quantify RA and RH in a forward analysis. Our results displayed that more than one-half of parameters were constrained by daily soil respiration data. The optimized model simulation showed that warming stimulated RH and had little effect on RA in the first 2 months, but decreased both RH and RA during the remainder of the treatment and post-treatment years. Clipping of above-ground biomass stimulated the warming effect on RH but not on RA. Overall, warming decreased RA and RH significantly, by 28.9% and 24.9%, respectively, during the treatment year and by 27.3% and 33.3%, respectively, during the post-treatment year, largely as a result of decreased canopy greenness and biomass. Lagged effects of climate anomalies on soil respiration and its components are important in assessing terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks to climate warming. 3aMarkov chain 3aMonte Carlo method 3aaboveground biomass 3acanopy 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate 3aglobal warming 3asimulation models 3asoil respiration 3aterrestrial ecosystems 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAutotrophic Processesxphysiology 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aCell Respiration 2aHeterotrophic Processesxphysiology 2aLikelihood Functions 2aModels, Biological 2aPlant Cells 2aPlantsxmetabolism 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTemperature 2aWater 0aautotrophic respiration 0aBayesian 0adeconvolution 0aEcoCELL 0aheterotrophic respiration 0aMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 0awarming1 aLuo, Yiqi1 aGao, Chao1 aVerburg, Paul S.J.1 aArnone, John A.

For example, by going through accessible studies, a lot of problems concerning memory can be identified in the field of living conditions and in other domains. Consequently, it may be claimed that facts are seldom stored in an easily accessible manner. It is probably not the case that people -when answering questions -respond promptly and automatically. Rather, some sort of thinking activity is initiated. Accordingly, the answers may be dependent on the occasion when the questions are asked, which background information is given, how familiar the respondents are with the phenomenon in question, how much time there is for reflection, and so on. We have had the opportunity to compare answers to the same questions asked in different contexts. The results clearly indicate the existence of context effects. At the same time, the results give some clues to how these effects can be interpreted, and even avoided. Problems may be minimized if questions are more precisely formulated, if their focus is on strictly limited aspects, and if they are only about things to which people have devoted a lot of interest and thought. 0acontext effects 0ameasurement quality 0asocial indicator 0asurvey methods0 tSocial indicators research.g2007 Oct., v. 84, no. 1 p.27-38dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0303-83007nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11205-006-9067-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100101b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02289naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007400172300001800246520107800264650002701342650002601369650001301395650002501408650002401433650001101457650001801468653001701486700001701503700002201520700002401542700002401566700001901590773014901609852000901758856009201767930003301859946001101892655001201903IND4437298220221117205315.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443729822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02274.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina, Eduardo10aMain variables affecting the lactic acid fermentation of table olives  ap. 1291-1296.  aAmong the olive varieties, Manzanilla is the most employed as table olives worldwide. Inoculation of the brines of Manzanilla and Gordal olives, which were not treated with alkali, with a strain of Lactobacillus pentosus was carried out and results indicated that variety is one of the main factors to be considered when fermenting olives, even more important than the salt level. This conclusion was based on the presence of a high concentration of antimicrobial compounds, namely the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl elenolic acid, either free or linked to hydroxytyrosol in the brines of the Manzanilla variety, as compared to the low level of these substances in the Gordal brines. Likewise, it was also observed that the inhibitory activity of Manzanilla olives against lactic acid bacteria could be counteracted by the addition of nitrogenous supplements such as MRS and yeast extract to their brines. Results obtained from this work are of great interest for the table olive industry in order to develop lactic acid fermentation in olives non-treated with alkali. 3aLactobacillus pentosus 3aanti-infective agents 3aindustry 3alactic acid bacteria 3alactic fermentation 3aolives 3ayeast extract 0atable olives1 aGori, Chiara1 aServili, Maurizio1 aCastro, Antonio de.1 aRomero, Concepción1 aBrenes, Manuel0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2010 June, v. 45, no. 6 p.1291-1296dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2010.02274.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03342naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003800164245007000202300001600272520134500288650001301633650001401646650001001660650002001670650001501690650001901705650004001724650003901764650001201803650003701815650003601852650001201888650003401900650002401934650003301958650002901991650003802020650002402058650003702082650000902119650002802128650003702156650001402193650002402207650000902231650001702240650001702257650002102274700004302295700002002338700003002358700003402388700002602422773011802448852000902566856008502575930003302660946001102693655001202704IND4438811020221117205310.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443881102DNAL7 a202171882pmid7 a10.1007/s11010-010-0429-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Souza Silva, Francielli Maria 10aEffects of metformin on glucose metabolism of perfused rat livers  ap. 283-289.  aAlthough metformin has been used to treat type 2 diabetes for several decades, the mechanism of its action on glucose metabolism remains controversial. To further assess the effect of metformin on glucose metabolism this work was undertaken to investigate the acute actions of metformin on glycogenolysis, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and ureogenesis in perfused rat livers. Metformin (5 mM) inhibited oxygen consumption and increased glycolysis and glycogenolysis in livers from fed rats. In perfused livers of fasted rats, the drug (concentrations higher than 1.0 mM) inhibited oxygen consumption and glucose production from lactate and pyruvate. Gluconeogenesis and ureogenesis from alanine were also inhibited. The cellular levels of ATP were decreased by metformin whereas the AMP levels of livers from fasted rats were increased. Taken together our results indicate that the energy status of the cell is probably compromised by metformin. The antihyperglycemic effect of metformin seems to be the result of a reduced oxidative phosphorylation without direct inhibition of key enzymatic activities of the gluconeogenic pathway. The AMP-activated protein kinase cascade could also be a probable target for metformin, which switches on catabolic pathways such as glycogenolysis and glycolysis, while switches off ATP consuming processes. 3adiabetes 3ametformin 3aliver 3agluconeogenesis 3aglycolysis 3aglycogenolysis 2aAdenosine Monophosphatexmetabolism 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnergy Metabolismxdrug effects 2aFasting 2aGluconeogenesisxdrug effects 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlycogenolysisxdrug effects 2aGlycolysisxdrug effects 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMetforminxpharmacology 2aOxygen Consumptionxdrug effects 2aPerfusion 2aPostprandial Period 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTime Factors 2aUreaxmetabolism1 aRocha Alves da Silva, Mário Henrique 1 aBracht, Adelar 1 aEller, Gabrielle Jacklin 1 aConstantin, Rodrigo Polimeni 1 aYamamoto, Nair Seiko 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2010 July, v. 340, no. 1-2 p.283-289dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0429-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03150naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245013100171300001800302500001500320520161500335650001301950650002601963650001901989650001102008650001902019650001602038650001702054650000902071650001902080650001802099650001602117650001602133650001202149650001002161650002102171653000902192653001002201653001002211653002002221653002102241653001902262653002902281700003202310700002002342773011302362852000902475856009202484930003302576946001102609655001202620IND4438009320221117205301.0100604e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443800932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07676.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKucab, Jill E.10aLinking environmental carcinogen exposure to TP53 mutations in human tumours using the human TP53 knock-in (Hupki) mouse model  ap. 2567-2583.  a2019-12-04  aTP53 is one of the most commonly mutated genes in human tumours. Variations in the types and frequencies of mutations at different tumour sites suggest that they may provide clues to the identity of the causative mutagenic agent. A useful model for studying human TP53 mutagenesis is the partial human TP53 knock-in (Hupki) mouse containing exons 4-9 of human TP53 in place of the corresponding mouse exons. For an in vitro assay, embryo fibroblasts from the Hupki mouse can be examined for the generation and selection of TP53 mutations because mouse cells can be immortalized by mutation of Tp53 alone. Thus far, four environmental carcinogens have been examined using the Hupki embryo fibroblast immortalization assay: (a) UV light, which is linked to human skin cancer; (b) benzo[a]pyrene, which is associated with tobacco smoke-induced lung cancer; (c) 3-nitrobenzanthrone, a suspected human lung carcinogen linked to diesel exposure; and (d) aristolochic acid, which is linked to Balkan endemic nephropathy-associated urothelial cancer. In each case, a unique TP53 mutation pattern was generated that corresponded to the pattern found in human tumours where exposure to these agents has been documented. Therefore, the Hupki embryo fibroblast immortalization assay has sufficient specificity to make it applicable to other environmental mutagens that putatively play a role in cancer aetiology. Despite the utility of the current Hupki embryo fibroblast immortalization assay, it has several limitations that could be addressed by future developments, in order to improve its sensitivity and selectivity. 3aetiology 3aultraviolet radiation 3askin neoplasms 3ahumans 3alung neoplasms 3amutagenesis 3amutagenicity 3amice 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3aanimal models 3acarcinogens 3afibroblasts 3atobacco 3aexons 3ain vitro studies 0aTP53 0agenes 0aHupki 0aimmortalization 0acancer aetiology 0amutation assay 0aenvironmental carcinogen1 aPhillips, D.

When orientation is altered from the vertical, they form a special type of wood called reaction wood that differs chemically and structurally from normal wood and forces reorientation of the organ or whole plant. The reaction wood of dicotyledons is called tension wood and is characterized by nonlignified gelatinous fibers. The altered chemical and mechanical properties of tension wood reduce wood quality and represent a major problem for the timber and pulping industries. Repeated clipping of the emerging inflorescence stems of Arabidopsis thaliana augments wood formation in organs, including those inflorescence stems that are allowed to develop later. Gravistimulation of such inflorescence stems induces tension wood formation, allowing the use of A. thaliana for a molecular and genetic analysis of the mechanisms of tension wood formation. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aherbaceous plants 3aindustry 3amechanical properties 3amodels 3apulping 3astem elongation 3astems 3atension wood 3atrees 3awood 3awood quality 0aArabidpsis thaliana 0agelatinous fibers1 aSederoff, R. 1 aFlaishman, M.

In this work, we describe a pan-specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I epitope predictor, NetCTLpan. The method integrates predictions of proteasomal cleavage, transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transport efficiency, and MHC class I binding affinity into a MHC class I pathway likelihood score and is an improved and extended version of NetCTL. The NetCTLpan method performs predictions for all MHC class I molecules with known protein sequence and allows predictions for 8-, 9-, 10-, and 11-mer peptides. In order to meet the need for a low false positive rate, the method is optimized to achieve high specificity. The method was trained and validated on large datasets of experimentally identified MHC class I ligands and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes. It has been reported that MHC molecules are differentially dependent on TAP transport and proteasomal cleavage. Here, we did not find any consistent signs of such MHC dependencies, and the NetCTLpan method is implemented with fixed weights for proteasomal cleavage and TAP transport for all MHC molecules. The predictive performance of the NetCTLpan method was shown to outperform other state-of-the-art CTL epitope prediction methods. Our results further confirm the importance of using full-type human leukocyte antigen restriction information when identifying MHC class I epitopes. Using the NetCTLpan method, the experimental effort to identify 90% of new epitopes can be reduced by 15% and 40%, respectively, when compared to the NetMHCpan and NetCTL methods.

The uncoupler FCCP (carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone) and the ionophores valinomycin and nigericin stimulate the PPase activity of repeatedly washed yeast mitochondria 2-3-fold. We have previously cloned a yeast gene, PPA2, encoding the catalytic subunit of a mitochondrial PPase. Uncouplers stimulate the PPase activity several-fold in mitochondria from both cells that overexpress PPA2 from a high copy number plasmid and cells with normal expression. These results indicate that the PPA2 polypeptide functions as an energy linked and membrane associated PPase. The stimulation of mitochondrial PPase activity by FCCP, but not by valinomycin and nigericin, was greatly enhanced by the presence of DTT. The antibiotics Dio-9, equisetin and the F(0)F(1)-ATPase inhibitor oligomycin also increase mitochondrial PPase activity several fold. This stimulation is much higher, whereas basal PPase activity is lower, in isotonic than in hypotonic solution, which indicates that intact membranes are a prerequisite for maximal effects. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amitochondria 3apyrophosphatases 3aenzyme activity 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aCarbonyl Cyanide p-Trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazonexpharmacology 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMitochondriaxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aNigericinxpharmacology 2aOrganic Chemicals 2aPyrophosphatasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPyrrolidinonesxpharmacology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSubmitochondrial Particlesxenzymology 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxpharmacology 2aTetrahydronaphthalenes 2aUncoupling Agentsxpharmacology 2aValinomycinxpharmacology1 aDeopujari, S.W.1 aLichko, L.1 aPereira da Silva, L.1 aBaltscheffsky, H.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1992 Jan. 16, v. 1098, no. 2 p.217-223x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02110naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007400124300001400198520120500212650002201417650001401439650001801453650001801471650001601489650001501505650001501520700001701535700001801552700001601570773014501586852000901731939003301740946001101773655001201784IND9302700320221117204732.0930504e19920130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930270032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeda, H.10aPresence of two chlorophyll a' molecules at the core of photosystem I  ap. 74-80.  aThe pigment composition in cells and thylakoid membranes of a cyanobacterium. and in leaves and intact or P700-enriched chloroplasts of higher plants, has been reinvestigated by solvent extraction/HPLC. In acetone extracts, the amount of chlorophyll (Chl) a' relative to Chl a or P700 was nearly twice that in chloroform extracts: the latter gave a result in line with the stoichiometry of Chl a'/P700 approximately equal to 1 found by chloroform extraction (Kobayashi, M. et al.

By two-step extraction, first with chloroform then with acetone, a roughly equal amount of Chl a' was extracted in each step, while more than 90% of Chl a was extracted already in the first step. For chloroplasts heavily enriched in P700, the residue of the first extraction exhibited a Chl a'/Chl a molar ratio outreaching the equilibrium value (0.33). as verified by the second extraction/HPLC. These results evidence that two Chl a' molecules exist at the Photosystem (PS) I core, and just one of them is at a site to which only such a hydrophilic molecule as acetone is accessible. A preliminary discussion is given on the possible role of the two Chl a' molecules in PS I. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aHydrangea 3aCyanobacteria 3aphotosystem I 3achlorophyll 3aextraction 3aseparation1 aWatanabe, T.1 aKobayashi, M.1 aIkegami, I.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1992 Jan. 30, v. 1099, no. 1 p.74-80x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02528naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245012300123300001600246500001500262520151200277650001701789650001601806650002301822650001301845650001401858650001501872653002201887653002101909653001701930653001201947700001701959773014901976852000902125939003302134946001102167655001202178IND9303602920221117204708.0930614e19930224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930360292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Q.T.10aEffect of cholesteryl ester on the distribution of fluorescent cholesterol analogues in triacylglycerol-rich emulsions  ap. 145-153.  a2019-12-05  aLipid emulsions consisting of a surface monolayer of phospholipid enclosing a core of neutral lipid (cholesteryl ester and/or triacylglycerol) are useful models of the lipid phase of lipoproteins. The physical state of the emulsion surface may determine the extent and nature of interaction of enzymes and lipid transfer proteins (e.g., lipoprotein lipase, cholesteryl ester transfer protein) with the particle. Unesterified cholesterol, which is a major determinant of the physical state of the surface phase, is able to partition between surface and core compartments. This report describes a fluorescence quenching method which determines the equilibrium distribution of a fluorescent cholesterol analogue (dehydroergosterol) between the surface and core compartments of triacylglycerol-rich emulsions. Quenching by iodide is used to distinguish a pool of unesterified cholesterol readily accessible to the aqueous phase. Quenching by 5-nitroxystearate identifies a pool of unesterified cholesterol in the phospholipid monolayer and the pool of unesterified cholesterol in the core compartment is found by difference. It is shown that the substitution of cholesteryl oleate for triolein in the core of the emulsion substantially increases the partition of unesterified cholesterol into the core compartment with a consequent depletion of unesterified cholesterol in the surface monolayer. The distribution of unesterified cholesterol between surface and core compartments is largely enthalpically driven. 3afluorescence 3acholesterol 3acholesteryl esters 3atriolein 3aemulsions 3aergosterol 0adehydroergosterol 0atriacylglycerols 0asubstitution 0aanalogs1 aSawyer, W.H.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1993 Feb. 24, v. 1166, no. 2/3 p.145-153x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01883naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245004300143300001600186520071800202650001700920650001700937650001300954650002800967650001400995650002401009650002501033650002901058650002901087650002801116650001101144650002701155650002501182650005601207653002301263773014601286852000901432939003301441946001101474655001201485IND9302819920221117204732.0930510e19920520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930281992DNAL7 a15352212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, N.10aEvolution of organellar proton-ATPases  ap. 109-124.  aProton ATPases function in biological energy conversion in every known living cell.

Moreover, these studies shed light on the evolution of the various organelles of eukaryotes and suggested some events in the evolution of the three kingdoms of eubacteria, archaebacteria and eukaryotes. 3achloroplasts 3amitochondria 3avacuoles 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aevolution 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aChloroplastsxenzymology 2aMitochondriaxenzymology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOperon 2aOrganellesxenzymology 2aProtein Conformation 2aProton-Translocating ATPasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aliterature reviews0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1992 May 20, v. 1100, no. 2 p.109-124x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03157naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245012000144300001600264520137600280650001201656650004301668650002201711650001501733650001901748650002901767650002401796650002701820650002501847650005501872650002201927650002001949650004001969650003802009650003902047650003902086650002802125650011202153650003502265650001902300650002202319650002202341650002002363653003602383700002002419773014702439852000902586939003302595946001102628655001202639IND9302603420221117204329.0930429e19920116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930260342DNAL7 a17300082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSigrist, M.10aIdentification of type 1 and type 2 light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins using monospecific antibodies  ap. 191-200.  aThe amino acid sequences of more than 40 apoproteins of the light-harvesting complex associated with Photosystem II (LHC II) of various plants have been deduced by sequencing their corresponding genes. These highly conserved sequences fall into two major categories, type 1 and type 2, that differ mainly in a small number of domains close to the N-terminus. We have made polyclonal, monospecific antibodies against synthetic peptides corresponding to the most unique sequence domains of the N-terminal regions of type 1 and type 2 LHC II apoproteins, using sequences derived from petunia genes. On Western blots our anti-type 1 and 2 antibodies crossreact with light-harvesting proteins of petunia, tomato, spinach and several other plants. By using an new gel-system based on ammediol (2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol), we are able to resolve up to eight LHC II apoproteins. On petunia, tomato and spinach blots the anti type 1 antibodies bind to two or more of the higher molecular weight LHC II polypeptides, whereas the anti type 2 antibodies recognize very specifically only one or two of the lower molecular weight LHC-proteins. In all plants studied, the type 1 LHC II apoproteins are more numerous and span a greater size range than the type 2 apoproteins. This is consistent with the smaller number of type 2 LHC II CAB genes that have been discovered to date. 3aPetunia 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSpinacia oleracea 3athylakoids 3aphotosystem II 3alight harvesting complex 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAntibodiesximmunology 2aAntibody Specificity 2aApoproteinsxanalysisxclassificationximmunology. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCross Reactions 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aIntracellular Membranesxchemistry 2aLight-Harvesting Protein Complexes 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhotosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteinsxanalysisxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complex 2aPlant Proteins 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aPropylene Glycols 2aSilver Staining 0achlorophyll a/b binding protein1 aStaehelin, L.A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta : International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1992 Jan. 16, v. 1098, no. 2 p.191-200x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03644naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001900183245011200202300001600314500002400330500001500354506007600369520139400445506003701839650002501876650001601901650001801917650001401935650001901949650002701968650001501995650001302010650001302023650002602036650001202062650001402074650002802088650001602116650002602132650001802158650003902176650003902215650004102254650003802295650003002333650002302363650002802386650002402414650003002438650004002468650003302508650002502541650001602566650002802582650003702610653001502647700001902662700001902681700001602700700002102716773010602737852000902843856008202852655001202934IND4403973720221207124726.0080404e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440397372DNAL7 a183144992pmid7 aPMC22764532pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.107.0547182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaeda, Hiroshi10aTocopherols Modulate Extraplastidic Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Metabolism in Arabidopsis at Low Temperature  ap. 452-470.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTocopherols (vitamin E) are synthesized in plastids and have long been assumed to have essential functions restricted to these organelles. We previously reported that the vitamin e-deficient2 (vte2) mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana is defective in transfer cell wall development and photoassimilate transport at low temperature (LT). Here, we demonstrate that LT-treated vte2 has a distinct composition of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs): lower levels of linolenic acid (18:3) and higher levels of linoleic acid (18:2) compared with the wild type. Enhanced 18:3 oxidation was not involved, as indicated by the limited differences in oxidized lipid species between LT-treated vte2 and the wild type and by a lack of impact on the LT-induced vte2 phenotype in a vte2 fad3 fad7 fad8 quadruple mutant deficient in 18:3. PUFA changes in LT-treated vte2 occur primarily in phospholipids due to reduced conversion of dienoic to trienoic fatty acids in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway. Introduction of the ER fatty acid desaturase mutation, fad2, and to a lesser extent the plastidic fad6 mutation into the vte2 background suppressed the LT-induced vte2 phenotypes, including abnormal transfer cell wall development. These results provide biochemical and genetic evidence that plastid-synthesized tocopherols modulate ER PUFA metabolism early in the LT adaptation response of ARABIDOPSIS:0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3atocopherols 3alinoleic acid 3aphenotype 3alinolenic acid 3afatty acid composition 3acell walls 3amutation 3aplastids 3afatty acid metabolism 3amutants 3aoxidation 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3atemperature 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aphospholipids 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxmetabolism 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLinoleic Acidxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhospholipidsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlastidsxmetabolism 2aTemperature 2aTocopherolsxmetabolism 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxmetabolism 0aadaptation1 aSage, Tammy L.1 aIsaac, Giorgis1 aWelti, Ruth1 aDellaPenna, Dean0 tplant cell.g2008 Feb., v. 20, no. 2 p.452-470dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.107.0547183Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04172naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245015400180300001800334500002400352520186100376650002202237650002102259650002202280650001902302650001602321650001402337650001302351650001302364650001402377650001502391650001402406650001502420650001302435650001602448650003502464650001502499650001302514650001002527650002402537650001802561650004202579650002302621650002302644650002502667650006102692650002102753650004002774650004602814650001102860650001902871650002402890650001302914650001402927650003602941650003302977650001603010650002303026650002703049650003603076700001803112700001303130700001703143700001603160700001603176700001403192700001703206773011003223852000903333856004803342655001203390IND4443661820221117204316.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444366182DNAL7 a205565952pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-010-1384-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Zhenze10aMolecular characterization of the celiac disease epitope domains in α-gliadin genes in Aegilops tauschii and hexaploid wheats (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 1239-1251.  aIncludes references  aNineteen novel full-ORF α-gliadin genes and 32 pseudogenes containing at least one stop codon were cloned and sequenced from three Aegilops tauschii accessions (T15, T43 and T26) and two bread wheat cultivars (Gaocheng 8901 and Zhongyou 9507). Analysis of three typical α-gliadin genes (Gli-At4, Gli-G1 and Gli-Z4) revealed some InDels and a considerable number of SNPs among them. Most of the pseudogenes were resulted from C to T change, leading to the generation of TAG or TAA in-frame stop codon. The putative proteins of both Gli-At3 and Gli-Z7 genes contained an extra cysteine residue in the unique domain II. Analysis of toxic epitodes among 19 deduced α-gliadins demonstrated that 14 of these contained 1-5 T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes while the other 5 did not contain any toxic epitopes. The glutamine residues in two specific ployglutamine domains ranged from 7 to 27, indicating a high variation in length. According to the numbers of 4 T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes and glutamine residues in the two ployglutamine domains among the 19 α-gliadin genes, 2 were assigned to chromosome 6A, 5 to chromosome 6B and 12 to chromosome 6D. These results were consistent with those from wheat cv. Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and phylogenetic analysis. Secondary structure prediction showed that all α-gliadins had high content of β-strands and most of the α-helixes and β-strands were present in two unique domains. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that α-gliadin genes had a high homology with γ-gliadin, B-hordein, and LMW-GS genes and they diverged at approximate 39 MYA. Finally, the five α-gliadin genes were successfully expressed in E. coli, and their expression amount reached to the maximum after 4 h induced by IPTG, indicating that the α-gliadin genes can express in a high level under the control of T₇ promoter. 3aAegilops tauschii 3aEscherichia coli 3aTriticum aestivum 3aceliac disease 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3acysteine 3aepitopes 3aglutamine 3ahexaploidy 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 3aproteins 3apseudogenes 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astop codon 3atoxicity 3awheat 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCeliac Diseasexgeneticsximmunology. 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEpitopes, T-Lymphocytexchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aEscherichia coli 2aGenes, Plantxgeneticsximmunology. 2aGliadinxchemistryxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aINDEL Mutation 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPeptides 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aPseudogenes 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTriticumxgeneticsximmunology.1 aWang, Congyan1 aWang, Ke1 aWang, Shunli1 aLi, Xiaohui1 aZhang, Zhao1 aMa, Wujun1 aYan, Yueming0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2010 Nov., v. 121, no. 7 p.1239-1251dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-010-1384-8 7aarticle02202naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245012300147300001400270520078300284650001101067650002901078650001401107650002301121650001901144650003301163650004701196650002701243650001101270650006301281650003401344650003501378653001001413653002601423653003001449653002801479700001501507700002001522700001601542773014501558852000901703939003301712946001101745655001201756IND9303762920221117204353.0930624e19930210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930376292DNAL7 a84314932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDessel, G. van14aThe shuttling of dolichol between VLDL and HDL: involvement of a protein factor from lipoprotein-deficient human serum  ap. 64-72.  aThe occurrence of a dolichol transfer factor in LPDS has been demonstrated using three different transfer assays. Applying a three step purification procedure, the transfer factor could be enriched 4000-5000-fold with a recovery of 1-2%. SDS-gel electrophoresis revealed a molecular weight of 64 kDa. Kinetics as well as the influence of a series of effectors were studied. Transfer was not accompanied by a concurrent esterification and the HDL3 subpopulation showed the highest acceptor capacity. The transfer factor also affected liposomal stability based on calcein fluorescence dequenching upon release. The characteristics of this dol-TP are discussed in view of these of other plasma LTPs.

Despite the serious arguments against geoengineering, policy-makers may start to take an interest in it in the medium term. The article identifies non-technical characteristics of geoengineering which might influence governance models, and then discusses three broad approaches: through the United Nations, by one state unilaterally, and through a consortium of states. An examination of international legal instruments reveals none that would pose an insuperable barrier to geoengineering. Finally, the article argues for early exploration of the technological, environmental, political and regulatory issues raised by geoengineering, to maximize the chances of good, science-based multilateral decision making if and when geoengineering's day arrives. 3aUnited Nations 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3aequipment 3agovernance 3amodels0 tClimatic change.g2009 July, v. 95, no. 1-2 p.103-119dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-008-9523-9 7aarticle
