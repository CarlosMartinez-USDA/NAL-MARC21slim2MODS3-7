Here, we investigated the diversity of legume-rhizobium symbioses, compared the N2-fixing efficiency of legume-rhizobium symbioses, and clarified the relationship of rhizobia, host species, and microhabitat. Eighteen potential N2-fixing species were surveyed, and only nine of them were found to be nodulated. Most of wild legumes were found to be associated with rhizobia belonging to the genus Bradyrhizobium, except for Callerya nitida, which formed associations with the genus Mesorhizobium. δ15N signatures of Derris fordii were significantly closer to zero than all the other plants tested, suggesting that the D. fordii-ISA2507 (Bradyrhizobium elkanii) symbiosis might have the highest N2-fixing efficiency of all the associations. D. fordii and its rhizobial symbionts may have potential for application in ecological restoration and agricultural production. Host species selection was the major factor, and there was no significant effect of slope position on nodulation-legume symbioses in our study area, in which altitudes ranged from 287 m to 521 m at the small scale. The Shannon diversity and the evenness of N2-fixing species (nodulated legumes) were significantly positively correlated (P < 0.05) with the Shannon and evenness across non-N2-fixing plants (non-nodulated plants), suggesting that the Bradyrhizobium-legume nodulation symbiosis plays an important role in maintaining plant community structure in this degraded ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium elkanii 3aDerris 3aMesorhizobium 3aaltitude 3acommunity structure 3aecological restoration 3aecosystems 3ahosts 3akarsts 3alegumes 3amicrohabitats 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anodulation 3aplant communities 3astable isotopes 3asymbionts 3asymbiosis 3aChina 0aEcological restoration 0aRhizobium nodulation 0aSymbiosis 0anifH 0a15N natural abundance1 aHe, Xunyang1 aWang, Kelin1 aXie, Yanjun1 aXie, Qiang1 aO'Donnell, A.

However, distinguishing the frequency and magnitude of flood events was difficult. Light gray event layers (GELs) in the sediment of Lake Suigetsu in Central Japan can solve this problem because they are recording the occurrence and magnitude of flood events during the last 80 years. Using these GELs, we aimed to reconstruct the frequency and magnitude of flood events during the last 8000 years. First, we verified whether GELs maintained the recording of flood events. We found that thin GELs (less than 40 mg/cm² in mass) were rare, probably because of bioturbation, whereas thick GELs (larger than 40 mg/cm² in mass) were rarely erased. We also found that GELs formed by the same amount of rainfall could have been thinner before 100 years ago. We revealed that the occurrence of extreme flood-origin event layers (EFELs: GELs thicker than 40 mg/cm²) during the last 8000 years may indicate the occurrence of extreme flood events (EFEs). Mass accumulation of EFELs may indicate the minimum estimation of rainfall on EFEs. There are several periods with higher frequency and magnitude of EFEs than those of the present level, agreeing with the periods of high flood activity in western Japan and East China. The frequency and magnitude of EFEs show different temporal variations. Northward and southward shifts in the westerly jet and monsoon fronts can partially explain such patterns.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the JSPS KAKENHI Grant KIBAN-S Number 23221002.  aPublisher supplied data  a23221002cJSPS KAKENHI Grant KIBAN-S 3aHolocene epoch 3aJapan 3abioturbation 3alakes 3amonsoon season 3arain 3asediments 3aChina 0aCentral Japan 0aEvent layer 0aFlood events 0aLake sediment 0aLake Suigestu 0aMid to late-Holocene1 aTada, Ryuji1 aNagashima, Kana1 aNakagawa, Takeshi1 aGotanda, Katsuya1 aHaraguchi, Tsuyoshi1 aSchlolaut, Gordon0 tHolocene.g2021 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.121-133dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x1477-09117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09596836209614973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245017300163300001400336520185500350592002802205650001302233650002002246650001102266650002402277650002302301650001202324653003602336653001502372653001902387653002702406653002202433700002002455700002802475700002402503700002402527773010902551856007402660852000902734655001202743IND60765864420221118001145.0220203e20220202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076586442DNAL7 a10.2326/osj.21.532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBragina, Eugenia V.10aReintroduction of Parent-Reared and Semi-Wild Chicks of Red-Crowned Grus japonensis and White-Naped Cranes Antigone vipio in Russia: Lessons from 29 Years of Experience  ap. 53-62.  aRed-crowned Grus japonensis (IUCN status: Endangered) and White-naped Antigone vipio (IUCN status: Vulnerable) cranes are both rare, with wild populations of ∼3,000 and ∼6,000 individuals, respectively. Since 1991, the Rare Bird Reintroduction Station at the Khingansky State Nature Reserve, Russia, has been rearing and reintroducing chicks of both species to bolster wild populations. The station uses two different chick-rearing methods: (1) the “parent-reared” method, in which chicks are raised in enclosures by natural parents and stay with them until their release into the wild, and (2) the “semi-wild” method, a modification of hand-rearing, in which cohorts of 2–7 chicks spend most of their time together in an enclosure but are guided on daily excursions outside the enclosure, under supervision of a keeper from a distance of 30–50 m. We have assessed and compared apparent survival of crane chicks reared under these methods. Of the 165 juveniles released into the wild from 1991–2019 (104 Red-crowned; 61 White-naped), no difference was found between apparent survival of parent-reared and semi-wild chicks. Six-month apparent survival of Red-crowned Cranes was 84.2% (95% confidence interval: 75.3–90.3%); for White-naped Cranes –89.5% (95% CI: 83.9–93.3%). Both parent-reared and semi-wild chicks were later observed in mated pairs with their own offspring (17 chicks in total), coupling with either other reintroduced birds or with wild individuals. We conclude that both the parent-reared and semi-wild methods had similar outcomes with respect to apparent survival. However, since the semi-wild method is less costly with respect to time (i.e., more juveniles can be released annually using this method) we recommend that it be used whenever possible to bolster these Endangered and Vulnerable populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntigone 3aGrus japonensis 3aRussia 3aconfidence interval 3aconservation areas 3aprogeny 0aEndangered species conservation 0aManagement 0aParent-rearing 0aReintroduction success 0aSemi-wild rearing1 aBalan, Irina V.1 aKuznetsova, Nadezhda V.1 aParilov, Mikhail P.1 aSlaght, Jonathan C.0 tOrnithological science.g2022 Feb. 2, v. 21, no. 1 p.53-62dUniBio PresswJournal:19740x1347-05587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.21.533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010100172300001400273520172900287592002802016650001502044650001702059650001802076650001502094650002202109653001202131653001602143653002402159653002402183653001502207653002202222700002602244700006202270700001802332700002402350700002802374700006302402700002902465700002602494700002602520700002002546700002002566700001902586700002302605700002402628700002602652773010202678856008502780852000902865655001202874IND60543613320221120095835.0190411e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054361332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2014.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaulwetter, Sarah10aResistance of polychaete species and trait patterns to simulated species loss in coastal lagoons  ap. 73-82.  aThe loss of species is known to have negative impacts on the integrity of ecosystems, but the details of this relationship are still far from being fully understood. This study investigates how the distribution patterns of polychaete species and their associated biological trait patterns in six Mediterranean coastal lagoons change under computationally simulated scenarios of random species loss. Species were progressively removed from the full polychaete assemblage and the similarity between the full assemblage and the reduced matrices of both species and trait patterns was calculated. The results indicate the magnitude of changes that might follow species loss in the real world, and allow consideration of the resistance of the system's functional capacity to loss of species, expressed through the species' biological traits as an approximation to functioning. Comparisons were made between the changes in the distribution of species and of traits, as well as between the six different lagoons. While the change of species and trait patterns was strongly correlated within most lagoons, different lagoons showed distinctly different patterns. In disturbed lagoons, the dominance of one or few species was the major driver for the observed patterns and the loss of these species caused extreme changes. Less disturbed lagoons were less susceptible to extreme changes and had a greater resistance towards species loss. Species richness appears to be less important for the ability of the lagoons to buffer changes, instead the initial composition of the assemblage and the identity of the lost species determine the response of the system and our ability to predict changes of the assemblage's functional potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPolychaeta 3abiogeography 3acoastal water 3aecosystems 3aspecies diversity 0aLagoons 0aPolychaetes 0aRandom species loss 0aFunctional capacity 0aRedundancy 0aBiological traits1 aPapageorgiou, Nafsika1 aKoulouri, Panayota1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3418-79801 aFanini, Lucia1 aChatzinikolaou, Eva1 aMarkantonatou, Vasiliki1 aPavloudi, Christina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5106-60671 aChatzigeorgiou, Georgios1 aKeklikoglou, Kleoniki1 aVasileiadou, Katerina1 aBasset, Alberto1 aPinna, Maurizio1 aRosati, Ilaria1 aReizopoulou, Sofia1 aNicolaidou, Artemis1 aArvanitidis, Christos0 tJournal of sea research.g2015 Apr., v. 98 p.73-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2014.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245015000166300001600316520219100332592002802523596007702551596002802628650001602656650004402672650002702716650001302743650001202756650001002768650001502778650001402793650001002807650001602817650001302833651001602846653001002862653001802872653001102890653001102901653001202912653001002924653001302934700001502947700001502962700001602977700001302993773012203006856008503128852000903213655001203222IND60595744820221119192309.0180607e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059574482DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2018.14410782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClough, WJ10aProtection of sheep by vaccination against experimental challenge with Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo and L. interrogans serovar Pomona  ap. 138-143.  aAIMS: To evaluate a multivalent leptospiral and clostridial vaccine for prevention of renal colonisation and urinary shedding in sheep, following experimental challenge with New Zealand strains of Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo type Hardjobovis and L. interrogans serovar Pomona. METHODS: Two separate but similarly designed studies were conducted. In both studies, Romney-cross lambs, aged 9–11 weeks, were randomly allocated to a vaccinated group and a control group. Vaccinated lambs each received two 1.5-mL S/C doses of a multivalent leptospiral and clostridial vaccine, 4 weeks apart, and animals in the control groups received the same dose of saline. Groups of 12 vaccinated and 12 control lambs were randomly selected in each study for challenge with serovars Hardjo or Pomona. Challenge was initiated 16 weeks following the second vaccination with three daily doses of live leptospires by intranasal and conjunctival routes. Following challenge, urine samples were collected weekly for 6 weeks, for dark field microscopy and leptospiral culture; 6 weeks after challenge the lambs were slaughtered and kidneys collected for leptospiral culture. RESULTS: In lambs challenged with serovar Hardjo, 8/12 unvaccinated lambs had ≥1 urine or kidney sample that was positive for leptospires following culture, compared with 0/12 lambs in the vaccinated group (p=0.001). In lambs challenged with serovar Pomona, 9/12 unvaccinated lambs had ≥1 urine or kidney sample that was positive following culture, compared with 0/12 lambs in the vaccinated group (p<0.001). Prevention of renal colonisation and urinary shedding, expressed as the prevented fraction, was 100 (95% CI=61.7–100)% and 100 (95% CI=68.3–100)% against challenge with serovars Hardjo and Pomona, respectively, at 4 months after vaccination. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Use of a multivalent leptospiral and clostridial vaccine demonstrated protection against challenge from New Zealand strains of serovars of Hardjo and Pomona 4 months after vaccination in lambs first vaccinated at 9–11 weeks of age.

Urban spatial discontinuity, which occurs when the urban fabric includes built-up or green areas and a relevant share of vacant spaces, has gained recent attention. In this paper, we use Global Human Settlement Layer data to track urbanisation dynamics in European Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) from 1990 to 2014. We represent urban sprawl as the spatial expansion of FUAs associated with either or both declining population density and increasing built-up area discontinuity. We also consider the association with the demographic trends that have been described as the primary driver of urban spatial expansion. We use configural frequency analysis to explore the local association between the different characters of sprawl. We found evidence that urban sprawl effectively took differentiated forms across European FUAs. Even though FUAs have generally become less dense and more disperse, our results show that the extent of these phenomena appears to be more contained in recent years than in previous decades. Both elements of sprawl characterise FUAs with a shrinking population, confirming the decoupling of urban development policies and demographic trends in cities. The results call for better controlled urban development, favouring compact cities and subjecting land-use changes to a perspective of urban population growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adevelopment policy 3aemployment 3afabrics 3aland use change 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3aurbanization1 aOueslati, Walid 1 aPareglio, Stefano 0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110822473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02993naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010800163300001400271520184700285592002802132650001302160650001302173650001502186650001502201650001002216650000902226650001502235650001502250650001802265653001402283653002302297653002402320653001602344700002102360700002202381773010902403856007402512852000902586655001202595IND60765864520221118001337.0220203e20220202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076586452DNAL7 a10.2326/osj.21.632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishibayashi, Naoya10aComparison of the Home Ranges of Mountain Hawk-Eagles during Different Phases of Wind Farm Construction  ap. 63-70.  aRaptors are long-lived apex predators with a lower rate of breeding success than smaller birds. Therefore, their responses to the construction of wind farms must be documented to assess the impact of wind energy on birds. We estimated the home ranges of three pairs of Mountain Hawk-Eagle Nisaetus nipalensis orientalis before, during, and after construction of a wind energy facility to assess changes in home range. We also compared altitude, inclination, and land cover composition of habitats within home ranges during the construction phase. For one pair, the home range of which included wind farm construction, the distance from the home range to the construction area during the first year of construction increased significantly compared with that during pre-construction, but there was no significant difference between the post-construction and construction phase. It is thought that the construction of a wind farm within the home range caused the displacement, and that displacement began during the first phase of construction and continuing during the second phase and afterwards. Because the birds moved about 500 m away from the wind farm during the construction and post-construction phases but succeeded in breeding, we think that the distance of 500 m may be meaningful in terms of mitigating disturbance. The nest trees of all three successful breeding pairs were more than 1.3 km from the closest wind turbine, perhaps indicative that impact on breeding is light if construction takes place this far away from breeding sites. No significant differences in either land cover or inclination within home ranges were found during the construction phase, which might explain why all birds bred successfully during the second construction phase. After construction, all three pairs continued to use areas with similar habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3aland cover 3anests 3awind 3awind farms 3awind power 3awind turbines 0aAvoidance 0aConstruction phase 0aMountain Hawk-Eagle 0aWind energy1 aKitamura, Wataru1 aYoshizaki, Shinji0 tOrnithological science.g2022 Feb. 2, v. 21, no. 1 p.63-70dUniBio PresswJournal:19740x1347-05587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2326/osj.21.633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002100167245007100188300001600259500002000275500001500295520138800310592002801698650001701726650002301743650001401766650001101780650002601791650001801817650002301835651001101858651001501869773013001884852000902014856010802023655001202131IND2205034320221123044950.0180321e200002  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220503432DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0248:EONFMS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarey, Andrew B.10aEffects of new forest management strategieson squirrel populations  ap. 248-257.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aTwo strategies for managing forests for multiple values have achieved prominence in debates in the Pacific Northwest: (1) legacy retention with passive management and long rotations, and (2) intensive management for timber with commercial thinnings and long rotations. Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus), Townsend’s chipmunks (Tamias townsendii), and Douglas’ squirrels (Tamiasciurus douglasii) were studied retrospectively in Douglas‐fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests managed under the alternative strategies in the Puget Trough of Washington. Flying squirrels were twice as abundant under legacy retention as under intensive management for timber, almost as abundant as in old‐growth western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) forests on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, but <50% as abundant as in old‐growth Douglas‐fir forests in western Oregon. Chipmunks were four times as abundant under intensive timber management, as under legacy retention, but less abundant than in old‐growth forests. Abundance of Douglas’ squirrels did not differ between strategies. Neither strategy produced the increased abundance of all three species that is an emergent property of late‐seral forests. A third strategy holds promise: active, intentional ecosystem management that incorporates legacy retention, variable‐density thinning, and management for decadence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTamiasciurus 3aconiferous forests 3aGlaucomys 3aTamias 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3acrop rotation 3aTsuga heterophylla 3aOregon 0aWashington0 tEcological applications.g2000 Feb., v. 10, no. 1 p.248-257dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010%5B0248:EONFMS%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02607naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245015800175300001800333520129600351592002801647650002401675650001401699650001701713650001701730650001501747650001501762650002501777650001701802700002101819700002201840700002601862700002001888700002201908700001601930700001701946700001901963773012001982856008602102852000902188655001202197IND60753560420221119160258.0211015e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075356042DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2021.18719252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAktepe, Oktay Halit14aThe Predictive Value of Red Blood Cell Distribution Width for Survival Outcomes of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients Treated with Targeted Therapy  ap. 1957-1963.  aWe aimed to investigate the prognostic value of red cell distribution width (RDW) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated with targeted therapy, including sunitinib and pazopanib. A total of 104 mRCC patients were included. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and the long-rank test was used for comparison. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between RDW and PFS and OS. The PFS and OS of all cohorts were 11.8 mo and 25.9 mo, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that RDW level ≥15.4 was the optimal cutoff value for OS prediction with 73.53% sensitivity and 61.11% specificity (area under curve: 0.64, P = 0.012). RDW level ≥15.4 was found as an independent prognostic parameter for OS when adjusted for the number of covariates, including the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) scoring system (hazard ratio: 1.125, 95% confidence interval: 1.024–2.235, P = 0.014). Our study revealed that high RDW level, a routinely and easily assessed marker, was significantly associated with worse survival outcomes in mRCC patients treated with targeted therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3aerythrocytes 3ahazard ratio 3ametastasis 3aprediction 3arenal cell carcinoma 3atherapeutics1 aGuven, Deniz Can1 aSahin, Taha Koray1 aYildirim, Hasan Cagri1 aCelikten, Burcu1 aYeter, Haci Hasan1 aYuce, Deniz1 aDizdar, Omer1 aErman, Mustafa0 tNutrition and cancer.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 73, no. 10 p.1957-1963dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2021.18719253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012000165300001600285520121100301592002801512596007801540650000901618650001301627650001601640650001601656650002501672650000701697650003001704650001401734650001501748650001301763650001801776650001801794650002001812651001601832700001801848700002301866700001901889700001901908773013501927856008102062852000902143655001202152IND60630554820221120211847.0190210e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063055482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-018-1156-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Min-Jiao10aFlavitalea flava sp. nov., a bacterium isolated from a soil sample, and emended description of the genus Flavitalea  ap. 275-281.  aA Gram-stain negative strain, designated AN120636ᵀ, was isolated from a soil sample collected from Goesan-gun, Chungbuk, South Korea. The strain was strictly aerobic, with golden yellow-pigmented colonies on R2A agar. Cells were non-motile, long or short rods and some were observed to be coccal. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain AN120636ᵀ belongs to the genus Flavitalea in the family of Chitinophagacea, with Flavitalea populi (95.4%), Pseudoflavitalea soli (95.0%), Flavitalea gansuensis (94.7%) and Pseudoflavitalea rhizosphaerae (94.7%) as its close relatives. Growth was observed at 15–32 °C, pH 5.0–7.0 and in the absence of NaCl. The strain contained iso-C₁₇:₀ 3-OH, iso-C₁₅:₁ G and iso-C₁₅:₀ as its major cellular fatty acids; phosphatidylethanolamine as the major polar lipid; MK-7 as its respiratory quinone; and the polyamine was homospermidine. The genomic DNA G+C content was 44.8 mol%. On the basis of the polyphasic evidence, strain AN120636ᵀ is considered to represent a novel species, for which the name Flavitalea flava sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AN120636ᵀ (=KCTC 52346ᵀ=CCTCC AB 2017174ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2013M3A9A5076601cMinistry of Science and ICT of the Korea Government 3aagar 3abacteria 3afatty acids 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3apolyamines 3aquinones 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asodium chloride 3aSouth Korea1 aJin, Chun-Zhi1 aErsiman, Ainijiang1 aPark, Dong-Jin1 aKim, Chang-Jin0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2019 Feb., v. 112, no. 2 p.275-281dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-018-1156-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010700159520109100266592002801357650001501385650001901400650001101419650001101430650001301441650001601454650001801470651001001488700001801498700001701516700001301533700001601546700001501562773012701577856007401704852000901778655001201787IND60652921520221122220224.0190713e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065292152DNAL7 a10.3390/su110822482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xintong 12aA Normal Cloud Model-Based Method for Water Quality Assessment of Springs and Its Application in Jinan  aSprings are a source of drinking water and a famous tourist attraction in Jinan, China. In this paper, a multi-index evaluation method was proposed based on a normal cloud model. This model is new graphic model, which could synthetically picture the randomness and fuzziness of concepts. Ten parameters were selected, and water quality was classified into five levels. Three numerical characteristics were calculated, and the weights were assigned by an integrated weighting algorithm. The uncertainty of each spring was calculated by a cloud generator and the integrated certainty grades of water quality were determined. To ensure the accuracy of the normal cloud model, the proposed method was used to assess the water quality of springs in Jinan, China. The results obtained by the proposed method were compared with that of the other four methods. The results obtained by different methods are highly consistent. The proposed cloud model-based method can reflect the water quality level and provides a practical guide for water quality evaluation, as demonstrated in Jinan springs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adrinking water 3amodels 3aspring 3atourists 3auncertainty 3awater quality 3aChina1 aYang, Weimin 1 aXu, Zhenhao 1 aHu, Jie 1 aXue, Yiguo 1 aLin, Peng 0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110822483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245011600165300001600281520137300297592002801670596006801698596006801766596008501834596006501919596008801984650001502072650001902087650002002106650001502126700001702141700001602158773016102174856008202335852000902417655001202426IND60688160720221119042831.0200409e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068816072DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-020-01787-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Junfei10aPrediction of [Formula: see text] concentration based on weighted bagging and image contrast-sensitive features  ap. 561-573.  aIn this paper, we propose an effective method of [Formula: see text] prediction based on image contrast-sensitive features and weighted bagging based neural network (WBBNN). Three types of image contrast-sensitive features are first extracted from the images and fuzzified. Next, a weighted bagging strategy combining the ensemble fuzzy neural network (FNN) and ensemble radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is established. The ensemble neural network (NN), regardless of FNN and RBFNN, is obtained by simply averaging the outputs of component neural networks. And these component neural networks are trained by the improved gradient descent algorithm and samples acquired by bootstrap sampling. Finally, the WBBNN is used to forecast [Formula: see text] concentration by extracting three types of image contrast-sensitive features. Results of experiments demonstrate that our prediction method is more reliable, practical and efficient than FNN, RBFNN, the ensemble NNs, and state-of-the-art quality assessment method in terms of predicting the concentration of [Formula: see text]. More importantly, an improved gradient descent algorithm is developed to accelerate the convergence speed and ensure the prediction accuracy of WBBNN and the fuzzy features acquired by the feature fuzzification method can greatly improve the robustness and precision of WBBNN.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 61533002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  aNo. 61603009cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  aNo. 2018ZX07111005cNational Major Science and Technology Projects of China (CN)  aNo. 61890930-5cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2018Y\\FC1900800-5cNational Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (CN) 3aalgorithms 3aimage analysis 3aneural networks 3aprediction1 aHe, Zengzeng1 aDu, Shengli0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2020 Apr., v. 34, no. 3-4 p.561-573dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-020-01787-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245009600164300001200260520083400272592002801106650001501134650001801149650002001167650003501187650001001222650001301232650001801245650001201263650005201275650001401327650001301341700001501354700001301369700001301382700001601395700001401411700001701425700001601442700001601458773010901474856007901583852000901662655001201671IND60749260720221119030944.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074926072DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-3712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Mingxing12aA novel protein-coding ORF72.2 gene was identified from Marek's disease virus strain CVI988  ap. 371.  aMarek's disease is a highly contagious disease of poultry characterized by rapid-on set of T-cell lymphomas, which is caused by Marek's disease virus (MDV), but its pathogenic mechanism is still not very clear. Recently, some new progress were achieved in molecular character of MDV. Along with the genomic sequencing of MDV serotype 1, some novel open reading frames (ORFs) were predicted, and ORF72.2 was one of them which have no homologues in other MDV serotypes or in other alphaherpesvirus. In the study, ORF72.2 was firstly identified as a protein-coding gene by the method of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assay. This study paved the way to conduct further studies to determine whether ORF72.2 plays a role in MDV replication and pathogenicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMardivirus 3aMarek disease 3aT-cell lymphoma 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenes 3agenomics 3apathogenicity 3apoultry 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3avirology1 aZhao, Yang1 aShi, Min1 aLin, Yan1 aZou, Nianli1 aLiu, Ping1 aWen, Xintian1 aCao, Sanjie1 aHuang, Yong0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.371-371dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-3713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03627naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245014000210300001300350500001500363520166100378592002802039650002902067650002302096650001502119650001102134650002502145650002102170650002802191650001902219650001402238650002902252650002402281650001502305650002102320650002002341650002602361650002402387650001702411650001902428650002002447650002202467650001702489650002802506653002402534653001902558653004002577653002902617653002102646653002502667653001702692700001702709700001802726700001702744700002002761773012602781856008502907852000902992655001203001IND60543613520221120095704.0190411e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054361352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejsobi.2015.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangalassery, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5431-648710aImpacts of zero tillage on soil enzyme activities, microbial characteristics and organic matter functional chemistry in temperate soils  ap. 9-17.  a2019-12-06  aZero tillage management of agricultural soils has potential for enhancing soil carbon (C) storage and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the mechanisms which control carbon (C) sequestration in soil in response to zero tillage are not well understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the links between zero tillage practices and the functioning of the soil microbial community with regards to C cycling, testing the hypothesis that zero tillage enhances biological functioning in soil with positive implications for C sequestration. Specifically, we determined microbial respiration rates, enzyme activities, carbon source utilization and the functional chemistry of the soil organic matter in temperate well drained soils that had been zero tilled for seven years against annually tilled soils. Zero tilled soils contained 9% more soil C, 30% higher microbial biomass C than tilled soil and an increased presence of aromatic functional groups indicating greater preservation of recalcitrant C. Greater CO2 emission and higher respirational quotients were observed from tilled soils compared to zero tilled soils while microbial biomass was 30% greater in zero tilled soils indicating a more efficient functioning of the microbial community under zero tillage practice. Furthermore, microbial enzyme activities of dehydrogenase, cellulase, xylanase, β-glucosidase, phenol oxidase and peroxidase were higher in zero tilled soils. Considering zero tillage enhanced both microbial functioning and C storage in soil, we suggest that it offers significant promise to improve soil health and support mitigation measures against climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aagricultural soils 3ano-tillage 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil respiration 3aagricultural management 3acarbon dioxide 3axylanases 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3asoil microorganisms 3aperoxidase 3abeta-glucosidase 3atemperate soils 3amicrobial communities 3asoil organic matter 3asoil quality 3aclimate change 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial biomass 3asoil enzymes 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 0aSoil organic matter 0aorganic matter 0aSoil microbial functional diversity 0aMicrobial biomass carbon 0aGreenhouse gases 0aCarbon sequestration 0aSoil enzymes1 aMooney, S.J.1 aSparkes, D.L.1 aFraser, W.T.1 aSjögersten, S.0 tEuropean journal of soil biology.g2015 May,  June, v. 68 p.9-17dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl597945x1164-55637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejsobi.2015.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02585naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245014700159520138200306592002801688650001801716650002501734650001401759650003001773650002401803650001401827650001601841650000901857650002101866650002101887650001901908650001101927651001101938700001801949700001801967773012601985856007902111852000902190655001202199IND60763378320221119102638.0220120e20220104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076337832DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110101112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Ying 10aSelenomethionine Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment, Decreases Hippocampal Oxidative Stress and Attenuates Dysbiosis in D-Galactose-Treated Mice  aThe prevalence of age-related cognitive impairment is increasing as the proportion of older individuals in the population grows. It is therefore necessary and urgent to find agents to prevent or ameliorate age-related cognitive impairment. Selenomethionine (SeMet) is a natural amino acid occurring in yeast and Brazil nuts. It mitigates cognitive impairment in an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model, however, whether it works on age-related cognitive impairment remains unknown. In this study, SeMet significantly improved the performance of D-galactose-treated mice in the novel object recognition test, passive avoidance task and Morris water maze test. SeMet reversed D-galactose-induced reduction of hippocampal acetylcholine levels, suppression of choline acetyltransferase activity and activation of acetyl cholinesterase. It decreased D-galactose-induced oxidative stress and increased the selenoprotein P levels in the hippocampus. Besides, it attenuated D-galactose-induced dysbiosis by increasing the α-diversity and modulating the taxonomic structure. Correlations between certain taxa and physiological parameters were observed. Our results provide evidence of the effectiveness of SeMet on ameliorating D-galactose-induced cognitive impairment and suggest SeMet has potential to be used in the prevention or adjuvant treatment of age-related cognitive impairment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetylcholine 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aadjuvants 3acholine acetyltransferase 3acognitive disorders 3adysbiosis 3ahippocampus 3amice 3aoxidative stress 3aselenomethionine 3aselenoproteins 3ayeasts 3aBrazil1 aXu, Yongquan 1 aYin, Junfeng 0 tAntioxidants.g2022 Jan. 04, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110101113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02750naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002600150245008500176300001400261520167900275592002801954650002201982650001202004650001702016650001402033650004802047650001102095650001302106650001302119650001902132650001502151651001802166700002602184773008302210856008602293852000902379655001202388IND4475691720221119193456.0141111e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447569172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.07.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourgault, Rebecca R.10aGenesis and characterization of manganiferous soils in the Eastern Piedmont, USA  ap. 84-94.  aManganese is normally a trace element in soils, but it is important due to its effects on soil chemistry and morphology. There are rare, Mn-rich soils in the Eastern Piedmont of the USA that have not been previously studied. The morphology, mineralogy, and chemical and physical properties of these manganiferous soils were documented in order to better understand their pedogenesis. The soils were found to contain as much as 169gkg⁻¹ Fe and 140gkg⁻¹ Mn as oxides (dithionite–citrate–bicarbonate extractable). These high levels of Mn oxides impart an extremely dark color to the soil material (moist Munsell value and chroma commonly <2/1). Manganiferous soil materials have unusual physical properties such as high particle density (up to 3.25×10⁻⁶Mgm⁻³ on bulk soil), low bulk density (as low as 0.39×10⁻⁶Mgm⁻³), and extremely high porosity (maximum calculated 88%). X-Ray Diffraction and Fourier Transform Infrared spectra show that the dominant Fe oxide and Mn oxide minerals in the soils are hematite and lithiophorite, respectively. Samples of the parent marble were dissolved in acid for Fe and Mn analysis and collection of non-carbonate residues (NCR). Based on the quantities of Fe and Mn in the bedrock, the mineralogy of the NCR, and micromorphological observations, it appears that the black, porous, Mn-rich material is derived directly from the dissolution of marble bedrock and accumulation of silicate residues plus Mn and Fe from within the rock. These soils, which appear to have a similar origin to Mn wad deposits, offer a unique opportunity for future studies of soil Mn due to the naturally high concentration of this metal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3abedrock 3abulk density 3amanganese 3aoxide, hydroxide, and oxyhydroxide minerals 3aoxides 3apiedmont 3aporosity 3asoil chemistry 3asoil color 3aUnited States1 aRabenhorst, Martin C.0 tGeoderma.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 165, no. 1 p.84-94dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012800155300001800283520107600301592002801377650002301405650003401428650002201462650001301484650001501497650001101512650001401523650002301537650003501560650002301595650001301618650001501631650002001646650001801666650001101684650001301695650001801708650001701726650001401743650002001757650001601777650001601793650001201809650003701821700001401858700001801872700001601890773012501906856007402031852000902105655001202114IND60662735520221122221602.0190906e20140324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066273552DNAL7 a10.1039/c3gc42121j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ying10aFacile route fabrication of nickel based mesoporous carbons with high catalytic performance towards 4-nitrophenol reduction  ap. 2273-2280.  aNovel nickel based mesoporous carbons are firstly in situ fabricated via pyrolysis of CTAB-chitosan-nickel supramolecular aggregates, which are pre-constructed by CTAB-directed self-assembly of 8-quinolinol modified chitosan and nickel acetate under basic conditions. This facile route fabrication method renders smart and homogeneously dispersed Ni nanoparticles (NPs) on the mesoporous carbonaceous framework without using any stabilizer and additional reductant, verified by high-energy X-ray diffraction, TEM, X-ray absorption fine structure, N₂ adsorption/desorption and Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, it is found that the morphology of Ni NPs, the textural property of carbonaceous supports, and the corresponding catalytic performance towards 4-nitrophenol reduction vary with the pyrolysis temperature. It is suggested that the nickel based mesoporous carbon pyrolyzed at 750 °C (Ni/MC-750) simultaneously possessing uniform spherical Ni NPs (24.5 nm) and bottle-neck mesopores exhibits the largest activity factor of 20.9 s⁻¹ g⁻¹ of any nickel catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aacetates 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3achemical reduction 3achitosan 3adesorption 3agreen chemistry 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3anitrogen 3ap-nitrophenol 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3areducing agents 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3atexture 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aRen, Yang1 aSun, Chengjun1 aHao, Shijie0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 Mar. 24, v. 16, no. 4 p.2273-2280dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3gc42121j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03499naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010000171300001600271520189000287592002802177650002402205650001302229650001602242650001902258650001202277650002602289650001802315650001902333650000902352650001502361650001102376650001502387650001002402650001302412650001402425650001402439650001602453650002402469650001402493650002002507650001002527650003202537650001002569700001802579700002302597700002202620700002202642700006002664773012902724856008302853852000902936655001202945IND60634461320221117225703.0190817e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063446132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-018-01069-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebuse, Valerie J.10aEnvironmental influences on stem borer incidence in Australian subtropical Corymbia plantations  ap. 579-593.  aPopulation dynamics of forest insect pests are a key determinant of forest health globally, but there is often insufficient information on tree susceptibility and environmental drivers of attack to construct pest population models that inform management. We investigated susceptibility of Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegata (spotted gum) plantations to two stem borer families (Cerambycidae, Cossidae) for which the drivers of attack are largely unknown. We surveyed 20 plantations for borer incidence (proportion of trees attacked), severity (number of attacks/attacked tree) and height and collected environmental variables in six categories (site characteristics, physical soil characteristics, foliar nutrition, landscape structure, climate and management). Most attacks on tree stems were associated with the cerambycid beetle Phoracantha solida, which were positively related to secondary attack from the cossid moth Culama australis. Mean incidence of borer attack was 3.5% and highly variable across plantations (0–22%). Phoracantha solida incidence was highly correlated with severity at a plantation scale. Relative tree diameter was the most important associate of P. solida attack incidence; proportionately larger diameter trees were more likely to be attacked where no thinning had occurred. Foliar nutrients, specifically lower concentrations of potassium, iron and nitrogen, were associated with higher P. solida attack incidence. We suggest that measuring incidence can be used as a proxy for severity of P. solida-associated damage at a plantation scale in operational pest surveillance. The results indicate that thinning may reduce the occurrence of proportionately larger diameter trees being attacked. We also recommend further research to determine the effectiveness of adding fertiliser to remediate sites that are deficient in potassium, nitrogen and iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorymbia citriodora 3aCossidae 3aPhoracantha 3aboring insects 3aclimate 3aenvironmental factors 3aforest health 3aforest insects 3airon 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amoths 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3anutrition 3aplantations 3apopulation dynamics 3apotassium 3asoil properties 3astems 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees1 aSmith, Tim E.1 aHolloway, Chris T.1 aWiegand, Aaron N.1 aNahrung, Helen F.1 aLawson, Simon A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1692-80440 tJournal of pest science.g2019 Mar., v. 92, no. 2 p.579-593dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870064x1612-47587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-018-01069-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245008100163300001200244520178700256592002802043650002202071650002502093650001802118650001302136650001802149650001402167650001602181650001002197650002402207650001102231650001302242650001402255650002102269650001702290650002202307700001902329700001802348700001302366700001602379773010902395856007902504852000902583655001202592IND60749260820221119030949.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074926082DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-3722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Chongfeng10aChicken cyclophilin A is an inhibitory factor to influenza virus replication  ap. 372.  aBACKGROUND: The importance of enhancing influenza resistance in domestic flocks is quite clear both scientifically and economically. Chicken is very susceptible to influenza virus. It has been reported that human cellular cyclophilin A (CypA) impaired influenza virus infection in 293T cells. Whether chicken CypA (chCypA) inhibits influenza virus replication is not known. The molecular mechanism of resistance in chicken to influenza virus remains to be studied. RESULTS: The chCypA gene was isolated and characterized in the present study. It contained an ORF of 498 bp encoding a polypeptide of 165 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 17.8 kDa sharing high identity with mammalian CypA genes. The chCypA demonstrated an anti-influenza activity as expected. ChCypA protein was shown to be able to specifically interact with influenza virus M1 protein. Cell susceptibility to influenza virus was reduced by over-expression of chCypA in CEF cells. The production of recombinant influenza virus A/WSN/33 reduced to one third in chCypA expressing cells comparing to chCypA absent cells. ChCypA was widely distributed in a variety of chicken tissues. It localized in cytoplasm of chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells. Avian influenza virus infection induced its translocation from cytoplasm into nucleus. ChCypA expression was not significantly up-regulated by avian influenza virus infection. The present study indicated that chCypA was an inhibitory protein to influenza virus replication, suggesting a role as an intrinsic immunity factor against influenza virus infection. CONCLUSION: The present data demonstrates that chCypA possesses anti-influenza virus activity which allows the consideration of genetic improvement for resistance to influenza virus in chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aantiviral properties 3achick embryos 3achickens 3acyclophilin A 3acytoplasm 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3ahumans 3aimmunity 3ainfluenza 3amolecular weight 3apolypeptides 3avirus replication1 aMeng, Shanshan1 aLiu, Xiaoling1 aSun, Lei1 aLiu, Wenjun0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.372-372dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-3723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006700153245011800220520176000338592002802098650002802126650001102154650002002165650001702185650002202202650001402224653002002238653002602258653003102284653002302315653002702338653002502365700002702390700002002417700001602437700003102453773011002484856008802594852000902682655001202691IND60754661520221122055551.0211106e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075466152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1059452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagedoorn, Liselotte C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6075-896X10aAngry waves that eat the coast: An economic analysis of nature-based and engineering solutions to coastal erosion  aCoastal areas in developing countries are very vulnerable to the effects of sea-level rise. Adaptation to sea-level rise through protection measures can include both engineering and nature-based solutions. However, comparative economic analyses across both types of solutions are sparse. Moreover, stated preference studies in developing countries that are commonly applied to estimate the benefits of adaptation projects increasingly include time payments as an alternative to money payments. The implications of this payment mode on policy recommendations remains unclear. In this study, we conduct cost-benefit analyses (CBA) that incorporate the results of discrete choice experiments with money as well as time payments for both an engineering (groynes) and a nature-based (beach nourishment) solution. We provide a range of sensitivity analyses regarding discount rates, effectiveness of the measures, cost estimates and different projections in the benefit calculations. These quantitative CBAs are complemented by qualitative insights from focus group discussions. We find overall negative net present values of both engineering and nature-based erosion solutions when money payments are applied, but positive values when time payments are applied. Qualitative insights describe the disruptive effects of erosion on local livelihoods. The qualitative results combined with previous studies’ results provide support for the use of the time payment results. Furthermore, our results indicate that nourishment has a larger positive effect on welfare than groynes. These results provide relevant insights for decision-makers regarding coastal adaptation and stated preference practitioners in developing countries regarding the use of time payments.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoastal zone management 3acoasts 3adecision making 3afocus groups 3aissues and policy 3asea level 0aCoastal erosion 0aCost-benefit analyses 0aDiscrete choice experiment 0aEcosystem services 0aNature-based solutions 0aTime payment vehicle1 aAppeaning-Addo, Kwasi,1 aKoetse, Mark J.1 aKinney, Ken1 avan Beukering, Pieter J.H.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 214 p.105945-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2021.1059453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245009800158300001600256520167600272592002801948650001601976650001501992650001602007650001302023650001502036650001902051650002402070651001102094651001002105651003202115653001302147653001702160653001802177653002602195653002102221653001702242653001002259653001302269653001702282653001702299700002502316700002502341700002202366700002302388700002202411773014402433856007602577852000902653655001202662IND60765864920221118001446.0220203e20211116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076586492DNAL7 a10.3372/wi.51.513012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConti, Fabio12aA taxonomic revision of the Siler montanum group (Apiaceae) in Italy and the Balkan Peninsula  ap. 321-347.  aA morphometric-based taxonomic revision of the Siler montanum group (Apiaceae) from Italy and the Balkan Peninsula was carried out. Multivariate and univariate analyses were performed on 47 morphological characters including seven ratios, and based on the study of 328 dried herbarium specimens. According to our results, the characters employed in the study revealed their suitability as key characters for the examined taxa. A taxonomic treatment was presented and a new diagnostic key to the S. montanum group is also provided for Italy and Balkan Peninsula. Ten taxa were recognized within the group, and among them three new subspecies were described: S. montanum subsp. apuanum, S. montanum subsp. corrasianum and S. montanum subsp. ogliastrinum. Furthermore, three new combinations were proposed: S. zernyi subsp. laeve, S. zernyi subsp. ochridanum and S. montanum subsp. stabianum. Six names were lectotypified: Laserpitium garganicum var. balcanicum, L. garganicum var. laeve, L. garganicum var. scabrum, L. siculum var. stabianum, L. siler var. ovalifolium and Ligusticum garganicum. Occurrences were confirmed for Siler zernyi subsp. zernyi in Greece and S. zernyi subsp. laeve in North Macedonia. Occurrences were excluded for S. montanum subsp. garganicum in Greece and North Macedonia and S. montanum subsp. siculum in C and S Italy.

We tested how three types of exposure duration to 4 °C warming (acute, developmental and transgenerational exposure to 24 °C vs 20 °C) shape the effect of the pesticide chlorpyrifos on two ecologically relevant fitness-related traits of mosquito larvae: heat tolerance and antipredator behaviour. Transgenerational (from the parental generation) and developmental (from the egg stage) warming appeared energetically more stressful than acute warming (from the final instar), because (i) only the latter resulted in an adaptive increase of heat tolerance, and (ii) especially developmental and transgenerational warming reduced the diving responsiveness and diving time. Exposure to chlorpyrifos decreased the heat tolerance, diving responsiveness and diving time. The impact of chlorpyrifos was lower at 24 °C than at 20 °C indicating that the expected increase in toxicity at 24 °C was overruled by the observed increase in pesticide degradation. Notably, although our results suggest that transgenerational warming was energetically more stressful, it did reduce the chlorpyrifos-induced negative effects at 24 °C on heat tolerance and the alarm escape response compared to acute warming. Our results provide important evidence that the exposure duration to warming may determine the impact of a pesticide under warming, thereby identifying a novel temporal aspect of stressor interactions in risk assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulicidae 3aantipredatory behavior 3achlorpyrifos 3aecotoxicology 3aeggs 3aescape behavior 3aexposure duration 3aheat tolerance 3ainstars 3apesticide degradation 3apollution 3arisk assessment 3atoxicity 0aAntipredator behaviour 0aGlobal warming 0aHeat tolerance 0aTransgenerational effects 0aThermal plasticity1 aTran, Tam T.1 aDelnat, Vienna1 aStoks, Robby1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4130-04590 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 284 p.117217-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1172173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245005300188300001200241520238700253592002802640650002902668650001202697650001702709650002002726650001302746650001302759650001302772650001502785650001502800650002502815650001002840650001402850650002502864650001102889650001002900650001002910650001302920651002102933773008802954856010703042852000903149655001203158IND60131195720221121231344.0160903e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013119572DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2002)022[0282:ADDACS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimoney, Kevin12aA dyin delta? A case study of a wetland paradigm  ap. 282.  aThe Peace-Athabasca Delta, Canada, a RAMSAR Wetland of International Significance, has since the 1970s been viewed as an ecosystem in decline. The putative reason for its decline has been the regulation of the Peace River by the W.A.C. Bennett Dam in British Columbia. The dying delta paradigm has its origin in a short-term study that coincided with a transient drawdown of the open drainage lakes in the delta. The paradigm has circumscribed all subsequent studies of the delta in its a priori assumption that all detected changes are due to the dam and are negative. As a result, the growth of scientific understanding has been stifled. Factors that contribute to the lack of ecological understanding unclude problems of data quality, quantity, and scale, ecological complexity, media marketing, failure to consult or analyze older/historical datasets, over-reliance on gray literature, too few wetland ecologists, and too little interdisciplinary thinking. Factors that may be involved in the recent changes, or lack of changes, include climatic variation and change. normal wetland dynamism, stochasticity, flow regulation, weirs, dredging, avulsions and their prevention, influxes of weeds and contaminants, delta evolution, and cultural change. The assessment of health in a delta is problematic since deltas are naturally stressed, dynamic ecosystems. Indicators of anthropogenic stress, such as declines in diversity and abundance, changes in biomass and primary production, or retrogressive succession may be difficult to apply in deltas. Long-term datasets are required that allow differentiation of normal from anthropogenic changes. Critique of the ‘dying delta’ view reveals little scientific support. The often-stated decline in flood frequency seems to have no statistical basis. The ecological health of the Peace-Athabasca Delta was assessed based on 26 attributes; 18 attributes indicated health, 3 indicated stress/disease, and 5 attributes were either neutral or required study. When compared to other major deltas in North America, the Peace-Athabasca Delta stands out as a paragon of ecosystem health. This study presents a cautionary lesson in the power of unchallenged paradigms in shaping scientific and popular opinion. A new paradigm views the delta as predominantly healthy, driven by large-scale natural processes, complex, and dynamically varying.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiomass 3acase studies 3adata collection 3adrainage 3adrawdown 3adredging 3aecologists 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3alakes 3amarketing 3aprimary productivity 3arivers 3aweeds 3aweirs 3awetlands 3aBritish Columbia0 tWetlands.g2002 June, v. 22, no. 2 p.282-282dSpringer Netherlandsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672/0277-5212(2002)022%5B0282:ADDACS%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04111naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002600167245010400193300001600297500002000313520306700333592002803400650002103428650001903449650001403468650001403482650001703496650002203513651001503535773013003550852000903680856010803689655001203797IND2205033620221123044407.0180321e200002  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220503362DNAL7 a10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010[0145:SASEOT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuariguata, Manuel R.10aSeed and seedling ecology of tree species in neotropical secondary forests: management implications  ap. 145-154.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn spite of the growing importance of neotropical secondary forests as sources of timber and environmental services, the baseline information needed to develop silvicultural options is still limited. In this paper I describe interspecific patterns of seed longevity in the soil, germination, and survival and growth of transplanted seedlings under closed canopy of nine tree species that are common in secondary forest stands in wet, lowland Costa Rica and most of which are timber species in the region: Cordia alliodora, Hampea appendiculata, Jacaranda copaia, Laetia procera, Rollinia microsepala, Simarouba amara, Stryphnodendron microstachyum, Trichospermum grewiifolium, and Vochysia ferruginea. Many of these species also occur throughout the lowland neotropics. Experiments were carried out in three replicate secondary‐forest stands (20–30 yr old after pasture abandonment) located at La Selva Biological Station in northeastern Costa Rica. Longevity of experimental seed cohorts differed markedly among species, from <3 mo (Cordia, Hampea, Simarouba, Vochysia), to >1 yr (Stryphnodendron). Similarly, germination of recently dispersed seeds in the understory ranged from 0% in Laetia to >75% in Cordia and Vochysia. In contrast, seedling survival was uniformly low (<10% survival one year after transplanting except for Stryphnodendron, which showed ∼20% survival). The implications of these findings for the management of secondary forest stands for timber production are varied and depend on the species of interest. First, all study species appear to require nearly complete canopy opening to regenerate as they show limited capacity either to germinate or to survive as seedlings in the understory. Second, some species that can germinate at high levels in the shade can be managed at the seedling stage by opening up the canopy a few months after germination (e.g., Cordia, Simarouba, Vochysia). Third, species that show little or no germination under closed canopy (e.g., Jacaranda, Laetia, Rollinia) will need canopy removal simply to germinate in adequate amounts. Due to rapid declines in seed viability and seedling survivorship, however, any canopy manipulation must be performed not beyond 6 mo in order to guarantee adequate levels of soil‐stored seeds or seedlings for future stand development. Site‐preparation techniques may need implementation, given the potential of competing vegetation to interfere with seedlings after canopy opening, as suggested by the high abundance of herbs and shrubs present in the soil seed bank in the study stands. This ecological scenario is likely to occur in secondary stands elsewhere in the region as secondary stands are usually located within agricultural land. Finally, the results of this study suggest that ecological classifications of trees solely based on light preferences for stem growth may fail to account for important differences among species in their regeneration mode. This is of particular importance for refining silvicultural guidelines in neotropical secondary forests.  aPublisher supplied data 3atropical forests 3aforest ecology 3aseedlings 3amortality 3aforest trees 3aforest management 3aCosta Rica0 tEcological applications.g2000 Feb., v. 10, no. 1 p.145-154dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2000)010%5B0145:SASEOT%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03230naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245007400176300001600250520171700266592002801983650002202011650001402033650001802047650001102065650001302076650001902089650001502108650001102123650002402134650001602158650001802174650001602192653003302208653002202241653001102263653001702274653001602291653002702307700002202334700003202356700002502388700003002413700002102443700002302464700002702487773010402514856008502618852000902703655001202712IND60543613720221120095740.0190411e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054361372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2014.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugustine, Starrlight10aMechanisms behind the metabolic flexibility of an invasive comb jelly  ap. 156-165.  aMnemiopsis leidyi is an invasive comb jelly which has successfully established itself in European seas. The species is known to produce spectacular blooms yet it is holoplanktonic and not much is known about its population dynamics in between. One way to gain insight on how M. leidyi might survive between blooms and how it can bloom so fast is to study how the metabolism of this species actually responds to environmental changes in food and temperature over its different life-stages. To this end we combined modelling and data analysis to study the energy budget of M. leidyi over its full life-cycle using Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory and literature data.An analysis of data obtained at temperatures ranging from 8 to 30°C suggests that the optimum thermal tolerance range of M. leidyi is higher than 12°C. Furthermore M. leidyi seems to undergo a so-called metabolic acceleration after hatching. Intriguingly, the onset of the acceleration appears to be delayed and the data do not yet exist which allows determining what actually triggers it. It is hypothesised that this delay confers a lot of metabolic flexibility by controlling generation time.We compared the DEB model parameters for this species with those of another holoplanktonic gelatinous zooplankton species (Pelagia noctiluca). After accounting for differences in water content, the comparison shows just how fundamentally different the two energy allocation strategies are. P. noctiluca has an extremely high reserve capacity, low turnover times of reserve compounds and high resistance to shrinking. M. leidyi adopts the opposite strategy: it has a low reserve capacity, high turnover rates of reserve compounds and fast shrinking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMnemiopsis leidyi 3aNoctiluca 3adata analysis 3aenergy 3ahatching 3aheat tolerance 3ametabolism 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3atemperature 3awater content 3azooplankton 0aDynamic Energy Budget Theory 0aMnemiopsis leidyi 0aGrowth 0aReproduction 0aDevelopment 0aMetabolic Acceleration1 aJaspers, Cornelia1 aKooijman, Sebastiaan A.L.M.1 aCarlotti, François,1 aPoggiale, Jean-Christophe1 aFreitas, Vânia,1 avan der Veer, Henk1 avan Walraven, Lodewijk0 tJournal of sea research.g2014 Nov., v. 94 p.156-165dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2014.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02197naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007400166300001800240520116700258592002801425650001201453650001901465650001201484650001001496650001801506650001101524700001501535700001501550700001601565700001801581700001601599700001901615773011101634856008101745852000901826655001201835IND60548231620221117191352.0160903e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054823162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-009-0028-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haifeng,10aInfluence of location-dependent protuberance damage on cell viability  ap. 1260-1266.  aThe influence of femtosecond laser-induced damages on viability of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) is investigated. Several cytokinetic processes including cellular damage, recovery and death are discussed. Using femtosecond laser with the power of 100 μW and cutting speed of 2 μm/s, we cut the cellular protuberance with smaller diameter twice in different locations, and then observe the viability of the damaged cells. Under the same conditions, the root of protuberance with larger diameter is cut six times to observe changes of cellular shape. Whether the damage is located in the end, middle or root of protuberance with smaller diameter, the cell viability can recover within 3 h. When the damage is located in the root of protuberance with larger diameter, the damaged cell will die in the way of oncosis. Cytokinetic phenomena including intracellular high Ca²⁺ concentration, cellular morphologic change, recovery and oncosis are discussed. Meanwhile, high Ca²⁺ concentration is observed after femtosecond laser surgery. Therefore, femtosecond laser surgery is an important tool for establishing cell damage model and studying cytokinetics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acell viability 3acutting 3adeath 3alaser surgery 3amodels1 aZhou, Ming1 aDi, JianKe1 aZhao, EnLan1 aYang, PeiFang1 aGong, AiHua1 aSun, Xianglan,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2009 Apr., v. 54, no. 7 p.1260-1266dSP Science in China Pressx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-009-0028-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008800165300001600253520150000269592002801769596010801797596006601905650001901971650003001990650002202020650005202042650002002094650001502114650001802129650001102147650002002158650001402178650001802192650001002210650001202220650001202232700001802244700002302262700002202285773012902307856008302436852000902519655001202528IND60634461520221117225630.0190817e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063446152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-018-01067-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasmi, Laila10aOutcome of mixed DNA virus infections on Spodoptera exigua susceptibility to SeMNPV  ap. 885-893.  aBaculovirus-based biopesticides have been developed for an efficient control of lepidopteran pests; however, very few studies have assessed the effect of other viral microorganisms that might coexist with the applied baculovirus pesticide. Systematic studies are needed to predict the effect of such microorganisms on the baculovirus efficacy following application in the field. In this context, we examined the effect of a sublethal doses of the DNA virus Junonia coenia densovirus (JcDV) on the infectivity of the Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) when infecting the same host, Spodoptera exigua. In our experimental conditions, the infection timing was critical for the mixed infection outcome. The consecutive infections with SeMNPV and later with JcDV did not affect the larval mortality or the measured infection parameters compared with single infection with the baculovirus. However, when larvae were first infected with JcDV, a clear antagonism was detected between both viruses and resulted in a patent reduction in viral pathogenicity and deleterious effects observed in the SeMNPV progeny. On the other hand, the simultaneous infection with both viruses led to an additive effect of the mortalities caused by the two viruses. Our results reveal that temporal order of the infection with one or the other virus affects the outcome of mixed viral infections on the targeted pest and may influence the ecology of baculovirus and its use as biological insecticide.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2014-57752-C2-02cSpanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness and European FEDER funds  aFPU16/02363cSpanish Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport 3aJunonia coenia 3aJunonia coenia densovirus 3aSpodoptera exigua 3aSpodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aadditive effect 3aantagonism 3abiopesticides 3alarvae 3amixed infection 3amortality 3apathogenicity 3apests 3aprogeny 3aviruses1 aFrattini, Ada1 aOgliastro, Mylène1 aHerrero, Salvador0 tJournal of pest science.g2019 Mar., v. 92, no. 2 p.885-893dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870064x1612-47587nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-018-01067-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02651naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003000141245003500171300001600206520123100222592002801453650001301481650001401494650001001508650001101518650001401529650001501543650001101558650001401569650001401583650001101597650001401608650001601622650001501638650001401653650001001667650001401677650002101691650001601712653001701728653002301745653001101768653001801779653001801797653001501815653001301830653002001843700001701863773014401880856007602024852000902100655001202109IND60765865020221118001654.0220203e20211130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076586502DNAL7 a10.3372/wi.51.513042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avon Raab-Straube, Eckhard10aEuro+Med-Checklist Notulae, 14  ap. 355-369.  aThis is the fourteenth of a series of miscellaneous contributions, by various authors, where hitherto unpublished data relevant to both the Med-Checklist and the Euro+Med (or Sisyphus) projects are presented.

Throughout the 19-years-long monitoring period, a total of 5135 Rhinolophus hipposideros were counted in maternity roost, with a mean of 273 (SD = 198.1) per year (mean Piedmont = 73, SD = 85.9; mean Liguria = 200, SD = 164.6). The population analysis model shows a significant overall gradient of 1.047, which corresponds to an average annual increase of 4.7 % over the period considered. The analysis suggests that in the study area, the reproductive population of Rhinolophus hipposideros monitored in the maternity roost has increased throughout the period from 2000-2018, with large increases after 2010 and different trends occurring in the two regions considered, including a significant moderate increase in Liguria and a stable trend in Piedmont. The results agreed with the recently observed trends in other European countries for this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhinolophus 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apiedmont 3aItaly 0aChiroptera 0aRhinolophus hipposideros 0apopulation trend 0aTRIM1 aCalvini, Mara0 tFolia zoologica.g2019 July 3, v. 68, no. 2 p.95-99dInstitute of Vertebrate Biology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech RepublicwJournal:14572x0139-78937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.25225/fozo.006.20193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100001800189245015400207300001600361500001900377506007600396520110400472592002801576596006401604506003701668650002101705650001801726650001701744650002401761650000901785650002401794650001301818650002601831650001801857700001801875700001501893700001701908700001601925700005601941773012801997856008302125852000902208655001202217IND60688161220221207062134.0200724e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068816122DNAL7 aPMC71421732pmcid7 a322965582pmid7 a10.1007/s10068-019-00676-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, YongJun10aEffects of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine on moisture content and oxidative stability in soybean oil–water system at different interfaces  ap. 479-486.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEffects of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) on the oxidative stability were determined in soybean oil–water system at different locations including at the interface of air–oil, in the middle of oil, and at the interface of oil–water. Also, profile changes of tocopherols were determined during UV irradiation for 18 days. Although no significant changes in tocopherol profiles were observed at three different locations irrespective of DOPC from 0 to 1250 μmol/kg oil, addition of DOPC increased total tocopherols, α-tocopherol, and δ-tocopherol whereas content of β + γ tocopherols did not increase at any locations. Moisture content in water–oil interface was higher than other locations while those were not consistent at different DOPC concentration. Added DOPC significantly decreased oxidative stability from 250 to 830 μmol/kg oil compared to controls (p < 0.05) whereas 1250 μmol/kg oil DOPC increased oxidative stability. Stabilities of tocopherols especially α-tocopherol were lower in oil–water system than those in bulk oil at UV irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2017R1A2B4002613cNational Research Foundation of Korea0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalpha-tocopherol 3abiotechnology 3afood science 3aoil-water interface 3aoils 3aoxidative stability 3asoybeans 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater content1 aJo, Seungbeen1 aNa, HeeSun1 aKim, SungHwa1 aKim, Mi Ja,1 aLee, JaeHwan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0118-62330 tFood science and biotechnology.g2020 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.479-486dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000073x1226-77087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-019-00676-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010600165300001600271520163300287536030601920592002802226596001702254596001502271650003602286650001602322650000902338650001702347650001602364650002302380650001602403650001102419650003102430650001502461650002002476650001902496650001202515650002202527650002402549650002902573650002602602653001802628653002002646653002002666653002002686653004002706700001502746700001902761700001902780700001702799773011502816856008602931852000903017655001203026IND60753560820221119160325.0211016e20211002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075356082DNAL7 a10.1080/08905436.2021.19813692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Yang10aTranscriptional analysis of the response of nectarine fruit to low-temperature stress in cold storage  ap. 349-373.  aNectarine (Prunus persica var. nectarina) is a sub-tropical fruit tree with strong cold sensitivity. In this study, flesh of nectarine (Shuguang) was used to determine the difference in transcriptional data before and after chilling injury under storage. In addition, genes responses involved in nectarine acclimation to cold stress were also explored. Results of the current study showed that nectarine was found to be more susceptible to chilling injury during storage at 5°C than at 0°C, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were concentrated in the late stage of low-temperature storage where chilling injury symptoms appeared at the end of the experiment. The key genes related to low-temperature response were associated with post-harvest biological processes. DEGs were annotated on the metabolic pathways of cold regulation signal transduction, cold resistance physiological metabolism and cold resistance-related protein synthesis. Moreover, the expression of genes related to cold stress such as plant hormone signal transduction element such as Auxin-responsive protein, transcription factors responding to cold stress such as WRKY transcription factor and genes related to maintaining membrane stability and regulating physiological metabolism such as proline dehydrogenase was more pronounced when nectarine was stored at 5°C than at 0°C. Overall, these findings showed that alteration in chilling temperature has substantial impact on the transcription levels associated with cold resistance pathway during the low-temperature storage of nectarine and thus promotes chilling injury disorders in nectarine.  aThis work was supported by the Comprehensive Demonstration, Promotion and Application of Fruit and Vegetable Product Logistics Technology and Equipment Integration [2012BAD38B09]; Research and Development and Application of Fruit and Vegetable Product Logistics and Processing Technology [ZDPY201705].  aPublisher supplied data  a2012BAD38B09  aZDPY201705 3aPrunus persica var. nucipersica 3aacclimation 3acold 3acold storage 3acold stress 3afood biotechnology 3afruit trees 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3anectarines 3aoxidoreductases 3aplant hormones 3aproline 3aprotein synthesis 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aFruit storage 0achilling injury 0atranscriptomics 0acold resistance 0adifferential expressed genes (DEGs)1 aJiao, Xuan1 aGao, Zhen-feng1 aFeng, Zhi-hong1 aHao, Li-Ping0 tFood biotechnology.g2021 Oct. 02, v. 35, no. 4 p.349-373dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl46326x1532-42497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08905436.2021.19813693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006300164300001300227520139100240592002801631650002301659650002201682650001201704650001301716650002801729650001501757650000901772650001801781650002101799700001701820700001601837700001701853700001501870700001301885773011101898856008102009852000902090655001202099IND60548231720221117191424.0160903e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054823172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11434-009-0002-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, NingNing10aRelaxor behavior of (1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-xPbTiO3 ceramics  ap. 1267.  aIn the present work, the phase transitions and relaxor behavior of (1-x)Pb(Mg₁/₃Nb₂/₃)O₃-xPbTiO₃ (PMN-PT, x = 0.2–0.4) ferroelectric ceramics have been investigated by means of X-ray diffraction, dielectric spectroscopy, the P-E hysteresis loop measurements and Raman scattering techniques. Structural analysis revealed that with the increase of PbTiO₃ content, PMN-PT ceramics experienced a gradual phase transition process from rhombohedral to tetragonal. It is usually believed that such kinds of phase transitions resulted in the linear decrease of relaxation degree. Surprisingly, our analysis of the dielectric spectra revealed that the indicator of the degree of diffuseness y reached the maximum value near morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) (x = 0.32), then decreased with the further increase of PbTiO₃ content. The large dielectric relaxor feature near MPB may be attributed to the formation of ordered nanodomains, resulting from complex coexisting nanostructures. Further, the P-E hysteresis loop measurements and Raman analysis of the B-site cation order correlated well with the dielectric measurement results. It was found that the hysteresis loop squareness R ₛq received the minimum value while the inverse of the value of full wide of half maximum (FWHM) of A₁g mode reached the maximum value at MPB composition, which showed similar trends to y.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acations 3aceramics 3adielectric spectroscopy 3ahysteresis 3alead 3ananomaterials 3aphase transition1 aSong, XueMei1 aHou, YuDong1 aZhu, ManKang1 aWang, Chao1 aYan, Hui0 tChinese science bulletin.g2009 Apr., v. 54, no. 7 p.1267-1267dSP Science in China Pressx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-009-0002-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002500143245012700168520155100295592002801846650002201874650001501896650001101911650002501922650001501947650001301962650001501975650002401990650002002014650002602034650001802060650002002078650001402098650002002112650002802132650002202160650004302182650005202225650002602277650002002303650002902323650001902352650002902371650002202400700002502422700003202447773011902479856007802598852000902676655001202685IND60703659120221120132432.0200721e20191225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070365912DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90100362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAroonluk, Suvichark 10aIdentification and Characterization of Phosphoproteins in Somatic Embryogenesis Acquisition during Oil Palm Tissue Culture  aSomatic embryogenesis during oil palm tissue culture is a long process. The identification of the proteins that control this process may help to shorten the time of oil palm tissue culture. We collected embryogenic callus and somatic embryos at the globular, torpedo, and cotyledon maturation stages, as well as from plantlets, for total protein extraction. An enrichment column was used to enrich the phosphoproteins, which were subjected to tryptic enzyme digestion. Each sample was analyzed with nano-liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (nano LC-MS/MS). A total of 460 phosphoproteins were identified and analyzed. The functional characterization of phosphoproteins were observed as highest in the metabolic process, protein/nucleotide/ion binding, and membrane component. The different phosphoproteins are involved in the control of vegetative growth, cellular differentiation, cell morphogenesis, and signaling roles in plants. The Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription-PCR technique (qPCR) was successfully used to verify the expression of genes, and the results were consistent with the level of protein expression from nano-LC-MS/MS. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase and sister chromatid cohesion PDS5 were specifically expressed only in the somatic embryo and plantlet, and these could be used as protein biomarkers to determine the oil palm somatic embryo maturation stage. This study sheds light on the protein phosphorylation mechanism that regulates somatic embryogenesis transition during oil palm tissue culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeis guineensis 3abiomarkers 3acallus 3acell differentiation 3achromatids 3acohesion 3acotyledons 3aenzymatic reactions 3agene expression 3aliquid chromatography 3amorphogenesis 3aphosphoproteins 3aplantlets 3aprotein content 3aprotein phosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissue culture 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3avegetative growth1 aRoytrakul, Sittiruk 1 aJantasuriyarat, Chatchawan 0 tPlants.g2019 Dec. 25, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90100363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002900169245010400198300001800302520121100320592002801531650001401559650001501573650002701588650001701615650001901632650001001651650001501661650002101676650001501697650001501712650002401727650001101751650000901762650003501771650002001806650003101826650003201857700002101889700002401910700002001934700001901954773009201973856008402065852000902149655001202158IND60088304320221118032222.0141102e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008830432DNAL7 a223423132pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2012.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Coustumer, Sébastien14aThe influence of design parameters on clogging of stormwater biofilters: A large-scale column study  ap. 6743-6752.  aA large-scale laboratory study was conducted to test the influence of design and operating conditions on the lifespan of stormwater biofilters. The evolution of hydraulic conductivity over time was studied in relation to a number of key design parameters (media type, filter depth, vegetation type, system sizing, etc). The biofilters were observed to clog over time, with average hydraulic conductivity decreasing by a factor of 3.6 over the 72 weeks of testing. The choice of plant species appears to have a significant effect on the rate of decrease in permeability, with plants with thick roots (e.g. Melaleuca) demonstrating an ability to maintain permeability over time. Other species studied, with finer roots, had no such beneficial effects. As expected, small systems relative to their catchment (and thus which are subjected to high loading rates) are more prone to clogging, as increases in hydraulic and sediment loading can lead to extremely low hydraulic conductivities. Sizing and the appropriate choice of vegetation are thus key elements in design because they can limit clogging, and therefore, indirectly increase annual load treated by limiting the volume of water bypassing the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelaleuca 3abiofilters 3ahydraulic conductivity 3apermeability 3apollution load 3aroots 3astormwater 3avegetation types 3awatersheds 2aBiofouling 2aFiltrationxmethods 2aPlants 2aRain 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutants, Chemical 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aFletcher, Tim D.1 aDeletic, A.q(Ana),1 aBarraud, Sylvie1 aPoelsma, Peter0 tWater research.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 46, no. 20 p.6743-6752dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2012.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003600135040001800171100006400189245010600253300001600359500001900375506007600394520110900470592002801579596005301607596006901660596006701729506003701796650001801833650001801851650001801869650001601887650001601903650001701919650001801936650001701954650002801971650001201999650002902011650001802040650001802058650001902076650002902095650001002124650002802134650002002162650001202182650001502194700001702209700001602226700002202242700001702264700001602281773012802297856008302425852000902508655001202517IND60688161320221207062112.0200724e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068816132DNAL7 aPMC71421822pmcid7 a322965672pmid7 a10.1007/s10068-019-00684-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunejo, Shahid Ahmed1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6552-662610aSuperfine wheat bran improves the hyperglycemic and hyperlipidemic properties in a high-fat rat model  ap. 559-567.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWheat bran (WB) is an abundant source of fiber, promoting the health for constipation, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastrointestinal disorders. However, the role of superfine-WB in improving the obesity, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia needs to be revealed. The superfine-WB (low and high treatments) was studied on body-weight, blood sugar, serum, and liver lipids in a high-fat rat model for 5-weeks. The high-fat diet substantially increased body-weight, sugar levels, lipids, and malondialdehyde in serum and liver. In contrast, the superfine-WB treatments reduced food and energy intake, postprandial glucose, body-weight, blood and liver cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde, low-density lipoprotein, and increased the level of high-density lipoprotein. Additionally, when the two different concentrations were compared, the maximum impact was exhibited by the superfine-WB containing high concentration. These results suggest that the superfine-WB significantly improves the hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and possibly also protecting against other acute, recurrent, or chronic diseases.  aPublisher supplied data  a(No.11008761)cAnhui Natural Sciences Foundation  a(No.1704a07020098)cAnhui Sciences and Technology Plant Project.  a(No.Ilj20170144)cAnhui Sciences and Technology Plant Project.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3abiotechnology 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3aconstipation 3aenergy intake 3afood science 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperglycemia 3ahyperlipidemia 3airritable bowel syndrome 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3amalondialdehyde 3aobesity 3awheat bran1 aGeng, Huihui1 aLi, Songnan1 aKaka, Ajeet Kumar1 aRashid, Alam1 aZhou, Yibin0 tFood science and biotechnology.g2020 Apr., v. 29, no. 4 p.559-567dSpringer SingaporewJournal:J000000073x1226-77087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-019-00684-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010400163300001400267520155900281592002801840650001501868650001901883650001401902650000901916650002201925650002101947650002501968650002501993650001002018650001502028650001302043650001902056650002002075650001202095653000802107653001302115653003702128653002502165653001402190700002002204700001902224700001902243700001802262773010302280856008202383852000902465655001202474IND60479727420221118074609.0160123e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047972742DNAL7 a10.1556/AVet.59.2011.1.82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJakab, Csaba10aExpression of claudin-5 in canine pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma — An immunohistochemical study  ap. 87-98.  aClaudin-5 is an endothelium-specific tight junction protein. The aim of the present study was to detect the expression pattern of this molecule in intact pancreatic tissues and in well-differentiated and poorly differentiated pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas from dogs by the use of cross-reactive humanised anticlaudin-5 antibody. The necropsy samples taken from dogs included 10 nonneoplastic pancreatic tissues, 10 well-differentiated pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas, 10 poorly differentiated pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas, 5 intrahepatic metastases of well-differentiated and 5 intrahepatic metastases of poorly differentiated acinar cell carcinomas. A strong lateral membrane claudin-5 positivity was detected in exocrine cells in all intact pancreas samples. The endocrine cells of the islets of Langerhans and the epithelial cells of the ducts were negative for claudin-5. The endothelial cells of vessels and lymphatic channels in the stroma of the intact pancreas showed strong membrane positivity for this claudin. All well-differentiated exocrine pancreas carcinomas and all poorly-differentiated pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma samples showed a diffuse loss of claudin-5 expression. The claudin-5-positive peritumoural vessels and lymphatic channels facilitated the detection of vascular invasion of the claudin-5-negative cancer cells. In liver metastasis samples, the pancreatic carcinomas were negative for claudin-5. It seems that the loss of expression of claudin-5 may lead to carcinogenesis in canine exocrine pancreatic cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3adogs 3aendothelial cells 3aepithelial cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aislets of Langerhans 3aliver 3ametastasis 3anecropsy 3aneoplasm cells 3atight junctions 3atissues 0aDog 0apancreas 0apancreatic acinar cell carcinoma 0aimmunohistochemistry 0aclaudin-51 aRusvai, Miklós1 aGálfi, Péter1 aHalász, Judit1 aKulka, Janina0 tActa veterinaria Hungarica.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 59, no. 1 p.87-98dAkadémiai Kiadóx0236-62907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAVet.59.2011.1.83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245006300173300001600236520120100252592002801453650001701481650001001498650002001508650002601528650001301554650001101567650001201578650001101590700002001601700001601621700002101637773010801658856005501766852000901821655001201830IND50066430820221123014200.0130515e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006643082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1600-048X.2012.05868.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarell, Patrik10aBrown tawny owls moult more flight feathers than grey ones  ap. 235-244.  aThe mechanisms by which melanin‐based colour polymorphism can evolve and be maintained in wild populations are poorly known. Theory predicts that colour morphs have differential sensitivity to environmental conditions. Recently it has been proposed that colour polymorphism covaries genetically with intrinsic and behavioural properties. Plumage moult is a costly and crucial somatic maintenance function in birds. We used a long‐term data set consisting of 761 observations on 307 individuals captured between 1985 and 2010 to examine differences in partial flight feather moult between grey (pale) and brown (pheomelanic dark) colour morphs of the tawny owl. We find that the brown morph consistently moult more primary flight feathers than the grey morph whereas there is no clear difference between colour morphs in the moulting of secondary feathers. Contrary to expectations, the difference in the number of moulted flight feathers between the morphs was independent of environmental conditions, as quantified by the abundance of prey. We discuss the potential physiological and behavioural causes for and costs of the observed difference in maintenance functions between colour morphs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStrigiformes 3acolor 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3afeathers 3aflight 3amolting 3amorphs1 aBrommer, Jon E.1 aAhola, Kari1 aKarstinen, Teuvo0 tJournal of avian biology.g2013 June, v. 44, no. 3 p.235-244dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-048X.2012.05868.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001300149245020500162300001400367520110600381592002801487650002201515650001401537650001001551650003101561650002001592650003501612650001701647650001101664650000901675650001801684650001401702650001101716650001601727650001601743650001801759650000901777650001101786650000901797653001401806653001601820653003101836773009101867856008301958852000902041655001202050IND60481362620221118032942.0160204e20140607xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048136262DNAL7 a10.1515/helia.2009.32.51.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlba, V.10aPOLLEN FLOW ANALYSIS IN SUNFLOWER (Helianthus annuus L.) / ANÁLISIS DEL FLUJO POLÍNICO EN GIRASOL (Helianthus annuus L.) / ANALYSE DE LA DISPERSION DU POLLEN CHEZ LE TOURNESOL (Helianthus annuus L.)  ap. 11-18.  aBiofuels from wood, wastes and various agricultural crops are currently quite expensive. Seed oil plants, instead, represent a relevant renewable natural resource for biodiesel to be used as engine fuel. In consequence, new genetic modified varieties (GMV) have been obtained by biotechnological methods, which offer a wide range of special oils for bio-energetic purposes. However, growing sunflower GMVs for biodiesel production could create a potential risk due to pollen flow from transgenic to non-transgenic varieties when grown in the same geographic areas. Presently, pollen flow analysis by DNA-based tools is expensive and time consuming, and new, cheap and rapid methods are needed. The goal of this research was to estimate pollen flow in sunflower by using a “composite” line, with a monogenic dominant marker (TT) for a high phenotypic expression of blue leaf nervure, as pollinator, and an inbred line and a cytoplasmic male sterile line (cms) as recipient plants. The obtained results suggest that cytoplasmic male sterility could be used for the analysis of sunflower pollen flow.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3abiodiesel 3acrops 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3afuel production 3agenetically modified organisms 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3aoils 3aoilseed crops 3aphenotype 3apollen 3apollen flow 3apollinators 3arapid methods 3arisk 3awastes 3awood 0asunflower 0apollen flow 0acytoplasmic male sterility0 tHelia.g2014 June 7, v. 32, no. 51 p.11-18dDe GruyterwJournal:23082x2197-04837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/helia.2009.32.51.113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03350naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245010600193300001800299520168400317592002802001650001302029650001902042650001402061650001202075650001002087650001902097650001202116650001602128650001402144650001302158650001802171650000902189650001802198650001502216650001702231650001502248650005002263650003402313650002402347650002402371650002902395650003402424650002002458650002302478650001302501651001402514651001402528700002502542700002002567773009202587856008402679852000902763655001202772IND60088304420221118032313.0141102e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008830442DNAL7 a222652532pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2011.12.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeFevre, Gregory H.14aThe role of biodegradation in limiting the accumulation of petroleum hydrocarbons in raingarden soils  ap. 6753-6762.  aPrevious studies have indicated that raingardens are effective at removing petroleum hydrocarbons from stormwater. There are concerns, however, that petroleum hydrocarbons could accumulate in raingarden soil, potentially resulting in liability for the site owner. In this work, 75 soil samples were collected from 58 raingardens and 4 upland (i.e., control) sites in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, representing a range of raingarden ages and catchment land uses. Total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations in the samples were quantified, as were 16S rRNA genes for Bacteria and two functional genes that encode for enzymes used in the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. TPH levels in all of the raingarden soil samples were low (<3 μg/kg) and not significantly different from one another. The TPH concentration in raingarden soil samples was, however, significantly greater (p ≤ 0.002) than TPH levels in upland sites. In addition, the number of copies of Bacteria 16S rRNA genes and functional genes were greater in the raingardens planted with deeply-rooted natives and cultivars than in raingardens containing simply turf grass or mulch (p < 0.036), suggesting that planted raingardens may be better able to assimilate TPH inputs. The ability of microorganisms present in the soil samples to degrade a representative petroleum hydrocarbon (naphthalene) was also investigated in batch experiments. A sub-set of the field sites was selected for re-sampling, and all soil samples tested (n = 8) were able to mineralize naphthalene. In these experiments the initial mineralization rate correlated with the number of copies of Bacteria 16S rRNA genes present.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3acultivars 3aenzymes 3agenes 3amineralization 3amulches 3anaphthalene 3apetroleum 3aplanting 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3astormwater 3aturf grasses 3awatersheds 2aBacteriaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aFiltrationxmethods 2aPetroleumxanalysis 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSoilxchemistry 2aWater Microbiology 2aWetlands 3aMinnesota 0aMinnesota1 aHozalski, Raymond M.1 aNovak, Paige J.0 tWater research.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 46, no. 20 p.6753-6762dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2011.12.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03569naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006200141245016100203300001600364520194800380592002802328650001602356650001602372650001402388650001402402650001202416651002002428653002302448653002402471653003202495653003602527653001302563653001402576653002402590653003702614653003402651653003402685653002102719653002502740700005902765700005802824773014402882856007603026852000903102655001203111IND60765865320221118001615.0220203e20211223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076586532DNAL7 a10.3372/wi.51.513072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalimov, Rashad A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8363-466310aOverall phylogenetic relationships of Scutellaria (Lamiaceae) shed light on the origin of the predominantly Caucasian and Irano-Turanian S. orientalis group  ap. 395-427.  aScutellaria is one of the largest genera in the Lamiaceae with an estimated 400–500 species with a nearly worldwide distribution. Most species occur in the N hemisphere, with the Caucasus and the wider Irano-Turanian region housing a large number of taxa, many of them considered endemic. We present an overall phylogeny of the monophyletic genus Scutellaria based on rapidly evolving plastid regions (matK-trnK, rpl16, trnL-F). Three well-supported clades are evident, which render the currently accepted S. subg. Scutellaria paraphyletic to S. subg. Apeltanthus, which appears nested in “clade A”, in which the African S. schweinfurthii is sister to all remaining taxa, followed by other lineages of S. subg. Scutellaria. Ancestral states of 12 morphological characters frequently used as diagnostic from subgenus to species level were reconstructed with BayesTraits. The S. orientalis group appears as a major radiation in the Caucasus area and the Irano-Turanian region that may comprise up to a quarter of the species in the genus. This radiation corresponds to a monophyletically defined S. sect. Lupulinaria, characterized by decussate inflorescences and specialized (e.g. cucullate) bracts. Our phylogenetic data present significant resolution at the species level within the S. orientalis group, indicating complex geographically centred patterns of speciation in adaptation to steppe and high mountain habitats, including multiple evolution of pinnate and tomentose leaves. The detailed infrageneric classification of Juzepczuk (1951, 1954) mostly does not reflect natural groups. Citation: Salimov R.

(2012) Biochemistry51, 4541–4550]. An equilibrium model may semiquantitatively account for the results of this study; in the model, FtsZ self-associates in a noncooperative fashion to form linear fibrils, that upon increasing to a certain size exhibit an increasing tendency to form closed cyclic fibrils, as previously suggested [González, J.

The closed cyclic fibrils are formed when the natural curvature and flexibility of a linear oligomer bring the ends of a linear fiber sufficiently close to overcome the entropic barrier to loop closure. The size distribution of cyclic oligomers is thus a reflection of the tendency toward curvature of linear fibrils of FtsZ under the conditions used in these experiments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aguanosine triphosphate 3amodels 3apH 3apotassium1 aRivas, Germán,1 aMinton, Allen P.0 tBiochemistry.g2012 Aug. 07, v. 51, no. 31 p.6108-6113dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbi300891q3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03010naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245011500203500002000318520173400338592002802072596006802100596005302168596007102221596009702292650001902389650001302408650002202421650001302443650001002456773013202466856007702598852000902675655001202684IND60788155120221119232636.0220811e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078815512DNAL7 a10.1029/2020WR0279862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyman, Jeffrey D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4224-284710aFlow Channeling in Fracture Networks: Characterizing the Effect of Density on Preferential Flow Path Formation  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFlow channelization is a commonly observed phenomenon in fractured subsurface media where the flow of fluids is restricted primarily to highly transmissive fracture networks surrounded by a low‐permeability rock matrix. The multiscale structural heterogeneity of these networks results in multiscale flow channelization where preferential flow paths form at length scales ranging from the entire system down to the subfracture size. We present an analysis of how one of the largest scales in fractured media, the network density, influences the degree of flow channeling that occurs using an ensemble of semigeneric three‐dimensional discrete fracture network (DFN) simulations. We construct 10 DFNs, whose fracture lengths follow a power law distribution, at four densities for a total of 40 networks. We characterize their structure in terms of the network topology and geometry. Eulerian and Lagrangian observations of the steady‐state flow fields obtained within the networks are used to quantify the degree of flow channelization at the network scale. We introduce a measure for the importance‐ranking/hierarchy of different flow paths in the network using graph‐based analysis of Lagrangian transport by which the degree of flow channeling between networks is compared. These flow observations are then linked to the structural properties of the networks. In general, network‐scale flow channeling decreases as the network density increases. However, at low densities, there is more uniform flow within the entire connected network than in high‐density networks. We also demonstrate how standard transport observables can be used to infer the degree of flow channelization occurring within a fracture network.  aPublisher supplied data  a20180621ECRcDOE | LDRD | Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)  aLANLE3W1cDOE | SC | Basic Energy Sciences (BES)  cU.S. Department of Energy (D.O.E.)

The receiving antennas can determine the depth and orientation of targets beside the borehole. However, the problem of target orientation determination and 3D imaging algorithms remains a technological challenge. The MUSIC (multiple signal classification) algorithm requires a peak search, so the accuracy of the operation is limited by the angle interval. Based on the MUSIC algorithm, the Root-MUSIC algorithm is proposed and implemented. By replacing the spectral peak search with calculating the roots of the polynomials greatly improves the orientation recognition accuracy. Finally, the results obtained using the above algorithm are verified with synthetic data and compared with the results of the MUSIC algorithm. The results show that both the MUSIC algorithm and the Root-MUSIC algorithm can achieve very good orientation determination and 3D imaging results. In terms of accuracy, the Root-MUSIC algorithm has an obvious improvement compared with the MUSIC algorithm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aantennae 3adigital images 3aexhibitions 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3arooting 3aroots1 aLiu, Sixin 1 aShen, Xuzhang 1 aZheng, Wenjun 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 July 27, v. 13, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131529573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05049naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005800188245018100246300001200427506007600439520289900515592002803414596005903442506003703501650002003538650000903558650001503567650002203582650001303604650001203617650002203629650001403651650002503665650001003690650001103700650001203711650001403723650002203737650001903759650001503778700001503793700001803808700002203826700001703848700002203865700002003887700002203907700002503929700002903954700002703983700001904010700002904029700001904058700002404077710004704101773016104148856008104309852000904390655001204399IND60675311620221207144616.0200721e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067531162DNAL7 a316850282pmid7 aPMC68299122pmcid7 a10.1186/s12966-019-0864-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLatomme, Julie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3061-642310aDo physical activity and screen time mediate the association between European fathers’ and their children’s weight status? Cross-sectional data from the Feel4Diabetes-study  ap. 100.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Most research on parenting and childhood obesity and obesity-related behaviours has focused on mothers while fathers have been underrepresented. Yet, recent literature has suggested that fathers uniquely influence their children’s lifestyle behaviours, and hence could also affect their weight status, but this has not yet been scientifically proven. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether the association between fathers’ weight status and their children’s weight status is mediated by fathers’ and children’s movement behaviours (i.e. physical activity (PA) and screen time (ST)). METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 899 European fathers and their children were analyzed. Fathers/male caregivers (mean age = 43.79 ± 5.92 years, mean BMI = 27.08 ± 3.95) completed a questionnaire assessing their own and their children’s (mean age = 8.19 ± 0.99 years, 50.90% boys, mean BMIzₛcₒᵣₑ = 0.44 ± 1.07) movement behaviours. Body Mass Index (BMI, in kg/m²) was calculated based on self-reported (fathers) and objectively measured (children) height and weight. For children, BMI z-scores (SD scores) were calculated to obtain an optimal measure for their weight status. Serial mediation analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 25.0 Statistics for Windows to test whether the association between fathers’ BMI and children’s BMI is mediated by fathers’ PA and children’s PA (model 1) and fathers’ ST and children’s ST (model 2), respectively. RESULTS: The present study showed a (partial) mediation effect of fathers’ PA and children’s PA (but not father’s ST and children’s ST) on the association between fathers’ BMI and children’s BMI (model for PA; coefficient: 0.001, 95% CI: [0.0001, 0.002]; model for ST; coefficient: 0.001, 95% CI: [0.000, 0.002]). Furthermore, fathers’ movement behaviours (PA and ST) were positively associated with their children’s movement behaviours (PA and ST) (model for PA, coefficient: 0.281, SE: 0.023, p < 0.001; model for ST, coefficient: 0.345, SE: 0.025, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the influence of fathers on their children’s weight status partially occurs through the association between fathers’ PA and children’s PA (but not their ST). As such, intervening by focusing on PA of fathers but preferably of both members of the father-child dyad (e.g. engaging fathers and their children in co-PA) might be a novel and potentially effective strategy for interventions aiming to prevent childhood overweight and obesity. Longitudinal studies or intervention studies confirming these findings are however warranted to make meaningful recommendations for health intervention and policy.

The aim of the study was to develop a duplex real-time PCR assay for rapid identification of Staph. aureus isolates, targeting both nuc and Sa442. Overall, 140 isolates collected from dairy cow mastitis in 90 different herds, were tested. All strains had been identified using morphological and biochemical characteristics. DNA from each strain was amplified in real-time PCR assay, to detect nuc or Sa442. Thereafter, a duplex real-time PCR assay was performed, and specificity of the amplified products was assessed by high resolution melting curve analysis. Out of 124 Staph. aureus isolates, 33 did not show the typical morphology or enzymic activity; in 118 strains, the two melt-curve peaks consistent with nuc and Sa442 were revealed, while 2 isolates showed only the peak consistent with Sa442. Four isolates bacteriologically identified as Staph. aureus, were PCR-negative and were further identified as Staph. pseudintermedius by sequencing. Staph. pseudintermedius and coagulase-negative staphylococci did not carry nuc or Sa442. The results showed the correct identification of all isolates, comprehending also coagulase—or nuc-negative Staph. aureus, while other coagulase-positive Staphylococci were correctly identified as non-Staph. aureus. Both sensitivity and specificity were 100%. High resolution melting analysis allowed easy detection of unspecific products. Finally, the duplex real-time PCR was applied directly to 40 milk samples, to detect infected mammary quarters. The assay confirmed the results of bacteriological analysis, on Staph. aureus-positive or—negative samples. Therefore, the proposed duplex real-time PCR could be used in laboratory routine as a cost-effective and powerful tool for high-throughput identification of atypical Staph. aureus isolates causing dairy cow mastitis. Also, it could be applied directly to milk samples, to detect Staph. aureus mammary infections avoiding bacteriological analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3acoagulase positive staphylococci 3acost effectiveness 3adairy cows 3aenzyme activity 3aherds 3amastitis 3amelting 3amilk 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0amastitis 0aduplex real-time PCR 0adairy cow1 aSnel, Gustavo G M1 aMalvisi, Michela1 aPiccinini, Renata0 tJournal of dairy research.g2013 May, v. 80, no. 2 p.223-226dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45499x1469-76297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00220299130000223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03698naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011100168300001600279520206400295592002802359650002202387650001302409650001102422650001902433650001102452650001802463650001402481650002002495650002602515650002102541650001602562650001302578650001102591650001302602650002502615650001502640650001402655650000902669650001702678650001202695650002102707650001802728650001602746651001602762653000802778653000702786653001202793653001702805653002602822653001602848700001602864700001602880773010502896856008603001852000903087655001203096IND60589451620221119005002.0200427e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058945162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.11.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, S.R.10aApplying linear discriminant analysis to predict groundwater redox conditions conducive to denitrification  ap. 611-624.  aDiffuse nitrate losses from agricultural land pollute groundwater resources worldwide, but can be attenuated under reducing subsurface conditions. In New Zealand, the ability to predict where groundwater denitrification occurs is important for understanding the linkage between land use and discharges of nitrate-bearing groundwater to streams. This study assesses the application of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for predicting groundwater redox status for Southland, a major dairy farming region in New Zealand. Data cases were developed by assigning a redox status to samples derived from a regional groundwater quality database. Pre-existing regional-scale geospatial databases were used as training variables for the discriminant functions. The predictive accuracy of the discriminant functions was slightly improved by optimising the thresholds between sample depth classes. The models predict 23% of the region as being reducing at shallow depths (<15 m), and 37% at medium depths (15–75 m). Predictions were made at a sub-regional level to determine whether improvements could be made with discriminant functions trained by local data. The results indicated that any gains in predictive success were offset by loss of confidence in the predictions due to the reduction in the number of samples used.The regional scale model predictions indicate that subsurface reducing conditions predominate at low elevations on the coastal plains where poorly drained soils are widespread. Additional indicators for subsurface denitrification are a high carbon content of the soil, a shallow water table, and low-permeability clastic sediments. The coastal plains are an area of widespread groundwater discharge, and the soil and hydrology characteristics require the land to be artificially drained to render the land suitable for farming. For the improvement of water quality in coastal areas, it is therefore important that land and water management efforts focus on understanding hydrological bypassing that may occur via artificial drainage systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aaltitude 3acarbon 3acoastal plains 3acoasts 3adairy farming 3adatabases 3adenitrification 3adiscriminant analysis 3adrainage systems 3agroundwater 3aland use 3amodels 3anitrates 3apoorly drained soils 3aprediction 3asediments 3asoil 3aspatial data 3astreams 3awater management 3awater quality 3awater table 3aNew Zealand 0aLDA 0aDO 0aNitrate 0aRedox status 0aStatistical modelling 0aNew Zealand1 aClose, M.E.1 aAbraham, P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Jan., v. 556 p.611-624dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.11.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03579naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245008700199300001400286500001900300500002000319520230100339592002802640596003602668650001202704650001702716650001402733650003002747650002402777650001602801650001402817650001902831650002202850700006202872700005702934773012002991856007303111852000903184655001203193IND60682151620221119112943.0200127e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068215162DNAL7 a10.1111/jbi.136232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeigelt, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2485-370810aGIFT – A Global Inventory of Floras and Traits for macroecology and biogeography  ap. 16-43.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: To understand how functional traits and evolutionary history shape the geographic distribution of plant life on Earth, we need to integrate high‐quality and global‐scale distribution data with functional and phylogenetic information. Large‐scale distribution data for plants are, however, often restricted to either certain taxonomic groups or geographic regions. Range maps only exist for a small subset of all plant species and digitally available point‐occurrence information is biased both geographically and taxonomically. Floras and checklists represent an alternative, yet rarely used potential source of information. They contain highly curated information about the species composition of a clearly defined area, and together virtually cover the entire global land surface. Here, we report on our recent efforts to mobilize this information for macroecological and biogeographical analyses in the GIFT database, the Global Inventory of Floras and Traits. LOCATION: Global. TAXON: Land plants (Embryophyta). METHODS: GIFT integrates plant distributions from regional Floras and checklists with functional traits, phylogenetic information, and region‐level geographic, environmental and socio‐economic data. It contains information about the floristic status (native, endemic, alien and naturalized) and takes advantage of the wealth of trait information in the regional Floras, complemented by data from global trait databases. RESULTS: GIFT 1.0 holds species lists for 2,893 regions across the whole globe including ~315,000 taxonomically standardized species names (i.e. c. 80% of all known land plant species) and ~3 million species‐by‐region occurrences. Based on a hierarchical and taxonomical derivation scheme, GIFT contains information for 83 functional traits and more than 2.3 million trait‐by‐species combinations and achieves unprecedented coverage in categorical traits such as woodiness (~233,000 spp.) or growth form (~213,000 spp.). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Here, we present the structure, content and automated workflows of GIFT and a corresponding web‐interface (http://gift.uni-goettingen.de) as proof of concept for the feasibility and potential of mobilizing aggregated biodiversity data for global macroecological and biogeographical research.  aPublisher supplied data  cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft 3aPlantae 3abiogeography 3adatabases 3ageographical distribution 3ainformation sources 3ainventories 3aphylogeny 3asocioeconomics 3aspecies diversity1 aKönig, Christian,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0585-59831 aKreft, Holger1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4471-82360 tJournal of biogeography.g2020 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.16-43dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl9765x0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbi.136233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245006300170300001600233500001400249520079900263592002801062650002101090650001101111650000901122650002101131650001501152650001601167650001501183650001401198650000901212650001301221650002601234650001001260650001901270650001501289650001301304650001901317650001401336650001901350650001201369650001101381651001001392653003401402653001301436653000901449653001901458700001701477700001401494700001801508773016701526856008601693852000901779655001201788IND60706253920221118054143.0200807e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070625392DNAL7 a10.5958/0973-9718.2015.00030.62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAudarya, S.D.10aDetection of bluetongue virus antibodies in goats of Delhi  ap. 135-137.  aNAL-light  aSeropositivity for bluetongue virus antibodies in nondescript adult goats of Delhi, India was evaluated by indigenously developed Agar Gel Immunodiffusion test (AGID).

They formed thin filamentous pseudocysts of 0.9–2.0 (mean 1.4) mm by 0.03–0.06 (0.04) mm (n = 5) and 0.9–3.4 (2.1) mm by 0.02–0.05 (0.04) mm (n = 12), respectively. Myxospores of U. aequilobata n. sp. are composed of three equal shell valves and measured 6.7–8.5 (7.3) μm in length and 7.1–8.8 (7.6) μm in width, and contained a prominent polar capsule (PC) 3.2–3.8 (3.6) μm in diameter (n = 18) and two rudimentary PCs. A nucleotide sequence (5127 bp) of the ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) array was obtained for the genetic characterization of this new species. Based on morphological and phylogenetic criteria, we erect U. aequilobata n. sp. as the sixteenth species in the genus Unicapsula. Nucleotide sequences of the 18S and 28S rDNA obtained from U. seriolae from the yellowstripe scad were almost identical (99.6–100% or 99.0–99.6%, respectively) to those from fish found in the seawaters around Australia and Japan. Consequently, this is a new host and geographical distribution records for U. seriolae. In addition, we illustrated the predicted secondary structure of the available 5.8S rDNA sequences of multivalvulid species, including those obtained from U. aequilobata n. sp., to assess the significance of interspecific nucleotide variations in this short rDNA unit.  aPublisher supplied data  aR17022cGuangdong Ocean University  aGrant-in-Aid for Food Science and Research 2019cToyo Suisan Foundation  aGrant-in-Aid for International Collaboration Research 2019cGoho Life Sciences International Fund  a18K05995cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aDecapterus 3aJapan 3aMultivalvulida 3aSelaroides leptolepis 3afish 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasitology 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3aribosomal RNA 3aAustralia 3aSouth China Sea1 aLi, Yingjun,1 aGhosh, Subarna1 aYunus, Muchammad1 aZhang, Jin-Yong1 aSato, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5230-46770 tParasitology research.g2021 July, v. 120, no. 7 p.2379-2389dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07108-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245007600161500001400237520124200251592002801493650001501521650002001536650001401556650001901570650001601589650001501605650001001620650001301630650002501643650001001668650001001678700002501688700002601713773011901739856007401858852000901932655001201941IND60704215320221119131945.0200723e20191224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070421532DNAL7 a10.3390/w120100802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarti-Puig, Pere 10aDouble Tensor-Decomposition for SCADA Data Completion in Water Networks  aNAL-light  aSupervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems currently monitor and collect a huge among of data from all kind of processes. Ideally, they must run without interruption, but in practice, some data may be lost due to a sensor failure or a communication breakdown. When it happens, given the nature of these failures, information is lost in bursts, that is, sets of consecutive samples. When this occurs, it is necessary to fill out the gaps of the historical data with a reliable data completion method. This paper presents an ad hoc method to complete the data lost by a SCADA system in case of long bursts. The data correspond to levels of drinking water tanks of a Water Network company which present fluctuation patterns on a daily and a weekly scale. In this work, a new tensorization process and a novel completion algorithm mainly based on two tensor decompositions are presented. Statistical tests are realised, which consist of applying the data reconstruction algorithms, by deliberately removing bursts of data in verified historical databases, to be able to evaluate the real effectiveness of the tested methods. For this application, the presented approach outperforms the other techniques found in the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adrinking water 3ainformation 3aliterature 3apaper 3asampling 3astatistical analysis 3atanks 3awater1 aMartí-Sarri, Arnau 1 aSerra-Serra, Moisès 0 tWater.g2019 Dec. 24, v. 12, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120100803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245014200177300001800319520135500337592002801692650001701720650002201737650003101759650001101790650001101801650001201812650001301824650004401837650000901881650001701890650001201907650001901919650001201938700001801950700002401968700001701992700002502009700002002034700001802054773011702072856005502189852000902244655001202253IND4510045620221119081911.0150730e200006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451004562DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1327.2000.01366.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, XiaoâSong13aTherole of individual lysine residues in the basic patch on turnip cytochrome f for electrostatic interactions with plastocyanin in vitro  ap. 3461-3468.  aThe role of electrostatic interactions in determining the rate of electron transfer between cytochrome f and plastocyanin has been examined in vitro with mutants of turnip cytochrome f and mutants of pea and spinach plastocyanins. Mutation of lysine residues Lys58, Lys65 and Lys187 of cytochrome f to neutral or acidic residues resulted in decreased binding constants and decreased rates of electron transfer to wildâtype pea plastocyanin. Interaction of the cytochrome f mutant K187E with the pea plastocyanin mutant D51K gave a further decrease in electron transfer rate, indicating that a complementary charge pair at these positions could not compensate for the decreased overall charge on the proteins. Similar results were obtained with the interaction of the cytochrome f mutant K187E with single, double and triple mutants of residues in the acidic patches of spinach plastocyanin. These results suggest that the lysine residues of the basic patch on cytochrome f are predominantly involved in longârange electrostatic interactions with plastocyanin. However, analysis of the data using thermodynamic cycles provided evidence for the interaction of Lys187 of cytochrome f with Asp51, Asp42 and Glu43 of plastocyanin in the complex, in agreement with a structural model of a cytochrome fâplastocyanin complex determined by NMR.  aPublisher supplied data 3acytochrome f 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrostatic interactions 3alysine 3amodels 3amutants 3amutation 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apeas 3aplastocyanin 3aspinach 3athermodynamics 3aturnips1 aWen, Jiang Qi1 aFisher, Nicholas E.1 aYoung, Simon1 aHowe, Christopher J.1 aBendall, D.

F.10aAssessment of elemental and NROM/TENORM hazard potential from non-nuclear industries in North Sinai, Egypt  ap. 583.  aNon-nuclear industries use raw materials containing significant levels of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM). The processing of these materials may expose workers engaged in or even people living near such sites to technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material (TENORM) above the natural background. Inductively coupled plasma and gamma ray spectrometry have been used to determine major and trace elements and radionuclide concentrations in various samples, respectively, in order to investigate the environmental impact of coal mining and cement plant in North Sinai, Egypt. Generally, very little attention was directed to the large volumes of waste generated by either type of industrial activities. Different samples were analyzed including various raw materials, coal, charcoal, Portland and white cement, sludge, and wastes. Coal mine and cement plant workers dealing with waste and kaolin, respectively, are subjected to a relatively high annual effective dose. One of the important finding is the enhancement of all measured elements and radionuclides in the sludge found in coal mine. It may pose an environmental threat because of its large volume and its use as combustion material. The mine environment may have constituted Al, Fe, Cr, and V pollution source for the local area. Higher concentration of Al, Fe, Mn, B, Co, Cr, Mn, Ni, Sr, V, and TENORM were found in Portland cement and Zn in white cement. Coal has higher concentrations of Al, Fe, B, Co, Cr, and V as well as ²²⁶Ra and ²³²Th.

However, most treatments are ineffective and adverse effects are common. Therefore, we aimed to screen protoscolex antigen molecules of Echinococcus granulosus to identify a diagnostic biomarker for hydatid disease. Published E. granulosus transcriptome sequencing data were analyzed to screen for antigen molecules that are highly expressed in protoscoleces but not in oncospheres. The membrane protein EG-06283 (annotated as Frizzled-4) was selected from 16 antigens, and its gene fragment was subjected to codon optimization and synthesis. rEG-06283 expression was induced in the pET-24a/EG-06283/BL21 strain; subsequently, the protein was purified and subcutaneously injected into ICR mice at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6. Blood sampling occurred periodically to quantify serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Immunogenicity was determined by western blot assays using sera from normal mice and mice with secondary hydatid infections. The antigen’s immune reactivity and diagnostic value were validated using sera of patients with hydatid disease. ELISA results confirmed that the antigen molecule induced specific IgG production in mice, resulting in significantly higher levels than those in the adjuvant and control groups (P < 0.05). The western blot results indicated that the protein was recognized by antibodies in the sera of mice with hydatid infection and the antisera of immunized mice. Quantification of protein levels in the sera of patients with hydatid disease significantly differed from levels in healthy participants (P < 0.05). These results indicate that rEG-06283 is a potential diagnostic antigen for E. granulosus infections.  aPublisher supplied data  aNo. 81360249cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aNo. 2018BEG02003cthe Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Key Research Program  aNo.NZ15212cNatural Science Foundation of Ningxia Province 3aEchinococcus granulosus 3aWestern blotting 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3adisease diagnosis 3aechinococcosis 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amembrane proteins 3aoncospheres 3aparasitology 3aprotoscoleces 3aresearch 3atranscriptome1 aZhang, Tingrui1 aZhao, Yinqi1 aWang, Yin1 aLv, Yongxue1 aLi, Shasha1 aYang, Songhao1 aZhu, Mingxing1 aZhao, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7744-115X1 aWang, Qiang0 tParasitology research.g2021 July, v. 120, no. 7 p.2557-2567dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07183-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011900164300001600283520161400299592002801913650002101941650001301962650001801975650001001993650001502003650002102018650001502039650001602054650002702070650002802097650002202125650001602147650001002163650002002173650002102193650000902214650001602223650002002239650002502259650001102284650001702295700002202312700002402334700002502358700001902383700002302402773010002425856007302525852000902598655001202607IND60519165120221119183125.0160420e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051916512DNAL7 a10.1002/tox.220672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarombi, Ebenezer O.10aResponses of testis, epididymis, and sperm of pubertal rats exposed to functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes  ap. 543-551.  aThe present study investigated the response of testes, epididymides and sperm in pubertal Wistar rats following exposure to 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 mg kg⁻¹ functionalized multi‐walled carbon nanotubes (f‐MWCNTs) for 5 days. The results showed that administration of (f‐MWCNTs) significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase in a dose‐dependent manner in both testes and sperm compared with control group. Moreover, the significant decrease in the activity of glutathione‐S‐transferase and glutathione level was accompanied with significant elevation in the levels of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in both testes and sperm of (f‐MWCNTs)‐treated rats. The spermiogram of (f‐MWCNTs)‐treated rats indicated significant decrease in epididymal sperm number, sperm progressive motility, testicular sperm number and daily sperm production with elevated sperm abnormalities when compared with the control. Exposure to (f‐MWCNTs) decreased plasma testosterone level and produced marked morphological changes including decreased geminal epithelium, edema, congestion, reduced spermatogenic cells and focal areas of tubular degeneration in the testes. The lumen of the epididymides contained reduced sperm cells and there was mild to severe hyperplasia epithelial cells lining the duct of the epididymis. Collectively, pubertal exposure of male rats to (f‐MWCNTs) elicited oxidative stress response resulting in marked testicular and epididymides dysfunction. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Eldana saccharina is a destructive pest of the sugarcane crop in South Africa. Fusarium sacchari PNG40 (a fungal strain harmful to E. saccharina) has the potential to be an endophytic biological control agent of the stalk borer. However, the fungus causes Fusarium stalk rot in sugarcane. In the current study, sugarcane plants tolerant and resistant to F. sacchari PNG40 were produced by exposing embryogenic calli to the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), followed by in vitro selection during somatic embryogenesis and plantlet regeneration on media containing F. sacchari culture filtrates (CF). The incorporation of 100 ppm CF in the culture media at the embryo maturation stage, at germination, or at both, resulted in callus necrosis and consequent reduced plantlet yield. Subsequent trimming of the roots of regenerated plants and their exposure to 1,500 ppm CF served as a further selection treatment. Plants produced from EMS-treated calli displayed improved root re-growth in the presence of CF pressure compared with those from non-treated calli. The tolerance of CF-selected plants was confirmed in greenhouse tests by inoculation with F. sacchari PNG40, re-isolation of Fusarium spp. from undamaged tissue of asymptomatic plants and establishment of the identity of fungal isolates as PNG40 using molecular analysis. The restriction of PNG40 presence to the inoculation lesion in some plants suggested their resistance to the fungus. Genotypes exhibiting symptomless endophytic colonization by PNG40 were identified and will be utilised for testing biological control strategies against E. saccharina.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEldana saccharina 3aFusarium 3aPapaipema nebris 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3acallus 3aculture filtrates 3aculture media 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3afungi 3agenotype 3agermination 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amutagenicity 3anecrosis 3apests 3aroots 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asugarcane 2aAnimals 2aEndophytes 2aEthyl Methanesulfonate 2aFusariumxphysiology 2aGenotype 2aMothsxphysiology 2aMutagenesis 2aMutagens 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Somatic Embryogenesis Techniques 2aRegeneration 2aSaccharumxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 3aSouth Africa1 aRutherford, R.

Error analysis against gauge observations revealed that EMSPD-DBMA captured the spatiotemporal pattern of daily precipitation with an acceptable Correlation Coefficient (CC) of 0.53 and a Relative Bias (RB) of −8.28%. Moreover, EMSPD-DBMA outperformed IMERG and GSMaP-MVK in almost all metrics in the summers of 2014 and 2015, with the lowest RB and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values of −2.88% and 8.01 mm/d, respectively. It also better reproduced the Probability Density Function (PDF) in terms of daily rainfall amount and estimated moderate and heavy rainfall better than both IMERG and GSMaP-MVK. Further, hydrological evaluation with the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model in the Upper Yangtze River region indicated that the EMSPD-DBMA forced simulation showed satisfying hydrological performance in terms of streamflow prediction, with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.82 and 0.58, compared to gauge forced simulation (0.88 and 0.60) at the calibration and validation periods, respectively. EMSPD-DBMA also performed a greater fitness for peak flow simulation than a new Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation Version 2 (MSWEP V2) product, indicating a promising prospect of hydrological utility for the ensemble satellite precipitation data. This study belongs to early comprehensive evaluation of the blended multi-satellite precipitation data across the TP, which would be significant for improving the DBMA algorithm in regions with complex terrain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aalgorithms 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprobability distribution 3arain 3asatellites 3astream flow 3asummer 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aSatellite precipitation 0aDynamic Bayesian Model Averaging (DBMA) scheme 0aHydrological application 0aThe Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model 0aTibetan Plateau1 aYang, Yuan1 aHan, Zhongying1 aTang, Guoqiang1 aMaguire, Lane1 aChu, Zhigang1 aHong, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7428-02690 tJournal of hydrology.g2018 Jan., v. 556 p.634-644dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03676naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245019800159300001800357500002000375520152800395592002801923596010401951596006602055650002802121650001402149650001402163650001902177650001702196650002702213650001302240650001102253650002302264650002702287650001902314650002802333650001302361650001402374650001702388700005602405700002402461700005802485700002402543700001602567700002402583700001802607700002002625700002402645700001902669700002002688700005602708700002202764700002102786700002002807700002002827773012202847856007202969852000903041655001203050IND60645658920221122053304.0190529e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064565892DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.63292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang‐Bo, Hyun10aMorin enhances auranofin anticancer activity by up‐regulation of DR4 and DR5 and modulation of Bcl‐2 through reactive oxygen species generation in Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells  ap. 1384-1393.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEvidence suggests that auranofin (AF) exhibits anticancer activity by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Here, in this study, we have investigated the synergistic effects of AF and morin and their mechanism for the anticancer effects focusing on apoptosis in Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We assessed the anticancer activities by annexin V/PI double staining, caspase, and TrxR activity assay. Morin enhances the inhibitory effects on TrxR activity of AF as well as reducing cell viability. Annexin V/PI double staining revealed that morin/AF cotreatment induced apoptotic cell death. Morin enhances AF‐induced mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) loss and cytochrome c release. Further, morin/AF cotreatment upregulated death receptor DR4/DR5, modulated Bcl‐2 family members (upregulation of Bax and downregulation of Bcl‐2), and activated caspase‐3, ‐8, and ‐9. Morin also enhances AF‐induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The anticancer effects results from caspase‐dependent apoptosis, which was triggered via extrinsic pathway by upregulating TRAIL receptors (DR4/DR5) and enhanced via intrinsic pathway by modulating Bcl‐2 and inhibitor of apoptosis protein family members. These are related to ROS generation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that morin can enhance the anticancer activity of AF in Hep3B human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, indicating that its combination could be an alternative treatment strategy for the hepatocellular carcinoma.  aPublisher supplied data  a0820050cNational R & D Program for Cancer Control, Ministry for Health, Welfare and Family Affairs  a2018R1A2B2005705cNational Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell viability 3acytochrome c 3adeath domain receptors 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aneoplasm cells 3areactive oxygen species 3astaining 3asynergism 3athioredoxins1 aLee, Won Sup1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0863-14241 aNagappan, Arulkumar1 aKim, Hong-jae,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2719-40041 aPanchanathan, Radha1 aPark, Cheol1 aChang, Seong‐Hwan1 aKim, Nam Deuk1 aLeem, Sun‐Hee1 aChang, Young‐Chae1 aKwon, Taeg Kyu1 aCheong, Jae Hun1 aKim, Gon Sup1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7048-458X1 aJung, Jin‐Myung1 aShin, Sung-chul,1 aHong, Soon Chan1 aChoi, Yung Hyun0 tPhytotherapy research.g2019 May, v. 33, no. 5 p.1384-1393dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.63293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016700166300001200333520167000345592002802015650002802043650002502071650002002096650001202116650001102128650001402139650000902153650002102162650001002183650001502193650001702208650001702225650001102242650001502253650000902268650000902277650001002286650001202296650001102308650001002319650001502329650000902344650001402353650000902367651001302376700002102389700002002410700002102430700001902451773013402470856008102604852000902685655001202694IND60439532320221117224739.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043953232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4812-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYap, Chee Kong10aPotential human health risk assessment of heavy metals via the consumption of tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus collected from contaminated and uncontaminated ponds  ap. 584.  aFish tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus were collected from a contaminated Seri Serdang (SS) pond potentially receiving domestic effluents and an uncontaminated pond from Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM). The fish were dissected into four parts namely gills, muscles, intestines, and liver. All the fish parts were pooled and analyzed for the concentrations of Cd, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, and Zn. Generally, the concentrations of all metals were low in the edible muscle in comparison to the other parts of the fish. It was found that the levels of all the heavy metals in the different parts of fish collected from the SS were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than those from UPM, indicating greater metal bioavailabilities in the SS pond. The sediment data also showed a similar pattern with significantly (P < 0.05) higher metal concentrations in SS than in UPM, indicating higher metal contamination in SS. Potential health risk assessments based on provisional tolerable weekly intake (PTWI) and the amount of fish required to reach the PTWI values, estimated daily intake (EDI), and target hazard quotient (THQ) indicated that health risks associated with heavy metal exposure via consumption of the fish’s muscles were insignificant to human. Therefore, the consumption of the edible muscles of tilapia from both ponds should pose no toxicological risk of heavy metals since their levels are also below the recommended safety guidelines. While it is advisable to discard the livers, gills, and intestines of the two tilapia fish populations before consumption, there were no potential human health risks of heavy metals to the consumers on the fish muscle part.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOreochromis mossambicus 3aaverage daily intake 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acopper 3aeffluents 3afish 3afish consumption 3agills 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aintestines 3airon 3alead 3aliver 3amuscles 3anickel 3aponds 3apopulation 3arisk 3asediments 3azinc 3aMalaysia1 aJusoh, Amiruddin1 aLeong, Wah June1 aKaramī, ʻAlī,1 aOng, Ghim Hock0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Sept., v. 187, no. 9 p.584-584dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4812-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012600169300001600295500001900311520134900330592002801679650003301707650001601740650002401756650002101780650001401801650001901815650002001834650001301854653002701867653004001894700005901934700002301993700005802016700002002074700001702094700002402111700002302135773014602158856008302304852000902387655001202396IND60678165620221118012743.0200210e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067816562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.12.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObayashi, Hitomi10aHistone deacetylase 10 knockout activates chaperone-mediated autophagy and accelerates the decomposition of its substrate  ap. 246-252.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHistone deacetylase (HDAC) 10 is a member of class IIb HDACs, but its deacetylation targets and functions are poorly characterized. Recent investigation has proposed that HDAC10 deacetylates heat shock cognate protein 70 kDa (HSC70) after interaction. HSC70 plays an important role in chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), binding CMA substrates and transporting them to lysosomes. However, it has not been clarified whether HDAC10 is involved in CMA. In this study, we established the HDAC10 knockout HeLa cell line and evaluated its CMA activity to determine whether HDAC10 participates in regulating CMA. In HDAC10 knockout cells, lysosome-associated protein type 2A (LAMP2A) protein level increased and LAMP2A-positive lysosomes accumulated around the nucleus. Moreover, GAPDH, which is a well-known CMA substrate, was delivered to LAMP2A-positive lysosomes and degraded in HDAC10 knockout cells more efficiently than in wild type HeLa cells. These results suggest that CMA is activated in HDAC10 knockout cells. Meanwhile, turnover assay using LC3 and p62, which are macroautophagy markers, indicated that autophagic flux was fully functioning in HDAC10 knockout cells as well as in wild type HeLa cells. In conclusion, HDAC10 participated in regulating CMA, and HDAC10 knockout activated CMA and accelerated degradation of a CMA substrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3achaperone-mediated autophagy 3aheat stress 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahuman cell lines 3alysosomes 3amacroautophagy 3aprotein content 3aresearch 0aHistone deacetylase 10 0aLysosome-associated protein type 2A1 aNagano, Yoshito1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7974-48241 aTakahashi, Tetsuya1 aSeki, Takahiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9894-47681 aTanaka, Shigeru1 aSakai, Norio1 aMatsumoto, Masayasu1 aMaruyama, Hirofumi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 523, no. 1 p.246-252dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.12.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02002naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245044800167300001600615520071300631592002801344650002201372650001501394650002101409650001801430650002201448700001901470773013701489856007701626852000901703655001201712IND60521396320221119013607.0160529e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052139632DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1972-06152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrause, Gotthard H.10aBeziehungen zwischen Rotationsisomerie, Wasserstoffbrücken-Bindung und Substituenteneffekten der organischen Chemie / Relations between Rotational Isomerism, Hydrogen Bonding, and Substituent Effects in Organic ChemistrybEinfluß des Behinderungspotentials der Protonenakzeptorrotation auf die Stabilität innermolekularer Wasserstoffbrücken / Effect of Hindrance to Proton Acceptor Rotation on the Strength of Intramolecular Hydrogen Bonds  ap. 663-674.  aThe change of free enthalpy involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding is smaller if the proton acceptor group can rotate round a single bond, as compared to proton acceptor groups which are fixed in a position optimal for hydrogen bonding.

This is demonstrated by comparing the absorptions of carbonyl stretching vibrations in the infrared spectra of certain compounds showing rotational isomerism.

Hence, we designed a study to evaluate the renal‐stone‐dissolving efficacy of black seed. Sixty patients with renal stones were randomly enrolled in two arms of a randomized, triple‐blind, placebo‐controlled, clinical trial. The patients were treated by black seed capsules (500 mg) or placebo two times per day for 10 weeks. Patients were assessed in terms of size of renal stones by using sonography before and after intervention. In the black seed group, 44.4% of patients excreted their stones completely, and the size of the stones remained unchanged and decreased in 3.7% and 51.8% of patients, respectively. In contrast, in the placebo group, 15.3% of the patients excreted their stones completely, 11.5% had reduction in stone size, 15.3% had increase in stone size, and 57.6% had no change in their stone size. The difference in the mean size of renal stones after the study was significant between the two groups (p < 0.05). N. sativa L., as compared with placebo, is demonstrated to have significant positive effects on disappearance or reduction of size of kidney stones.  aPublisher supplied data  cMashhad University of Medical Sciences 3aNigella sativa 3aclinical trials 3apatients 3arenal calculi 3aultrasonography1 aYūsufī, Mahdī,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5434-26341 aSaghebi, Seyed Ahmad1 aSadeghi Vazin, Mahmoud1 aIraji, Aida1 aMosavat, Seyed Hamdollah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2016-68360 tPhytotherapy research.g2019 May, v. 33, no. 5 p.1404-1412dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.63313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245014000170300001800310520190100328592002802229596006602257650002602323650002702349650001702376650001302393650002002406650001502426650001002441650001002451650001502461650001402476650001402490650001702504650001302521650001802534651001002552700002202562700002002584700002302604700002202627773013002649856008202779961001502861852000902876655001202885IND60744131320221122005045.0210709e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074413132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-021-07196-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Dayvion R.10aCulex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) survivorship following the ingestion of bird blood infected with Haemoproteus sp. parasites  ap. 2343-2350.  aArthropod vectors are frequently exposed to a diverse assemblage of parasites, but the consequence of these infections on their biology and behavior are poorly understood. We experimentally evaluated whether the ingestion of a common protozoan parasite of avian hosts (Haemoproteus spp.; Haemosporida: Haemoproteidae) impacted the survivorship of Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) (Diptera: Culicidae). Blood was collected from wild northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) in College Station, Texas, and screened for the presence of Haemoproteus spp. parasites using microscopic and molecular methods. Experimental groups of Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were offered Haemoproteus-positive cardinal blood through an artificial feeding apparatus, while control groups received Haemoproteus-negative cardinal blood or domestic canary (Serinus canaria domestica) blood. Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes exposed to Haemoproteus infected cardinal blood survived significantly fewer days than mosquitoes that ingested Haemoproteus-negative cardinal blood. The survival of mosquitoes fed on positive cardinal blood had a median survival time of 18 days post-exposure and the survival of mosquitoes fed on negative cardinal blood exceeded 50% across the 30 day observation period. Additionally, mosquitoes that fed on canary controls survived significantly fewer days than cardinal negative controls, with canary control mosquitoes having a median survival time of 17 days. This study further supports prior observations that Haemoproteus parasites can be pathogenic to bird-biting mosquitoes, and suggests that Haemoproteus parasites may indirectly suppress the transmission of co-circulating vector-borne pathogens by modulating vector survivorship. Our results also suggest that even in the absence of parasite infection, bloodmeals from different bird species can influence mosquito survivorship.  aPublisher supplied data  aK01AI128005cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health 3aCardinalis cardinalis 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aHaemoproteus 3aProtozoa 3aSerinus canaria 3aarthropods 3abirds 3ablood 3ablood meal 3aingestion 3aparasites 3aparasitology 3aresearch 3asurvival rate 3aTexas1 aGolnar, Andrew J.1 aHamer, Sarah A.1 aSlotman, Michel A.1 aHamer, Gabriel L.0 tParasitology research.g2021 July, v. 120, no. 7 p.2343-2350dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870072x0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-021-07196-73Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245014200167300001800309500002000327520167600347592002802023650001102051650001602062650002002078650001602098650001502114650001502129650001102144650001702155650001302172650001502185650001302200650001402213650002102227700005602248700006102304700002002365773013002385856007702515852000902592655001202601IND60790152020221116181846.0220824e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079015202DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JB0166732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aObradors‐Prats, J.12aA Diagenesis Model for Geomechanical Simulations: Formulation and Implications for Pore Pressure and Development of Geological Structures  ap. 4452-4472.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aForward basin modeling is routinely used in many geological applications, with the critical limitation that chemical diagenetic reactions are often neglected or poorly represented. Here, a new, temperature‐dependent, kinetic diagenesis model is formulated and implemented within a hydromechanical framework. The model simulates the macroscopic effects of diagenesis on (1) porosity loss, (2) sediment strength, (3) sediment stiffness and compressibility, (4) change in elastic properties, (5) increase in tensile strength due to cementation, and (6) overpressure generation. A brief overview of the main diagenetic reactions relevant to basin modeling is presented and the model calibration procedure is demonstrated using published data for the Kimmeridge Clay Formation. The calibrated model is used to show the implications of diagenesis on prediction of overpressure development and structural deformation. The incorporation of diagenesis in a uniaxial burial model results in an increase in overpressure of up to 9 MPa due to both stress‐independent porosity loss and overpressure generated by disequilibrium compaction caused by a reduction in permeability. Finally, a compressional model is used to show that the incorporation of diagenesis within geomechanical models allows the transition from ductile to brittle behavior to be captured due to the increase in strength that results in an overconsolidated stress state.

However, some recent studies have proposed that such environmental losses of N can be ignored by adapting an alternative way of combining nitrogenous fertilizer with pyrolyzed biomass (biochar). Therefore, the effect of co-application of rice-residue biochar (RB) or poultry manure biochar (PB) along with urea on N dynamics was investigated by conducting a 60-day incubation experiment. The results showed that urea led to greater N mineralization (0.2 µg N g⁻¹ soil day⁻¹) due to the easy availability of ammonical-N (NH₄⁺-N) produced from hydrolysis that acted as a substrate for nitrification. Sole application of biochars (RB or PB) or their co-application with urea resulted in 38–45% and 19–28% lower N mineralization than the sole urea amended soil, respectively. The lower N mineralization in sole biochar or biochar plus urea amended soil was most likely caused due to (1) increased C:N ratio of the biochar amended soil, (2) adsorption of NH₄⁺-N by biochar, (3) microbial immobilization of the nitrogen in the amended soil, and (4) lower urease activity in the treatments amended with biochar. Thus, it may be concluded that the co-application of biochar with urea can reduce N losses through moderation of N mineralization and make it available to plants for longer periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3ahydrolysis 3amineralization 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apoultry manure 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3aurea 3aurease 3avolatilization1 aMavi, Manpreet S.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2021 June, v. 193, no. 6 p.326-326dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-09107-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164300001200295520127700307592002801584650001101612650002201623650002601645650001901671650001401690650002301704650002101727650001501748650002301763650002701786650001201813651001001825700001501835700001701850700001801867700001401885700001701899700001301916773013401929856008102063852000902144655001202153IND60439532520221117224748.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043953252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4733-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Haijun10aAnnual ecosystem respiration variability of alpine peatland on the eastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and its controlling factors  ap. 550.  aPeatlands are widely developed in the eastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, but little is known about carbon budgets for these alpine peatland ecosystems. In this study, we used an automatic chamber system to measure ecosystem respiration in the Hongyuan peatland, which is located in the eastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Annual ecosystem respiration measurements showed a typical seasonal pattern, with the peak appearing in June. The highest respiration was 10.43 μmol CO₂/m²/s, and the lowest was 0.20 μmol CO₂/m²/s. The annual average ecosystem respiration was 2.06 μmol CO₂/m²/s. The total annual respiration was 599.98 g C/m², and respiration during the growing season (from May to September) accounted for 78 % of the annual sum. Nonlinear regression revealed that ecosystem respiration has a significant exponential correlation with soil temperature at 10-cm depth (R ² = 0.98). The Q ₁₀ value was 3.90, which is far higher than the average Q ₁₀ value of terrestrial ecosystems. Ecosystem respiration had an apparent diurnal variation pattern in growing season, with peaks and valleys appearing at approximately 14:00 and 10:00, respectively, which could be explained by soil temperature and soil water content variation at 10-cm depth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adiurnal variation 3aecosystem respiration 3agrowing season 3apeatlands 3aseasonal variation 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3avalleys 3aChina1 aHong, Bing1 aHong, Yetang1 aZhu, Yongxuan1 aCai, Chen1 aYuan, Lingui1 aWang, Yu0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Sept., v. 187, no. 9 p.550-550dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4733-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245008200167300001600249520063300265592002800898650002500926650002500951650000900976650001500985650001501000650001101015650002801026650001701054650001701071650004401088700001601132700001901148700001501167700002101182773012101203856008101324852000901405655001201414IND60440529320221120175833.0151024e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044052932DNAL7 a10.1007/s12272-009-1135-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Young-Jae,10aAntioxidant activities of new flavonoids from Cudrania tricuspidata root bark  ap. 195-200.  aTwo new flavonoids, hydroxybenzyl flavonoid glycosides (6-p-hydroxybenzyl kaempferol-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside named cudranian 1 and 6-p-hydroxybenzyl quercetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside named cudranian 2), and 3 known flavonoids (kaempferol-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, quercetin-7-O-β-D-glucopyranoside and aromadendrin) were isolated from root bark of Cudrania tricuspidata and their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods.

The present study aimed to establish an endoscopic technique for the placement of a transurethral urinary catheter into the bladder of rams. This catheter was used as a removable stent-like drainage. The procedure was performed in three sheep rams that were euthanized and placed for surgery in 45° Trendelenburg position. In one ram, cystotomy was performed via right paramedian laparotomy. A 3 mm flexible fiberscope was introduced into the urinary bladder and advanced via urethra to the tip of the penis. Placing a guide wire through the endoscopic working channel into the urethra enabled the retrograde insertion of a transurethral urinary catheter into the bladder. In two rams, retrograde insertion of a fiberscope was performed. Again, a guidewire was used to insert a balloon catheter into the bladder. Paramedian right laparotomy was performed to ascertain the correct position of the balloon. Both techniques, antero- and retrograde endoscopy, were possible and could be successfully performed. Mucous membranes and urinary microliths were easily observed. Repeated advancing of the endoscope or the catheter resulted in marked damage of the mucous membranes. The patency of the urethra may be restored by means of endoscopic placement of a transurethral catheter in male small ruminants. The applicability and clinical outcome of this procedure as well as the effects on stricture formation should be further examined with controlled clinical studies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abladder 3acadaver 3acatheters 3aclinical trials 3adrainage 3aendoscopy 3alaparotomy 3amucosa 3apenis 3arams 3aurethra 3aurolithiasis1 aNeiger, Reto1 aWehrend, Axel0 tActa veterinaria scandinavica.g2019 Dec., v. 61, no. 1 p.52-52dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl16962x1751-01477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13028-019-0487-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03606naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011400208300001400322500001900336520168800355592002802043596007702071596007702148596008402225596009202309596005102401650002602452650003602478650003602514650001202550650001302562650001402575650001802589650001302607650002202620650002602642650002202668650001302690650002602703700006202729700006002791700006002851773012202911856008203033852000903115655001203124IND60720476220221119103909.0201215e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072047622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-020-01069-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, Romina N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2991-215310aWRKY22 and WRKY25 transcription factors are positive regulators of defense responses in Nicotiana benthamiana  ap. 65-82.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aKEY MESSAGE: NbWRKY22 and NbWRKY25 are required for full activation of bacteria-associated pattern- and effector-triggered immunity as well as for the response to other non-bacterial defense elicitors. Plants defend themselves against pathogens using a two-layered immune system. Pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) can be activated upon recognition of epitopes from flagellin including flg22. Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) delivers effector proteins into the plant cell to promote host susceptibility. However, some plants express resistance (R) proteins that recognize specific effectors leading to the activation of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). Resistant tomato lines such as Rio Grande-PtoR (RG-PtoR) recognize two Pst effectors, AvrPto and AvrPtoB, and activate ETI through the Pto/Prf protein complex. Using RNA-seq, we identified two tomato WRKY transcription factor genes, SlWRKY22 and SlWRKY25, whose expression is increased during Pst-induced ETI. Silencing of the WRKY25/22 orthologous genes in Nicotiana benthamiana led to a delay in programmed cell death normally associated with AvrPto recognition or several non-bacterial effector/R protein pairs. An increase in disease symptoms was observed in silenced plants infiltrated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci expressing AvrPto or HopQ1-1. Expression of both tomato WRKY genes is also induced upon treatment with flg22 and callose deposition and cell death suppression assays in WRKY25/22-silenced N. benthamiana plants supported their involvement in PTI. Our results reveal an important role for two WRKYs as positive regulators of plant immunity against bacterial and potentially non-bacterial pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT2014-1589cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica  aPICT2017-0916cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica  aPIP2014-0314cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (AR)  aPUE INFIVE 2016-0110cConsejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (AR)  aIOS-1546625cNational Science Foundation (USA) 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. tomato 3acallose 3aepitopes 3aflagellin 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3amolecular biology 3aprogrammed cell death 3asequence analysis 3atomatoes 3atranscription factors1 aMartin, Gregory B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0044-68301 aPombo, Marina A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4057-27001 aRosli, Hernan G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3929-56300 tPlant molecular biology.g2021 Jan., v. 105, no. 1-2 p.65-82dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33639x0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-020-01069-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005300138245009500191300001800286500001100304520106200315592002801377596006901405596005901474596005901533596005901592596005901651596006501710596006501775650001801840650002301858650002701881650002001908650002001928650001601948650001301964650001701977650001601994650001702010650001302027650002102040650001702061650002302078650002502101650001302126700001502139700001802154700002602172700001702198700001402215700001602229700001202245700001402257700001902271773012202290856007202412852000902484655001202493IND60645659220221123032109.0190529e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064565922DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.63242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2439-162710aCurcuminoids: Implication for inflammation and oxidative stress in cardiovascular diseases  ap. 1302-1317.  aREVIEW  aIt has been extensively verified that inflammation and oxidative stress play important roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Curcuminoids, from the plant Curcuma longa, have three major active ingredients, which include curcumin (curcumin I), demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Curcuminoids have been used in traditional medicine for CVDs' management and other comorbidities for centuries. Numerous studies had delineated their anti‐inflammatory, antioxidative, and other medicinally relevant properties. Animal experiments and clinical trials have also demonstrated that turmeric and curcuminoids can effectively reduce atherosclerosis, cardiac hypertrophy, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and diabetic cardiovascular complications. In this review, we introduce and summarize curcuminoids' molecular and biological significance, while focusing on their mechanistic anti‐inflammatory/antioxidative involvements in CVDs and preventive effects against CVDs, and, finally, discuss relevant clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data  aZ151100004015190cCapital Health Research of Special Application  a81400279cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81670343cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81770374cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81770375cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a20170520012JHcJilin Province Science and Technology Project  a20190701066GHcJilin Province Science and Technology Project 3aCurcuma longa 3aactive ingredients 3aanimal experimentation 3aatherosclerosis 3aclinical trials 3acomorbidity 3acurcumin 3ahypertension 3ahypertrophy 3ainflammation 3aischemia 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3areperfusion injury 3atraditional medicine 3aturmeric1 aMiao, Xiao1 aLi, Fengsheng1 aAdhikari, Binay Kumar1 aLiu, Yucheng1 aSun, Jian1 aZhang, Rong1 aCai, Lu1 aLiu, Quan1 aWang, Yonggang0 tPhytotherapy research.g2019 May, v. 33, no. 5 p.1302-1317dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.63243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002200189245012400211300001600335506007600351520116100427592002801588506003701616650002301653650001901676650001201695650001201707650001801719650001301737650001401750650001101764650001501775650001601790653003101806653002301837653002301860653002501883653001301908700002501921700002001946700002401966700002101990700002602011773010102037856008202138852000902220655001202229IND60555173020221207052020.0180905e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055517302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.btre.2014.12.0102doi7 aPMC54662602pmcid7 a286267022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojtusik, Mateusz10a1,3-Propanediol production by Klebsiella oxytoca NRRL-B199 from glycerol.

Medium composition has been optimized by means of a statistical design based on the Taguchi method. Strong influences of glycerol and phosphate concentrations have been detected on biomass and product yields. Other factors, such as magnesium concentration and K:Na ratio, have shown a small influence on both responses, biomass and product concentrations. An optimized medium composition has been proposed, leading to a final 1,3-propanediol concentration of 12.4g/L with a selectivity of 72% with respect to glycerol consumed at shaken bottle-scale. Once the medium composition had been optimized, the scale-up from shaken bottles to STBR was conducted. Several experiments in a 2L STBR have been conducted in order to determine the best operating conditions concerning temperature and agitation.Under the best operating conditions, i.e., a programmed variable stirring rate ranging from 50 to 100rpm and a temperature of 37°C, a final concentration of 13.5g/L of 1,3-propanediol with a selectivity of 86% with respect to the glycerol consumed was obtained.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKlebsiella oxytoca 3aTaguchi method 3abiomass 3abottles 3aculture media 3aglycerol 3amagnesium 3amixing 3aphosphates 3atemperature 0a1,3-Propanediol production 0aKlebsiella oxytoca 0aMedium composition 0aOperating conditions 0aScale-up1 aRodríguez, Alberto,1 aRipoll, Vanessa1 aSantos, Victoria E.1 aGarcia, Jose L.,1 aGarcía-Ochoa, Félix0 tBiotechnology reports.g2015 June, v. 6 p.100-107dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23403x2215-017X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.btre.2014.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245013600177300001200313520189500325592002802220650002202248650001402270650001002284650001302294650002002307650002302327650002002350650001102370650002602381650001502407650001202422650001602434650000902450650000902459650001502468650001702483650002702500650001602527651001002543700002002553700002302573700002102596700003902617700002102656700002802677700002202705700001602727700001802743700002202761773013402783856008102917852000902998655001203007IND60439532620221117224707.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043953262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4796-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiaradia, Enrico Antonio13aAn integrated, multisensor system for the continuous monitoring of water dynamics in rice fields under different irrigation regimes  ap. 586.  aThe cultivation of rice, one of the most important staple crops worldwide, has very high water requirements. A variety of irrigation practices are applied, whose pros and cons, both in terms of water productivity and of their effects on the environment, are not completely understood yet. The continuous monitoring of irrigation and rainfall inputs, as well as of soil water dynamics, is a very important factor in the analysis of these practices. At the same time, however, it represents a challenging and costly task because of the complexity of the processes involved, of the difference in nature and magnitude of the driving variables and of the high variety of field conditions. In this paper, we present the prototype of an integrated, multisensor system for the continuous monitoring of water dynamics in rice fields under different irrigation regimes. The system consists of the following: (1) flow measurement devices for the monitoring of irrigation supply and tailwater drainage; (2) piezometers for groundwater level monitoring; (3) level gauges for monitoring the flooding depth; (4) multilevel tensiometers and moisture sensor clusters to monitor soil water status; (5) eddy covariance station for the estimation of evapotranspiration fluxes and (6) wireless transmission devices and software interface for data transfer, storage and control from remote computer. The system is modular and it is replicable in different field conditions. It was successfully applied over a 2-year period in three experimental plots in Northern Italy, each one with a different water management strategy. In the paper, we present information concerning the different instruments selected, their interconnections and their integration in a common remote control scheme. We also provide considerations and figures on the material and labour costs of the installation and management of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acomputers 3acrops 3adrainage 3aeddy covariance 3aevapotranspiration 3afactor analysis 3agauges 3airrigation management 3amonitoring 3apaddies 3apiezometers 3arain 3arice 3asoil water 3atensiometers 3awages and remuneration 3awater table 3aItaly1 aFacchi, Arianna1 aMasseroni, Daniele1 aFerrari, Daniele1 aBischetti, G.

In practice, nevertheless, Tx/Rx arrays may be susceptible to unknown gain-phase errors (GPE) and yield seriously decreased positioning accuracy. This paper focuses on the direction-of-departure (DOD) and direction-of-arrival (DOA) problem in bistatic MIMO radar with unknown gain-phase errors (GPE). A novel parallel factor (PARAFAC) estimator is proposed. The factor matrices containing DOD and DOA are firstly obtained via PARAFAC decomposition. One DOD-DOA pair estimation is then accomplished from the spectrum searching. Thereafter, the remainder DOD and DOA are achieved by the least squares technique with the previous estimated angle pair. The proposed estimator is analyzed in detail. It only requires one instrumental Tx/Rx sensor, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical advantages.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aleast squares 3amethodology 3aradar 3aremote sensing 3asimulation models 3ayields1 aShi, Junpeng 1 aWang, Xinhai 1 aWang, Lin 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 July 28, v. 13, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs131529643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03019naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002300142245010800165500002000273520174500293592002802038596008802066596008202154650002002236650001302256650002002269650001602289650002702305650001402332650001302346650001102359651001102370700005902381773013102440856007702571852000902648655001202657IND60788172120221118162838.0220811e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078817212DNAL7 a10.1029/2020WR0273462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Shih‐Yang10aBayesian Integration Using Resistivity and Lithology for Improving Estimation of Hydraulic Conductivity  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe characterization of spatially heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity (K) is important in groundwater resources management. We propose a Bayesian statistical method that integrates multiple secondary data (continuous and category data) with primary data (K) to improve regional K field characterization. Considering the disparity of the data scale, spatial scarcity of primary and secondary data, and need for regional‐scale site characterization, the aquifer thickness is used as the scale for data integration. We transform the high‐resolution secondary data to the scale of K and perform linear/nonlinear regression analyses for the transformed secondary data and primary data. A Bayesian approach using Metropolis‐within‐Gibbs sampling is developed for jointly integrating the primary and transformed secondary data without a limitation on the type of data attribute and the number of data set. A synthetic example is first presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. Results show that the correlation strength, not the relation type, is the primary factor for improving the estimates. The Bayesian method is applied to Choushui River alluvial fan in Taiwan. Resistivity logs and a lithological description are first upscaled and then simultaneously integrated in the K estimation. Results indicate that the improvement of the K estimate obtained using resistivity data is higher in the proximal and mid fans but lower in the distal fan compared to that obtained using lithofacies data. Jointly integrating two‐attribute data outperforms using one or no secondary data set for K estimates. The proposed Bayesian integration method is thus versatile and suitable for large‐scale aquifer characterization.  aPublisher supplied data  a105‐2221‐E‐009‐054‐MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST)  a108‐2116‐M‐006‐008cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (MOST) 3aBayesian theory 3aaquifers 3adata collection 3agroundwater 3ahydraulic conductivity 3alithology 3aresearch 3arivers 3aTaiwan1 aHsu, Kuo‐Chin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1126-80080 tWater resources research.g2021 Mar., v. 57, no. 3 p.e2020WR027346-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR0273463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005500142245008400197500002000281520180900301592002802110596006602138596008602204596007502290650001402365650001202379650001902391650002302410650001502433650001102448650001302459650000902472650001302481650000902494650001302503650001602516650001502532650001002547650002102557650001802578700005602596700005502652773013202707856007702839852000902916655001202925IND60788155820221120075407.0220811e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078815582DNAL7 a10.1029/2020WR0273492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Xuejin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0462-677810aGlobal Changes in Baseflow Under the Impacts of Changing Climate and Vegetation  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUnderstanding the impacts of climate change and human activities on hydrological processes, especially the baseflow, is vital for sustainable water resource management. We analyzed the global changes in baseflow and baseflow index (BFI) for 2,374 global streamflow stations from 1970 to 2016 to examine their associations with precipitation, temperature, terrestrial water storage (TWS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) representing the vegetation regimes, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and a humidity index (HI)‐precipitation/PET. Results showed that changes in both baseflow and BFI are significantly region dependent in continents, due to spatial differences of changes in climate and vegetation that determines the baseflow generation. Seasonal baseflow changed slightly, while seasonal BFI varied greatly, partly due to the shift from snowfall to rainfall and warming effects on glacial retreat and the timing of snowmelt. The multibasin baseflow elasticity analyses show that baseflow (BFI) was highly sensitive to changes in NDVI, precipitation, and temperature (temperature and PET). The multivariate regression analyses show that globally, changes in precipitation and TWS contributed to the majority (64.8% and 20.2%) of changes in baseflow, while changes in HI, PET, and precipitation contributed to the majority (30.3%, 28.9%, and 27.5%) of changes in BFI. The spatially varying interaction between climate, vegetation, and baseflow implies that regional adaptation of water resources utilization to climate change should consider the regional shifts in vegetation. This study quantified the elasticity and relative contribution of changes in geographic factors to changes in baseflow and BFI around the world and could inform practices for sustainable water management.  aPublisher supplied data  a51879289cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  aGZSWKJ‐2020‐2cInnovation Fund of Guangzhou City Water Science and Technology  a2019B1515120052cGuangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation 3abase flow 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aevapotranspiration 3aglaciation 3ahumans 3ahumidity 3arain 3aresearch 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awater 3awater management 3awater storage1 aLiu, Bingjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9393-06741 aTan, Xuezhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5682-34770 tWater resources research.g2020 Sept., v. 56, no. 9 p.e2020WR027349-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020WR0273493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245003900160300001600199520103000215592002801245650001101273650002501284650001001309650002801319650001801347650002101365700001901386700002101405773010001426856007201526852000901598655001201607IND60519165620221119183038.0160420e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051916562DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.20112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTollefson, Laurie10aReview of the Strategy Theme Basin  ap. 235-238.  aThe technical activities of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) are organized under four Strategy Themes: On Farm, Systems, Basin, and Knowledge. Strategy Theme Basin deals with the basin level environmental aspects that affect agricultural water management and their impact on the environment. This review of Strategy Theme Basin and its six Working Groups (WG) examines its unique multi‐disciplinary role in delivering ICID's contribution to Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), its effectiveness in meeting that role, and its future needs toward fulfilling that role. A formal set of objectives, of mechanisms to meet those objectives, and of suitable outputs for Strategy Theme Basin are proposed. Recommendations for future activities of the WG are made to improve multi‐disciplinary collaborations with relevant outside organizations, to facilitate greater participation by ICID members, to improve WG functionality, and to effectively disseminate knowledge to IWRM professionals.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aenvironmental impact 3afarms 3airrigation and drainage 3aprofessionals 3awater management1 aWahba, Mohamed1 aHarrington, John0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2016 Apr., v. 65, no. 2 p.235-238dJohn Wiley & Sonsx1531-03537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.20113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02639naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001600141245009700157500001400254520131900268592002801587650001101615650001001626650001601636650001501652650001301667650002501680650003201705650002201737650000901759650001301768650001001781650001201791650001401803650001301817650001501830650001401845650001201859650001001871700001801881700001601899700001801915700001901933773012001952856007602072852000902148655001202157IND60702123620221119003200.0200717e20200110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070212362DNAL7 a10.3390/ani100101122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Yiyan 10aCitrus Extract Improves the Absorption and Utilization of Nitrogen and Gut Health of Piglets  aNAL-light  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of citrus extract (CE) on plasma free amino acids, intestinal morphology and enzymes activity, fecal nitrogen and phosphorus emissions in piglets. The experiment was performed on 144 weaned piglets (Duroc × Landrace × Large White) divided into three groups. Control (CON), fed a basic diet; Antibiotic (ANTI), fed a basic diet supplemented with 75 g/t chlortetracycline; Citrus extract (CE), fed a basic diet supplemented with 300 mL/t CE. The albumin content of the CE group was significantly higher than the CON group. Compared with the CON and ANTI groups, the CE group had increased concentrations of plasma total essential amino acids and threonine. Compared with the CON group, CE increased the α-aminoadipic acid concentration, while compared with ANTI group, it increased the 3-methylhistidine concentration. Compared with the CON group, the crypt depth of duodenum, jejunum and ileum decreased, and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth of ileum increased in the ANTI and CE groups. CE increased the activity of alkaline phosphatase and lipase in duodenum, and the activity of alkaline phosphatase and trypsin in jejunum. In brief, CE improved the absorption and utilization of nitrogen, intestinal morphology and digestive enzymes activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCitrus 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3aabsorption 3aalbumins 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3achlortetracycline 3adiet 3aduodenum 3aileum 3ajejunum 3alandraces 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3athreonine 3atrypsin 3avilli1 aTian, Zhimei 1 aWang, Gang 1 aMa, Xianyong 1 aChen, Weidong 0 tAnimals.g2020 Jan. 10, v. 10, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani100101123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245008800182300001800270500001500288520096200303592002801265650001301293650001501306650001801321650001101339650003701350650001501387650001401402650006101416650001201477650001101489650001101500650002901511650005901540650000901599650002501608650003601633653001601669700002201685700002201707700001901729700002101748700002201769773011001791856008101901990002301982852000902005655001202014IND60090834520221119021856.0141102e20130901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009083452DNAL7 a238763392pmid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2013.06.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJose, Jiney10aStructure–activity relationships for ketamine esters as short-acting anaesthetics  ap. 5098-5106.  a2019-12-06  aA series of aliphatic esters of the non-opioid anaesthetic/analgesic ketamine were prepared and their properties as shorter-acting analogues of ketamine itself were explored in an infused rat model, measuring the time after infusion to recover from both the anaesthetic (righting reflex) and analgesic (response to stimulus) effects. The potency of the esters as sedatives was not significantly related to chain length, but Me, Et and i-Pr esters were the more dose potent (up to twofold less than ketamine), whereas n-Pr esters were less potent (from 2- to 6-fold less than ketamine). For the Me, Et and i-Pr esters recovery from anaesthesia was 10–15-fold faster than from ketamine itself, and for the n-Pr esters it was 20–25-fold faster than from ketamine.

A total of 1,374 lactating heifers from three dairy farms were examined in the present study; 22.64 % of heifers were positive for mastitis, out of which, 3.86 and 18.78 % were with HCM and HSCM, respectively. Of the 67 HCM samples, 91.05 % were single growth, 7.46 % mixed growth, and 1.49 % no bacterial growth. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) accounted for 30.98 % of the isolates followed by Escherichia coli (29.58 %), Staphylococcus aureus (16.9 %), and Streptococcus uberis (11.27 %). Logistic regression analyses showed that heifer milk yield lower than 3 L had the highest prevalence of HCM compared to heifer milk yield of more than 3 L (P < 0.01), and prevalence of HCM was significantly high in heifers with the presence of teat lesions (P < 0.01). Moreover, the heifer milk yield lower than 3 L had the highest prevalence of HSCM compared to heifer milk yield of more than 3 L (P < 0.01). These two factors were significantly associated with the occurrence of heifer mastitis, which needs to be considered in the prevention and control strategies of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus uberis 3abacteria 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3adairy farming 3aheifers 3alactation 3amastitis 3amicrobial growth 3amilk yield 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aChina1 aShen, Chen1 aHe, Bao Xiang1 aYang, Yuying,1 aGong, Da Chun1 aLi, Xiao Shan0 tTropical animal health and production.g2015 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.87-92dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-014-0689-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245011900204300001600323500001900339520154400358536021401902592002802116650003802144650001202182650002802194650001802222650001602240650001302256650001702269653003002286653002702316653001402343653001802357700002302375700005702398700002102455700001702476700002102493773012102514856008002635961001302715852000902728655001202737IND60722248620221118105310.0201230e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072224862DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175209352122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayeed, Md Abu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8354-205610aCharacterizing the total within-sample variation in cotton fiber length using the High Volume Instrument fibrogram  ap. 175-187.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWithin-sample variation in cotton fiber length is important when explaining variation in yarn quality. However, typical High Volume Instrument (HVI) length parameters, the Upper Half Mean Length (UHML) and Uniformity Index (UI), do not characterize the total within-sample variation in fiber length. HVI fiber length measurements are based on the fibrogram principle where the HVI generates a curve called a fibrogram and reports the UHML and UI. Our results, based on 19,628 commercial bales, reveal that the typical HVI length measurements do not characterize unique types of length variation. Fibrograms from a subset of 538 commercial samples suggest that the fibrograms capture additional within-sample variation in fiber length that is not being currently reported. Two additional sets of samples were then used to evaluate the importance of this additional length variation. Partial Least Square Regression models and leave-one-out cross-validation reveal that the HVI fibrogram explains yarn quality better than current HVI length parameters and is comparable with the Advanced Fiber Information System (AFIS) length distribution by number. The validation results show that the models built with the HVI fibrogram are better than models with the current HVI length parameters and at least as good as the AFIS length distribution by number when predicting yarn quality. Fiber length variation captured by the whole fibrogram could provide a new tool to breeders for selecting breeding lines and spinners for purchasing cotton bales.  aFunding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Cotton Incorporated (Grant No. 17-533).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadvanced fiber information system 3afabrics 3ahigh volume instruments 3aleast squares 3alint cotton 3aresearch 3ayarn quality 0afiber length distribution 0aHigh Volume Instrument 0afibrogram 0afiber quality1 aSchumann, Mithcell1 aWanjura, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5086-19471 aKelly, Brendan R1 aSmith, Wayne1 aHequet, Eric F.,0 tTextile research journal.g2021 Jan., v. 91, no. 1-2 p.175-187dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175209352123Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245014900171300001600320520143200336592002801768650002001796650000901816650001401825650001301839650001601852650001001868650002601878650001301904650001701917650001101934650001601945650001401961650001101975650001001986650002301996650001202019650001402031653001602045653002602061653001602087653001602103653002102119700002102140700001602161700002202177700001902199700002202218700002102240773008102261856008002342852000902422655001202431IND60519901620221122055959.0160513e20160325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051990162DNAL7 a10.1515/biolog-2016-00172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRašković, Božidar10aEffect of supplemental feeds on liver and intestine of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in semi-intensive rearing system: histological implications  ap. 212-219.  aIn order to determine effects of different types of supplementary feed on the histology of liver and intestine of carp reared in a semi-intensive system, a six-month field experiment was carried out. Carp yearlings were fed different supplemental feeds: cereals (CF), pelleted (PF) and extruded (EF) compound feeds. Hepatocytes histomorphometry revealed larger nuclear profile area of EF-fed fish compared to other two groups, while cytoplasmic profile area of the hepatocytes decreased in following sequence: CF > EF > PF. Lower nucleus/cytoplasm ratio was found in CF-fed fish compared to EF-and PF-fed fish. Striking, season dependant finding, was that regardless of the type of supplementary feed the number of lipid droplets in hepatocytes was highest in July and August, lipid depletion occurred in September and October, while glycogen was present in hepatocytes throughout the study. No size difference between groups was observed for enterocytes height, absorptive surface height and number of goblet cells in tunica mucosa, but a strong relationship between length of intestinal folds and fish weight was found. Histological analysis revealed a difference among three types of supplemental feed used in this field study: extruded or steam-pelleted feed induced better nutritional status of common carp in comparison to cereals. At the same time, histomorphometry indicated some differences between EF-and PF-fed fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3acarp 3acytoplasm 3adroplets 3aenterocytes 3afeeds 3afield experimentation 3aglycogen 3agoblet cells 3agrains 3ahepatocytes 3ahistology 3alipids 3aliver 3anutritional status 3arearing 3ayearlings 0acommon carp 0asupplementary feeding 0ahepatocytes 0aenterocytes 0ahistomorphometry1 aČirič, Miloš,1 aKoko, Vesna1 aStanković, Marko1 aživić, Ivana1 aMarković, Zoran,1 aPoleksić, Vesna0 tBiologia.g2016 Mar. 25, v. 71, no. 2 p.212-219dDe Gruyterx1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/biolog-2016-00173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04551naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245009100163300001400254520275800268592002803026650001703054650001503071650001403086650001503100650001803115650001503133650001403148650000903162650002503171650002503196650000903221650001503230650001403245650001503259650001303274650001103287650000903298650001303307650002903320650001903349650001203368650001703380650001803397650002303415651001603438653001603454653001403470653001503484653000903499653000903508653001603517653001103533653001703544700001603561700001203577700001303589700001603602700001503618700001703633773012103650856008503771852000903856655001203865IND60595743820221119194251.0180607e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059574382DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2017.14139592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSano, H12aA survey of dog and cat anaesthesia in a sample of veterinary practices in New Zealand  ap. 85-92.  aAIMS: To survey current anaesthesia practices for dogs and cats in small and mixed animal practices in New Zealand in order to improve anaesthesia education. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 440 small and mixed animal practices, including questions regarding the type of practice, preanaesthetic examination, anaesthetic drugs and management, anaesthetic machines, monitoring and topics of interest for continuing professional development. RESULTS: Responses were obtained from 113/440 (26%) practices, with 78 (69%) respondents from small and 35 (31%) from mixed animal practices. A preanaesthetic physical examination was carried out by >95% of respondents and premedication was usually given to dogs (112/113; 99%) and cats (95/113; 85%). Acepromazine was the preferred sedative for dogs and cats, with morphine or buprenorphine. Propofol and alfaxalone were the preferred induction agents, and isoflurane was preferred for maintenance in both dogs and cats. A venous catheter was usually placed for anaesthesia in dogs (59/113; 52%), but less so in cats (39/113; 35%). Perioperative fluid was administered at 10 mL/kg/hour by 62/110 (56%) respondents. Intubation was usually used for anaesthesia in dogs (111/112; 99%), and cats (87/112; 78%). Almost 40% of respondents usually administered supplementary oxygen if patients were not intubated. Local analgesia was used by 69/111 (88%) respondents sometimes or always if applicable. Morphine or buprenorphine, and meloxicam were common choices for post-operative analgesia after neuter surgery in dogs and cats. A semiclosed (non-rebreathing) system was used in animals weighing <10 kg, and a Mapleson E or F non-rebreathing circuit was used by 66/109 (61%) practices. Only 15/111 (14%) practices had a ventilator in their practice. A dedicated anaesthetist was usually used by 104/113 (92%) practices, and apnoea alarms, pulse oximeters, thermometers and oesophageal stethoscopes were the main monitoring devices available in practices. Loco-regional block, pain management, and anaesthetic drugs were the main topics of interest for continuing education. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Responses by the veterinarians taking part in this survey indicated that they had a reasonably good standard of anaesthetic practice. A physical examination was carried out preanaesthesia, and premedication including analgesia was routinely administered to most patients. A dedicated anaesthetist usually monitored patients and most respondents reported they had access to basic anaesthetic monitoring equipment. Areas where changes could lead to improved anaesthetic practice were increased use of I/V catheterisation, endotracheal intubation, and supplementary oxygen, and reduced I/V fluid rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacepromazine 3aalfaxalone 3aanalgesia 3aanesthesia 3abuprenorphine 3acastration 3acatheters 3acats 3aclinical examination 3acontinuing education 3adogs 3aisoflurane 3ameloxicam 3amonitoring 3amorphine 3aoxygen 3apain 3apatients 3aprofessional development 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 3athermometers 3aveterinarians 3aveterinary clinics 3aNew Zealand 0aAnaesthesia 0aanalgesia 0amonitoring 0adogs 0acats 0aNew Zealand 0asurvey 0aveterinarian1 aBarker, K.,1 aOdom, T1 aLewis, K1 aGiordano, P1 aWalsh, V.,1 aChambers, JP0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 66, no. 2 p.85-92dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2017.14139593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245011000162300001200272520141000284592002801694650001101722650001001733650002501743650001901768650001401787650001301801700002001814700001901834700001901853700001901872773010901891856007902000852000902079655001202088IND60749259620221119030703.0210901e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074925962DNAL7 a10.1186/1743-422X-7-3612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsorio, Lyda10aComparison of the diagnostic accuracy of commercial NS1-based diagnostic tests for early dengue infection  ap. 361.  aBACKGROUND: We compared the diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility of commercially available NS1-based dengue tests and explored factors influencing their sensitivities. METHODS: Paired analysis of 310 samples previously characterized as positive (n = 218) and negative (n = 92) for viral isolation and/or RT-PCR and/or IgM seroconversion. Masked samples were tested by two observers with Platelia™ Dengue NS1 Ag, second generation Pan-E™ Dengue Early ELISA, SD Dengue NS1 Ag ELISA, Dengue NS1 Ag STRIP™, and SD BIOLINE™ Dengue Duo (NS1/IgM/IgG). RESULTS: SD BIOLINE™ NS1/IgM/IgG had the highest sensitivity (80.7% 95%CI 75-85.7) with likelihood ratios of 7.4 (95%CI 4.1-13.8) and 0.21 (95%CI 0.16-0.28). The ELISA-format tests showed comparable sensitivities; all below 75%. STRIP™ and SD NS1 had even lower sensitivities (<65%). The sensitivities significantly decreased in samples taken after 3 days of fever onset, in secondary infections, viral serotypes 2 and 4, and severe dengue. Adding IgM or IgG to SD NS1 increased its sensitivity in all these situations. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous detection of NS1/IgM/IgG would be potentially useful for dengue diagnosis in both endemic and non endemic areas. A negative result does not rule out dengue. Further studies are required to assess the performance and impact of early laboratory diagnosis of dengue in the routine clinical setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3adengue 3afever 3alaboratory diagnosis 3aseroconversion 3aserotypes 3avirology1 aRamirez, Meleny1 aBonelo, Anilza1 aVillar, Luis A1 aParra, Beatriz0 tVirology journal.g2010 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.361-361dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001738x1743-422X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1743-422X-7-3613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03035naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245010600168300001600274520178100290592002802071650001402099650002902113650001302142650002402155650001002179650001502189650001302204650001402217650002202231651001202253653002302265653001502288653002402303653002402327653001602351653002702367700002102394773010402415856008502519852000902604655001202613IND60543612120221120180834.0190411e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054361212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2014.07.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarwick, R.M.10aAssessing the conservation status of marine habitats: thoughts from a sandflat on the Isles of Scilly  ap. 109-119.  aStatutory monitoring of the fauna of the ‘mudflats and sandflats not covered by seawater at low tide’ biotope complex on St Martin's Flats, a part of the Isles of Scilly Complex Special Area of Conservation, was undertaken in 2000, 2004 and 2009. The targets set by Natural England for “characteristic biotopes” were that “composite species, abundance and diversity should not deviate significantly from an established baseline, subject to natural change”. The three specified biotopes could not be distinguished, and instead three assemblages were subjectively defined based on sediment surface features. There were statistically significant natural changes in diversity and species composition between years, especially in the association initially characterised by the razor-clam Ensis, and possible reasons for this are discussed. It is suggested that setting fixed local limits on natural variability is almost always impractical. Two possible approaches to distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic changes are suggested; a change in ecological condition as indicated by AMBI scores, and a significant change in average taxonomic distinctness (Δ+) compared with expectation. The determination of species biomasses as well as abundances might also open more possibilities for assessment. The practice of setting objectives for a marine Special Area of Conservation (SAC) feature that include the range and number of biotopes cannot be supported, in view of the difficulty in ascribing assemblages to recognised biotopes. A more realistic definition of species assemblages might best be gained from examination of the species that consistently make a substantial contribution to the Bray–Curtis similarity among samples collected from specific sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVeneroida 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiotopes 3aconservation status 3afauna 3amonitoring 3aseawater 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3aEngland 0aBiotope Definition 0aMonitoring 0aSpecies Composition 0aNatural Variability 0aAMBI Scores 0aTaxonomic Distinctness1 aSomerfield, P.J.0 tJournal of sea research.g2015 Apr., v. 98 p.109-119dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2014.07.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100001900182245013500201300001800336506007600354520155600430592002801986506003702014650001502051650002502066650002602091650001602117650001602133650001002149650002402159650001402183650002102197650001502218650001902233650002602252650002002278700001902298700002402317700002802341773012202369856007502491852000902566655001202575IND60128164920221207102412.0150501e20150315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012816492DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.02496-142doi7 aPMC43363452pmcid7 a255839742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeung, Vincent14aThe Formation of Streptococcus mutans Persisters Induced by the Quorum-Sensing Peptide Pheromone Is Affected by the LexA Regulator  ap. 1083-1094.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe presence of multidrug-tolerant persister cells within microbial populations has been implicated in the resiliency of bacterial survival against antibiotic treatments and is a major contributing factor in chronic infections. The mechanisms by which these phenotypic variants are formed have been linked to stress response pathways in various bacterial species, but many of these mechanisms remain unclear. We have previously shown that in the cariogenic organism Streptococcus mutans , the quorum-sensing peptide CSP (competence-stimulating peptide) pheromone was a stress-inducible alarmone that triggered an increased formation of multidrug-tolerant persisters. In this study, we characterized SMU.2027, a CSP-inducible gene encoding a LexA ortholog. We showed that in addition to exogenous CSP exposure, stressors, including heat shock, oxidative stress, and ofloxacin antibiotic, were capable of triggering expression of lexA in an autoregulatory manner akin to that of LexA-like transcriptional regulators. We demonstrated the role of LexA and its importance in regulating tolerance toward DNA damage in a noncanonical SOS mechanism. We showed its involvement and regulatory role in the formation of persisters induced by the CSP-ComDE quorum-sensing regulatory system. We further identified key genes involved in sugar and amino acid metabolism, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) system, and autolysin from transcriptomic analyses that contribute to the formation of quorum-sensing-induced persister cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aamino acid metabolism 3aantibiotics 3agametolysin 3agenes 3aheat shock response 3aofloxacin 3aoxidative stress 3apheromones 3aquorum sensing 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptomics1 aAjdic, Dragana1 aKoyanagi, Stephanie1 aLéévesque, Céline M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 197, no. 6 p.1083-1094dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0021-91937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JB.02496-143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04460naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016600168300001500334520271900349536021203068592002803280596003703308650002603345650002203371650002003393650001503413650000903428650001803437650001603455650002903471650001703500650001203517650001003529650001703539650000903556650001503565650000903580650002003589653001303609653002003622653001203642653002403654653001503678700001803693700001503711773012203726856008503848852000903933655001203942IND60595743920221119194102.0180607e20180304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059574392DNAL7 a10.1080/00480169.2017.14166922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDougall, S10aAntimicrobial usage and risk of retreatment for mild to moderate clinical mastitis cases on dairy farms following on-farm bacterial culture and selective therapy  ap. 98-107.  aAIMS: To assess antimicrobial usage for treatment of mild to moderate clinical mastitis, and risk of retreatment, following implementation of an on-farm bacterial culture system and selective therapy based on culture results, and to assess compliance with treatment decision tree protocols and the level of agreement between results from on-farm culture and laboratory-based microbiology methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herdowners from seven dairy herds were asked to collect milk samples from cases of mild to moderate clinical mastitis between July 2015 and May 2016. All samples were cultured on-farm using a commercially available selective media and were also submitted for laboratory-based culture. Within sequential pairs of cows with mastitis, half were assigned to be treated without regard to culture results (Blanket group), and half were treated based on the on-farm culture results (Selective group) according to decision tree diagrams provided to the farmers. Culture results, treatments, and retreatments for clinical mastitis were recorded. The sum of the daily doses of antimicrobials used per cow, the number of retreatments and interval to first retreatment were compared between treatment groups. RESULTS: The geometric mean sum of daily doses for quarters assigned to the Selective (1.72 (95% CI=1.55–1.90)) group was lower than for the Blanket (2.38 (95% CI=2.17–2.60)) group (p=0.005). The percentage of cows retreated for clinical mastitis did not differ between the Selective (21.7 (95% CI=10.5–25.9)%) and Blanket (26.1 (95% CI=20.9–31.3)%) groups (p=0.13), and there was no difference between groups in the hazard that cows would be retreated within 60 days of enrolment (hazard ratio=0.82 (95% CI=0.39–1.69); p=0.59). Compliance with the treatment protocols was higher amongst quarters assigned to the Selective (199/233; 85.4%) compared with the Blanket (171/249; 68.7%) group (p<0.001), and varied between farms from 64–94%. The overall agreement between results from on-farm and laboratory culture was 188/331 (56.9%; kappa=0.31; p<0.001), but varied between farms from 44.7–88.2% (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Use of on-farm culture with selective antimicrobial therapy resulted in approximately 25% lower antimicrobial usage, but was not associated with an increase in the proportion of cows retreated for clinical mastitis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study has demonstrated that on-farm culture and selective therapy based on culture results can be implemented on-farm. However, farms varied in their implementation of both the treatment protocols and microbiology procedures. Where such systems are to be used on-farm, specific training and on-going monitoring is required.  aThis study was funded by the Sustainable Farming Fund from the Ministry for Primary Industries (project number 401530) and the Society of Dairy Cattle Veterinarians of the New Zealand Veterinary Association.  aPublisher supplied data  a401530cSustainable Farming Fund 3aanti-infective agents 3abacterial culture 3abovine mastitis 3acompliance 3acows 3adairy farming 3adairy herds 3adecision support systems 3adrug therapy 3afarmers 3afarms 3amicrobiology 3amilk 3amonitoring 3arisk 3aselective media 0aMastitis 0aon-farm culture 0atherapy 0aantimicrobial usage 0adairy cows1 aNiethammer, J1 aGraham, EM0 tNew Zealand veterinary journal.g2018 Mar. 4, v. 66, no. 2 p.98-107dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12298x1176-07107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00480169.2017.14166923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03258naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245014100176300001800317520162700335592002801962650001301990650001702003650001802020650001002038650002002048650002302068650004302091650001302134650004302147650001802190650001502208650003602223653002702259653002302286653003102309653002302340653002302363700001602386700001602402700002302418700002002441700001802461700001802479700001702497700001602514700002002530773007902550856009002629852000902719655001202728IND60090487720221119234323.0161019e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009048772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Ding-Yuan10aThree-dimensional cell aggregates composed of HUVECs and cbMSCs for therapeutic neovascularization in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia  ap. 1995-2004.  aThe proximity of cells in three-dimensional (3D) organization maximizes the cell–cell communication and signaling that are critical for cell function. In this study, 3D cell aggregates composed of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and cord-blood mesenchymal stem cells (cbMSCs) were used for therapeutic neovascularization to rescue tissues from critical limb ischemia. Within the cell aggregates, homogeneously mixed HUVECs and cbMSCs had direct cell–cell contact with expressions of endogenous extracellular matrices and adhesion molecules. Although dissociated HUVECs/cbMSCs initially formed tubular structures on Matrigel, the grown tubular network substantially regressed over time. Conversely, 3D HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates seeded on Matrigel exhibited an extensive tubular network that continued to expand without regression. Immunostaining experiments show that, by differentiating into smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineages, the cbMSCs stabilize the HUVEC-derived tubular network. The real-time PCR analysis results suggest that, through myocardin, TGF-β signaling regulates the differentiation of cbMSCs into SMCs. Transplantation of 3D HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates recovered blood perfusion in a mouse model of hindlimb ischemia more effectively compared to their dissociated counterparts. The experimental results confirm that the transplanted 3D HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates enhanced functional vessel formation within the ischemic limb and protected it from degeneration. The 3D HUVEC/cbMSC aggregates can therefore facilitate the cell-based therapeutic strategies for modulating postnatal neovascularization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3ablood 3acell aggregates 3acell communication 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3aischemia 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asmooth muscle 3astem cells 3atransforming growth factor beta 0aCritical limb ischemia 0aCell-based therapy 0aThermo-responsive hydrogel 0aNeovascularization 0aTissue engineering1 aWei, Hao-Ji1 aLin, Kun-Ju1 aHuang, Chieh-Cheng1 aWang, Chung-Chi1 aWu, Cheng-Tse1 aChao, Ko-Ting1 aChen, Ko-Jie1 aZhang, Yan,1 aSung, Hsing-Wen0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Mar., v. 34 p.1995-2004dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.11.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03437naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014000171300001300311500001500324520204000339592002802379650003702407650001502444650001902459650000802478650001302486650002402499650002002523650001702543653002102560653003702581653003002618653002502648653001402673653001902687700001602706700001302722700001502735700001502750700001702765773010202782856008602884852000902970655001202979IND60629716120221121120824.0190322e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062971612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zhongbin10aLinking saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability to the characteristics of biopores derived from X-ray computed tomography  ap. 1-10.  a2019-12-06  aThe different types of soil macropores (e.g., biopores and non-biopores) vary in the conductivity of water or air due to the difference in the 3D pore characteristics. The objectives of this study were to reveal which types of macropores and which macropore characteristics played the most important roles in regulating water or air flow. Intact soil columns sampled from the subsoil of a long-term fertilization experiment were scanned by medical X-ray computed tomography (CT), and subsequently, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) and air permeability at −12 cm water potential (Ka12) were measured. The 3D characteristics of macropores were then analyzed with image analysis. The biopores and the percolating biopores that connected the top and the bottom of a soil column were separated for the biopore-dominated samples (with percolating biopores) and their 3D characteristics were also quantified. Our results showed that the mean macropore diameter of the limiting layer (MDLL) presented the best relationships with Ks and Ka12 compared with the other macropore characteristics for all the samples. The biopores and percolating biopores contributed 27.8–74.5% and 3.26–64.4% of the volume of total macropores, respectively, for the biopore-dominated samples. The hydraulic radius, mean diameter, compactness, global and local connectivities, and MDLL of biopores, especially those of percolating biopores, were generally larger than those of total macropores. The global connectivity (Γ) of biopores performed very well for estimating Ks and Ka12. The MDLL of percolating biopores could predict Ks much better than the MDLL of biopores and total macropores. Moreover, the performance of MDLL for estimating Ka12 was as good as the MDLL of biopores but was much better than the MDLL of total macropores. The findings of this study reveal that the MDLL is a more useful parameter in estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability at low water potential than the other CT-derived pore characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3amacropores 3aimage analysis 3aair 3aair flow 3acomputed tomography 3awater potential 3apermeability 0aAir permeability 0aSaturated hydraulic conductivity 0aMacropore characteristics 0aPercolating biopores 0ahydrology 0aSoil structure1 aLiu, Kailou1 aZhou, Hu1 aLin, Henry1 aLi, Daming1 aPeng, Xinhua0 tJournal of hydrology.g2019 Apr., v. 571 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006000146245012900206300001400335500001900349520166100368536012002029592002802149650001202177650001302189650001202202650001202214650001102226650001302237653003702250653002602287653002402313653001402337653001602351653001902367700002302386773011902409856008002528852000902608655001202617IND60722248720221118105334.0201230e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072224872DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175209355342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Shuhei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6611-281210aModeling perceptions using common impressions: Perceptual “authenticity,” “luxury,” and “quaintness” for leather  ap. 73-86.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGenuine leather has numerous applications, such as car interiors and clothing, owing to its excellent quality. However, due to the high cost of genuine leather, animal rights issues, and environmental effects of leather processing, artificial leather has increasingly replaced genuine leather. The materials and processing methods used for artificial and genuine leathers are different, resulting in a variety of impressions and shitsukan, that is, the sense of quality of the object. In this study, we focused on the perceptual “authenticity,” “luxury,” and “quaintness,” which are important components needed to achieve the shitsukan of leather used in various products and examined the quantification of qualitative shitsukan using a perception model. We hypothesized that shitsukan can be recognized from the common potential impressions perceived from the properties of a material. Therefore, we developed a method for evaluating shitsukan using representative words for impressions that we perceive in objects and measured their image properties. The physical and psychophysical properties were obtained using several measurements. Multi-angle measuring devices were developed for the measurement experiments. Moreover, several subjective evaluation experiments were conducted to estimate the representative impressions that were potentially perceived in leather. Subsequently, we estimated two independent impressions, “surface shape” and “impression of stateliness” from the properties of leather. In addition, “authenticity,” “luxury,” and “quaintness,” were quantified using simple equations basis the impressions.  aFunding The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aclothing 3afabrics 3aleather 3amodels 3aresearch 0ahuman sensory and comfort issues 0amanagement of leather 0amaterial appearance 0amaterials 0ameasurement 0aproduct design1 aHoriuchi, Takahiko0 tTextile research journal.g2021 Jan., v. 91, no. 1-2 p.73-86dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175209355343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245016100176300001600337520162600353592002801979650001502007650001102022650002102033650001602054650001102070650000902081650000902090650002502099650001502124650001402139650001502153650001102168650002002179650002002199650002302219650001202242651001402254651001502268653002002283653002302303653001902326653002502345653002002370653001702390700002802407700004302435700002002478773010402498856008502602852000902687655001202696IND60543612220221120180823.0190411e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054361222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2014.07.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDromard, Charlotte R.10aDiversity of trophic niches among herbivorous fishes on a Caribbean reef (Guadeloupe, Lesser Antilles), evidenced by stable isotope and gut content analyses  ap. 124-131.  aWhile herbivorous fishes have been widely studied due to the major ecological role they play on coral reefs, the description of their trophic niche remains challenging. In this study, we asked how 10 species of parrotfishes and surgeonfishes partition trophic resources on a Caribbean reef. The determination of trophic niches was conducted using gut and stomach content and stable isotope analyses (15N:14N and 13C:12C ratios). The contributions of food source to fish diet were calculated with concentration-dependent mixing models. Stomach content analyses distinguished two species of Acanthuridae from other fish species: Acanthurus coeruleus due to its high ingestion of fleshy macroalgae and Acanthurus chirurgus due to its high ingestion of calcified macroalgae. Acanthuridae and Sparisoma aurofrenatum presented similar diets in terms of assimilation of food resources with a high contribution of detritus and invertebrates to their diets. The diets of Sparisoma rubripinne and Sparisoma chrysopterum were more heterogeneous by comparison to the previous species. Scarus iseri, Scarus vetula, Scarus taeniopterus and Sparisoma viride appeared to share a similar trophic niche characterized by the contribution of live coral and fleshy macroalgae to their diet. The resource use among herbivorous fishes was partially related to the nutritional quality of food sources, but also to their physical structure and the capacity of fish to process them efficiently.

Filtration through a series of membranes with different pore sizes separated GGMs of different molar masses, from polymers to oligomers. Only polysaccharides were precipitated in ethanol–water. With the optimal water content of 5–15%, the precipitated amount was about 6% on wood basis. The average molar mass of the precipitated polysaccharides was 10–12kDa with a molar mass range of 4–20kDa. GGMs comprised about 80% of the precipitated hemicelluloses. Other precipitated polysaccharides were mainly arabinoglucuronoxylans and pectins (rhamnogalacturonans). Analysis of a lignin-free, ethanol-precipitated GGM preparation by 13C NMR spectroscopy verified that it was structurally almost identical with a GGM-rich ethanol precipitate obtained from spruce wood by extraction at much milder conditions, 90°C for 60min.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethanol 3afiltration 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apectins 3apolymers 3awater content 3awood 3awood extractives 2aChemical Precipitation 2aEthanolxchemistry 2aFiltration 2aLigninxanalysis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMannansxisolation & purification 2aMembranes, Artificial 2aMonosaccharidesxanalysis 2aPiceaxchemistry 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aPolysaccharidesxisolation & purification 2aWoodxchemistry 0aGalactoglucomannan 0aHot-water extraction 0aMembrane filtration 0aPrecipitation 0aSpruce wood1 aPranovich, Andrey1 aHolmbom, Bjarne0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Feb., v. 130 p.198-203dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.11.1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03539naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008500171300001600256520167400272592002801946650000901974650001601983650001301999650001202012650001702024650001202041650001202053650001302065650001302078650001802091650001602109650001702125650001202142650001802154650001002172650000702182650002302189650002002212650001102232650001102243650001202254650002302266650002002289650001902309650001802328650001602346653002902362653001602391653001302407653002302420653002402443653002802467700002302495700002402518700001902542700002102561700006502582700002202647773010102669856008602770852000902856655001202865IND60633384620221122045758.0190410e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063338462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMardani, Marieh10aStudy on foaming, rheological and thermal properties of gelatin-free marshmallow  ap. 335-341.  aMarshmallow is an aerated confectionery product, which consists mainly of gelatin, sugar solutions, glucose syrup and a foaming agent such as egg albumin. Gelatin is generally used as a foaming and gelling agent, but due to its limitations for consumption, many attempts have been made to use hydrocolloids as replacements. In this research, xanthan and guar gum, were added to formulations with the xanthan (x): guar (g) ratios of 100:0, 25:75, 50:50 and 75:25 and a control sample containing only gelatin (G). Analysis of °Brix and moisture content, pH, water activity (aw), density, overrun, texture, thermal, rheological and sensory properties were carried out. According to the results, density, aw and moisture content of the sample containing x25/g75, revealed no significant difference with the sample containing gelatin (p > 0.05). Texture results showed that x25/g75 sample led to a hardness similar to the control. The formulation containing x25/g75, had thermal behavior closer to the control, which exhibited “melt in mouth” behavior, gel strength and functionality properties similar to the control. Positive correlation was also observed between the hardness, melting temperature, and enthalpy. The study of viscoelastic properties showed that the values of storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G″) were dependent on frequency and the G′ were always higher than G″ in all samples. Also, considering the desirable sensory properties of the samples, xanthan/guar with a ratio of 25:75 (x25/g75) having positive interaction with other ingredients can be suggested as good alternative for gelatin in production of gelatin-free marshmallow.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrix 3aegg albumen 3aenthalpy 3afoaming 3agel strength 3agelatin 3aglucose 3aguar gum 3ahardness 3ahydrocolloids 3aingredients 3aloss modulus 3amelting 3amelting point 3amouth 3apH 3asensory properties 3astorage modulus 3asweets 3asyrups 3atexture 3athermal properties 3aviscoelasticity 3awater activity 3awater content 3axanthan gum 0aGelatin-free marshmallow 0aXanthan gum 0aGuar gum 0aThermal properties 0aTextural properties 0aViscoelastic properties1 aYeganehzad, Samira1 aPtichkina, Nataliia1 aKodatsky, Yury1 aKliukina, Oksana1 aNepovinnykh, Nataliia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2923-92021 aNaji-Tabasi, Sara0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Aug., v. 93 p.335-341dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245012600166520158500292592002801877650002201905650002101927650002001948650001101968650001701979650003001996650002102026650002302047650002202070650002802092650001802120650001402138700002302152700001702175700002002192700001802212700002802230700002302258700002702281700001802308700002202326700002102348773012602369856007902495852000902574655001202583IND60763377020221119102440.0220120e20211222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076337702DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110100102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPonchia, Rosetta 10aOxidative Stress Measurement in Frozen/Thawed Human Sperm: The Protective Role of an In Vitro Treatment with Myo-Inositol  aDespite its widespread use, sperm cryopreservation induces serious detrimental alterations in sperm function; indeed, it is commonly associated with decreased sperm viability and motility, and DNA fragmentation. Mechanisms of human sperm cryodamage are thought to be multifactorial, but oxidative stress seems to have a prominent role. A huge amount of data supported the cryoprotective effect of different antioxidants able to minimize the detrimental effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improve the quality of spermatozoa. Among others, myo-inositol is one of the most powerful and has been reported to be effective in improving sperm quality and motility when used both in vivo and in vitro. This study aimed to determine the in vitro impact of myo-inositol in ameliorating sperm oxidative status during sperm cryopreservation. In particular, we demonstrated a significant improvement of sperm parameters (vitality and motility) when myo-inositol was added after sperm thawing (p < 0.05). Moreover, we showed that myo-inositol induces a significant increase in oxygen consumption, the main index of oxidative phosphorylation efficiency and ATP production. Finally, by means of 2D-electrophoresis, we demonstrated a significant decrease in the level of carbonyl groups, the main structural changes occurring in conditions of oxidative stress (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the sperm cryopreservation procedure we developed, assuring the reduction of ROS-induced sperm modifications, may improve the in vitro procedure currently used in ART laboratory for sperm cryostorage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA fragmentation 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3ahumans 3amyo-inositol 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen consumption 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3asperm quality 3aviability1 aBruno, Annunziata 1 aRenzi, Asia 1 aLandi, Claudia 1 aShaba, Enxhi 1 aLuongo, Francesca Paola1 aHaxhiu, Alesandro 1 aArtini, Paolo Giovanni1 aLuddi, Alice 1 aGovernini, Laura 1 aPiomboni, Paola 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Dec. 22, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110100103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245016700173300001800340520135900358536031301717592002802030596002202058650001902080650002202099650001402121650001202135650001902147650001502166650001802181650001102199650001402210650002202224650002802246650001102274700002302285700003202308700002502340700002702365700001902392700002802411773012002439856008602559852000902645655001202654IND60753559420221120163945.0211015e20211126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075355942DNAL7 a10.1080/01635581.2020.18193502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaokaen, Palakorn10aCordycepin-loaded Nanoparticles from Cassava Starch Promote the Proliferation of Submandibular Gland Cells and Inhibit the Growth of Oral Squamous Carcinoma Cells  ap. 2014-2029.  aThis study examined associations between the effect of treatment with nano-cassava starch that contained cordycepin (CS) extract, targeting human submandibular gland cells (HSGs), and human oral squamous carcinoma cells (HSC-4). Cassava starch nanoparticles (CSNPs) were prepared by either physical or acid treatment. These nanoparticles were then loaded with either CS or cordyceps medium and then treated with HSG or HSC-4 cells in different concentrations of CS and nanoparticles. Moreover, the protein secretion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity and the expression of salivary-specific genes, antioxidant gene were determined after treatment. CSNPs can enhance the activity of CS at low concentrations. Cordycepin-loaded cassava starch nanoparticles (CCSNPs) increased HSG proliferation, protein secretion, and the expression of salivary-specific genes, AMY and AQP5. Besides, CCSNPs also protected and scavenged of ROS via the stimulation of the antioxidant genes in HSGs, indicating the protective roles of CS to HSGs. On the other hand, CCSNPs inhibited the growth of HSC-4 cells by stimulating ROS generation and reducing protein secretion. This finding suggested that CCSNPs presented the dual actions against HSGs and human oral squamous carcinoma cells, and the encapsulation of CS with cassava nanoparticles enhanced the activity of CS.  aThis work was supported by the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT), Suranaree University of Technology granted to the School of Geriatric Oral Health, Institute of Dentistry under grant number SUT9-906-62-36-01, and by the Office of the Higher Education Commission under the NRU Project of Thailand.  aPublisher supplied data  aSUT9-906-62-36-01 3aacid treatment 3aantioxidant genes 3acarcinoma 3acassava 3acassava starch 3acordycepin 3aencapsulation 3ahumans 3anutrition 3aprotein secretion 3areactive oxygen species 3astarch1 aJaiboonma, Atchara1 aChaicharoenaudomrung, Nipha1 aKunhorm, Phongsakorn1 aJanebodin, Kajohnkiart1 aNoisa, Parinya1 aJitprasertwong, Paiboon0 tNutrition and cancer.g2021 Nov. 26, v. 73, no. 10 p.2014-2029dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl11654x1532-79147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01635581.2020.18193503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03492naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245008900176300002000265520121400285592002801499650001701527650001001544650001201554650002501566650001701591650001101608650001501619650001501634650001801649650000901667650001801676650002101694650002001715650001401735650000901749650000901758650002901767650004401796650003901840650001701879650003501896650004001931650001801971650002001989650004802009650004302057650004202100650002602142650004502168650002102213653002502234653003102259653001802290653001702308653002202325700002802347700002502375700002202400700001402422700001702436700001602453700002702469700003102496773013502527852000902662856007502671655001202746IND4475948720221118203906.0160905e20131127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447594872DNAL7 a241882812pmid7 a10.1021/jf404046v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRico, Cyren M.,10aEffect of Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles on the Quality of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Grains  ap. 11278-11285.  aDespite the remarkable number of publications on the interaction of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) with plants, knowledge of the implications of ENPs in the nutritional value of food crops is still limited. This research was performed to study the quality of rice grains harvested from plants grown in soil treated with cerium oxide nanoparticles (nCeO₂). Three rice varieties (high, medium, and low amylose) were cultivated to full maturity in soil amended with nCeO₂ at 0 and 500 mg kg–¹ soil. Ce accumulation, nutrient content, antioxidant property, and nutritional quality of the rice grains were evaluated. Results showed that rice grains from nCeO₂-treated plants had less Fe, S, prolamin, glutelin, lauric and valeric acids, and starch. Moreover, the nCeO₂ reduced in grains all antioxidant values, except flavonoids. Medium- and low-amylose varieties accumulated more Ce in grains than the high-amylose variety, but the grain quality of the medium-amylose variety showed higher sensitivity to the nCeO₂ treatment.

We study likelihood‐based estimation of the model parameters with and without controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, estimation of the mean and median willingness to pay, and specification tests. These statistical procedures are implemented using a data set. In this application we find that a parametric model is rejected in favor of our semiparametric model, that the heterogeneity can be adequately controlled using a simple density, and that the semiparametric model offers more robust mean willingness to pay estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3acontingent valuation 3adata collection 3amodels 3astatistical inference 3awillingness to pay0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2000 Aug., v. 82, no. 3 p.487-500dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0002-9092.000413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006100172300001600233520130700249592002801556650001301584650001301597650001201610650001401622650001301636650001501649650001801664650001501682650002001697650001101717650001301728650001601741653001001757653001501767653001701782653001501799653001701814653001001831700002101841700001701862700001901879700002001898773009601918856008502014852000902099655001202108IND60600695420221119140630.0220929e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060069542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2014.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalihan, Lenny B.10aBlended ionic liquid systems for macroalgae pretreatment  ap. 596-604.  aA novel ionic liquid (IL) blend system, consisted of a solvent IL for biomass dissolution and an acidic IL for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the released polysaccharides into simple sugars, was developed for the pretreatment of macroalgae Gelidium amansii. Acidic ILs with varying Hammett acidities were screened; among which, 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate was found most suitable as it provided the highest sugar yields with lowest propensity to degrade the produced sugars. On the other hand, 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride was found the most effective solvent IL for G. amansii. A compositional balance between the solvent IL and AIL was found critical to achieve the highest sugar yields. Interestingly, it was notable that the macroalgae was more efficiently dissolved in the selected IL blend than in the most effective pure solvent IL. Pretreatments can be accomplished under atmospheric environment but temperature control and timely reaction termination were both important in order to maximize the sugar yields and minimize the subsequent sugar degradation. Overall, the developed IL blend system proved to be viable for the pretreatment of macroalgae, an abundant renewable resource of fermentable sugars as valuable precursors for biofuel or biochemical production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGelidium 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3achlorides 3ahydrogen 3ahydrolysis 3aionic liquids 3amacroalgae 3apolysaccharides 3asugars 3asulfates 3atemperature 0aBlend 0aHydrolysis 0aIonic liquid 0aMacroalgae 0aPretreatment 0aSugar1 aNisola, Grace M.1 aMittal, Neha1 aSeo, Jeong Gil1 aChung, Wook-Jin0 tRenewable energy.g2014 June, v. 66 p.596-604dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2014.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100003100145245008600176300001600262500002000278520066100298592002800959650002000987650002701007650001101034650002001045650001001065650002301075650001201098650001901110650001101129650002601140650001501166650001001181650002301191650000901214773014301223856007901366852000901445655001201454IND60680417820221120075812.0200105e200008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068041782DNAL7 a10.1111/0002-9092.000452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaphores, Jean‐Daniel M.14aThe Economic Threshold with a Stochastic Pest Population: A Real Options Approach  ap. 541-555.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aUsing real options,this paper formulates an optimal stopping model for applying pest control measures when the density of a pest population varies randomly. A delay between successive pesticide applications is introduced to analyze the farmer's expected marginal cost of reentry. This model is applied to the control of a foliar pest of apples via a pesticide, and is solved numerically. A sensitivity analysis shows that the pest density that should trigger pesticide use can vary significantly with the pest density volatility. Incorporating pest randomness into simple decision rules may thus help better manage the chemicals applied to soils and crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalus domestica 3aagricultural economics 3aapples 3acontrol methods 3acrops 3aeconomic threshold 3afarmers 3ainsect control 3amodels 3apesticide application 3apesticides 3apests 3apopulation density 3asoil0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2000 Aug., v. 82, no. 3 p.541-555dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0002-9092.000453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245013600165300001400301520152700315592002801842650001901870650002801889650002001917650002301937650001601960650001301976650001801989650001102007650001802018650001202036650001002048650001502058700001802073773014602091856007902237852000902316655001202325IND60764826920221120105240.0220409e20180528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076482692DNAL7 a10.17221/17/2017-cjgpb2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvrenosoğlu, Y.10aEvaluation of pear (Pyrus communis L.) hybrid combinations for the transmission of fire blight resistance and fruit characteristics  ap. 78-85.  aFire blight is one of the most destructive diseases of pome fruits, especially pears. In current conditions when the demand for organic products is increasing, improvement of resistant rootstock and varieties is becoming important due to the lack of an effective disease management method against fire blight caused by Erwinia amy-lovora as well as the harmful effects of chemicals on environment, human and animal health. The findings of the researchers as to which variety performs well in terms of the transmission of fire blight resistance are quite important for new breeding programs. In the study, three varieties with high commercial value (Magness, Santa Maria and Williams) were identified as the maternal parents and 21 hybridization combinations were made with seven varieties (Akça, Ankara, Conference, Güz, Kaiser Alexandre, Kieffer and Taş) as pollinators. The Magness maternal parent was found superior when compared with the other maternal parents for the variety susceptibility level to fire blight. Apart from the differences in the susceptibility level of 21 different combinations of hybrids to fire blight, the commercially superior ten hybrids (I-15-24, II-13-1, II-13-19, II-13-34, II-13-73, II-27-21, II-27-55, II -32-44, III-22-638, III-27-590) have been determined via the weighted ranking method from the parameters of disease resistance and different fruit characteristics measuring the commercial preference of the fruits such as fruit quality, attractiveness, size, firmness and rustiness  aPublisher supplied data 3aPyrus communis 3aanimal and human health 3adisease control 3adisease resistance 3afire blight 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruits 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3apears 3arootstocks1 aMertoğlu, K.0 tCzech journal of genetics and plant breeding.g, v. 54, no. 2 p.78-85dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:12179x1212-19757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/17/2017-cjgpb3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005600140245014400196300001800340500002000358520132500378592002801703596005901731596007601790596007601866596006201942650002502004650002402029650001702053650001402070650001602084650001702100650002802117650001802145650004302163650002302206650001502229650000902244650001802253650001202271650001702283650000902300650001002309650002002319700001602339700001702355700005702372700001802429700005202447700001602499700001502515773015302530856007402683852000902757655001202766IND60672592020221122015410.0191017e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067259202DNAL7 a10.1111/ijfs.142172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Dongxiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1928-081014aThe effect of simulated digestion on the composition of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities in lychee pulp of different cultivars  ap. 3042-3050.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSimulated gastric fluid (SGF) and intestinal fluid (SIF) digestion were used to evaluate the effects of digestion on the composition of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacities of the pulp of six lychee cultivars. Caffeic acid, ferulic acid, procyanidin B2, epicatechin, A‐type procyanidin trimer, procyanidin A2, quercetin‐3‐rutinose‐7‐rhamnoside, rutin and isoquercitrin were quantified using HPLC‐DAD. Lychee pulp had high concentrations of procyanidin B2 (0.30~15.53 mg g⁻¹), procyanidin A2 (0.29~0.52 mg g⁻¹) and quercetin‐3‐rutinose‐7‐rhamnoside (0.16~0.45 mg g⁻¹). SGF and SIF Digestion, which significantly decreased the concentration of procyanidin B2, epicatechin and quercetin‐3‐rutinose‐7‐rhamnoside. But observably increased the concentration of procyanidin A2. Compared with deionized water treatment (DW), the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) of different lychee pulps significantly increased after SGF and SIF digestion. After SGF digestion, the ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of lychee pulps increased while the ABTS+ free radical scavenging ability (ABTS) had a slight decline. This shows that simulated digestion improves the bioactive component and antioxidant activity of different varieties of lychee pulp.  aPublisher supplied data  a31601469cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aKF2018002cZhejiang Provincial Top Discipline of Biological Engineering  aKF2015004cZhejiang Provincial Top Discipline of Biological Engineering  a201604020089cScience and Technology Program of Guangzhou 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acaffeic acid 3acultivars 3aepicatechin 3aferulic acid 3afree radical scavengers 3agastric juice 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ain vitro digestion 3aintestines 3airon 3aisoquercitrin 3alitchis 3aprocyanidins 3apulp 3arutin 3awater treatment1 aLuo, Mukang1 aLiu, Hesheng1 aQi, Xiangyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8562-78001 aZeng, Qingzhu1 aHe, Shan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2698-07861 aFen, Shilun1 aZhang, Jie0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2019 Nov., v. 54, no. 11 p.3042-3050dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl41365x0950-54237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.142173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009300173300001800266520116800284592002801452650001601480650001701496650002601513650002301539650000701562650002201569650001601591700005601607700006201663700006401725773012101789856008401910852000901994655001202003IND60750410620221120232431.0210915e20210901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075041062DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c009402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLalwani, Suvesh M.10aRelaxation Times of Solid-like Polyelectrolyte Complexes of Varying pH and Water Content  ap. 7765-7776.  aThe effect of complexation pH and water on the relaxation time and dynamics of polyelectrolyte (PE) complexes (PECs) and coacervates remains poorly understood. Here, we describe the dynamic mechanical behavior of solid-like PECs containing weak PEs poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) at varying complexation pH, relative humidity, and temperature with support from molecular dynamics simulations. Time–temperature, time–water, and time–intrinsic ion pair superposition principles are applied to obtain the relaxation times. It is shown that the natural log of relaxation time in hydrated PAH/PAA PECs is inversely proportional to the volume fraction of water (ln τ ∼ ϕw–¹) for a given complexation pH. For all complexation pH values examined, the natural log of relaxation time collapsed into a single line when plotted against the ratio of the number of intrinsic ion pairs to water molecules (ln (τ) ∼ nᵢₙₜᵣᵢₙₛᵢc ᵢₒₙ ₚₐᵢᵣₛ/nwₐₜₑᵣ). Taken together, this suggests that the relaxation of solid-like, hydrated PAH/PAA PECs is mediated by bound water at the intrinsic ion pair.  aPublisher supplied data 3abound water 3aelectrolytes 3amechanical properties 3amolecular dynamics 3apH 3arelative humidity 3atemperature1 aBatys, Piotr1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2264-30531 aSammalkorpi, Maria1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9248-430X1 aLutkenhaus, Jodie L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2613-60160 tMacromolecules.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 54, no. 17 p.7765-7776dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c009403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005300155245018100208520172400389592002802113650002202141650004402163650002502207650002202232650002502254650002002279650001602299650002102315650001602336650002802352650001502380650003202395650001702427650001302444650001202457650001102469653002402480653002402504653001202528700001502540700008802555700005902643700001902702700001202721700001602733700002202749700002102771773009102792856009002883852000902973655001202982IND60744480120221121145728.0211023e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074448012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1314542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yiman1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3245-202010aBacillus subtilis and saponin shifted the availability of heavy metals, health indicators of smelter contaminated soil, and the physiological indicators of Symphytum officinale  aBacillus subtilis and saponin were tested for the uptake of heavy metals (HMs) by Symphytum officinale grown in a smelter-contaminated soil in completely randomized design.

Mono-application of B. subtilis efficiently increased the peroxidase (POD: 27%) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO: 13.56%), whereas, co-application enhanced the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL: 6.50%) level in shoots. Zn concentration in the shoots and roots declined by 12.75 and 27.32% in T1, respectively. Cd increased (3.92%, T3) in shoots and decreased (39.25%, T1) in roots; Pb concentration remained below detection in shoots and increased by 40% (T3) in roots due to accumulation in dead cells and cell vacuoles. Overall, B. subtilis and saponin influenced the bioavailability of HMs, enzymatic activities, and bacterial abundance in the soil; plant growth indicators, antioxidants activities, and metal uptake in shoots and roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSymphytum officinale 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abioavailability 3acarotenoids 3acatechol oxidase 3achlorophyll 3aelectrical conductivity 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aplant growth 3asaponins 3asoil pH 3aurease 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aMines-polluted soil 0aSaponin1 aAli, Amjad1 aJeyasundar, Parimala Gnana Soundari Arockiam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3900-15751 aAzeem, Muhammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2736-79721 aTabassum, Anum1 aGuo, Di1 aLi, Ronghua1 aMian, Ishaq Ahmad1 aZhang, Zengqiang0 tChemosphere.g2021 Dec., v. 285 p.131454-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1314543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245010900201300001600310500002000326520130100346592002801647650001401675650001601689650000901705650002001714650001201734650002601746700002401772700002201796773013401818856007301952852000902025655001202034IND60613041120221120234335.0180911e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061304112DNAL7 a10.1111/vru.126552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollard, Rachel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2986-182714aThe prevalence of dynamic pharyngeal collapse is high in brachycephalic dogs undergoing videofluoroscopy  ap. 529-534.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe aim of this retrospective study was to determine the frequency of pharyngeal collapse in a large group of brachycephalic dogs undergoing videofluoroscopic assessment of swallowing or airway diameter. We hypothesized that brachycephalic dogs would have pharyngeal collapse more frequently than dolichocephalic or mesocephalic dogs with or without airway collapse. The medical records database was searched for brachycephalic dogs undergoing videofluoroscopy of swallowing or airway diameter between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2015. A cohort of dolichocephalic/mesocephalic dogs with videofluoroscopically confirmed airway collapse was age and time matched for comparison. A control group of dolichocephalic/mesocephalic dogs that did not have documented airway collapse was also evaluated. All fluoroscopic studies were assessed by a board certified veterinary radiologist for the presence and degree of pharyngeal collapse. Results demonstrate that pharyngeal collapse was significantly more common in brachycephalic dogs (58/82; 72%) than in nonbrachycephalic dogs with (7/25; 28%) and without (2/30; 7%) airway collapse. Pharyngeal collapse is more prevalent in brachycephalic dogs undergoing videofluoroscopy than in dolichocephalic/mesocephalic dogs with or without airway collapse.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adeglutition 3adogs 3amedical records 3apharynx 3aretrospective studies1 aJohnson, Lynelle R.1 aMarks, Stanley L.0 tVeterinary radiology & ultrasound.g2018 Sept., v. 59, no. 5 p.529-534dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48671x1058-81837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vru.126553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245013500174300001800309520106800327592002801395650001601423650001701439650002301456650001301479650001901492650002101511650000701532650001601539650000901555650002101564700001601585700006101601700002301662700006501685700005801750773012101808856008401929852000902013655001202022IND60750410720220217000000.0210915e20210902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075041072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c009522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeaudoin, Guillaume10aMaking Hydrophilic Polymers Thermoresponsive: The Upper Critical Solution Temperature of Copolymers of Acrylamide and Acrylic Acid  ap. 7963-7969.  aHomopolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid are known to be hydrophilic and soluble in water. Their copolymers are soluble in water at neutral pH but can be turned into polymers possessing an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) behavior when the carboxylic acid groups are protonated (pH < 3). At temperatures below the UCST, the formation of interchain hydrogen bonds between the acid and amide groups makes the copolymers insoluble. These hydrogen bonds are disrupted when the temperature is heated above the critical temperature (Tc), exhibiting a UCST behavior. In this study, linear water-soluble random copolymers of acrylamide and acrylic acid of different compositions and molar masses have been synthesized. The thermoresponsive properties of the copolymers were studied to elucidate the effects of their composition, molar mass, and concentration by measuring their cloud point temperatures (Tcₚ) in acidic buffer solutions to keep the carboxylic acid groups in the protonated state. The effects of pH and added salts or urea were also studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aacrylic acid 3acomposite polymers 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophilicity 3amolecular weight 3apH 3atemperature 3aurea 3awater solubility1 aLasri, Anne1 aZhao, Chuanzhuang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5899-31431 aLiberelle, Benoît1 aDe Crescenzo, Gregory1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6280-15701 aZhu, Xiao Xia,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0828-299X0 tMacromolecules.g2021 Sept. 02, v. 54, no. 17 p.7963-7969dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c009523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011600168300001600284520170100300592002802001650002002029650002202049650001402071650001002085650001002095650002102105650001302126650001702139650001502156650001702171650001902188650001302207700002302220700002502243700002502268773009502293856008102388852000902469655001202478IND60085342720221120172816.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008534272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2011.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiana, Marcin K.10aComparative morphology of the epidermis of seven species of polyclad flatworms (Platyhelminthes: Rhabditophora)  ap. 206-214.  aThe ultrastructure of the epidermis of seven species of polyclad flatworms (Phaenocelis medvedica, Phaenocelis peleca, Pleioplana atomata, Boninia divae, Pericelis orbicularis, Enchiridium periommatum, and Cycloporus variegatus) representing six families is described. In all seven species, the epidermis consists of a single layer of columnar cells that rests on a bipartite basement membrane. Epithelial cell surfaces are covered by numerous microvilli and cilia. Cilia contain microtubules arranged in the 9+2 pattern, and from their basal bodies two striated rootlets arise, a rostrally directed one running parallel to the apical cell membrane, and a vertical one at a right angle to the first rootlet. Numerous epithelosomes and mitochondria occupy the apical parts of the cells. The basal part of the cells is highly folded, forming a cell web that connects to the basement membrane. The basement membrane consists of a thin basal lamina and a thick, multilayered reticular lamina. The number of layers in the reticular lamina varies among the different species and appears to be correlated with body size. Numerous canals containing either pigment granules or nervous processes perforate the basement membrane. We have identified four different types of glands: rhabdite glands, rhabdoid glands, mucoid glands containing vacuoles filled with flocculent material, and mucoid glands resembling thread cells of hagfish slime glands. The latter have been found only in P. orbicularis. Pigment cells were found in all species examined with the exception of C. variegatus, which takes its coloration from its ascidian prey. Our results further support the unique taxonomic status of Boniniidae.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlatyhelminthes 3abasement membrane 3abody size 3acilia 3acolor 3aepithelial cells 3agranules 3amicrotubules 3amicrovilli 3amitochondria 3aultrastructure 3avacuoles1 aQuiroga, Sigmer Y.1 aBolaños, D.

The pH of vermicompost was decreased toward neutral, C:N ratio < 20; reduced organic carbon with increased nitrogen indicates the compost attains maturity. The final vermicomposts result shows reduction of complex organic materials into simple minerals which indicates the maturity of the experimental vermicompost product than the control. The increased aliphatic portion incorporated with flower residues may be due to the synthesis of alkyl, O-alkyl, and COO groups by the microbes present in the gut of earthworm. Plant bioassays are considered the most conventional assessment of compost maturity analysis, and subsequently, it shows the effect of vermicompost maturity on the germination index of Vigna mungo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aVigna mungo 3abioassays 3abiofertilizers 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acompost maturity 3acomposting 3adigestive system 3aearthworms 3aflowers 3agermination 3amicroorganisms 3aminerals 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apH 3avermicomposts 3awastes 2aAnimals 2aCarbonxanalysis 2aFabaceaexgrowth & development 2aGermination 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aOligochaeta 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 0avermicompost 0abiofertilizers 0acompost maturity 0aFTIR 0a13C CPMAS NMR 0agermination index1 aSatheesh Kumar, P.,1 aRajendran, N.

The results show that in order to reduce rural poverty, the Indian government should give highest priority to additionalinvestments in ruralroads and agriculturalresearch. These types of investment not only have much larger poverty impacts per rupee spent than any other government investment, but also generate higher productivity growth. Apart from government spending on education, which has the third largest marginalimpact on ruralpoverty and productivity growth, other investments (including irrigation, soil and water conservation, health, and rural and community development) have only modest impacts on growth and poverty per additional rupee spent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3acommunity development 3aeducation 3aequations 3airrigation 3amodels 3arural poverty 3asoil 3awater conservation 3aIndia1 aHazell, Peter1 aThorat, Sukhadeo0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2000 Nov., v. 82, no. 4 p.1038-1051dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0002-9092.001013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012200168300001400290520148900304592002801793650002501821650001701846650002101863650002101884650001701905650002001922650003101942650001001973650001501983650001001998650001102008650002002019650002102039650002402060650001802084650002002102650001002122653002302132653003502155653001502190653003302205653002202238700001802260700001302278700001802291700001202309700001602321700001602337700001302353700001802366773012502384856008502509852000902594655001202603IND60779161820221121223152.0220714e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077916182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.05.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Huixiao10aIntegrated transcriptomic and gibberellin analyses reveal genes related to branch development in Eucalyptus urophylla  ap. 69-79.  aTree branches affect the planting density and basal scab, which act as important attributes in the yield and quality of trees. Eucalyptus urophylla is an important pioneer tree with characteristics of strong adaptability, fast growth, short rotation period, and low disease and pest pressures. In this study, we collected ZQUC14 and LDUD26 clones and compared their transcriptomes and metabolomes from mature xylem, phloem, and developing tissues to identify factors that may influence branch development. In total, 32,809 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 18 gibberellin (GA) hormones were detected in the five sampled tissues. Searches of the kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways identified mainly genes related to diterpenoid biosynthesis, plant MAPK signaling pathways, plant hormone signal transduction, glycerolipid metabolism, peroxisome, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, ABC transporters, and brassinosteroid biosynthesis. Furthermore, gene expression trend analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed 13 genes likely involved in diterpenoid biosynthesis, including five members of the 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase superfamily, four cytochrome P450 genes, and four novel genes. In GA signal transduction pathways, 24 DEGs were found to positively regulate branch formation. These results provide a comprehensive analysis of branch development based on the transcriptome and metabolome, and help clarify the molecular mechanisms of E. urophylla.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3acytochrome P-450 3aditerpenoids 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ametabolome 3apests 3aphloem 3apioneer species 3aplant physiology 3asignal transduction 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3axylem 0aBranch development 0aDifferentially expressed genes 0aEucalyptus 0aSignaling to giberellic acid 0aHormone signaling1 aLiao, Huanqin1 aXu, Fang1 aZhang, Weihua1 aXu, Bin1 aChen, Xinyu1 aZhu, Baozhu1 aPan, Wen1 aYang, Xiaohui0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 185 p.69-79dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2022.05.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002800149245014000177300001600317520168600333592002802019650001102047650001602058650003102074650001402105650001002119650002702129650002102156650001702177650001202194650001902206650001802225650001102243650000702254650001202261650002002273650001002293650001602303650001402319650001802333700002402351700002502375700002202400700002202422773009002444856008502534852000902619655001202628IND4464243420221116185548.0141111e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446424342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagarajan, Muralidharan10aCharacteristics and functional properties of gelatin from splendid squid (Loligo formosana) skin as affected by extraction temperatures  ap. 389-397.  aGelatin was extracted from the skin of splendid squid (Loligo formosana) at different temperatures (50, 60, 70 and 80 °C) with extraction yield of 8.8%, 21.8%, 28.2%, and 45.3% (dry weight basis) for G50, G60, G70 and G80, respectively. Gelatin from the skin of splendid squid had a high protein content (∼90%) with low moisture (8.63–11.09%), fat (0.22–0.31%) and ash contents (0.17–0.68%). Gelatin extracted at higher temperature (G80) had a relatively higher free amino group content than gelatin extracted at lower temperatures (G50, G60 and G70) (P < 0.05). All gelatins contained α- and β-chains as the predominant components. Amino acid analysis of gelatin revealed the high proline and hydroxyproline contents for G50 and G60. FTIR spectra of obtained gelatins revealed the significant loss of molecular order of the triple-helix. The gel strength of gelatin extracted at lower temperature (G50) was higher than that of gelatins extracted at higher temperatures including G60, G70 and G80, respectively. The net charge of G50, G60, G70 and G80 became zero at pHs of 6.84, 5.94, 5.49, and 4.86, respectively, as determined by zeta potential titration. Gelatin extracted at higher temperature (G80) had the lower L* value but higher a* and b* values, compared with those extracted at lower temperatures (P < 0.05). Emulsion activity index decreased, whilst emulsion stability index, foam expansion and stability increased as the concentration (1–3%) increased (P < 0.05). Those properties were governed by extraction temperatures of gelatin. Thus gelatin can be successfully extracted from splendid squid skin using the appropriate extraction temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoligo 3aash content 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemulsions 3afoams 3afood processing wastes 3afree amino acids 3agel strength 3agelatin 3ahydroxyproline 3alipid content 3alipids 3apH 3aproline 3aprotein content 3asquid 3atemperature 3atitration 3awater content1 aBenjakul, Soottawat1 aProdpran, Thummanoon1 aSongtipya, Ponusa1 aKishimura, Hideki0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2012 Dec., v. 29, no. 2 p.389-397dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2012.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245008000209300001800289520201000307592002802317650001902345650001202364650001502376650002102391650002202412650002002434650001102454650001602465650001302481651000902494651001202503700002202515700002002537700002702557773013302584856008302717852000902800655001202809IND60784294520221120114650.0220805e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078429452DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-022-02770-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Audrey C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7876-267910aAbundance of introduced rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) in central Florida  ap. 2217-2228.  aIntroduced non-human primates threaten native ecosystems and have the potential to transmit diseases to humans and native wildlife, but primate population management is challenging and often controversial. Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), native to much of Asia, were introduced to an island in the Silver River in central Florida (Marion County, U.S.A.) in the 1930s and 40s. An initial population of approximately twelve individuals has grown and spread throughout what is now Silver Springs State Park. In 2015, the park was home to at least 176 rhesus macaques despite the removal of approximately 1000 animals over the preceding 30 years. The Silver River flows east into the Ocklawaha River, where rhesus macaques were reported as early as the 1970s. Population management or further research on the effects of rhesus macaques in Florida requires estimates of abundance, home range, and distribution, yet prior to this study the abundance and spatial distribution of the Ocklawaha groups were unknown. In this study, we evaluated minimum population size, number of groups, and minimum winter home range size of Ocklawaha River groups, and compared these metrics with the previously-studied Silver River groups. We surveyed a 52 km section of the Ocklawaha River using baited camera traps and river surveys for ten weeks. We identified six Ocklawaha River macaque groups, each containing between fourteen and 39 individuals, for a minimum abundance of 134 individuals. Minimum winter home ranges were between 3.63 and 11.89 km, measured as the linear distance between the furthest points at which a group was observed. Overall, Ocklawaha groups were smaller and had larger winter home ranges than Silver River groups, a difference likely driven by provisioning from tourists along the heavily-visited Silver River. This information is crucial for management of the central Florida rhesus macaque population and for future research regarding population growth and ecology of this invasive species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacaca mulatta 3acameras 3ahome range 3ainvasive species 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3arivers 3astate parks 3awildlife 3aAsia 3aFlorida1 aAnderson, C.

A new species, Mesocyclops roberti sp. nov. is described from Fiji and the Wallis Islands. New data on the geographic distribution and morphology are reported for Mesocyclops medialis, Mesocyclops woutersi and Mesocyclops aspericornis. Phylogenetic reconstructions coding the intraspecifically variable characters by three different methods (unordered, unscaled and scaled coding) support close relationship of M. roberti with two Australian species (Mesocyclops brooksi and Mesocyclops notius). Both the “unordered” and “scaled” analyses show monophyly of a group composed of Australian (Mesocyclops australiensis, M. brooksi, M. notius, and Mesocyclops pubiventris) and South Pacific (M. medialis and M. roberti sp. nov.) taxa. None of the analyses supports a sister relationship of M. roberti with M. medialis (New Caledonia, Vanuatu), the only other species restricted to South Pacific, which suggests that Mesocyclops invaded the South Pacific from Australia at least twice. The sister relationship of the Australian-South Pacific clade remains unresolved, yet all reconstructions suggest a link with Asian Mesocyclops sp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesocyclops aspericornis 3ageographical distribution 3aislands 3amonophyly 3anew species 3azoogeography 3aAustralia 3aFiji 3aNew Caledonia 3aVanuatu1 aStoch, Fabio0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2012 Aug., v. 251, no. 3 p.237-252dElsevier GmbHx0044-52317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2011.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01457naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094024002200123024001900145040001800164100001700182245006400199300001300263506007600276520036500352592002800717506003700745650001000782650002500792650001400817650001700831651001700848700001800865700001700883773012300900856007501023852000901098655001201107IND60118361920221207144632.0141126e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011836192DNAL7 a10.1128/JB.01852-122doi7 aPMC35105502pmcid7 a232092272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Qiliang10aGenome Sequence of Galbibacter marinum Type Strain ck-I2-15  ap. 6973.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGalbibacter marinum strain ck-I2-15T was isolated from an arsenite-resistant consortium enriched from the deep sea sediment of a hydrothermal vent field on the Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge.

To fully utilize LTCA as a fertilizer, this study investigated a procedure for P recovery from LTCA via struvite crystallization with fewer impurities. The adsorption characteristics of P and Fe by cation exchange resin (CER) were explored by simulating using the macroscopic parametric equation Thomas model. Optimum purification conditions for P-rich leachate by cation exchange column method were determined. Results showed that approximately 97.21 wt% of P was extracted from LTCA at HCl concentration of 0.8 M and liquid/solid ratio of 20.0 ml/g. More than 90 wt% of impurities could be detached by making P-rich leachate flow through cation exchange bed filled by CER at 300 ml/h. The macroscopic parametric equation Thomas model could clearly describe the adsorption characteristics of Fe in P-rich leachate by CER. Theoretical basis for purification of high concentration Fe in P-rich leachate by CER was provided. Approximately 84.04 wt% of total P in LTCA was recovered as struvite crystal which had low concentrations of heavy metals (5.96 mg/kg for Cr, 45.21 mg/kg for Cu, 29.67 mg/kg for Ni, 2.24 mg/kg for Pb, and 290.6 mg/kg for Zn) and could be eco-friendly for agricultural application. X-ray diffraction and SEM-EDS analysis validated the formation of struvite.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3acation exchange 3acation exchange resins 3achromium 3acombustion 3acopper 3acrystallization 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aequations 3afertilizers 3aheavy metals 3ahydrochloric acid 3airon 3aleachates 3alead 3aliquids 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3amodels 3anickel 3aphosphorus 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asludge ash 3awaste management 3azinc 0aLow-temperature combustion sludge ash 0aPhosphorus recovery 0aStruvite 0aCation exchange bed 0aMacroscopic parametric equation Thomas model1 aLiu, Xiaoji1 aHuang, Qunxing1 aGao, Huaping,d1962-1 aTay, Kangrou1 aYan, Jianhua0 tWaste management.g2019 May 01, v. 90 p.84-93dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.04.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013900164300001600303520132200319592002801641650001801669650003301687650001601720700001901736700002501755773009501780856008101875852000901956655001201965IND60085343120221120213840.0141101e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008534312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcz.2011.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCech, Gábor10aRevision of Bryodrilus glandulosus () and Mesenchytraeus kuehnelti (Oligochaeta: Enchytraeidae) using morphological and molecular data  ap. 253-262.  aWe wished to test the taxonomic status of the enchytraeid species Bryodrilus glandulosus (Dózsa-Farkas, 1990) – previously B. ehlersi glandulosus – and Mesenchytraeus kuehneltiDózsa-Farkas, 1991, and their eventual conspecifity with, respectively, B. ehlersiUde, 1892 and Mesenchytraeus pelicensisIssel, 1905. The two species were both described from Hungarian Sphagnum-bogs as relict species of these unique areas. In this paper we demonstrate that these species are invalid based on morphological and molecular analyses of different European specimens. The only differential character of B. glandulosus from B. ehlersiUde, 1892 was the presence of glands at the opening of the spermathecae. However, during the thorough investigation of European B. ehlersi species we realized that contrary to the original description, all B. ehlersi have these glands. Moreover, there were no differences between the ITS gene sequences of the B. ehlersi specimens collected from different places. A similar ITS study did not find any difference between M. kuehnelti and M. pelicensis either. Their morphological differentiation was based on the presence of the atrial glands but this separation has no legitimacy since this is a variable character. For these reasons we revise the species referred and give new descriptions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnchytraeidae 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aspermatheca1 aBoros, Gergely1 aDozsa-Farkas, Klara,0 tZoologischer Anzeiger.g2012 Aug., v. 251, no. 3 p.253-262dElsevier GmbHx0044-52317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcz.2011.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100003500156245019100191300002000382520132900402592002801731650001701759650001801776650001401794650001801808650001601826650002101842650001101863650000701874650005801881650001801939650001601957650002401973650005001997650004302047650002902090650002902119650002502148650001902173653001702192653001402209653001302223653001802236653001702254653004102271700002602312700002902338700003102367773013502398852000902533856007502542655001202617IND4475949620160905000000.0160905e20131127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447594962DNAL7 a241171802pmid7 a10.1021/jf402920p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez Nicolás, José Manuel,10aPhysicochemical and Thermodynamic Characterization of the Encapsulation of Methyl Jasmonate by Natural and Modified Cyclodextrins Using Reversed-Phase High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography  ap. 11347-11354.  aAlthough the combinations of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and cyclodextrins (CDs) have been used by different authors to stimulate the production of several metabolites, no study has been published about the possible formation of MeJA–CD complexes when these two molecules are added together to the reaction medium as elicitors. For this reason and because knowledge of the possible complexation process of MeJA with CD under different physicochemical conditions is essential if these two molecules are to be used in cell cultures, this paper looks at the complexation of MeJA with natural and modified CDs using a reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) system. The interaction of MeJA with β-CD was more efficient than with α- and γ-CDs. However, a modified CD, HP-β-CD, was the most effective of all of the CDs tested. Moreover, MeJA formed complexes with CD with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and the formation constants of these complexes were strongly dependent upon the temperature of the mobile phase used but not the pH. To obtain information about the mechanism of the affinity of MeJA for CD, the thermodynamic parameters ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS° were calculated. Finally, molecular modeling studies were carried out to propose which molecular interactions are established in the complexation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3acyclodextrins 3aelicitors 3aencapsulation 3ametabolites 3amethyl jasmonate 3amodels 3apH 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3astoichiometry 3atemperature 2aAcetatesxchemistry 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aChromatography, Reverse-Phasexmethods 2aCyclodextrinsxchemistry 2aCyclopentanesxchemistry 2aOxylipinsxchemistry 2aThermodynamics 0aCyclodextrin 0ajasmonate 0aelicitor 0aencapsulation 0acell culture 0areversed-phase liquid chromatography1 aEscorial

Because MusPV may have been missed during routine pathogen screening of mice in colonies worldwide, a variety of detection methods are described to detect MusPV. The clinical and histologic lesions of productive MusPV infections fit PV-associated features, including papillomas, koilocytes within the stratum granulosum of the hyperplastic/acanthotic papillomatous epithelium, and the presence of intranuclear virus particles in koilocytotic cells visualized by electron microscopy. Antiserum against disrupted PV virions, isolated from another species (canine), identified conserved viral antigens in productively infected cells by immunohistochemistry. A rolling circle technique was used to amplify viral circular DNAs followed by endonuclease restriction enzyme digestion to determine the correct size of PV DNA. Consensus PV degenerative primers, My09/11, commonly used to detect many different types of PVs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), particularly mucosotropic HPVs, also identified MusPV and all rodent PVs tested. Since there was one nucleotide mismatch between the My09/11 primer set and the MusPV template, a new primer set, MusPV–My09/11, was designed to specifically detect MusPV in latent infections and spontaneous MusPV-induced papillomas. Southern blot analysis verified the presence of full size PV DNA in infected tissues. Virus-like particles (VLPs), generated from MusPV L1 genes, provided a substrate for serological testing of naturally and experimentally infected mice. In summary, a series of diagnostic assays were developed and validated to detect MusPV infection in skin tumors and serological response in laboratory mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aPapillomaviridae 3aSouthern blotting 3aantiserum 3adigestion 3adogs 3aelectron microscopy 3aepithelium 3agenes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amice 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3ascreening 3askin neoplasms 3aviral antigens 3avirion 3avirus-like particles 3aviruses 3aIndia1 aJenson, A.

However, the underlying causes remain poorly understood. Autophagy, an evolutionary regulated cellular mechanism, is highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms to maintain energy homeostasis against stress including starvation. To investigate whether autophagy plays a role during larval-to-juvenile transition, we generated atg7 and beclin1 zebrafish mutant lines using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. In this study, both atg7 and beclin1 null zebrafish died during larval-to-juvenile transition because atg7 and beclin1 mutants were unable to cope with the metabolic stress after yolk absorption and fail to activate autophagy in response to nutrient restriction. Meanwhile, dramatic defects in the intestine architecture and metabolic functions in the liver of these mutants were observed even though refeeding them. Treatment with rapamycin, an activator of autophagy, could effectively extend the survival time of both atg7 and beclin1 null zebrafish through decreasing the metabolic rate while it couldn't activate autophagy in mutants via the canonical pathway. Thus, our results revealed that autophagy played a crucial role in zebrafish ontogeny during larval-to-juvenile transition, and it could be considered as one of the most important endogenous factors judging the survival rate of the developing embryos during this period.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aDanio rerio 3aabsorption 3aaquaculture 3aautophagy 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aintestines 3aliver 3amutants 3aontogeny 3arapamycin 3astarvation 3asurvival rate 0aAutophagy 0aLarval-to-juvenile transition 0aatg7 0abeclin1 0aMetabolism 0aRapamycin1 aZhang, Jin1 aRen, Fan1 aHe, Yan1 aMei, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4947-35730 tAquaculture and fisheries.g2022 July, v. 7, no. 4 p.359-372dElsevier B.V.aShanghai Ocean UniversitywJournal:23559x2468-550X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaf.2021.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245008900159300001600248520149200264592002801756650002001784650001401804650001101818650002601829650001201855650001001867650001001877650001401887650001001901650001001911650001901921650002501940650000901965650001101974650001301985650001001998650001202008651001602020651001102036653001302047653002202060653003502082653002702117653002002144653001402164700002202178700003002200700001502230700001902245700001902264773011502283856007702398852000902475655001202484IND60519476620221118190201.0160429e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051947662DNAL7 a10.7589/2015-05-1132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiaud, Claude10aRanavirus causes mass die-offs of alpine amphibians in the southwestern alps, france  ap. 242-252.  aPathogenic fungi and viruses cause mortality outbreaks in wild amphibians worldwide. In the summer of 2012, dead tadpoles and adults of the European common frog Rana temporaria were reported in alpine lakes in the southwestern Alps (Mercantour National Park, France). A preliminary investigation using molecular diagnostic techniques identified a Ranavirus as the potential pathogenic agent. Three mortality events were recorded in the park, and samples were collected. The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was not detected in any of the dead adult and juvenile frogs sampled (n=16) whereas all specimens were positive for a Ranavirus. The genome sequence of this Ranavirus was identical to previously published sequences of the common midwife toad virus (CMTV), a Ranavirus that has been associated with amphibian mortalities throughout Europe. We cultured virus from the organs of the dead common frogs and infecting adult male common frogs collected in another alpine region where no frog mortality had been observed. The experimentally infected frogs suffered 100% mortality (n=10). The alpine die-off is the first CMTV outbreak associated with mass mortality in wild amphibians in France.

Stripping, as pre-treatment, could significantly remove ammonia nitrogen (NH ₃-N) and total nitrogen (TN) by 55% and 52%, respectively. Moreover, chemical oxygen demand (COD) was slightly reduced by 6.8%, and little total phosphorus (TP) was removed. The subsequent reversed A ²/O process appeared to be highly influenced by the volumetric mixing ratio of leachate to sewage. Typically, the effluent COD, NH ₃-N, TN and TP increased with the increasing ratio from 1:30 to 1:15, namely, the increasing fraction of leachate. Over the all tested mixing ratio range, the effluent COD and NH ₃-N were satisfied with the primary B standards of Chinese Discharge Standard of Pollutants for municipal waste water treatment plant (GB18918-2002). The standards different from the primary A standards for water reuse are used for discharge into the most surface water bodies in China. However, TN and TP would exceed the primary B standard levels at a mixing ratio of 1:15 or greater. These findings suggest that an appropriate volumetric mixing ratio should be carefully selected to ensure the performance of the reversed A ²/O process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenvironmental technology 3alandfill leachates 3amixing 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3apretreatment 3asewage 3asurface water 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse 3aChina 0alandfill leachate 0aammonia stripping 0areversed A2/O 0avolumetric mixing ratio 0asewage1 aDing, Wen-chuan1 aZhang, Zhi1 aWan, Peng1 aDeng, Yang1 aWang, Shuangshuang0 tEnvironmental technology.g2015 Oct. 18, v. 36, no. 20 p.2668-2673dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2015.10433113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03424naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011000164300002000274520190400294592002802198596007602226596008102302650001602383650001602399650001702415650002202432650002402454650002602478650001302504650001302517650001902530650001502549650001502564650001302579650001402592700001502606700001902621700001402640700001202654700005402666773015502720856008202875852000902957655001202966IND60743461820221120074854.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074346182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13050-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lanmiao10aCombined impact of organic matter, phosphorus, nitrate, and ammonia nitrogen on the process of blackwater  ap. 32831-32843.  aBlackwater events are frequently reported over the world and become a serious environmental problem. However, the mechanisms of blackwater occurrence are not fully understood yet. This study simulated the process of blackwater with the combined pollution in an orthogonal experiment, which had 4 factors (TOC, TP, NH₄⁺-N, and NO₃⁻-N) and 4 levels (None, Low, Middle, and High). Results showed that the process of water condition changes was divided into two parts, which were “exogenous” and “algae-derived” blackwater, and the influence of four different pollutants on the occurrence of the blackwater was ranked as follows: TOC > TP > NO₃⁻-N > NH₄⁺-N. With the increase of organic matter addition, the anaerobic condition in water was prolonged and the concentration of Fe²⁺ had a significant increase. In addition, under the None phosphorus condition, the descent rates of DO and COD in the water were reduced, and the algae bloom was obviously deferred. Moreover, the addition of organic matter or phosphorus changed the microbial community structure and led to different water processes. Particularly, only on the condition of the high content of TOC and phosphorus, the diversity of sulfate-reducing bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas, Paludibacter, and Bacteroides) increased significantly, which accounted for 51.4%, causing the significant production of S²⁻ in the water. Water’s lack of phosphorus showed a low rate of decomposition of organic matter, which might be the result of a considerable increase in the abundance of aerobic Trichococcus and Malikia. This study shows that organic matter and phosphorus have synergistic effect on blackwater occurrence. In the treatment of blackwater, the exogenous pollutant control should reduce the discharge of organic pollutants, and endogenous control should focus on phosphorus abatement and reduce nitrogen control.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018SZDZX0027cDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province  a2019-YF09-00081-SNcDepartment of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province 3aBacteroides 3aPseudomonas 3aTrichococcus 3aammonium nitrogen 3acommunity structure 3amicrobial communities 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3aresearch 3asynergism1 aWu, Linjun1 aYang, Lingxiao1 aLiu, Chao1 aLi, Jun1 aLi, Naiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6731-95050 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 July, v. 28, no. 25 p.32831-32843dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13050-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013200169300001600301500001500317520097200332592002801304650003101332650002301363650001701386650001101403650001401414650001701428650002601445650001801471650002401489650001601513650002401529650002001553653001701573700002601590773010901616856008301725990002301808852000901831655001201840IND60098076420221121013652.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009807642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafavi, Farinaz10aRole of serine proteases in inflammation: Bowman–Birk protease inhibitor (BBI) as a potential therapy for autoimmune diseases  ap. 428-433.  a2019-12-06  aSerine proteases, a sub-category of the protease family, participate in various physiologic and pathologic conditions. Serine proteases are involved in different arms of the immune system and play an important role in inflammation. They have been evaluated as therapeutic targets in several inflammatory diseases. The Bowman–Birk protease inhibitor (BBI), a soybean-derived serine protease inhibitor, is resistant to temperature and acidic conditions. These characteristics make it a good candidate for oral administration, with no major side effects. In addition, the therapeutic effect of BBI has been shown in inflammatory diseases and cancer. We have demonstrated the immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of BBI in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis. Here we review the role of serine proteases in inflammatory diseases, with emphasis on the potential of BBI as a novel oral therapy for multiple sclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aserine proteinases 3ainflammation 3amodels 3asclerosis 3aencephalitis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aimmune system 3aautoimmune diseases 3atemperature 3aoral administration 3aadverse effects 0atherapeutics1 aRostami, Abdolmohamad0 tExperimental and molecular pathology.g2012 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.428-433dElsevier Inc.x0014-48007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.09.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245011400176300001600290520118600306592002801492650002301520650003101543650001401574650001201588650002301600650001301623650001701636650001401653650002201667650002301689650001601712650000901728650004401737650000901781650002001790653001401810653003001824653005301854700002701907700002701934700002301961700002301984700002802007773011602035856008602151852000902237655001202246IND60529383620221120181546.0161019e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052938362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.12.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeivas, Carolina L.10aSubstituted galacturonan from starfruit: Chemical structure and antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects  ap. 295-300.  aStarfruit (Averrhoa carambola L.) is an edible tropical fruit, which is usually consumed as a fresh table fruit or as fruit juice. It also exhibits various pharmacological activities. In this study, polysaccharides were extracted with boiling water and purified by freeze–thawing and Fehling treatments. After purification steps, a homogenous fraction was obtained. It was analyzed by sugar composition, gel permeation chromatography, methylation, and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectroscopy analyses. It comprised arabinose (Ara), galactose (Gal), and galacturonic acid (GalA) in a molar ratio of 12.3:1.7:86.0. Methylation and NMR spectroscopy analyses showed that it contained a substituted galacturonan composed of (1→4)-linked α-d-Galp A units branched at O-2 by (1→5)-linked α-l-Araf and terminal α-l-Araf and α-d-Galp A units. The effect of PFSCW (10–300mg/kg, i.p.) on nocifensive behavior induced by intraplantar injection of formalin in mice was evaluated.

We assessed spatial and temporal patterns of ion concentrations in snow across urban to montane gradients in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, and the adjacent Wasatch Mountains during January 2011, a period of several persistent cold air pools. Ion concentrations in fresh snow samples were greatest in urban sites, and were lower by factors of 4–130 in a remote high-elevation montane site. Adjacent undeveloped canyons experienced significant incursions of particulate-rich urban air during stable atmospheric conditions, where snow ion concentrations were lower but not significantly different from urban sites. Surface snow ion concentrations on elevation transects in and adjacent to Salt Lake City varied with temporal and spatial trends in aerosol concentrations, increasing following exposure to particulate-rich air as cold air pools developed, and peaking at intermediate elevations (1500–1600 m above sea level, or 200–300 m above the valley floor). Elevation trends in ion concentrations, especially NH4+ and NO3−, corresponded with patterns of aerosol exposure inferred from laser ceilometer data, suggesting that high particulate matter concentrations stimulated fog or dry ion deposition to snow-covered surfaces at the top of the cold air pools. Fog/dry deposition inputs were similar to wet deposition at mid-elevation montane sites, but appeared negligible at lower and higher-elevation sites. Overall, snow ion concentrations in our urban and adjacent montane sites exceeded many values reported from urban precipitation in North America, and greatly exceeded those reported for remote snowpacks. Sodium, Cl−, NH4+, and NO3− concentrations in fresh snow were high relative to previously measured urban precipitation, with means of 120, 117, 42, and 39 μeq l−1, respectively. After exposure to atmospheric particulate matter during cold pool events, surface snow concentrations peaked at 2500, 3600, 93, and 90 μeq l−1 for these ions. Median nitrogen (N) deposition in fresh urban snow samples measured 0.8 kg N ha−1 during January 2011, with similar fog/dry deposition inputs at mid-elevation montane sites. Wintertime anthropogenic air pollution represents a significant source of ions to snow-covered ecosystems proximate to urban montane areas, with important implications for ecosystem function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aaltitude 3aammonium compounds 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acanyons 3achlorides 3acold 3adry deposition 3aecosystems 3aemissions 3aions 3amountains 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aparticulates 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asodium 3atemperature 3awet deposition 3awinter 3aUtah 0aInversion 0aMontane 0aNitrogen deposition 0aPM 2.5 0aSnow chemistry 0aUrban1 aMaurer, Gregory1 aHoch, Sebastian W.1 aTaylor, Raili1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5436-42031 aBowling, David R.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Dec., v. 98 p.231-241dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.08.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03718naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245017900209500002200388506011700410506007600527520227500603592002802878506003702906650001502943650000902958650001102967650001402978653001102992653002003003653002603023653003203049653002803081653001903109700001603128700001703144773009903161856005103260852000903311655001203320IND60795643620221207115723.0221004s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079564362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geogeo.2022.1001382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Debjeet1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7613-597010aRoof fall threat analysis using fractal pattern recognition and neural network over mine microseismicity in a Central Indian longwall panel overlain by massive sandstone roof  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDue to its high degree of mechanization, caved longwall mining is the most sophisticated and advanced mining method, and it is widely accepted across world's major coal producing countries. The overlying strata dynamics above goaf (void spaces behind powered supports) acts as the deciding parameter towards smooth and safe longwall operation. Usually, this overhanging load above goaf undergoes regular caving for releasing the excess accumulated stress, but sometimes the presence of massive hard strata (mostly sandstone beds) reduces the cavablity of immediate roof. The delayed caving tends to increase the hanging time and load weight of strata. The excess accumulated stress is released in form of sudden roof falls, which are massive by nature and also considered to be the most serious threat to the underground mines. The aftereffects of these untimely roof falls are often associated with catastrophic consequences in form of fatalities, non-fatal injuries, instrument loss and reduction in productivity. Therefore, fast-automated monitoring of roof stress level with higher degree of precision in real time is highly desired for safe operation of mines, which will have the ability to detect the location (in 3D) and threat level of stressed zones in the overlying strata for setting a precursory alarm towards roof fall forecasting. Similar work has been carried out in the present study, which tends to use the passive microseismicity associated with coal mine for monitoring the stress level in the overlying strata and roof fall forecasting through fractal pattern recognition and neural network over microseismic event distribution. The prime objective of the study was to enhance the safety in the working area of the underground mines through: (a) fast and automated identification of roof fall threat level in real time and to categorized it under five threat classes using fractal pattern recognition of microseismic event distribution, (b) developing a suitable predictive model in order to identify high hazard event windows, which acted as precursory signatures towards roof fall forecasting, and (c) timely identification of stressed areas in the overlying strata for providing prior information towards spatio-temporal forecasting of roof fall.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautomation 3acoal 3amodels 3asandstone 0aSafety 0aThreat analysis 0aRoof-fall forecasting 0aFractal pattern recognition 0aMicroseismic monitoring 0aNeural network1 aRoy, P.N.S.1 aKumar, Manoj0 tGeosystems and geoenvironment.g2022,  p.100138-dElsevier LtdwJournal:28585x2772-88387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geogeo.2022.100138  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245011600167300001600283520123300299592002801532650001601560650001501576650000801591650002001599650001001619650001901629650003001648650002701678650001101705650003101716650002401747651001201771653001601783653001501799653001501814653001201829653002001841653001001861700002001871700002201891700002001913700001901933773011501952856007702067852000902144655001202153IND60519476920221118190145.0160429e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051947692DNAL7 a10.7589/2015-05-1312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez Vera, Cristina10aGeographic distribution and molecular diversity of bartonella spp. infections in moose (alces alces) in finland  ap. 209-216.  aMoose, Alces alces (Artiodactyla: Cervidae) in Finland are heavily infested with deer keds, Lipoptena cervi (Diptera: Hippoboschidae). The deer ked, which carries species of the genus Bartonella, has been proposed as a vector for the transmission of bartonellae to animals and humans. Previously, bartonella DNA was found in deer keds as well as in moose blood collected in Finland. We investigated the prevalence and molecular diversity of Bartonella spp. infection from blood samples collected from free-ranging moose. Given that the deer ked is not present in northernmost Finland, we also investigated whether there were geographic differences in the prevalence of bartonella infection in moose. The overall prevalence of bartonella infection was 72.9% (108/148). Geographically, the prevalence was highest in the south (90.6%) and lowest in the north (55.9%). At least two species of bartonellae were identified by multilocus sequence analysis. Based on logistic regression analysis, there was no significant association between bartonella infection and either age or sex; however, moose from outside the deer ked zone were significantly less likely to be infected (P<0.015) than were moose hunted within the deer ked zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlces alces 3aBartonella 3aDNA 3aLipoptena cervi 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3ageographical distribution 3ageographical variation 3ahumans 3amultilocus sequence typing 3aregression analysis 3aFinland 0aAlces alces 0abacteremia 0aBartonella 0aFinland 0aLipoptena cervi 0amoose1 aAaltonen, Kirsi1 aSpillmann, Thomas1 aVapalahti, Olli1 aSironen, Tarja0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2016 Apr., v. 52, no. 2 p.209-216dWildife Disease Associationx0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589%2F2015-05-1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02308naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003300149245012000182520095100302592002801253650001201281650001301293650001901306650001201325650001101337650001301348650002201361650001901383650001101402650001501413650001501428653003301443653003601476653003401512653003301546653002901579700002001608700002101628700002201649773011001671856008401781852000901865655001201874IND60729128120221119063920.0210619e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072912812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2021.1006552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOspina-Betancourth, Carolina10aLow inhibitory effect of ammonia on the nitrogen-fixing activity of a sludge enriched with nitrogen-fixing bacteria  aIn principle, high carbon to nitrogen wastes can be used to produce nitrogen-fixing bacteria and thus create a potential biofertiliser. In practice biological nitrogen fixation can be inhibited by the presence of ammonia. We wish to know what concentrations of ammonia are inhibitory. We therefore “challenged” sludge from reactors fed with high carbon to nitrogen wastewater with different ammonia concentrations and measured the effect on nitrogen fixation rates. The sludge was resistant to inhibition by ammonia with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of 70.2 mg of NH₄⁺ L⁻¹. Moreover, the presence of modest amounts of ammonium in the reactors did not affect the capacity of the biomass to reduce the organic matter contained in the wastewater. We conclude that high carbon to nitrogen wastes can be used to generate a potential fertiliser that could work in the presence of high levels of ammonia contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abiofertilizers 3abiomass 3acarbon 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aorganic matter 3asludge 3atechnology 3awastewater 0aBiological nitrogen fixation 0aBiological wastewater treatment 0aHigh C:N wastewater treatment 0aPulp and paper mill effluent 0aBiofertilizer production1 aAcharya, Kishor1 aSanabria, Janeth1 aCurtis, Thomas P.0 tBioresource technology reports.g2021 June, v. 14 p.100655-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2021.1006553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245015300166300001600319520201100335592002802346650002202374650002202396650002302418650001402441650001902455650001002474650001102484650001902495650001702514650001102531650002002542651001002562653002802572653001502600653001602615653001702631653001602648700001802664700005102682700005302733773011902786856008802905852000902993655001203002IND60628254420221119021131.0191214e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062825442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.1612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yong14aThe occurrence, composition and partitioning of phthalate esters (PAEs) in the water-suspended particulate matter (SPM) system of Lake Chaohu, China  ap. 285-293.  aThe occurrence, composition, and partitioning of six phthalate esters (PAEs) (dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)) in the water-suspended particulate matter (SPM) system of Lake Chaohu were investigated in this study. Our results showed that PAEs were ubiquitous contaminants in Lake Chaohu. The concentration of the Σ6 PAEs in dissolved and particulate phases ranged from 0.370 to 13.2 μg·L−1 and from 14.4 to 7129 μg·L−1, respectively. The Σ6 PAEs in water and SPM phases exhibited different seasonal trends. PAEs with different degrees of hydrophobicity demonstrated different temporal distributions in the dissolved phase. In particulate phase, all PAEs exhibited the same temporal distribution. Regarding the occurrence of PAEs, significant spatial differences exist between lake and estuary. However, there were no specific differences in PAEs across lake zones and river types of Lake Chaohu. River input should be considered an important source of PAEs in Lake Chaohu. DIBP and DBP were the most abundant PAEs in Lake Chaohu, and DIBP should attract more attention in the future. The organic carbon normalized partitioning coefficient (logKoc) ranged from an average of 2.38 ± 0.86 L·g−1 for BBP to 3.98 ± 0.66 L·g−1 for DEHP, and approximately 2 to 3 unit variations of logKoc existed for the individual PAEs. It was difficult to ascertain whether the partitioning of PAEs was in, near or far from the equilibrium. No linear relationship was found between logKoc and the octanol-water partitioning coefficient (logKow) for PAEs. Koc might not be suitable for describing the partitioning of PAEs in the water-SPM system. The hydrophobicity of PAEs may have little impact on their partitioning in the complex environmental system, and the Kow model may be inappropriate to predict the partitioning of PAEs in natural large lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 3adibutyl phthalate 3adiethyl phthalate 3adimethyl phthalate 3aestuaries 3ahydrophobicity 3alakes 3amodels 3aorganic carbon 3aparticulates 3arivers 3awater pollution 3aChina 0aPhthalate esters (PAEs) 0aOccurrence 0aComposition 0aPartitioning 0aLake Chaohu1 aWang, Qingmei1 aHe, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3671-86501 aXu, Fuliu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4242-78170 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 661 p.285-293dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.1613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02994naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245006800165520191000233592002802143650001602171650001102187650003202198650001402230653002402244653001602268653002602284653003202310653001702342653001702359700001602376700001902392700002602411773010102437856008502538852000902623655001202632IND60647590020221117063826.0190705e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064759002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecocom.2019.1007702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Saheb10aEffect of hunting cooperation and fear in a predator-prey model  aDynamics of predator-prey systems under the influence of cooperative hunting among predators and the fear thus imposed on the prey population is of great importance from ecological point of view. The role of hunting cooperation and the fear effect in the predator-prey system is gaining considerable attention by the researchers recently. But the study on combined effect of hunting cooperation and fear in the predator-prey system is not yet studied. In the present paper, we investigate the impact of hunting cooperation among predators and predator induced fear in prey population by using the classical predator-prey model. We consider that predator populations cooperate during hunting. We also consider that hunting cooperation induces fear among prey, which has far richer and complex dynamics. We observe that without hunting cooperation, the unique coexistence equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable. However, an increase in the hunting cooperation induced fear may destabilize the system and produce periodic solution via Hopf-bifurcation. The stability of the Hopf-bifurcating periodic solution is obtained by computing the Lyapunov coefficient. The limit cycles thus obtained may be supercritical or subcritical. We also observe that the system undergoes the Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in two-parameter space. Further, we observe that the system exhibits backward bifurcation between predator-free equilibrium and coexisting equilibrium. The system also exhibits two different types of bi-stabilities due to subcritical Hopf-bifurcation (between interior equilibrium and stable limit cycle) and backward bifurcation (between predator-free and interior equilibrium points). Further, we observe strong demographic Allee phenomenon in the system.

It has several advantages over high energy and other low energy methods including, protecting sensitive compounds against severe conditions of high energy method and its ability to minimize surfactant, removal of cosurfactant and thermal stability compared with other low energy methods. In this study, we examined possibility of encapsulating highly soluble crocin in W/O micro-emulsions using spontaneous method which further could be used for making double emulsions. Nonionic surfactants of Span 80 and polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) were used for making micro-emulsions that showed the high potential of PGPR for spontaneous method. Surfactant to water ratio (SWR%) was evaluated to find the highest amount of aqueous phase which can be dispersed in organic phase. Droplet size decreased by increasing SWR toward the SWR=100% which had the smallest droplet size and then increased at higher levels of surfactant. By increasing SWR, shear viscosity increased which showed the high effect of PGPR on rheological properties. This study shows in addition to W/O micro-emulsions, spontaneous method could be used for preparing stable O/W micro-emulsions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive compounds 3adroplet size 3aemulsifying 3aemulsifying properties 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3aglycerol 3ananoemulsions 3anonionic surfactants 3apharmaceutical industry 3aricinoleic acid 3athermal stability 3aviscosity 0aSpontaneous emulsification 0aCrocin 0aSaffron1 aJafari, Seid Mahdi,1 aMakhmal-Zadeh, Behzad S.1 aMaghsoudlou, Yahya0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Mar., v. 84 p.261-267dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010300167300001800270520106500288592002801353650001301381650001201394650001101406650001701417650002101434650001301455650001301468650001901481650001301500700005801513700006001571700005801631773012301689856008301812852000901895655001201904IND60620643920190311000000.0181116e20181008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062064392DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.8b013812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreno, Adrian10aSET-LRP in Biphasic Mixtures of the Nondisproportionating Solvent Hexafluoroisopropanol with Water  ap. 4480-4491.  aThe fluorinated alcohol 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol (HFIP) is an especially effective solvent for solubilizing a wide range of polymers. However, the performance of HFIP as SET-LRP solvent has classically been questioned due to its poor Cu(I)X disproportionating properties. Taking advantage of the fast and quantitative disproportionation of Cu(I)X in water, SET-LRP in organic solvent/water mixtures rids the organic solvent of mediating this fundamental event. Here, the Cu(0) wire-catalyzed SET-LRP synthesis of well-defined poly(methyl acrylate)s and poly(butyl acrylate)s with narrow molecular weight distribution and near perfect bromine chain end functionality is reported in HFIP/water mixtures. The results reported here support the potential of HFIP/water mixtures in the preparation of more complex architectures including polymers with dual control over molecular weight and tacticity. Since HFIP is also a classic solvent for the denaturation of proteins this SET-LRP system is also expected to find applications in the grafting of protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3abromine 3acopper 3adenaturation 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 3aproteins 3asolubilization 3asolvents1 aGalià, Marina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4359-45101 aLligadas, Gerard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8519-18401 aPercec, Virgil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5926-04890 tBiomacromolecules.g2018 Oct. 08, v. 19, no. 11 p.4480-4491dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12556x1526-46027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.8b013813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245007500205500002000280520115200300592002801452596005901480596003601539650002701575650001201602650002601614650002401640650001001664650001101674650002601685650001501711650001701726650001101743650001401754650001101768650001401779650002001793650002201813650002101835700002001856700005601876700005901932700005701991700006002048700007102108773012302179856007302302852000902375655001202384IND60677784220221119111114.0191213e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067778422DNAL7 a10.1111/ivb.122722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeury‐Ormanni, Julie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4711-459310aTolerance of free‐living nematode species to imidacloprid and diuron  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe neonicotinoid imidacloprid and the herbicide diuron are long‐lived pesticides commonly detected in European rivers. Both have lethal as well as sublethal effects on aquatic invertebrates dwelling in streambeds. Here, we performed lethality tests of imidacloprid and diuron on seven species of widespread, free‐living nematodes and the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Our results indicated that nematodes were relatively tolerant to both pesticides, and only two species (Diploscapter coronatus and Plectus opisthocirculus) showed mortality at high nominal concentrations of imidacloprid (119 mg/L) and diuron (33 mg/L). The changes observed in nematode community structure after imidacloprid and diuron exposure may have been related to trade‐offs between sensitivity to toxicants and changes in competitive abilities of the species. While the former can be tested using single‐species tests, we recommend that the latter be tested in further experiments using multispecies communities. Our results suggest that the presence of these pesticides could favor nematodes over other meiofaunal groups found in freshwater sediments.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR‐10‐LABX‐45cAgence Nationale de la Recherche  cFrench National Research Agency 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aPlectus 3aaquatic invertebrates 3acommunity structure 3adeath 3adiuron 3afree-living nematodes 3afreshwater 3aimidacloprid 3amodels 3amortality 3arivers 3asediments 3astream channels 3asublethal effects 3atoxic substances1 aDoose, Caroline1 aMajdi, Nabil1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7052-42971 aVedrenne, Jacky1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9313-42831 aMorin, Soizic1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0360-93831 aHöss, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3954-51341 aTraunspurger, W.q(Walter),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9828-84300 tInvertebrate biology.g2019 Dec., v. 138, no. 4 p.e12272-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867081x1077-83067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ivb.122723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009600167300001600263520143400279592002801713650002101741650002001762650001801782650002101800650001301821650001401834650002901848650002401877653002201901653002001923653001901943653002701962700001901989700002302008700002002031700002102051773018002072856008302252852000902335655001202344IND60647590220221117063652.0200824e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064759022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2019.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNamara, Jade10aUsing Interactive Nutrition Modules to Increase Critical Thinking Skills in College Courses  ap. 343-350.  aTo understand how the addition of an evidence-based framework to an online nutrition module influences college students’ critical thinking decision making (CT-DM).Students were individually randomized into an intervention group or a control group. The nutrition modules focused on 2 topics related to different types of eating behavior. Students completed a CT-DM activity to generate a score.College students, between 18 and 24 years old, recruited from introductory nutrition and agriculture science courses at 2 universities.Intervention and control received 2 nutrition modules. The intervention added a CT-DM framework that framed the topic as a problem, incorporated activities, and provided scaffolding.CT-DM was scored using a validated rubric to assess the use of critical thinking skills when making a food-related decision. Green eating and critical thinking disposition were measured.Hierarchical linear regression and t tests were used to assess outcomes.A total of 431 students participated (intervention = 203; control = 228). After controlling for university, the intervention group scored significantly higher on CT-DM (18.1 ± 7.6) compared with the control (15.4 ± 8.4); F (3,428) = 14.58, P < .001.The results show that an evidence-based framework using nutrition topics encourages CT-DM skills. Future higher-education nutrition interventions should use frameworks to enhance student learning.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollege students 3adecision making 3aeating habits 3ahigher education 3alearning 3anutrition 3anutritional intervention 3aregression analysis 0acritical thinking 0adecision making 0aSTEM education 0aproblem-based learning1 aSweetman, Sara1 aConnors, Priscilla1 aLofgren, Ingrid1 aGreene, Geoffrey0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2020 Apr., v. 52, no. 4 p.343-350dElsevier Inc.aSociety for Nutrition Education and BehaviorwJournal:jnl70490x1499-40467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2019.06.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245015600209500002200365506011700387506007600504520099900580592002801579506003701607650002101644650003001665650001201695650001401707650002101721650003201742650002401774650001101798650000801809653001901817653002001836653001901856653000901875653000901884653001601893773010901909856005102018852000902069655001202078IND60795644020221207103223.0221004s2022    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079564402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtemin.2022.1000242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNedjimi, Bouzid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2049-735210aAnalytical determination of some mineral and trace elements in medicinal Castor plant (Ricinus communis L.) by instrumental neutron activation analysis  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInstrumental neutron activation analysis (INNA) has been applied to determine some mineral and trace elements (As, Ba, Br, Ca, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Eu, Fe, K, La, Na, Rb, Sb, Sc, Sm, Tb, Th, and Zn) in Ricinus communis L.

The precision of method was evaluated by analyzing the certified reference material GBW 07605 (GSV-4) Tea leaves. The INNA analysis shows that Ca and K were the most abundant minerals in R. communis, followed by Na and Fe. The average estimation of daily intake of some chemical elements through the ingestion of 10 g day⁻¹person⁻¹ contributes partially to the daily requirements of some essential elements such as Ca, Cr, Fe, and K.

But excessive use of metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) in various industrial sectors may lead to detrimental impacts on our environment in the near future. Among NPs, applications of nanoiron in various industrial sectors are gradually increasing and its interaction with the soil-plant system is an area still to be explored. In this review, we have focused upon positive as well as the negative impact of nanoiron in plants. As per available literature, it is evident that higher concentration of nanoiron causes oxidative stress while lower concentration leads to plant growth promotion. In addition to this, review also highlights the uptake, translocation and accumulation of nanoiron in plant system which subsequently leads to alterations in the morpho-physiological, biochemical and molecular traits of plants. Moreover, various factors contributing towards the translocation of nanoiron in shoot and root system of plants has been duly discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agrowth promotion 3ananoparticles 3aoxidative stress 3aplant growth 3aroot systems 0aNanoiron 0aplants 0atranslocation 0aascorbate glutathione cycle 0adual role1 aSharma, Samarth1 aTripathi, Sneha1 aPrakash, Ved1 aTiwari, Kavita1 aSuri, Shubhangi1 aSharma, Shivesh0 tPlant nano biology.g2022 Sept. 22,  p.100017-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:28687x2773-11117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plana.2022.100017  aDNAL 7aarticle02075naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100003100190245009000221300001800311500001400329506007600343520072600419592002801145506003701173650001301210650001701223650002101240650001501261650002001276650001301296650002201309700002001331700005701351700005801408773011801466856008401584852000901668655001201677IND60677847120221207134852.0200117e20191114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067784712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.9b009002doi7 aPMC69688852pmcid7 a317243942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToledo-Patiño, Saacnicteh10aReconstructing the Remote Origins of a Fold Singleton from a Flavodoxin-Like Ancestor  ap. 4790-4793.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEvolutionary processes that led to the emergence of structured protein domains left footprints in the sequences of modern proteins. We searched for such hints employing state-of-the-art sequence analysis and found evidence that the HemD-like fold emerged from the flavodoxin-like fold through segment swap and gene duplication. To verify this hypothesis, we reverted these evolutionary steps experimentally, constructing a HemD-half that resulted in a protein with the canonical flavodoxin-like architecture. These results of fold reconstruction from the sequence of a different fold strongly support our hypothesis of common ancestry. It further illustrates the plasticity of modern proteins to form new folded proteins.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aancestry 3aarchitecture 3agene duplication 3aplasticity 3aprotein domains 3aproteins 3asequence analysis1 aChaubey, Manish1 aColes, Murray1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6716-61501 aHöcker, Birte1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8250-94620 tBiochemistry.g2019 Nov. 14, v. 58, no. 48 p.4790-4793dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b009003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013000168300001800298520094100316592002801257650000801285650002101293650002101314650001201335650001101347650002001358653004401378653002001422653003301442653002901475653001401504700001201518700001701530773013301547856008401680852000901764655001201773IND60340722820221119223543.0150808e20151003xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034072282DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2014.9694972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Xiaolei10aElectromagnetic shielding effectiveness and wearing comfort of radiation protection fabrics based on gray clustering analysis  ap. 1089-1094.  aIn this study, the comprehensive property of several radiation protection fabrics was analyzed by gray clustering analysis (GCA).

The electromagnetic shielding effectiveness in different frequencies and wearing comfort, including tensile and bending property, air transmission and abrasive resistance, was investigated. GCA was carried out to evaluate the comprehensive property of samples by nine clustering objects and seven clustering indexes. In the process of data operation, MATLAB7.0 was used to calculate experimental results due to its high efficiency and accuracy. The results of clustering analysis demonstrated that nine samples can be divided into three gray classes, namely, 4# and 5# belonging to “first-rate”; 1#, 3#, and 6# belonging to “medium”; and 2#, 7#, 8#, and 9# belonging to “low-rate”.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abending strength 3acluster analysis 3afabrics 3asilver 3astainless steel 0aelectromagnetic shielding effectiveness 0awearing comfort 0aradiation protection fabrics 0agray clustering analysis 0aMATLAB7.01 aWei, Li1 aGe, Mingqiao0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2015 Oct. 3, v. 106, no. 10 p.1089-1094dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2014.9694973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010100171300001600272520099600288592002801284650002501312650002101337650002101358650001701379650001001396650001801406650001801424650001901442650000901461650001801470650001601488650001301504653001601517653001901533653001701552700001801569700002001587773011601607856008601723852000901809655001201818IND60529384120221120181541.0161019e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052938412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sandeep12aA facile green approach to prepare core-shell hybrid PLGA nanoparticles for resveratrol delivery  ap. 380-384.  aGreen approach has revolutionized the area of nanoparticles (NPs) synthesis by virtue of eco and health friendly protocols. Advancing this further, the study proposes a captivating solvent free method for the preparation of green PLGA-oil nanohybrids (G-PONHs) using acrysol oil and encapsulation of resveratrol therein. G-PONHs were structurally similar to the standard PONHs, but had larger particle size of 375nm. Avoidance of organic solvents resulted in the formation of smooth NPs which showed a considerable improvement in drug release profile and antioxidant properties. G-PONHs exhibited superior biocompatibility with normal Vero cells, while the cytotoxicity on breast cancer cells was moderate in comparison to standard NPs owing to their large size. The size of NPs was found to be a critical factor governing the amplitude of cytotoxicity. The comparative high stability of G-PONHs further favors the tremendous potential of this novel preparation method and delivery platform.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocompatibility 3abreast neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aencapsulation 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3aoils 3aparticle size 3aresveratrol 3asolvents 0aPolymer-oil 0aNanocomposites 0aSolvent-free1 aLather, Viney1 aPandita, Deepti0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Mar., v. 84 p.380-384dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001700190245009300207300001600300520150000316592002801816650002101844650001801865650001501883650000901898650001601907650001001923650000901933650003701942650002101979650001402000700001702014700001402031700001102045700002102056700001602077700001502093773010902108856008302217990002302300852000902323655001202332IND60098077120221121013546.0141104e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009807712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.09.0022doi7 aPMC48945262pmcid7 a229819372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrench, S.W.10aFAT10 knock out mice livers fail to develop Mallory–Denk bodies in the DDC mouse model  ap. 309-314.  aMallory–Denk bodies (MDBs) are aggresomes composed of undigested ubiqutinated short lived proteins which have accumulated because of a decrease in the rate of their degradation by the 26s proteasome. The decrease in the activity of the proteasome is due to a shift in the activity of the 26s proteasome to the immunoproteasome triggered by an increase in expression of the catalytic subunits of the immunoproteasome which replaces the catalytic subunits of the 26s proteasome. This switch in the type of proteasome in liver cells is triggered by the binding of IFNγ to the IFNγ sequence response element (ISRE) located on the FAT10 promoter. To determine if either FAT10 or IFNγ are essential for the formation of MDBs we fed both IFNγ and FAT10 knock out (KO) mice DDC added to the control diet for 10weeks in order to induce MDBs. Mice fed the control diet and Wild type mice fed the DDC or control diet were compared. MDBs were located by immunofluorescent double stains using antibodies to ubiquitin to stain MDBs and FAT10 to localize the increased expression of FAT10 in MDB forming hepatocytes. We found that MDB formation occurred in the IFNγ KO mice but not in the FAT10 KO mice. Western blots showed an increase in the ubiquitin smears and decreases β 5 (chymotrypsin-like 26S proteasome subunit) in the Wild type mice fed DDC but not in the FAT10 KO mice fed DDC. To conclude, we have demonstrated that FAT10 is essential to the induction of MDB formation in the DDC fed mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3adiet 3ahepatocytes 3aliver 3amice 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aprotein subunits 3aubiquitin1 aFrench, B.A.1 aOliva, J.1 aLi, J.1 aBardag-Gorce, F.1 aTillman, B.1 aCanaan, A.0 tExperimental and molecular pathology.g2012 Dec., v. 93, no. 3 p.309-314dElsevier Inc.x0014-48007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexmp.2012.09.0023Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245009100172300001600263520175400279592002802033650001202061650002202073650002102095650002602116650001002142650001402152650002902166650001102195650001002206650003202216650002002248650001902268650001802287650001902305651001802324653001202342653002102354653001402375653001402389653001302403653001802416653001602434700002102450700002902471700002502500773008802525856008602613852000902699655001202708IND60547269320221120064116.0160903e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054726932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.01.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShah, Sanjay B.10aAcidifier application rate impacts on ammonia emissions from US roaster chicken houses  ap. 576-583.  aDue to its potential environmental and public health impacts, emissions of ammonia (NH3) as well as several other gases from US livestock farms may be regulated. Broiler houses are important sources of NH3 emissions. However, there are no emissions data from roaster (8–12 wk old broilers, ∼4 kg ea.) houses. Producers treat the litter in broiler houses with acidifiers, such as sodium bisulfate (SBS, NaHSO4) to reduce ammonia production and protect bird health. However, there is very little data on the effect of acidifiers, particularly at high application rates on ammonia emissions. The impact of different SBS application rates [High (0.95–1.46 kg m−2, whole house), Medium (0.73 kg m−2, whole house), Low (0.37–0.49 kg m−2, whole house), and Control (0.37–0.49 kg m−2, brood chamber)] on ammonia emissions was evaluated in commercial roaster houses over 22 months spanning eight flocks. Ammonia emission from each fan was measured with an acid scrubber that operated only when the fan operated. Emissions were calculated using >95% measured data with the rest being estimated using robust methods. Exhaust ammonia–N concentrations were inversely correlated with the SBS application rates. Emission rates on animal unit (AU, where 1 AU = 500 kg live-mass) basis (ER, g d−1 AU−1) were reduced by 27, 13, and 5%, respectively, in the High, Medium, and Low treatments vs. the Control treatment (mean: 100 g d−1 AU−1, range: 86–114 g d−1 AU−1). Emission rates for the Control treatment measured in this study on roasters were mostly higher than ERs in the literature. Differences in ERs are not only due to diet, environmental and management conditions, but also due to measurement methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3aapplication rate 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abirds 3aemissions 3aenvironmental management 3aflocks 3agases 3alivestock and meat industry 3apoultry housing 3apoultry manure 3apublic health 3asodium sulfate 3aUnited States 0aBroiler 0aLitter amendment 0aAcid trap 0aImpingers 0aBubblers 0aEmission rate 0aVentilation1 aGrimes, Jesse L.1 aOviedo-Rondón, Edgar O.1 aWesterman, Philip W.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Aug., v. 92 p.576-583dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002200157245010100179300001600280520144900296592002801745650001901773650001501792650001101807650001201818650001501830650001801845650002001863650001301883650000901896650002001905650002301925650001101948650001501959650001501974653001101989653001802000653001602018653001502034700001802049700001902067700002202086700002302108700002602131700001902157700001902176700002102195773011302216856009202329852000902421655001202430IND60647590720221117063724.0190712e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064759072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2019.06.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrieger, Stefanie13aAn ear-attached accelerometer as an on-farm device to predict the onset of calving in dairy cows  ap. 190-199.  aThe objective of the present study of dairy cows was to analyse data collected by an ear-tag containing an accelerometer, prepartum and during birth, (1) to determine activity, rumination and lying time of the dams, (2) to use data to develop an algorithm to predict calving and (3) to test the performance of this algorithm. Four weeks before the expected day of calving, we fixed an ear-tag, which contained a tri-axial accelerometer, to the dam's right ear. In total, 894 calving data sets were eligible for the final analyses. In total, six input variables based on accelerometer data were used to develop an algorithm for calving prediction; rumination time, activity, and lying time of individual animals and in relation to the remaining animals in the group. To predict the impending calving on the basis of these input variables, transfer function models were used. The performance of the algorithm predicting parturition was determined at the time periods of −72, −48, −24, −12, −6, −3 and −1 h before the expulsion of the calf. The highest balanced accuracy was achieved at −1 h, with 74%. The highest sensitivity was achieved at −1 h (54%), whereas the lowest was at −72 h (19%). Our findings indicate that it is possible to predict parturition in dairy cows based on input variables from acceleration data.

Crop yields have increased significantly by breeding, often via heterosis, which is associated with increased plant and organ size primarily achieved by cell number increases. A small class of genes is now known that control plant and organ sizes though cell number or cell size. The fw2.2 gene was found to control a major QTL for tomato fruit size by negatively affecting cell numbers. Orthologs to these fw2.2 genes underlie QTLs for fruit sizes in other species, and their expression can be negatively correlated with increased cell number. In maize decreased or increased expression of the fw2.2 ortholog ZmCNR1, increases or decreases cell number, respectively, thereby affecting maize organ size throughout the plant and thus also whole plant size. Therefore, these genes should now be considered as more general regulators of plant cell number and organ size. The exact molecular function of these transmembrane domain proteins remains unknown, as does any clear relationship to the cell cycle. Because these genes control organ sizes in diverse plants and important crop species, and because they can affect whole plant size, interest arose into how effects of such genes could parallel agronomic crop improvements, in particular that by heterosis, as it also affects cell number. In joining these subjects here in discussion we speculate on how single gene cell number regulation and heterosis may cooperate in crop improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell cycle 3acorn 3acorrelation 3acrop yield 3acrops 3agenes 3aheterosis 3aproteins 3aquantitative trait loci 3atomatoes 2aCell Count 2aCell Size 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFruitxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aHybrid Vigor 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aZea maysxgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aSimmons, Carl R.0 tPlant science.g2011 July, v. 181, no. 1 p.1-7dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-94527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2011.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245008200170300001600252500056800268520063700836592002801473650001301501650002001514650002701534650001801561651001801579773013901597856008301736990002301819852000901842655001201851IND60612803920221123032426.0180907e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061280392DNAL7 a10.1097/NT.00000000000000582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyers, Esther F.10aIs Your Perspective Being Reflected in the Nutrition Public Policy Landscape?  ap. 237-243.  aAffiliations: Esther F.

The six other C. elegans IF proteins IFB-2, IFC-1, IFC-2, IFD-1, IFD-2 and IFP-1 are co-expressed in the intestinal terminal web during different developmental stages, reveal various differently penetrant RNAi phenotypes and form another heteropolymeric IFB-2/IFCDP-1 IF system in C. elegans. Interestingly, the alternatively spliced IFC-2 variant, called EXC-2, was recently found also to be needed for a normal excretory system maturation in C. elegans. In order to better understand the IFC-2 function in the nematode tissue, we retrieved from the WormBase its multiple predicted alternatively spliced transcripts and analysed them using the molecular, immunofluorescence and RNAi approaches. We found that the 21-exon long genomic fragment encodes, besides the two different intestinal IFC-2a and IFC-2b IF proteins, also the novel excretory cell/IF unrelated protein ECP-1 and probably also the large ECP-1/IFC-2 fusion protein EXC-2, which all seem to be tissue-specific regulated from different promoters. Our analyses provide a framework for investigating interactions between the novel ECP-1, EXC-2 and some other proteins, including IFs, which show a similar excretory canal phenotype and are essential for development of the C. elegans excretory cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aRNA interference 3aalternative splicing 3adevelopmental stages 3aexcretory system 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agenomics 3aintestines 3amultigene family 3aphenotype 3aproteins 0aC. elegans 0aCellular junction 0aExcretory cell 0aIntermediate filament 0aSplice transcript1 aSchulze, Ekkehard1 aBaumeister, R.q(Ralf),0 tGene expression patterns.g2019 Dec., v. 34 p.119061-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12408x1567-133X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gep.2019.1190613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245003000170300002000200520109300220592002801313650003201341650001601373650001701389650001201406650001101418650001301429650001801442650001701460650002101477650002101498650003401519650001601553650003501569650002701604650001701631700002301648700005701671773012501728856008301853852000901936655001201945IND60620644520190201000000.0181114e20180709xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062064452DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b000372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHüll, Katharina10aIn Vivo Photopharmacology  ap. 10710-10747.  aSynthetic photoswitches have been known for many years, but their usefulness in biology, pharmacology, and medicine has only recently been systematically explored. Over the past decade photopharmacology has grown into a vibrant field. As the photophysical, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic properties of photoswitches, such as azobenzenes, have become established, they have been applied to a wide range of biological targets. These include transmembrane proteins (ion channels, transporters, G protein-coupled receptors, receptor-linked enzymes), soluble proteins (kinases, proteases, factors involved in epigenetic regulation), lipid membranes, and nucleic acids. In this review, we provide an overview of photopharmacology using synthetic switches that have been applied in vivo, i.e., in living cells and organisms. We discuss the scope and limitations of this approach to study biological function and the challenges it faces in translational medicine. The relationships between synthetic photoswitches, natural chromophores used in optogenetics, and caged ligands are addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aepigenetics 3aion channels 3aligands 3alipids 3amedicine 3anucleic acids 3aoptogenetics 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aproteinases 3atranslational medical research 3atransmembrane proteins 3atransporters1 aMorstein, Johannes1 aTrauner, Dirk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6782-60560 tChemical reviews.g2018 July 09, v. 118, no. 21 p.10710-10747dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23337x1520-68907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.8b000373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02095naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245011300164300001800277500000900295520094600304592002801250650001501278650002401293650002401317650001401341650001701355650001601372650002501388650001501413700001401428700001701442700002001459700001401479773013901493852000901632856008001641655001201721IND4413834320221119204900.0191228e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441383432DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2007.0242N2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Dileep K.10aImproved Estimation of Soil Organic Carbon Storage Uncertainty Using First-Order Taylor Series Approximation  ap. 1708-1710.  aepub  aAssessment of soil organic C (SOC) stocks is important for monitoring the effect of land use change in the C cycle and for formulation of C sequestration strategies in the context of global climate change. Discrepancies among the recent global SOC estimates by different researchers underscore the importance of precise estimation of the uncertainty associated with the SOC stocks. A method was recently proposed to estimate the SOC storage uncertainty using the Taylor series of approximations. Here we show that the accuracy of SOC storage uncertainty can be improved by incorporating the covariance among the input variables. Measurement of input variables from independent samples or use of an incomplete model leads to either over- or underestimation of the SOC storage uncertainty. The application of the method to an experimental data set indicated that ignoring covariance would lead to a substantial overestimate of the uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aestimation 3amathematical models 3asoil organic carbon 3aequations 3abulk density 3amethodology 3acarbon sequestration 3acovariance1 aSingh, R.1 aKundu, D.

Their physiological role is uncertain because sperm stabilization and activation effects have been reported. To analyze a putative modulatory role for semen exosomes on sperm activity in the boar, the effects of these vesicles on several sperm functional parameters were examined. Additionally, boar exosome proteins were sequenced and their incorporation into sperm was explored. Boar sperm were incubated under conditions that induce capacitation, manifested as increased tyrosine phosphorylation, cholesterol loss and greater fluidity in apical membranes, and the ability to undergo the lysophosphatidylcholine-induced acrosome reaction. After establishing this cluster of capacitation-dependent functional parameters, the effect produced by exosomes when present during or after sperm capacitation was analyzed. Exosomes inhibited the capacitation-dependent cholesterol efflux and fluidity increase in apical membranes, and the disappearance of a 14-kD phosphorylated polypeptide. In contrast, the acrosome reaction (spontaneous and lysophosphatidylcholine-induced) was not affected, and sperm binding to the oocyte zona pellucida was reduced only when vesicles were present during gamete coincubation. Liposomes with a lipid composition similar to that present in exosomes mimicked these effects, except the one on zona pellucida binding. Interaction between exosomes and sperm was confirmed by transfer of aminopeptidase activity. In addition, the major exosome protein, identified as actin, appeared to associate with sperm after coincubation. Exosome composition had a predominance for structural proteins (actin, plastin, ezrin, and condensin), enzymes, and several porcine seminal plasma-specific polypeptides (e.g., spermadhesins). Transfer of proteins from exosome to sperm and their ability to block cholesterol efflux supports a direct interaction between these vesicles and sperm, whereas inhibition of some capacitation-dependent features suggests a stabilizing function for exosomes in boar semen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrosome reaction 3aactin 3aboars 3acholesterol 3aenzymes 3aexosomes 3alipid composition 3aphosphorylation 3apolypeptides 3aprotein composition 3aseminal plasma 3asperm capacitation 3aspermatozoa 3astructural proteins 3atyrosine 3azona pellucida 2aAcrosome Reaction 2aAnimals 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aExosomesxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMale 2aProteinsxchemistry 2aSemenxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aSpermatozoaxphysiology 2aSwinexphysiology 0aExosome 0aProstasome 0aSperm capacitation 0aBoar 0aSeminal plasma1 aFischman, M.

Analyses of different grebe tissues (egg yolk and albumen, pectoral and leg muscle, breast and primary feathers) also allowed us to assess the effectiveness of these tissues at representing grebe trophic relations. Isotopic ratios from pectoral and leg muscles were similar, based on comparisons within individual birds. Enriched values of δδ¹⁵N and δδ¹³C suggested that breast and primary feathers were molted over winter, and therefore reflected a marine food web. Albumen and yolk of grebe eggs and muscle tissues from downy chicks, however, matched isotopic characteristics of the local food web, indicating that female Red-necked Grebes use nutrients from the breeding lake for egg formation. Eggs, therefore, can provide excellent material for isotopic analysis aimed at assessing trophic relations of Red-necked Grebes on breeding lakes. Gut contents and stable isotopes both indicated that grebes from lakes with fish consumed a mixed diet of fish and macroinvertebrates and occupied the highest trophic level, at or above the level of piscivorous fishes. In contrast, grebes from lakes lacking fish occupied a lower trophic position.Relaciones Tróóficas de Podiceps grisegena en Lagos del Bosque Boreal del Oeste: Un Anáálisis de Isóótopos EstablesResumen.  Comparamos la ecologíía tróófica de Podiceps inferida a partir de anáálisis de isóótopos estables con la de contenidos estomacales y comparamos las relaciones isotóópicas de P. grisegena entre lagos que difieren en sus redes tróóficas. Los anáálisis de diferentes tejidos de P. grisegena (yema y albumen del huevo, múúsculo pectoral y de la pierna, plumas del pecho y primarias) tambiéén nos permitieron evaluar la efectividad de estos tejidos para representar las relaciones tróóficas de P. grisegena. Las relaciones isotóópicas de los múúsculos pectorales y de las piernas basadas en comparaciones realizadas para cada ave individual fueron similares. Valores enriquecidos de δδ¹⁵N y δδ¹³C sugirieron que las aves mudaron las plumas del pecho y las primarias durante el invierno, y por lo tanto reflejaron una red tróófica marina. El albumen y la yema del huevo de P. grisegena y los tejidos musculares de pichones emplumados, sin embargo, coincidieron con las caracteríísticas isotóópicas de la red alimenticia local, indicando que las hembras de P. grisegena usan nutrientes del lago donde nidifican para la formacióón de los huevos. Los huevos, por lo tanto, pueden constituir un material excelente para anáálisis isotóópicos centrados en evaluar las relaciones tróóficas de P. grisegena en los lagos donde se reproducen. Los contenidos estomacales y los isóótopos estables indicaron que los individuos de P. grisegena provenientes de lagos con peces consumieron una dieta mixta de peces y macroinvertebrados y ocuparon la posicióón tróófica máás alta, al mismo nivel o por arriba de los peces piscíívoros. En contraste, los individuos provenientes de lagos sin peces ocuparon una posicióón tróófica menor.  aPublisher supplied data 0adiet 0aegg 0afood web 0aPodiceps grisegena 0aRed-necked Grebe 0astable-carbon isotope ratios 0astable-nitrogen isotope ratios1 aGingras, Beverly A.1 aWilcox, Kayedon1 aKlatt, Paul H.1 aTonn, William M.0 tThe Condor.g2004 Aug., v. 106, no. 3 p.638-651x1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1650%2F74403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245014400173520176600317592002802083650002702111650001702138650001802155650000802173650001602181650001602197650001402213650000702227650002302234650000902257650001202266700002502278700002202303700002002325773012702345856008502472852000902557655001202566IND60703375720221117193202.0200721e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070337572DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80608982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIacumin, Lucilla 10aListeria monocytogenes Survey in Cubed Cooked Ham Packaged in Modified Atmosphere and Bioprotective Effect of Selected Lactic Acid Bacteria  aThe aim of this work was to study the presence of Listeria monocytogenes, as well as the potential activity of two bioprotective cultures (Lyocarni BOX-74 and Lyocarni BOX-57), versus a mix of three L. monocytogenes strains that were intentionally inoculated in cooked cubed ham, packaged in Modified Atmosphere Packaging and stored at different temperatures. The bioprotective cultures limit L. monocytogenes growth in cubed cooked ham stored either at 4 °C for 60 days and at 4 °C for 20 days and at 8 °C for 40 days. The inhibition at 8 °C is particularly useful for industrial cooked meat products, considering there are often thermal abuse conditions (8 °C) in the supermarkets. Both the starters can eliminate L. monocytogenes risk and maintain the products safe, despite the thermal abuse conditions. In addition, both culture starters grew without producing perceptible sensory variations in the samples, as demonstrated by the panel of the untrained tasters. The bioprotective LAB produced neither off-odours and off-flavours, nor white/viscous patinas, slime, discoloration or browning. Therefore, according to the obtained data, and despite the fact that cooked cubed ham did not show pH ≤ 4.4 or aw ≤ 0.92, or pH ≤ 5.0 and aw ≤ 0.94, as cited in the EC Regulation 2073/2005. It can be scientifically stated that cubes of cooked ham with the addition of bioprotective starters cultures do not constitute a favourable substrate for L. monocytogenes growth. Consequently, these products can easily fall into category 1.3 (ready-to-eat foods that are not favourable to L. monocytogenes growth, other than those for infants and for special medical purposes), in which a maximum concentration of L. monocytogenes of 100 CFU g⁻¹ is allowed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3acooked foods 3adiscoloration 3aham 3alactic acid 3aoff flavors 3aoff odors 3apH 3aready-to-eat foods 3arisk 3asurveys1 aCappellari, Giorgia 1 aColautti, Andrea 1 aComi, Giuseppe 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 June 15, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80608983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011300171520113300284592002801417650001701445650002001462650001201482650001101494653002301505653002601528653001801554653002201572653002801594653001701622700002201639700002701661700002801688773011001716856008401826852000901910655001201919IND60729129220221119063931.0210619e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072912922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2021.1006682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalani, Ritesh S.10aKinetic modelling and process engineering aspects of biodesulfurization of liquid fuels: Review and analysis  aBiodesulfurization has been explored (as alternative to hydrodesulfurization) for deep desulfurization of liquid fuels. Previous lab-scale research has demonstrated efficacy of numerous microbial strains for desulfurization of heavy sulfur residues (basically benzothiophenes and their derivatives) in liquid fuels. This review has attempted to present an analysis of biodesulfurization literature from engineering perspective. Numerous kinetic models reported in literature are reviewed after grouping them in four categories on the basis of their approaches and features. Basic equations of these models and the biophysical insights provided by them are analyzed. The merits and limitations of these models from perspective of design of large-scale processes are identified. Process engineering issues of biodesulfurization with different reactor types and free/immobilized microbial cultures have been discussed for batch/continuous mode. Finally, an approximate analysis of sizing of the process for large-scale application is given with possible solutions in terms of improved biocatalyst and process intensification tools.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocatalysts 3adesulfurization 3aliquids 3asulfur 0aBiodesulfurization 0aMetabolic engineering 0a4–S pathway 0aKinetic modelling 0aProcess intensification 0aOptimization1 aBatghare, Amit H.1 aBhasarkar, Jaykumar B.1 aMoholkar, Vijayanand S.0 tBioresource technology reports.g2021 June, v. 14 p.100668-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2021.1006683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03916naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245009900207300002000306520205200326592002802378596005502406650002102461650001602482650001202498650001402510650002002524650001802544650001402562650001902576650000902595650002002604650001302624650001102637650003702648650001402685650002002699650001702719650001202736650002302748650001002771650001502781651002002796700002102816700002002837700002302857700001902880700002602899700003102925700003302956700002402989700002903013700002603042773015503068856008203223852000903305655001203314IND60743463120221120131313.0210707e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074346312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-13011-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMügler, Claude1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3129-734810aExperimental and modelling evidence of splash effects on manure borne Escherichia coli washoff  ap. 33009-33020.  aIn tropical montane South-East Asia, recent changes in land use have induced increased runoff, soil erosion and in-stream suspended sediment loads. Land use change is also contributing to increased microbial pathogen dissemination and contamination of stream waters. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is frequently used as an indicator of faecal contamination. Field rain simulations were conducted to examine how E. coli is exported from the surface of upland, agricultural soils during runoff events. The objectives were to characterize the loss dynamics of this indicator from agricultural soils contaminated with livestock waste, and to identify the effect of splash on washoff. Experiments were performed on nine 1 m² plots, amended or not with pig or poultry manure. Each plot was divided into two 0.5 m² sub-plots. One of the two sub-plots was protected with a mosquito net for limiting the raindrop impact effects. Runoff, soil detachment by raindrop impact and its entrainment by runoff, and E. coli loads and discharge were measured for each sub-plot. The results show that raindrop impact strongly enhances runoff generation, soil detachment and entrainment and E. coli export. When the impact of raindrops was reduced with a mosquito net, total runoff was reduced by more than 50%, soil erosion was on average reduced by 90% and E. coli export from the amended soil surface was on average 3 to 8 times lower. A coupled physics-based approach was performed using the Cast3M platform for modelling the time evolutions of runoff, solid particles detachment and transfer and bacteria transport that were measured for one of the nine plots. After estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil erodibility and attachment rate of bacteria, model outputs were consistent with measured runoff coefficients, suspended sediment and E. coli loads. This work therefore underlines the need to maintain adequate vegetation at the soil surface to avoid the erosion and export of soil borne potential pathogens towards downstream aquatic systems.  aPublisher supplied data  aANR-13-AGRO-0007cAgence Nationale de la Recherche 3aEscherichia coli 3aerodibility 3aexports 3ahighlands 3aland use change 3amosquito nets 3apathogens 3apoultry manure 3arain 3araindrop impact 3aresearch 3arunoff 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asediments 3asoil amendments 3asoil erosion 3astreams 3asuspended sediment 3aswine 3avegetation 3aSouth East Asia1 aRibolzi, Olivier1 aViguier, Marion1 aJaneau, Jean-Louis1 aJardé, Emilie1 aLatsachack, Keooudone1 aHenry-Des-Tureaux, Thierry1 aThammahacksa, Chanthamousone1 aValentin, Christian1 aSengtaheuanghoung, Oloth1 aRochelle-Newall, Emma0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 July, v. 28, no. 25 p.33009-33020dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13011-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02436naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245013800170300001800308520098700326592002801313650001901341650001901360650001101379650001301390650002101403650001301424650001101437650002101448650001701469650000701486650001901493650002101512700005901533700006001592700005901652700002201711700003001733700002501763773012301788856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60677847820200311000000.0191213e20191016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067784782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.9b010032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChapelle, Camille10aWater-Soluble 2,5-Anhydro-d-mannofuranose Chain End Chitosan Oligomers of a Very Low Molecular Weight: Synthesis and Characterization  ap. 4353-4360.  aFive chitosans with different degrees of N-acetylation (DAs), molar masses, and origins were depolymerized by nitrous acid treatment in acidic media, leading to water-soluble 2,5-anhydro-d-mannose chain end oligomers with DPn < 20. The kinetics of the reaction was studied, and the best work conditions were found to be 3 h reaction at 50 °C. It was shown that the DPn of oligomers only depends on the quantity of NaNO₂ involved. Molar masses or DAs do not have an impact on the depolymerization process when targeting oligomers with less than 20 units. This depolymerization process also leads to free 2,5-anhydromannofuranose (AMF) that might react with the free amines of obtained oligomers to form imines. This reaction is pH-dependent and in acidic condition leads to the formation of 5-hydromethyl-2-furfural (HMF).

Glyphosate-based herbicides are used globally in agriculture, forestry, horticulture, and in urban settings. Glyphosate can persist for years in our soil, potentially impacting the soil-dwelling arthropods that are primary drivers of a suite of ecosystem services. Furthermore, although glyphosate is not generally classified as neurotoxic to insects, evidence suggests that it may cause nerve damage in other organisms. In a series of experiments, we used food to deliver environmentally realistic amounts of Roundup ready-to-use III, a common 2% glyphosate-based herbicide formulation that lists isopropylamine salt as its active ingredient, to Madagascar hissing cockroaches. We then assessed the impact of contamination on body mass, nerve health, and behavior. Contaminated food contained both 30.6 mg glyphosate and so-called inert ingredients. Food was refreshed weekly for 26–60 days, depending on the experiment. We found that consumption of contaminated food did not impact adult and juvenile survivorship or body weight. However, consumption of contaminated food decreased ventral nerve cord action-potential velocity by 32%, caused a 29% increase in respiration rate, and caused a 74.4% decrease in time spent on a motorized exercise wheel. Such changes in behavior may make cockroaches less capable of fulfilling their ecological service, such as pollinating or decomposing litter. Furthermore, their lack of coordination may make them more susceptible to predation, putting their population at risk. Given the decline of terrestrial insect abundance, understanding common risks to terrestrial insect populations has never been more critical. Results from our experiments add to the growing body of literature suggesting that this popular herbicide can act as a neurotoxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGromphadorhina portentosa 3aactive ingredients 3aadults 3aat-risk population 3abody weight 3acell respiration 3aecosystems 3aexercise 3afood contamination 3aforestry 3aglyphosate 3ahorticulture 3ainsects 3ajuveniles 3anerve tissue 3aneurotoxicity 3aneurotoxins 3apollution 3apredation 3aresearch 3asoil 3asurvival rate 3aventral nerve cord 3aMadagascar1 aBauer, Samuel1 aEzedum, Zimuzo M.1 aDwyer, Ian P.1 aMoore, William S.1 aRodriguez, Gabriella1 aMall, Aditya1 aLittleton, Anne T.1 aYudell, Michael1 aKanabar, Jenil1 aTucker, Wade J.1 aDaniels, Emily R.1 aIqbal, Mohima1 aKhan, Hira1 aMirza, Ashra1 aYu, Joshua C.1 aO’Neal, Marvin1 aVolkenborn, Nils1 aPochron, Sharon T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3790-71970 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 July, v. 28, no. 25 p.32933-32944dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-13021-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04942naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094040001800116100002200134245008000156300001600236520411400252592002804366653001804394653001504412653002204427653001404449700001904463700002204482773006904504856007004573852000904643655001204652IND60125738020221121203814.0150428e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012573802DNAL7 a10.1650/74532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZicus, Michael C.10aFactors influencing incubation egg-mass loss for three species of waterfowl  ap. 506-516.  aAbstractMany bird eggs lose ∼∼15%% of their fresh mass before pipping, but individual species have been reported to lose 10––23%%. Most published estimates have been imprecise due to small sample sizes. Moreover, published estimates of within- or among-species variance components of mass loss are virtually unknown. We modeled the influence of nest type, clutch size, and egg size on daily mass loss of Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), Common Goldeneye (Bucephala clangula), and Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus) eggs and compared fractional mass loss among species. Mallard eggs in artificial nest cylinders lost more mass than those in ground nests, but were unaffected by nest initiation date. Average-sized eggs in Mallard ground nests, Mallard cylinder nests, and Common Goldeneye and Hooded Merganser nest boxes lost 7.9 g (15.2%%), 10.8 g (20.3%%), 10.3 g (15.5%%), and 9.2 g (15.8%%) of fresh mass, respectively. For all species, daily mass loss increased as incubation progressed and was affected by an interaction between egg size and incubation time, but was not influenced by clutch size. Depending on species, smallest eggs lost 1.0––4.0%% more of their fresh mass than did the largest. Egg-mass variability was partitioned into years, nests within years, and eggs within nests and years. Variability was evenly distributed among the variance components in Mallard ground nests; however, among-eggs within-nest variance predominated in nest cylinders. In contrast, among-nests variation was the dominant source for goldeneyes and mergansers. Nest-site selection and egg size likely involve trade-offs among optimum egg-mass loss and nest and hatchling survival.Factores que Influencian la Péérdida de Peso de los Huevos durante la Incubacióón en Tres Especies de Aves AcuááticasResumen.  Muchas aves pierden aproximadamente el 15%% de su peso fresco antes de iniciar la ruptura del cascaróón, pero se ha reportado que esto varíía entre especies entre el 10 y el 23%%. La mayoríía de los estimados publicados han sido imprecisos debido a tamaños de muestra pequeños. Máás aúún, los estimados de los componentes de la varianza dentro de especies o entre especies en la péérdida de peso son virtualmente desconocidos. En este estudio modelamos la influencia del tipo de nido, el tamaño de la nidada y tamaño del huevo sobre la péérdida diaria de peso en huevos de Anas platyrhynchos, Bucephala clangula y Lophodytes cucullatus, y comparamos la fraccióón de peso perdida entre especies. Los huevos de A. platyrhynchos perdieron máás peso en nidos cilííndricos artificiales que en nidos en el suelo, pero no fueron afectados por la fecha de iniciacióón de la nidificacióón. Huevos de tamaño promedio de A. platyrhynchos puestos en nidos en el suelo y en cilindros, y huevos de B. clangula y L. cucullatus puestos en cajas de nidificacióón, perdieron 7.9 g (15.2%%), 10.8 g (20.3%%), 10.3 g (15.5%%) y 9.2 g (15.8%%) de su peso fresco, respectivamente. Para todas las especies, la péérdida diaria de peso se incrementóó a medida que progresóó la incubacióón y fue influenciada por una interaccióón entre el tamaño de los huevos y el tiempo de incubacióón, pero no por el tamaño de la nidada. Dependiendo de la especie, los huevos máás pequeños perdieron entre 1.0 y 4.0%% máás de su peso fresco que los huevos máás grandes. La variabilidad en el peso de los huevos estuvo repartida entre años, entre nidos de un mismo año y entre huevos de un mismo nido en cada año. La variabilidad estuvo igualmente distribuida entre sus distintos componentes en los nidos de A. platyrhynchos del suelo. Sin embargo, la varianza entre huevos de un nido predominóó en los nidos puestos en cilindros. En contraste, la variacióón entre nidos fue la máás importante en B. clangula y L. cucullatus. La seleccióón de sitios de nidificacióón y el tamaño de los huevos probablemente involucran una solucióón de compromiso entre los niveles óóptimos de péérdida de peso de los huevos y de supervivencia de los nidos y pichones.  aPublisher supplied data 0aegg-mass loss 0aincubation 0anest microclimate 0awaterfowl1 aRave, David P.1 aRiggs, Michael R.0 tThe Condor.g2004 Aug., v. 106, no. 3 p.506-516x1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1650%2F74533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01717naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245004300172300001600215520082400231592002801055653001301083653001201096653001501108653002301123700002001146700001801166700002401184773011601208856008201324852000901406655001201415IND60729129420221118000958.0210226s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072912942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mset.2019.08.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatterjee, Bandhan10aNanozymes and aptamer-based biosensing  ap. 127-135.  aNanozymes are a class of artificial enzymes that have dimensions in nano range.

The starch granules of PS oxidized with high oxidant concentrations caused cracks and pores, and oxidation mainly acts on the amorphous regions of the starch granules. As the sodium hypochlorite concentration increases, the carbonyl content, carboxyl content, solubility, and pasting temperature of PS increased, as measured using a Rapid Visco Analyser (RVA). The swelling power, breakdown, setback, and peak and final viscosities decreased according to the RVA (P<0.05). The gel strength increased under low-intensity oxidative treatments and decreased under high-intensity oxidative treatments. Oxidative treatment decreased the digestibility of gelatinized potato starch. The slowly digestible starch and resistant starch contents increased significantly, while the rapidly digestible starch content decreased after the oxidation modification (P<0.05). Overall, PS oxidation with sodium hypochlorite improved the functional characteristics of starch and decreased starch digestibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorine 3acrystal structure 3adigestibility 3agel strength 3agelatinization 3agels 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apasting properties 3apotato starch 3aresistant starch 3asodium hypochlorite 3asolubility 3astarch granules 3aswelling (materials) 3atemperature 3atexture 3aviscosity 0aPotato starch oxidation 0aFunctional properties 0aDigestibility1 aLiu, Qian1 aZhang, Hongwei1 aChen, Qian1 aKong, Baohua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6417-68360 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Mar., v. 84 p.410-417dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.12.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245012300167300001800290520145900308592002801767650002101795650002801816650001501844650001801859650001101877650001201888650001001900650001101910650001301921650001301934650001101947650004201958653001402000653001802014653003202032653002202064700002802086700002302114773015302137856007902290852000902369655001202378IND60565420920221116205805.0190318e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056542092DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-118532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeissier, Isabelle10aShort communication: Early modification of the circadian organization of cow activity in relation to disease or estrus  ap. 3969-3974.  aBiological rhythms are an essential regulator of life. There is evidence that circadian rhythm of activity is disrupted under chronic stress in animals and humans, and it may also be less marked during diseases. Here we investigated whether a detectable circadian rhythm of activity exists in dairy cows in commercial settings using a real-time positioning system. We used CowView (GEA Farm Technologies) to regularly record the individual positions of 350 cows in a Danish dairy farm over 5 mo and to infer the cows' activity (resting, feeding, in alley). We ran a factorial correspondence analysis on the cows' activities and used the first component of this analysis to express the variations in activity. On this axis, the activities obtained the following weights: resting = −0.15; in alleys = +0.12; feeding = +0.34. By applying these weights to the proportions of time each cow spent on each of the 3 activities, we were able to chart a circadian rhythm of activity. We found that average level of activity of a cow on a given day and its variations during that day varied with specific states (i.e., estrus, lameness, mastitis). More specifically, circadian variations in activity appeared to be particularly sensitive and to vary 1 to 2 d before the farmer detected a disorder. These findings offer promising avenues for further research to design models to predict physiological or pathological states of cows from real-time positioning data.  aPublisher supplied data 3acircadian rhythm 3acorrespondence analysis 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3aestrus 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahumans 3alameness 3amastitis 3amodels 3apathological processes and conditions 0adairy cow 0aanimal health 0aprecision livestock farming 0abehavioral rhythm1 aMialon, Marie-Madeleine1 aSloth, Karen Helle0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 May, v. 100, no. 5 p.3969-3974dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-118533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100007000153245008400223300001600307520153700323592002801860650003001888650002601918650001701944650002301961650002301984650002602007650001002033650002202043650001202065650001102077650002302088650001302111650001602124650002402140650002202164651001202186653003202198653001702230653002402247653002502271653001602296700002102312700002302333700001602356700002102372700001402393773011902407856008802526852000902614655001202623IND60628255720221119021549.0191214e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062825572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.1742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilloslada Peciña, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7777-657710aCountry-scale mapping of ecosystem services provided by semi-natural grasslands  ap. 212-225.  aSemi-natural grasslands harbour high biodiversity and play a key role in the supply of ecosystem services (ES). However, abandonment, changes in traditional management practices and agricultural intensification constitute a major threat to these grasslands worldwide and these practices have led to declines in species diversity. In this paper the multi-functionality of semi natural-grasslands is assessed from the ES perspective, within a range of common semi-natural grassland types throughout Estonia. The analysis follows a stepwise approach based on the ES cascade model. Firstly, analyses of the relationships between plant species distribution patterns and environmental factors are described. Secondly, the effect of grassland abandonment on plant species diversity, as well as on the presence of rare and protected plant species is tested. In order to overcome the lack of data on ES at the national scale, plant species diversity and soil organic carbon are tested as surrogate indicators for five ESS: pollination, herbs for traditional medicinal use, nutrient cycling, nutrient retention and biomass production. In the final step, the spatial distribution of ES is assessed, based on an ES hotspots map obtained by detecting areas where high levels of plant species diversity and soil organic carbon overlap. The results show that the majority of ES hotspots are present in wooded meadows and pastures. However, there is an important threat to these hotspots because 45% are not eligible for agri-environmental support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagri-environmental policy 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiogeography 3abiomass production 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental factors 3aherbs 3aintensive farming 3ameadows 3amodels 3anutrient retention 3apastures 3apollination 3asoil organic carbon 3aspecies diversity 3aEstonia 0aEcosystem services hotspots 0aBiodiversity 0aSoil organic carbon 0aSurrogate indicators 0aAbandonment1 aWard, Raymond D.1 aBunce, Robert G.H.1 aSepp, Kalev1 aKuusemets, Valdo1 aLuuk, Ott0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 661 p.212-225dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.01.1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013600166300001600302520137200318592002801690650002101718650002201739650002801761650002101789650002601810650001701836650002901853650002401882650001501906650002001921650001301941650000701954650001401961650002201975650001601997650003102013650001602044650001702060650001502077650001202092650001902104650001102123650002102134651001002155653001402165653002402179653002802203653002602231653001702257700002002274700001402294700001902308700001802327700001802345700001502363773010502378856008502483852000902568655001202577IND60638040420221116211253.0190509e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063804042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Yanyu10aLinking plant community composition with the soil C pool, N availability and enzyme activity in boreal peatlands of Northeast China  ap. 144-154.  aPlant species composition influences belowground ecosystem function. However, there are few data on the interactive effects of plant diversity and soil function. We surveyed plant species diversity, and determined soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) fractions and enzyme activity in five peatlands with different vegetation-types. We also investigated the interactions between plant species diversity and richness, and soil biochemical properties. We found a close relationship between plant species diversity and total carbon (TC) in both surface (0–15 cm) and subsoil (15–30 cm) layers. Plant diversity and richness positively correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC), NH4+-N in both soil layers and subsoil moisture and total nitrogen (TN), as well as topsoil pH. Plant species diversity and richness were also positively correlated with subsoil moisture, pH, protease, acid phosphatase activity and topsoil urease activity. Soil β-glucosidase, invertase, urease, protease, and acid phosphatase activity positively correlated with soil TC, TN, DOC, available N and soil moisture. Our findings demonstrate that plant community diversity is linked with soil C and N turnover through soil enzyme activity. These results will improve our ability to more fully understand the linkages between aboveground and belowground components in peatland ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3aammonium nitrogen 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3abeta-glucosidase 3abotanical composition 3acarbon sinks 3adissolved organic carbon 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3anitrogen 3apH 3apeatlands 3aplant communities 3aproteinases 3asoil biological properties 3asoil carbon 3asoil enzymes 3asoil water 3atopsoil 3atotal nitrogen 3aurease 3avegetation types 3aChina 0aPeatlands 0aSpecies composition 0aPlant-soil interactions 0aNitrogen availability 0aSoil enzymes1 aSong, Changchun1 aShi, Fuxi1 aWang, Mingquan1 aRen, Jiusheng1 aWang, Xianwei1 aJiang, Lei0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Aug., v. 140 p.144-154dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245010400175300001600279520178400295592002802079650002502107650002302132650002002155650001102175650001502186650002402201650000902225650001702234651000902251651001002260653002202270653002702292653002602319653004002345700002302385700002002408773010502428856008502533852000902618655001202627IND60638040520221116211323.0190509e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063804052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakhshandeh, Esmaeil12aA cost and time-effective method to evaluate soil microbial respiration for soil quality assessment  ap. 121-125.  aSoil microbial respiration (SMR) is considered a robust estimate of potential soil biological activity. SMR measurement by incubation studies in laboratory conditions is a well-established technique, however is costly and time consuming depending on the selected incubation period. Based on 210 data available from Iran and Italy, we developed and validated (randomly selecting 70 and 30% of total data, respectively) a multiple linear regression analysis procedure for evaluating SMR. CumR (cumulative respiration during a 28 days incubation period) was evaluated from laboratory incubation measured at day 1 (R1d), day 2 (R2d) and day 4 (R4d), and CbasR (basal respiration at the last day of incubation, 28 days) from laboratory incubation at R4d. The best model prediction for CumR was found for the three parameters model (R1d, R2d and R4d; Adjusted R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 46.5), and was still accurate in the two parameters model (R1d and R4d; Adjusted R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 48.1) and in the one parameter model (R4d; Adjusted R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 57.2). Model prediction for CbasR from R4d was acceptable (Adjusted R2 = 0.71, RMSE = 3.64). Since the main aim of the study was to provide a time and cost-effective method for deriving CumR and CbasR, we can speculate that model prediction based on one parameter model (R4d) is still sufficiently accurate. The models were validated with a large data-set of laboratory measures from Italy (1050 samples) and very close relationships were found between actual and predicted values for both CumR and CbasR. Therefore, the proposed models can be used for the application of composite indexes for soil quality assessment and recommended for further research with the same methodology using other datasets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3amodels 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asoil 3asoil quality 3aIran 3aItaly 0aBasal respiration 0aCumulative respiration 0aLaboratory incubation 0aMultiple linear regression analysis1 aFrancaviglia, Rosa1 aRenzi, Gianluca0 tApplied soil ecology.g2019 Aug., v. 140 p.121-125dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2019.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01947naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245010000158300001600258520095900274592002801233650001601261650002301277650001201300650001001312650001501322650001401337700001401351700001901365700001401384773013501398856007901533852000901612655001201621IND60764824620221120141613.0220409e20110818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076482462DNAL7 a10.17221/169/2010-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisz, F.10aAssociation analysis of seven candidate genes with performance traits in Czech Large White pigs  ap. 337-344.  a&nbsp;In this study association analyses were performed between genes tagged SNP (IGF2, NAMPT, DGAT1, MYF4, MC3R, MC4R and MYOD1), performance traits (backfat thickness, lean meat content, average daily gain from birth to the end of the test, average daily gain in test) and estimated breeding values (EBVs) in a population of Czech Large White sows (n = 101).

In this study, an efficient pipeline combining geochemistry, high-throughput Fluidigmᵀᴹ functional gene amplification and sequencing was developed to analyze the suspended and attached microbial communities inhabiting five groundwater monitoring wells in the Illinois Basin, USA. The dominant taxa in the suspended and the attached microbial communities exhibited significantly different spatial and temporal changes in both alpha- and beta-diversity. Further analyses of representative functional genes affiliated with N₂ fixation (nifH), methane oxidation (pmoA), and sulfate reduction (dsrB, and aprA), suggested functional redundancy within the shallow aquifer microbiomes. While more diversified functional gene taxa were observed for the suspended microbial communities than the attached ones except for pmoA, different levels of changes over time and space were observed between these functional genes. Notably, deterministic and stochastic ecological processes shaped the assembly of microbial communities and functional gene reservoirs differently. While homogenous selection was the prevailing process controlling assembly of microbial communities, the neutral processes (e.g., dispersal limitation, drift and others) were more important for the functional genes. The results suggest complex and changing shallow aquifer microbiomes, whose functionality and assembly vary even between the spatially proximate habitats and fractions. This research underscored the importance to include all the interface components for a more holistic understanding of the biogeochemical processes in aquifer ecosystems, which is also instructive for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abasins 3agene amplification 3agenes 3agroundwater 3amethane 3amicrobiome 3aoxidation 3aresearch 3aspecies diversity 3asulfates 3aIllinois 0aShallow aquifer microbiomes 0aMultiplex PCR 0aTemporal-spatial affects 0aFunctional genes 0aSuspended vs attached microbial communities 0aCommunity assembly1 aSanford, Robert A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9607-98971 aConnor, Lynn1 aChee-Sanford, Joanne1 aWimmer, Bracken T.1 aIranmanesh, Abbas1 aShi, Liang1 aKrapac, Ivan G.1 aLocke, Randall A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3648-00051 aShao, Hongbo0 tWater research.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 202 p.117431-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2021.1174313Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245009000167520096500257592002801222650002501250650001601275650002201291650001201313650001901325650001301344650001801357650001301375650001401388650001301402650001101415650001601426653001801442653001801460653002201478653002101500700001601521700001501537700001901552700001501571700001901586773010001605856008701705852000901792655001201801IND60748287020221118055706.0220205e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074828702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1308952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Fan10aPreparation and characterization of quinoa starch nanoparticles as quercetin carriers  aQuinoa starch nanoparticles (QSNPs) prepared by nanoprecipitation method under the optimal condition was developed as a carrier for quercetin. The QSNPs prepared under the optimal condition (90 DMSO/H₂O ratio, 10 ethanol/solvent ratio, and ultrasonic oscillation dispersion mode) had the smallest particle size and polymer dispersity index through full factorial design. Compared with maize starch nanoparticles (MSNPs), QSNPs exhibited a smaller particle size of 166.25 nm and a higher loading capacity of 26.62%. Starch nanoparticles (SNPs) interacted with quercetin through hydrogen bonding. V-type crystal structures of SNPs were disappeared and their crystallinity increased after loading with quercetin. QSNPs was more effective in protecting and prolonging quercetin bioactivity because of their small particle sizes and high loading capacities.

The power generation system within asphalt pavement based on thermoelectric technology was studied in this paper. The characteristics of temperature difference between the pavement and ambient air, as well as the temperature gradient within road surface were investigated by collecting data on-site in different seasons. Based on this, a novel set of road thermoelectric generator system (RTEGS) was developed, which can generate electricity when there is a temperature difference between road surface and ambient air. In addition, a RTEGS prototype was fabricated to verify the energy generation capacity based on indoor and outdoor tests. Results showed that the output voltage of RTEGS was about 0.4V by asphalt mixture slab (300mm×300mm by size), when the temperature difference between road surface and ambient air was 15°C in winter. While in summer, the output voltage was about 0.6–0.7V, with a temperature difference of 25–30°C. This means that some 160kWh of energy can be obtained in 8h from a road of 1km in length and 10m in width. For asphalt pavement in tropical and subtropical regions, the large temperature difference would be more suitable for RTEGS. The findings and research experiments from this study will provide a good starting point and reference for the development and application of pavement thermoelectric technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abitumen 3adata collection 3aelectric generators 3aenergy 3apower generation 3asubtropics 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 0aThermoelectric generator 0aEnergy harvesting 0aAsphalt pavement 0aTemperature gradient1 aYuan, Dongdong1 aXu, Shudong1 aHu, Huitao1 aXiao, Jingjing1 aSha, Aimin1 aHuang, Yue0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 205 p.941-950dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03256naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245017300175300002000348520152300368592002801891650002201919650002001941650001601961650001201977650002501989650002602014650001102040650001302051650001502064650000902079650001402088650002002102650002002122650001002142650001702152650001502169650002402184650003502208650003202243650004902275653002402324653000902348653004202357653002202399700002002421700001702441700002502458773013502483852000902618856007502627655001202702IND4475655420221121004848.0160905e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447565542DNAL7 a242664962pmid7 a10.1021/jf40407672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhuja, Geetika10aGenome-Specific Granule-Bound Starch Synthase I (GBSSI) Influences Starch Biochemical and Functional Characteristics in Near-Isogenic Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Lines  ap. 12129-12138.  aNear-isogenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines differing at the Waxy locus were studied for the influence of genome-specific granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSSI/Waxy; Wx-A, Wx-B, Wx-D) on starch composition, structure, and in vitro starch enzymatic hydrolysis. Grain composition, amylose concentration, amylopectin unit-chain length distribution, and starch granule size distribution varied with the loss of functional GBSSI. Amylose concentration was more severely affected in genotypes with GBSSI missing from two genomes (double nulls) than from one genome (single nulls). Unit glucan chains (DP 6–8) of amylopectin were reduced with the complete loss of GBSSI as compared to wheat starch with a full complement of GBSSI. Wx-A and Wx-B had an additive effect toward short-chain phenotype of waxy amylopectin. Loss of Wx-D isoprotein alone significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the C-type starch granules. However, the absence of Wx-D in combination with Wx-A or Wx-B increased the B-type and C-type starch granules but decreased the volume of A-type starch granules. The rate of in vitro starch enzymatic hydrolysis was highest in completely waxy grain meal and purified starch. However, the presence of Wx-D reduced wheat starch hydrolysis as it increased the large A-type starch granule content (volume %) and reduced short chains (DP 6–8) in amylopectin. Factors such as small C-type starch granules, amylose concentration, and long chains of amylopectin (DP 23–45) also influenced wheat starch hydrolysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aadditive effect 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afunctional properties 3agenome 3agenotype 3ahydrolysis 3aloci 3aphenotype 3astarch granules 3astarch synthase 3awheat 3awheat starch 2aInbreeding 2aMolecular Structure 2aStarchxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aStarch Synthasexmetabolism 2aTriticumxchemistryxenzymologyxmetabolism. 0anear-isogenic wheat 0awaxy 0aamylopectin chain length distribution 0astarch hydrolysis1 aJaiswal, Sarita1 aHucl, Pierre1 aChibbar, Ravindra N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Dec. 11, v. 61, no. 49 p.12129-12138dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf40407673Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01630naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245006300162300001600225500002000241520071800261592002800979650002401007650001901031650002001050651001801070700002201088773014201110856007901252852000901331655001201340IND60680416420221122070340.0200105e200005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068041642DNAL7 a10.1111/0002-9092.000392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKer, Alan P.10aNonparametric Estimation of Crop Insurance Rates Revisited  ap. 463-478.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWith the crop insurance program becoming the cornerstone of U.S. agricultural policy, recovering accurate rates is of paramount interest. Lack of yield data presents, by far, the most fundamental obstacle to recovery of accurate rates. This article employs new methodology to estimate conditional yield densities and derive the insurance rates. In our application, we find the nonparametric kernel density estimator requires an additional twenty‐six years of yield data to estimate the shape of the conditional yield densities as accurately as the recently developed empirical Bayes nonparametric kernel density estimator. Such methodological improvements can significantly aid in ameliorating the data problem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural policy 3acrop insurance 3acrop production 3aUnited States1 aGoodwin, Barry K.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g2000 May, v. 82, no. 2 p.463-478dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/0002-9092.000393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170300001400267520165900281592002801940650002201968650002501990650003602015650001302051650001202064650002002076650001302096650002602109650001202135650001902147650002402166650001402190650001902204650002202223650001502245650001302260650002902273650002602302653003002328653002902358653000902387653000902396653002502405700002102430700002302451700002402474700002102498700001902519773011502538856008502653852000902738655001202747IND60638041120221120044354.0190913e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063804112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2019.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakatsu, Yukiko10aQuorum-dependent expression of rsmX and rsmY, small non-coding RNAs, in Pseudomonas syringae  ap. 72-78.  aPseudomonas syringae pathovars are known to produce N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHL) as quorum-sensing molecules. However, many isolates, including P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000), do not produce them. In P. syringae, psyI, which encodes an AHL synthase, and psyR, which encodes the transcription factor PsyR required for activation of psyI, are convergently transcribed. In P. amygdali pv. tabaci 6605 (Pta6605), there is one nucleotide between the stop codons of both psyI and psyR. However, the canonical stop codon for psyI in PtoDC3000 was converted to the cysteine codon by one nucleotide deletion, and 23 additional amino acids extended it to a C-terminal end. This resulted in overlapping of the open reading frame (ORF) for psyI and psyR. On the other hand, stop codons in the psyR ORF of P. syringae 7 isolates, including pv. phaseolicola and pv. glycinea, were found. These results indicate that many pathovars of P. syringae have genetically lost AHL production ability by the mutation of their responsible genes. To examine whether PtoDC3000 modulates the gene expression profile in a population-dependent manner, we carried out microarray analysis using RNAs prepared from low- and high-density cells. We found the expressions of rsmX and rsmY remarkably activated in high-density cells. The activated expressions of rsmX and rsmY were confirmed by Northern blot hybridization, but these expressions were abolished in a ΔgacA mutant of Pta6605.

For the grid-side, a novel controller is proposed for the first time to be successfully used for the DDWECS, which combining a proportional complex integral (PCI) current inner loop based on stationary reference frame (SRF) for regulating the grid-side current with a dc voltage outer loop for stabilizing the dc bus voltage and compare with the proportional resonant (PR) controller. A system simulation model is established by using the Matlab/Simulink to simulate the performance of the DDWECS and a prototype system has been build and tested to verify the validity of the developed control methods for both machine-side and grid-side and the excellent performance of the DDWECS.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3acontrol methods 3aelectric power 3aenergy conversion 3amagnetic materials 3asimulation models 3avector control 3awind power 0aCurrent vector control 0aGrid-connected direct-drive wind energy conversion system 0aProportional complex integral control 0aRotating reference frame 0aStationary reference frame1 aLin, Heyun1 aFeng, Yi1 aZhu, Z.Q.0 tRenewable energy.g2014 June, v. 66 p.371-380dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2013.12.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245009900156300001600255520119600271592002801467650002101495650002001516650001501536650000901551650001101560650001601571700001801587700001201605773013601617856007501753852000901828655001201837IND60764825320221123003050.0220904e20101101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076482532DNAL7 a10.17221/1698-cjas2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGumulka, M.10aLaying pattern parameters in broiler breeder hens and intrasequence changes in egg composition  ap. 428-435.  aThe aim of the study was to analyze the pattern of oviposition time in laying sequences in broiler breeder hens and to determine a relationship between egg position in the sequence and egg quality. The sequences were described using mean oviposition time (hour) within a sequence, mean lag of oviposition time between successive ovipositions, and mean and cumulative lag of oviposition for a sequence. Egg weight, percentage of egg components and shape index were determined for successive eggs in a sequence. The 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- to 6- and 7- to 9-egg sequences were considered. The light/dark regime was 16 h/8 h (05:00 a.m. to 09:00 p.m.). Hens laid the first egg in a sequence about 3.5 h after the beginning of the photoperiod. With increasing sequence length, the first egg was laid sooner after the beginning of the photoperiod and the intervals between successive ovipositions shortened. This suggests that when planning the frequency of egg collection in a flock of broiler breeder hens, one should account for changes in the egg sequence length during the production period. No significant relationship between egg position in the sequence and quality of egg components was observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abroiler breeders 3aegg composition 3aegg weight 3aeggs 3aflocks 3aoviposition1 aKapkowska, E.1 aMaj, D.0 tCzech Journal of Animal Science.g, v. 55, no. 10 p.428-435dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:14567x1212-18197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/1698-cjas3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245014300169300001800312520098000330592002801310596007201338650002501410650001701435650001801452650000901470650001001479700002301489700001601512700005601528773013701584856008301721852000901804655001201813IND60784292320221120160901.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078429232DNAL7 a10.1007/s10068-022-01100-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNosal, Briana M.10aImpact of coffee preparation on total phenolic content in brewed coffee extracts and their contribution to the body’s antioxidant status  ap. 1081-1088.  aAlthough coffee has been reported as a major contributor to antioxidants in the diet, there are limited studies assessing how brewing methods and types of coffee affect antioxidant capacity of coffee consumers. This study was aimed to investigate the impact of coffee preparation on total phenolic content in brewed coffee extracts and their contribution to antioxidant status. We examined how the different brewing methods affect total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity in brewed coffee extracts, then assessed the antioxidant status of coffee consumers after drinking coffee. Results showed that consuming capsule versus French press coffee provides a higher total phenolic content and drinking capsule coffee leads to greater antioxidant status as shown by the higher total antioxidant capacity in urine. Further studies can expand on this by using a broader range of brewing methods to evaluate the contribution of brewing methods of coffee to antioxidant status.  aPublisher supplied data  a1R03ES027983-01A1cFoundation for the National Institutes of Health 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiotechnology 3adiet 3aurine1 aSakaki, Junichi R.1 aKim, Dae-Ok1 aChun, Ock K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7391-23800 tFood science and biotechnology.g2022 July, v. 31, no. 8 p.1081-1088dSpringer Nature SingaporewJournal:J000000073x1226-77087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10068-022-01100-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245011400177300002000291500001500311520087500326592002801201650002501229650002301254650001401277650001301291650001501304650001001319650000901329650001601338650001701354650001101371650001701382650002801399650002201427650003601449650002001485650001301505650003001518650002401548653001401572653002101586653003601607653001301643653002101656653001501677700002201692700002601714700002401740700002201764700002201786773013501808852000901943856007501952655001202027IND4475655920221121020135.0160905e20131211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447565592DNAL7 a242743662pmid7 a10.1021/jf402620b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aContini, Claudia10aOverall Migration and Kinetics of Release of Antioxidant Compounds from Citrus Extract-Based Active Packaging  ap. 12155-12163.  a2019-12-05  aOverall migration (OM) tests were conducted on an antioxidant active packaging prepared by coating plasma pretreated and untreated polyethylene terepthalate (PET) trays with a citrus extract.

The results demonstrated the compliance of the packaging with the limit for OM for plastic material in contact with food. The validity of the procedure for OM in aqueous food simulants was questioned, with the loss of volatile compounds during evaporation of the simulant resulting in an underestimation of total compounds released.

The research area was located in the marginal zone of the Carpathian Foothills (Poland) in the Stara Rzeka catchment (mixed land-use) and its two sub-catchments: Leśny Potok (wooded) and Kubaleniec (farmed). Hydrochemical studies were carried out during the 1998&ndash;2004 water years and with separate recording frequencies for individual parameters. Measures used included specific conductance (SC), pH and the concentration of the main ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2</sup>&ndash;, Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup>) and nutrient compounds (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> , NO<sub>2</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3&ndash;</sup>). Tendencies towards changes in chemical parameters were estimated using the Seasonal Kendall Test. Elimination of flow rate impact on the chemical composition of stream waters was achieved using the residuals from the LOWESS analysis. During the analysed period, a statistically significant increase in SC and the concentration of the majority of main ions occurred. Additionally, there was an increase in the concentration of nutrient compounds in watercourses undergoing the anthropogenic impact (Kubaleniec, Stara Rzeka), as opposed to the Leśny Potok stream draining the wooded catchment. The SC changes were determined by a decrease in the annual river run-off and simultaneous ion concentration (natural factor). In the Stara Rzeka catchment, the increase in NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> concentration was caused by the increase in sewage discharge into the river (anthropogenic factor). Another factor that contributed to the annual changes of water chemistry was gradually deeper and deeper water-circulation (circulation factor), responsible for an increase in the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&ndash;</sup> and a decrease of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&ndash;</sup>3&ndash; and Ca<sup>2+</sup>.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3achemical composition 3ahydrochemistry 3aland use 3apH 3aresearch 3arivers 3arunoff 3asewage 3asoil 3astreams 3aPoland1 aŻelazny, M.1 aChełmicki, W.0 tSoil and Water Research.g, v. 3, no. 3 p.129-137dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21421x1801-53957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/17/2008-swr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02676naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012300166300001800289520146000307592002801767650001601795650001201811650001401823650001501837650001001852650001601862653003201878653003101910653002501941653002301966653002701989700001602016700001602032700001702048700001702065773010002082856008702182852000902269655001202278IND60582055020221122220307.0180830e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058205502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yan10aRefractory failure in entrained-flow gasifier: Vision-based macrostructure investigation in a bench-scale OMB gasifier  ap. 1091-1099.  aAs the key component of the entrained-flow gasifier, the refractory experiences high temperature, while also suffering the impacts of high speed gas flow and massive particle impacts accompanied with molten slag. These issues are causing corrosion and erosion that shorten the gasifier service life. Based on a bench-scale opposed multi-burner (OMB) gasifier, the refractory macrostructure failure is investigated by vision-based techniques. The whole refractory is cut into cross-sections and along the vertical direction to study the corrosion. From these samples, it is possible to classify the refractory failure into six zones by utilizing the penetration depth (calculated by area) coupled with simulations of particle trajectories. Refractory surface erosion is investigated through contour arithmetical mean deviation by employing a light field camera to measure the surface height distribution in each cross section. The space distributions of refractory corrosion and erosion present different characteristics which could guide the future design and optimization of OMB gasifiers. The extent of corrosion distribution can be concluded as follows: impinging up-flow zone>impinging down-flow zone>dome zone>impinging/burner zone>plug-flow zone>cone zone. Meanwhile, the extent of surface erosion distribution can be concluded as follows: impinging down-flow zone>impinging/burner zone>cone zone>dome zone>impinging up-flow zone and plug-flow zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarithmetics 3acameras 3acorrosion 3adurability 3aslags 3atemperature 0aEntrained-flow gasification 0aOpposed multi-burner (OMB) 0aRefractory corrosion 0aRefractory erosion 0aRefractory penetration1 aZhang, Qing1 aZhu, Huiwen1 aGuo, Qinghua1 aYu, Guangsuo0 tApplied energy.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 205 p.1091-1099dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.08.0953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245023100176300001600407520164300423592002802066596007002094596006502164650001702229650002002246650001102266650000702277700001902284700001802303700002802321700002402349773011802373856008302491852000902574655001202583IND60784292620221120172427.0220726e202207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078429262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10337-022-04160-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKahsay, Birhanu Nigusse10aDevelopment and Validation of a Simple, Selective, and Accurate Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatographic Method with Diode Array Detection (RP-HPLC/DAD) for the Simultaneous Analysis of 18 Free Amino Acids in Topical Formulations  ap. 665-676.  aEven though there are reported methods for the quantification of free amino acids (FAAs) in biological products, no work has been done on the analysis of these substances in formulations. Moreover, further research is required as the reported methods do not fulfill analytical method requirements. The objective of this study was, therefore, to develop and validate a rapid, reliable, and appropriate RP-HPLC/DAD method for the simultaneous determination of 18 FAAs (L-Ala, L-Arg, L-Asn, L-Asp, L-Gln, L-Glu, L-Gly, L-His, L-Ile, L-Lue, L-Lys, L-Met, L-Orn, L-Phe, L-Pro, L-Ser, L-Thr, and L-Val) in topical formulations. After appropriate method development, the technique was validated for selectivity, linearity and range, limit of detection, limit of quantification, precision, and accuracy. The samples were derivatized with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (Fmoc-Cl). Chromatographic separation was performed on InfinityLab Poroshell 120 E.C 18 (3 × 50) mm, 2.7 μm column at 25 °C. The mobile phase consisting of water and acetonitrile adjusted to appropriate pH was pumped in gradient mode at a flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Ten microliters were injected and analyte detection was conducted using a DAD. The results indicate that the method was selective for these FAAs. It was linear over the concentration range of 5–80 µM with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.995. Moreover, it was sensitive, precise, accurate, and robust. All the reported drawbacks of RP-HPLC-based analysis of FAAs were resolved, and hence, this new method can be considered appropriate for the analysis of these FAAs in topical formulations.  aPublisher supplied data  aGrant Number 57369155cGerman Academic Exchange Service New Delhi  a01DG17008BcBundesministerium für Forschung und Technologie 3aacetonitrile 3adetection limit 3adiodes 3apH1 aMoeller, Lucie1 aImming, Peter1 aNeubert, Reinhard H.

Juvenile specimens (n = 10) ranging from one month old to eight months old were studied. For comparison, bones from adults and juveniles from museum specimens (n = 4 and n = 6, respectively) were studied. In fresh bones, ossification centres were identified in the proximal and distal epiphyses of the tibiotarsi and in the proximal epiphysis of the tarsometatarsi, whereas the distal region of the femora and tarsometatarsi showed abundance of cartilage. The development and extension of the ossification centres of the tibiotarsi were different. In the proximal epiphysis, the centre presented less development with respect to the distal epiphysis. In the dry tibiotarsi, the proximal centre was absent and the distal one was well preserved. Both the fresh and dry juvenile tarsometatarsi presented unfused metatarsals and bulkier and wider aspect than the adult ones. The dry femora presented a noticeable excavation between condyles, whereas the dry tarsometatarsi showed the absence of the proximal epiphysis. The femora, tibiotarsi and tarsometatarsi possessed different traits of immaturity, which differentially affect the morphology of the preserved bones during a taphonomic process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhea americana 3aadults 3abone formation 3acartilage 3aepiphyses 3afemur 3ajuveniles1 aBarbeito, Claudio Gustavo0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2018 Oct., v. 47, no. 5 p.398-404dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.123673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013800166300001600304520106300320592002801383650001201411650001401423650002301437650001301460650001101473650003101484650001301515700001501528700002501543773009201568856008401660990002301744852000901767655001201776IND60092422520221118000821.0141103e20110430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009242252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2010.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaba, Laura10aPerformance of bifunctional Pd/MₓNyO (M=Mg, Ca; N=Zr, Al) catalysts for aldolization–hydrogenation of furfural–acetone mixtures  ap. 451-456.  aThe performance of different bi-functional Pd catalysts (supported on Mg–Zr, Mg–Al and Ca–Zr mixed oxides) for the aqueous-phase aldol-condensation of acetone and furfural was studied in this work. Experiments were carried out in a batch slurry reactor at 323–393K. Activity trends, as well as selectivity for the formation of the different adducts (C₈ and C₁₃), were correlated with the physico-chemical properties of the materials, mainly with the distribution of acid and basic sites. In general, it was observed that the catalyst with the lowest concentration of basic sites (Pd/Ca–Zr) presents the poorest performance. By contrast, the presence of medium-strength acid sites (as the observed in the case of one the Pd/Mg–Al catalyst) seems to enhance the catalytic activity of the material. Although selectivities trends were similar for the catalysts supported on Mg–Zr and Mg–Al catalysts, the ability of the materials for catalyzing the formation of the heaviest adducts depends mainly on the total concentration of basic sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afurfural 3aoxides 3aphysicochemical properties 3aslurries1 aDiaz, Eva,1 aOrdóñez, Salvador,0 tCatalysis today.g2011 Apr. 30, v. 164, no. 1 p.451-456dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2010.11.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04180naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245020400172520226200376592002802638650001202666650002402678650002502702650001602727650001802743650001602761650001702777650001602794650001802810650001402828650001202842650001802854650002002872650002002892650000902912650002302921650001502944650001502959650002602974650001303000650001503013650001103028650002903039650001903068650002903087650001203116650001903128651001903147653001803166653001103184653000803195653001803203653002303221653002703244700002003271700002403291700001703315773009903332856009003431852000903521655001203530IND60744478820221120153700.0210911e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074447882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.7371772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavies, S.J.12aA Solid-State Fermentation (SSF) supplement improved performance, digestive function and gut ultrastructure of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fed plant protein diets containing yellow lupin meal  aA nutritional investigation was conducted to determine whether growth performance, feed efficiency and midgut morphology of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is affected by United Kingdom cultivars of Yellow Lupin (Control, Y) (LC) compared to the addition of a commercial solid-state fermentation product (SSF) in separate dietary treatments 0.1 and 0.5% (LS0.1 and LS0.5, respectively). At the end of feeding trial, LC- and LS0.1-fed fish did not differ from one another, whilst significant improvement was observed in LS0.5 fed fish (P < 0.05). Apparent digestibility of crude protein and crude fibre were significantly higher in fish fed LS0.1 and LS0.5 than LC. No significant differences (P < 0.05) in Haemoglobin (Hb) concentrations were observed among dietary treatments. Fish fed the 0.1% SSF inclusion exhibited significantly (P < 0.001) higher haematocrit (Hct) concentration than all other treatments. Significantly (P < 0.005) higher serum glucose levels were observed in FMC fed fish compared to fish fed LC and LS0.1, whilst elevation was also observed in LS0.5 over LC and LS0.1. Activity of serum lysozyme was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the LS0.5 treatment compared to LC, S0.1 and FMC groups. Fish fed 0.5% SSF were observed to have a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in goblet cell counts (GC) compared to those fed LC and LS0.1.). Median enterocyte height (EH) of LS0.1 and LS0.5 fed fish did not differ from one another but were both significantly greater than LC fed fish. Mean microvilli length (MVL), diameter (MVD) and enterocyte apical area (EAA) did not differ significantly between dietary treatments (P > 0.05). Fish fed 0.5% SSF displayed a higher microvillar percentage coverage (MVCV) compared to fish fed LC and LS0.1.

Here, it is shown that the introduction of oxygen gas into the free-radical polymerization of n-butyl acrylate (nBA) results in high conversion of the monomer in a very short time at temperatures above 140 °C without the use of any conventional initiators. By conducting first-principles calculations based on density functional theory, this work for the first time identifies and kinetically studies the most-likely reactions via which molecular oxygen contributes to polymer chain initiation. It provides theoretical and experimental evidence that molecular oxygen acts as a catalyst in alkyl acrylate free-radical polymerization at high temperatures. A triplet diradical intermediate is generated from solvated oxygen reacting with an alkyl acrylate monomer. The intermediate then reacts with another monomer and thermally dissociates from molecular oxygen to proceed toward polymerization. This theoretical finding is supported by laboratory experiments showing that in the presence of a very small amount of molecular oxygen and in the absence of any thermal initiators, free-radical polymerization of nBA occurs sustainably and proceeds to a very high monomer conversion. This work opens a new path for a more economic and sustainable production of higher-quality acrylic polymers using molecular oxygen as an initiator catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylates 3acatalysts 3adensity functional theory 3aoxygen 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aChua, Lauren1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8065-29891 aShamsabadi, Ahmad Arabi1 aCorcoran, Patrick1 aPatra, Abhirup1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2446-80171 aGrady, Michael C.1 aSoroush, Masoud1 aRappe, Andrew M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4620-64960 tMacromolecules.g2021 Aug. 16, v. 54, no. 17 p.7925-7930dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c006693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009900164520107500263592002801338650001401366650001301380650001001393650001901403650001301422650001301435650001401448650001301462650001901475650002301494650001401517653001801531653001301549653001901562653001701581700001401598700001801612700001601630700001701646700001801663700001701681773010001698856008701798852000901885655001201894IND60748287920221118055716.0220205e20220201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074828792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1309122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Gan10aGel properties of heat-induced transparent hydrogels from ovalbumin by acylation modifications  aIn this paper, the effects of acylation modification on the gel behavior of ovalbumin (OVA) under heating induction have been investigated. From the obtained results, the acylated OVA hydrogels exhibited superior gelation properties than the native OVA hydrogels (NOVA-G) in terms of light transmission, gel hardness, resilience and water holding capacity. SEM revealed acylation modifications effectively promoted the formation of uniform and dense network structure of OVA hydrogels. The main intermolecular forces of the acylation-modified OVA hydrogels were hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. FTIR showed that acylation modifications caused 26.2% decrease in α-helix and 59.2% increase in β-sheet content compared to NOVA-G. Furthermore, in-vitro release experiments showed that the release rate of curcumin from acylated OVA hydrogels was significantly delayed. Moreover, the above results have shown that acylation modifications can be considered as an effective method to improve the gelation as well as drug release properties of protein hydrogels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacylation 3acurcumin 3adrugs 3afood chemistry 3agelation 3ahardness 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3alight transmission 3aovalbumin 0aSuccinylation 0aHydrogel 0aGel properties 0aDrug release1 aMa, Meihu1 aBatool, Zahra1 aSheng, Long1 aCai, Zhaoxia1 aLiu, Yuanyuan1 aJin, Yongguo0 tFood chemistry.g2022 Feb. 01, v. 369 p.130912-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.1309123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012700171300001800298520117000316592002801486650001601514650002401530650001701554650001601571650001401587650001901601650001901620650001301639650002501652650002201677650002201699700007001721700006301791773012001854856008401974852000902058655001202067IND60750409620221123015603.0210915e20210825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075040962DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.1c007542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKenath, Gopal S.10aSuper-Resolution Imaging of Spatial Heterogeneities in Model Thermosensitive Hydrogels with Implications for Their Origins  ap. 7743-7753.  aThree-dimensional nanoscale cross-link density variations are an important and incompletely understood morphological aspect of polymer gels. Here, within the context of establishing a deeper understanding of these so-called spatial heterogeneities, we study the spatial distribution of dye-tagged acrylamide monomers in bulk thermosensitive PNIPAM gels using a combination of 3D STED and multicolor confocal microscopy. We identify consistent microstructural trends for the various dye-tagged monomers, thereby expanding the prevailing picture of spatial heterogeneities in thermosensitive gels. Specifically, we provide new morphological insights into the distribution of cross-links, the nature of the interface that defines the polymer-rich regions, and the incidence and connectivity of higher cross-link density regions as a function of quench time and preparation temperature. While phase separation and reactivity rate constant differences have only been studied in isolation as the dominant cause of spatial heterogeneities in thermosensitive gels, our results show that both phenomena play an important role in determining cross-link density distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aconfocal microscopy 3acrosslinking 3adye binding 3ahydrogels 3aimage analysis 3amicrostructure 3apolymers 3aspatial distribution 3aspatial variation 3athermosensitivity1 aKaranastasis, Apostolos A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9966-78731 aUllal, Chaitanya K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7178-897X0 tMacromolecules.g2021 Aug. 25, v. 54, no. 17 p.7743-7753dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.1c007543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02705naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245016300208520114000371592002801511650004701539650005301586650002201639650002001661650001101681650001501692650002401707650001301731650000901744650001001753651001601763653002201779653002201801653001101823653001801834653001701852653000701869653000701876653000701883653001201890653000701902700001801909700001701927700001701944700001801961700001901979773009501998856008502093852000902178655001202187IND60638041820221123043016.0191214e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063804182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1529372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Young Bok1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8642-247910aAssociations between urine iodine and allergic diseases in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013–2015: A STROBE-compliant article  aThe associations between excessive iodine intake and allergic diseases have not been evaluated.We aimed to investigate the associations of allergic diseases with urinary iodine concentration (UIC).A nation-wide population-based survey conducted by the the Korean Centers for Disease Control and PreventionIn total, 5598 participants older than 19 years who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013–2015 were enrolled for analysis.

Keggin-type tungstosilicious and tungstophosphoric acids (H₄SiW₁₂O₄₀ and H₃PW₁₂O₄₀) were found to be highly efficient for the alcoholysis of cellulose. Methyl and ethyl glucosides (both containing α and β isomers) could be obtained in methanol and ethanol with yields as high as 57% and 63%, respectively. The ratio of α and β isomers was ∼1.4–1.6 in both methyl or ethyl glucosides, suggesting the intermolecular transformations between α and β isomers. Our comparative studies show that the alcoholysis of cellulose in methanol or ethanol proceeds more efficiently than the hydrolysis of cellulose in water medium. Glucose yields of only about 5–10% were obtained in water in the presence of an acid catalyst under similar reaction conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3amethylcellulose 3amethanol 3aglucose 3aacids 3acatalysts 3aalcoholysis 3aisomers 3aglucosides 3ahydrolysis 3acatalytic activity 3aethanol 0acellulose1 aLiu, Mi1 aZhang, Qinghong1 aWang, Ye0 tCatalysis today.g2011 Apr. 30, v. 164, no. 1 p.461-466dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2010.10.0553Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009800157300001600255500001100271520126600282592002801548596006901576650002001645650001901665650000901684650002501693650001401718650002501732651001001757700006101767773011001828856007301938852000902011655001202020IND60613040020221120221036.0180911e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061304002DNAL7 a10.1111/cla.122232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Yuanting10aPartition number, rate priors and unreliable divergence times in Bayesian phylogenetic dating  ap. 568-573.  aLETTER  aMore loci/partitions should improve Bayesian estimation of divergence times on phylogenies but it has recently been shown that this can lead to surprisingly poor estimation due to the way it affects the prior on mean substitution rate. Here we consider the likely impact of partition number on divergence time analyses carried out using the program BEAST. Mitochondrial genome data from toad‐headed lizards (genus Phrynocephalus) from the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau were used to examine this effect. Under increased partitioning of the sequences, BEAST posterior divergence times became unreasonably narrow and downwardly biased due to misspecification of the mean substitution rate prior. This effect was detectable when relatively few partitions were used (i.e. between four and eight), but became very acute for 27–86 partitions. Fortunately, a correction that adjusts the standard deviation of the mean of locus rates led to results that were equivalent to those obtained using the latest version of the program MCMCtree, which implements a new gamma‐Dirichlet prior to overcome this problem. A review of the literature shows that a substantial number of BEAST dating studies are likely to have been affected by this misspecification of the rate prior.  aPublisher supplied data  a31372183a31772447cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aBayesian theory 3aPhrynocephalus 3aloci 3amitochondrial genome 3aphylogeny 3astatistical analysis 3aChina1 aBrown, Richard P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2401-60770 tCladistics.g2018 Oct., v. 34, no. 5 p.568-573dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39879x0748-30077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cla.122233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02138naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011000171300001600281520105900297592002801356650001501384650001401399650002301413650002201436650001101458700002101469700002001490700002101510700002201531700002701553773009201580856008401672990002301756852000901779655001201788IND60092422920221118000649.0141103e20110430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009242292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cattod.2010.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirata, Hirohito10aCharacterization and dynamic behavior of precious metals in automotive exhaust gas purification catalysts  ap. 467-473.  aBoth the behaviors of sintering and reactivation of Pt and Rh on various metal oxide supports were investigated by TEM, CO pulse chemisorption and XAFS analysis. The results suggest that phenomenon of reversible sintering and re-dispersion to reduced, active metallic sites is related to the electron density of O atoms in support and to the crystal structure of support. As a result of in situ XAFS and in situ TEM analysis, Pt reversible sintering and re-dispersion phenomenon was observed on CeO2 based metal oxide. The Pt re-dispersion process proceeds by the repetition of (1) migration of Pt oxide from the surface of large Pt particles, (2) adsorption of Pt oxide on the surface of CeO₂ based metal oxide by strong Pt–O–Ce interaction and (3) reduction Pt oxide and Pt–O–Ce bond. To achieve a good balance between activity and the sintering suppression, CeO₂ based metal oxide is selected as Pt support, and ZrO₂ is used as Rh support. The blended catalyst of Pt on ceria based oxide and Rh on ZrO₂ has higher activity after aging.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3ametals1 aKishita, Keisuke1 aNagai, Yasutaka1 aDohmae, Kazuhiko1 aShinjoh, Hirofumi1 aMatsumoto, Shin’ichi0 tCatalysis today.g2011 Apr. 30, v. 164, no. 1 p.467-473dElsevier B.V.x0920-58617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2010.11.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011100170506002800281506003200309520154500341592002801886596008301914506003701997650001702034650001202051650001002063650001102073650001202084650001602096650001802112650001502130650001702145650001802162650001102180650001802191650001102209650002202220650001902242650001902261650001702280650001902297650002002316650002502336650002102361650001802382650001102400650001402411650001102425700002302436700002002459700002102479773012602500856008502626852000902711655001202720IND60703372620221207102509.0200721e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070337262DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80506992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRho, Hyungmin 10aEndophytes Increased Fruit Quality with Higher Soluble Sugar Production in Honeycrisp Apple (Malus pumila)  aResource is Open Access  aMDPI AG License Information  aEndophytes are fungi, bacteria, or yeast symbionts that live in the intercellular spaces or vascular tissues of host plants. Investigations indicate that endophytes isolated from the Salicaceae family (Populus and Salix) hosts provide several benefits that promote plant growth, including but not limited to di-nitrogen fixation, plant hormone production, nutrient acquisition, stress tolerance, and defense against phytopathogens. In exchange, the microorganisms receive domicile and photosynthates. Considering the known characteristics of nitrogen fixation and plant hormone production, we hypothesized that apple trees grown under nitrogen-limited conditions would show improved biometrics with endophyte inoculation. Our research objectives were to investigate the endophyte effects on plant physiology and fruiting. We examined these effects through ecophysiology metrics involving rates of photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and density, transpiration, biomass accretion, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, and fruit soluble sugar content and biomass. Our results showed evidence of the endophytes’ colonization in apple trees, decreased stomatal density, delayed leaf senescence, and increased lateral root biomass with endophytes. A highlight of the findings was a significant increase in both fruit soluble sugar content and biomass. Future research into the mechanistic underpinnings of this phenomenon stands to offer novel insights on how microbiota may alter carbohydrate metabolism under nitrogen-deficient conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMalus pumila 3aPopulus 3aSalix 3aapples 3abiomass 3achlorophyll 3aecophysiology 3aendophytes 3afluorescence 3afruit quality 3afruits 3alateral roots 3aleaves 3anitrogen fixation 3aphotosynthates 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aplant hormones 3aplant pathogens 3astomatal conductance 3astress tolerance 3asugar content 3asugars 3asymbionts 3ayeasts1 aVan Epps, Victor  1 aKim, Soo-Hyung 1 aDoty, Sharon L. 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 May 10, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80506993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245012500178300001400303520163000317592002801947650002501975650002102000650000902021650001402030650001102044650001502055650000902070650002002079650002002099650001802119650000902137653002402146653001902170653001902189653001102208700002102219700002102240700002602261773008802287856009002375852000902465655001202474IND60545290620221119143605.0220906e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054529062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPardue, Michael J.10aTreatment of oil and grease in produced water by a pilot-scale constructed wetland system using biogeochemical processes  ap. 67-73.  aConstructed wetland treatment systems (CWTSs) can effectively remove many constituents that limit beneficial use of oilfield produced water. The objectives of this investigation were: (1) to assess the effect of mass loadings of oil and grease (O & G) on treatment performance in pilot-scale subsurface flow and free water surface CWTS series having sequential reducing and oxidizing cells, and (2) to evaluate effects on treatment performance of adding a pilot-scale oil–water separator. Increase in O & G mass loading from 5 to 20mgmin⁻¹ caused decreases in both dissolved oxygen concentration and sediment redox potential, which affected treatment performance. Biogeochemical pathways for removal of O & G, iron, and manganese operate under oxidizing conditions, and removal rate coefficients for these constituents decreased (0.905–0.514d⁻¹ for O & G, 0.773–0.452d⁻¹ for iron, and 0.970–0.518d⁻¹ for manganese) because greater mass loading of O & G promoted reducing conditions. With increased mass loading, removal rate coefficients for nickel and zinc increased from 0.074 to 0.565d⁻¹ and from 0.196 to 1.08d⁻¹, respectively. Although the sequential reducing and oxidizing cells in the CWTS were very effective in treating the targeted constituents, an oil–water separator was added prior to wetland cells to enhance O & G removal at high inflow concentration (100mgL⁻¹). The oil–water separator removed approximately 50% of the O & G, and removal extents and efficiencies approximated those observed at 50mgL⁻¹ inflow concentration during treatment without an oil–water separator.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstructed wetlands 3adissolved oxygen 3airon 3amanganese 3anickel 3aoil fields 3aoils 3aredox potential 3asubsurface flow 3asurface water 3azinc 0aConstructed wetland 0aProduced water 0aOil and grease 0aMetals1 aCastle, James W.1 aRodgers, John H.1 aHuddleston, George M.0 tChemosphere.g2014 May, v. 103 p.67-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.11.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03500naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245008800179520210700267592002802374650001502402650003002417650001702447650002202464650001102486650001502497650001802512650001502530650001302545650002202558650002102580650001702601653001502618653002102633653002302654653003202677653001802709700002402727700002002751700003202771700002702803773011602830856008702946852000903033655001203042IND60778746820221118104616.0220906e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077874682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamzat, Abdulhammed K.10aApplication of nanofluid in solar energy harvesting devices: A comprehensive review  aThe increase in energy demand due to population explosion and the recent global pandemic stressed the need to maximize solar energy harvesting. Nanofluids are used to enhance the performance of solar collectors due to the desirable inherent thermal properties of the fluid. One of the major research trends in solar energy utilization is improving the efficiency of the harvesting devices. Hence, investigating the performance of nanofluid-based solar energy harvesting devices is of great importance. The review presents an overview of the recent advancement in nanofluid-based solar energy harvesting devices and how various parameters such as nanoparticle size, concentration, shapes, and nanofluid flow rates can be manipulated to efficiently harness solar energy from the sun. The type of working fluid used in the collectors significantly influences its performance, and nanofluid performed excellently compared to the conventional fluid. This study investigates the role of nanofluids in various solar-powered desalination systems, parabolic trough solar collectors, flat plate solar collectors, solar dishes, direct absorption solar collectors, evacuated tube solar collectors, solar cookers, and the photovoltaic thermal system. The collector performance was compared for the system with nanofluid and convectional fluid as working fluid based on the heat transfer performance, exergy and energy efficiency improvement, and thermal efficiency enhancement. It is found that maximum collector performance enhancement is obtained using nanofluid. More freshwater was produced with low energy input into a nanofluid-based solar-powered desalination system. The review will update readers on the recent progress made in the field, identify the current challenges and proffer suggestions on how the practical problems can be solved. It is hoped that the review will help young researchers, funding agencies, investors, government, and journal outlets understand the recent advances in this area and what needs to be done for the commercialization of nanofluid as a working fluid in solar collectors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadministrative management 3adesalination 3aenergy efficiency 3aexergy 3afreshwater 3aheat transfer 3ananofluids 3apandemic 3apopulation growth 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 0aNanofluids 0aSolar collectors 0aThermal efficiency 0aPhotovoltaic thermal system 0aSolar cookers1 aOmisanya, Mayowa I.1 aSahin, Ahmet Z.1 aRopo Oyetunji, Oluremilekun1 aAbolade Olaitan, Nafiu0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 266 p.115790-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1157903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245027000163300001600433500001900449520153000468592002801998650003302026650002402059650001402083650001102097650002802108650002402136650001302160650002202173650001102195650001102206650002302217651001102240653001702251653002002268653001602288653002102304700002502325700002402350773014202374856007502516852000902591655001202600IND60732979720221121230903.0210402e20201029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073297972DNAL7 a10.1093/jme/tjaa2282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChilongo, Kalinga10aEffects of Human Settlements and Spatial Distribution of Wing Vein Length, Wing Fray Categories and Hunger Stages in Glossina morsitans morsitans (Diptera: Glossinidae) and Glossina pallidipes (Diptera: Glossinidae) in Areas Devoid of Cattle in North-Eastern Zambia  ap. 891-899.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe effect of human-associated habitat degradation on tsetse populations is well established. However, more insights are needed into how gradual human encroachment into tsetse fly belts affect tsetse populations. This study investigated how wing vein length, wing fray categories, and hunger stages, taken as indicators of body size, age, and levels of access to hosts, respectively, in Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) and Glossina pallidipes Austen (Diptera: Glossinidae), varied along a transect from the edge into inner parts of the tsetse belt, in sites that had human settlement either concentrated at the edge of belt or evenly distributed along transect line, in north-eastern Zambia. Black-screen fly round and Epsilon traps were used in a cross-sectional survey on tsetse flies at three sites, following a transect line marked by a road running from the edge into the inner parts of the tsetse belt, per site. Two sites had human settlement concentrated at or close to the edge of the tsetse belt, whereas the third had human settlement evenly distributed along the transect line. Where settlements were concentrated at the edge of tsetse belt, increase in distance from the settlements was associated with increase in wing vein length and a reduction in the proportion of older, and hungry, tsetse flies. Increase in distance from human settlements was associated with improved tsetse well-being, likely due to increase in habitat quality due to decrease in effects of human activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlossina morsitans morsitans 3aGlossina pallidipes 3abody size 3acattle 3across-sectional studies 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahuman settlements 3ahumans 3ahunger 3amedical entomology 3aZambia 0atsetse flies 0atsetse fly belt 0asettlements 0ahuman activities1 aManyangadze, Tawanda1 aMukaratirwa, Samson0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2020 Oct. 29, v. 58, no. 2 p.891-899dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl45776x0022-25857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjaa2283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245016700176300001400343520129900357592002801656650001301684650002401697650001201721650001101733650001501744650001401759650001901773650002301792650001601815650001801831651001001849653005301859653002601912653003001938653004101968700001602009773008802025856009002113852000902203655001202212IND60545290720221119143517.0220906e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054529072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajput, Prashant10aPolar and non-polar organic aerosols from large-scale agricultural-waste burning emissions in Northern India: Implications to organic mass-to-organic carbon ratio  ap. 74-79.  aThis study focuses on characteristics of organic aerosols (polar and non-polar) and total organic mass-to-organic carbon ratio (OM/OC) from post-harvest agricultural-waste (paddy- and wheat-residue) burning emissions in Northern India. Aerosol samples from an upwind location (Patiala: 30.2°N, 76.3°E) in the Indo-Gangetic Plain were analyzed for non-polar and polar fractions of organic carbon (OC1 and OC2) and their respective mass (OM1 and OM2). On average, polar organic aerosols (OM2) contribute nearly 85% of the total organic mass (OM) from the paddy- and wheat-residue burning emissions. The water-soluble-OC (WSOC) to OC2 ratio, within the analytical uncertainty, is close to 1 from both paddy- and wheat-residue burning emissions. However, temporal variability and relatively low WSOC/OC2 ratio (Av: 0.67±0.06) is attributed to high moisture content and poor combustion efficiency during paddy-residue burning, indicating significant contribution (∼30%) of aromatic carbon to OC2. The OM/OC ratio for non-polar (OM1/OC1∼1.2) and polar organic aerosols (OM2/OC2∼2.2), hitherto unknown for open agricultural-waste burning emissions, is documented in this study. The total OM/OC ratio is nearly identical, 1.9±0.2 and 1.8±0.2, from paddy- and wheat-residue burning emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aagricultural wastes 3aburning 3acarbon 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aplant residues 3atemporal variation 3auncertainty 3awater content 3aIndia 0aPost-harvest agricultural-waste burning emission 0aPolar organic aerosol 0aNon-polar organic aerosol 0aOrganic mass-to-organic carbon ratio1 aSarin, M.M.0 tChemosphere.g2014 May, v. 103 p.74-79dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02229naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245007800165520114800243592002801391650000901419650002201428650002401450650001301474650002201487650001101509650002201520650001901542651001001561653002701571653002301598653002001621653001001641700001701651773009401668856008401762852000901846655001201855IND60706790220221123041634.0210114e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070679022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1118022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xiaoqi10aDecomposition analysis of debt’s impact on China’s energy consumption  aDebt can influence the energy consumption of private sectors and public agencies by changing their fiscal budget constraints. From 1996 to 2016, China has had rapid debt growth and become the second-largest borrower in the world. Additionally, China has been the largest energy consumer since 2009. The impact of debt growth on its energy consumption, however, is not much addressed in the literature. Using an extended LMDI model, we investigate the impact of China’s debt on its energy consumption from 1996 to 2016 in a new way. The results show that (1) among the closed set of debt-related factors and other conventional variables studied, private debt per capita makes the strongest contribution to China’s energy consumption, and population has a moderate impact on the growth of energy consumption; (2) energy efficiency improvement, output efficiency of government debt, debt structure adjustment, and increased tertiary industry share are mitigating forces of energy consumption. These results provide a new, holistic perspective for the Chinese government to formulate synergistic policies of risk control and pollution control.  aPublisher supplied data 3adebt 3aenergy efficiency 3agovernment agencies 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apollution control 3arisk reduction 3aChina 0aDecomposition analysis 0aEnergy consumption 0aDebt’s impact 0aChina1 aLiu, Xiaojia0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Nov., v. 146 p.111802-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1118023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011000159300002000269520111700289592002801406650002201434650001201456650001701468650002301485650001101508650002201519650001401541650001201555650001701567650002201584650001401606653003101620653002301651653001901674653003501693653002801728700001701756700001601773700001601789700001301805700001701818773012601835856008001961852000902041655001202050IND60572260720221123003041.0170713e20170712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057226072DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b058702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Manman10aTwo-Dimensional Imine-Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks as a Platform for Selective Oxidation of Olefins  ap. 22856-22863.  aTwo-dimensional imine-linked covalent organic frameworks with hydroxyl groups, TAPT-DHTA-COFHX and TAPT-DHTA-COFDMF, were respectively constructed by the condensation of 1,3,5-tris-(4-aminophenyl)triazine and 2,5-dihydroxyl-terephthalaldehyde under solvothermal and reflux conditions. Both COFs possess excellent thermal stability and a similar eclipsed stacking structure verified by XRD patterns. However, TAPT-DHTA-COFHX presented a larger surface area (2238 m²/g) and higher crystallinity than TAPT-DHTA-COFDMF. Significantly, copper ions are efficiently incorporated into the pores of these two COFs via the coordination interaction with hydroxyl groups and imine linkers. The obtained copper-containing COFs (Cu-COFHX and Cu-COFDMF) were employed in the selective oxidation of styrene to benzaldehyde. Cu-COFHX with superior surface area (1886 m²/g) and pore volume (1.11 cm³/g) exhibited excellent catalytic performance and recyclability. This strategy not only provides a convenient approach to design imine-linked 2D COFs with hydroxyl groups, but also develops their novel application for catalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalkenes 3abenzaldehyde 3acatalytic activity 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3aoxidation 3astyrene 3asurface area 3athermal stability 3atriazines 0acovalent organic framework 0asynthetic strategy 0acopper docking 0aselective oxidation of olefins 0aheterogeneous catalysis1 aWang, Yanwen1 aQin, Yutian1 aYan, Xilong1 aLi, Yang1 aChen, Ligong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 July 12, v. 9, no. 27 p.22856-22863dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b058703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245008500162300001600247520075300263592002801016650001601044650001901060650001201079650000901091650001001100650002101110650001101131650001901142650001101161653001401172653001601186653000801202653001901210653001601229653002601245653001701271653001801288653002801306700002601334773012101360856007701481852000901558655001201567IND60517567620221118052112.0160331e20150507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051756762DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2015-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMech, L.

Therefore, it is important to determine whether that wolf–prey system fits a long-standing model relating wolf density to prey biomass. Using data from 2005 to 2012 after elk population fluctuations dampened 10 years subsequent to wolf reintroduction, we found that NR prey biomass predicted wolf density. This finding and the trajectory of the regression extend the validity of the model to prey densities 19% higher than previous data and suggest that the model would apply to wolf–prey systems of even higher prey biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aCervus elaphus 3abiomass 3aelks 3ahosts 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anational parks 3awolves 0agray wolf 0aCanis lupus 0aelk 0aCervus elaphus 0aYellowstone 0apopulation regulation 0aprey biomass 0abiomass index 0aintraspecific mortality1 aBarber-Meyer, Shannon0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2015 May 7, v. 93, no. 6 p.499-502dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x0008-43017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2015-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245013000165300001600295520184900311592002802160650002602188650002602214650002302240650002302263650001002286650001102296650002602307650002102333650001102354650001402365650002902379651001702408653001402425653001402439653002402453653001702477653002502494700001802519773015602537856008302693852000902776655001202785IND60525640320221118185823.0190318e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052564032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2015.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeyl, P.S.R.10aMorphological variations in southern African populations of Myriophyllum spicatum: Phenotypic plasticity or local adaptation?  ap. 241-246.  aVariability in aquatic plant morphology is usually driven by phenotypic plasticity and local adaptations to environmental conditions experienced. This study aimed to elucidate which of these drivers is responsible for the morphological variation exhibited by three populations of Myriophyllum spicatum L. (Haloragaceae), a submerged aquatic plant whose status as native or exotic within southern Africa is uncertain. Individuals from three populations on the Vaal River (Northern Cape), Klipplaat River (Eastern Cape) and Lake Sibaya (KwaZulu-Natal) were grown under two nutrient treatments (high: 30mgN/kg sediment and low: sediment only), while all other variables were kept the same. Morphological characteristics were measured at the start of the experiment to obtain a baseline morphology, and again eight weeks later. By the end of the experiment, the individuals from each population had responded to the different growing conditions. In most cases, the individuals from each population were significantly larger under the high nutrient treatment (Stem diameter: F(5,86)=18.435, P<0.001, Internode length: F(5,86)=5.0747, P<0.001, Leaf length: F(5,86)=19.692, P<0.001). Despite these differences in nutrient treatments, the growth pattern of each population remained true to the original starting point indicated by the lack of overlap between populations in the PCA groupings. This suggests that local adaptations are responsible for the differences in morphology between populations of M. spicatum, but shows that phenotypic plasticity does play a role as evidenced by individual responses to the different nutrient conditions. The development of these local adaptations within southern Africa suggests that the populations have had a long evolutionary history in the region and are relatively isolated with little reproductive mixing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyriophyllum spicatum 3aenvironmental factors 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3alakes 3aleaves 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aplant morphology 3arivers 3asediments 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3aSouth Africa 0aGenotypes 0aGene flow 0aGeographic barriers 0aHaloragaceae 0aIsolated populations1 aCoetzee, J.A.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2016 Mar., v. 103 p.241-246dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2015.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245013300164520120700297592002801504650002201532650003301554650001301587650001801600650001501618650002001633650002101653650002101674650001301695650001801708650001801726650001501744650001901759653002801778653002201806653002601828700001801854700001501872700005801887700001701945700001801962700001701980700001601997700001602013773010602029856008702135852000902222655001202231IND60653802920221116153218.0190726e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065380292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1218152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yu10aGenetic associations as indices for assessing nitrogen transformation processes in co-composting of cattle manure and rice straw  aIn this study, mechanism of nitrogen transformation was investigated in terms of genetic associations (nitrogen-related gene groups) in co-composting of cattle manure and rice straw. Mutual validation among KEGG, Pearson correlation, stepwise regression, and Path analyses indicated that the functional genes synergistically affected on nitrogen transformation in composting process. NxrA/qnorB (0.9419 ± 0.0334) and (amoA + anammox)/Bacteria (0.7187 ± 0.0334) were the key functional gene groups mediating NH4+-N transformation. AmoA/(narG + napA) (−0.8400 ± 0.0129), amoA/bacteria (0.8692 ± 0.0273), and (nirK + nirS)/nosZ (1.1652 ± 0.0089) determined NO3−-N, NO2−-N and N2O transformation, respectively. AmoA/(napA + narG) mediated both NO3−-N and NO2−-N transformation. AmoA/anammox (−0.7172 ± 0.0591) and (nirK + nirS)/nosZ (−0.6626 ± 0.0825) served as predominant factors for total nitrogen removal. These results provided a molecular-level insight that nitrification, anaerobic ammonia oxidation and denitrification (SNAD) might simultaneously contribute to nitrogen transformation during composting, rather than sequentially.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacteria 3acattle manure 3acomposting 3adenitrification 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrite nitrogen 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3apath analysis 3arice straw 3atotal nitrogen 0aNitrogen transformation 0aGenetic synergism 0aFunctional gene group1 aSheng, Siyuan1 aJiang, Xin1 aBello, Ayodeji1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3258-216X1 aWu, Xiaotong1 aMeng, Qingxin1 aDeng, Liting1 aXu, Xiuhong1 aLi, Hongtao0 tBioresource technology.g2019 Nov., v. 291 p.121815-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1218153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245009600153300001600249500001900265520181200284592002802096650001102124650002202135650001502157650001902172650001102191650001602202650001402218650001002232650000902242650002102251650001202272650001302284650001102297650001402308650000902322650001502331653001602346653000902362653001602371653001002387700002102397700001502418700001202433700001802445773011402463856007102577852000902648655001202657IND60722552820221120222544.0210105s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072255282DNAL7 a10.1071/AN201422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKopp, K. J.14aThe production and composition of colostrum from ewes supplemented with niacin (vitamin B3)  ap. 117-122.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aContext Twin-bearing ewes may be unable to produce enough colostrum following birth to support the survival of two lambs. This causes the newborn lambs to be at risk of death due to starvation, mismothering, cold exposure and infection. Niacin has previously been demonstrated in cattle to increase immunoglobulin concentrations in colostrum, possibly due to niacin increasing blood flow, allowing the greater accumulation of nutrients and immunoglobulins in colostrum. High producing animals, such as the late gestation twin-bearing ewe, may not be able to produce enough niacin to meet their production requirements. Aims This experiment evaluated whether supplementation of niacin (vitamin B3) to late gestation twin-bearing ewes would increase colostrum production and composition (concentration of fat, lactose, protein and immunoglobulin G), and postnatal lamb growth. Methods A total of 24 artificially inseminated Merino ewes were weighed, body condition scored, aged and randomly allocated to a treatment – control treatment or with 5 g/day niacin supplemented for 2 weeks before lambing until 2–8 days post-lambing. Key results Colostrum production and immunoglobulin G concentration were similar between treatments (P > 0.05). Ewes supplemented with niacin produced significantly higher (P = 0.039) colostral protein at 12.54% compared with the control group ewes at 11.78%. Early lamb growth rates were unaffected (P > 0.05) by treatment. Conclusions Supplementation of ewes with 5 g/day niacin is not recommended to increase the production of colostrum and immunoglobulin G or to increase lamb growth rates following birth. Implications Further research into niacin supplementation, supplementation time and supplementation amount for production effects in late gestation ewes is warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aanimal production 3ablood flow 3abody condition 3acattle 3acold stress 3acolostrum 3adeath 3aewes 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alactose 3aneonates 3aniacin 3apregnancy 3arisk 3astarvation 0abirthweight 0amilk 0aparturition 0asheep1 aRobertson, S.

Fresh insight from the novel ARDL technique  ap. 7424-7437.  aTo boost the stability of economic and financial aspects along with the apprehensions for sustainability, it is important to promote the development of clean energy stocks around the globe. In the current research, the researchers have examined the impact of oil prices, coal prices, natural gas prices, and gold prices on clean energy stock using the autoregressive distribution lag (ARDL) approach from the year 2011 to the year 2020. The result of daily data analysis specifies that in the long as well as in the short run, gold prices, oil prices, and coal prices have a positive and significant effect on clean energy stock. On the other side, natural gas prices in the long as well as in the short run have a negative and significant effect on clean energy stock. So, the empirical analysis of our study is of interest to investors at an institutional level who aim at detecting the risk associated with the clean energy market through proper financial modeling. Besides, this study opens up a new domain to sustain financial as well as economic prospects by protecting the environment through clean energy stock as the investment in clean energy stocks results in producing a substantial effect on the economy and the environment as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclean energy 3acoal 3aempirical research 3aenergy 3agold 3amarkets 3anatural gas 3aoils 3apollution 3arisk1 aKhan, Muhammad Kamran1 aShujaat, Sobia1 aGodil, Danish Iqbal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1602-37441 aSharif, Arshian1 aAnser, Muhammad Khalid0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 5 p.7424-7437dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16262-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03777naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001400167245012100181300001300302520171000315592002802025650001202053650000802065650003702073650001702110650002102127650001102148650001002159650001302169650001802182650002402200650002702224650001902251650001302270650002202283650002302305650002802328650001102356650001602367650001202383650002302395650004902418650004002467650003102507650002202538650004202560650003402602650002802636650002102664650003802685650003202723650004902755650002702804650003102831700001802862700001902880700001702899700001902916773007702935856008203012852000903094655001203103IND60098967420221120102146.0141105e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009896742DNAL7 a225425082pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2012.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Cui10aSequencing and analysis of four BAC clones containing innate immune genes from the Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri)  ap. 9-15.  aThe sequencing of BAC clones (~100kb) can reveal some characteristics of a genome that are challenging to obtain based on short sequences. Additionally, although the immune genes of the Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri) have been studied widely, few analyses have been conducted at the DNA level. In this study, four C. farreri BAC clones containing innate immune genes, including hsp70, lgbp (lipopolysaccharide and beta-1,3-glucan binding protein), serine protease and a gene with an immunoglobulin-like domain, were sequenced and analyzed both to explore the genomic characteristics of C. farreri based on long DNA sequences and to promote the study of C. farreri immune genes at the DNA level. The total length of the four BACs was 389.98kb. A total of 34 genes were predicted in these sequences, and several features of protein-coding regions in the C. farreri genome were inferred based on this information. Two LGBP genes were located close together in a 22-kb region in one BAC clone, indicating the physical linkage of some immune genes in C. farreri. A cluster of membrane transport genes was also observed; these genes might play important roles in eliminating toxins in C. farreri, which lives as a filter feeder. Further analysis showed 15.43% of the BAC sequence was repetitive. Tandem repeats were the most abundant repeat type, followed by transposable elements. A total of 31 SSRs were predicted in the four BACs. An IS10 family transposon was identified, and a suspected regulatory non-coding RNA gene for this transposon (RNA-OUT) was observed to overlap with it complementarily. This work will promote future studies on the genomics, immune system and non-coding regions of C. farreri.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamys 3aDNA 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abeta-glucans 3abinding proteins 3aclones 3agenes 3agenomics 3aimmune system 3alipopolysaccharides 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anon-coding RNA 3ascallops 3asequence analysis 3aserine proteinases 3atandem repeat sequences 3atoxins 3atransposons 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterialxgenetics 2aHSP70 Heat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aLectinsxgenetics 2aMembrane Transport Proteinsxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPectinidaexgeneticsximmunology. 2aRNA, Untranslatedxgenetics 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSerine Proteasesxgenetics1 aZhang, Tongwu1 aZhang, Xiaojun1 aHu, Songnian1 aXiang, Jianhai0 tGene.g2012 July 1, v. 502, no. 1 p.9-15dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245009500160300001600255520132500271592002801596650001901624650001001643650002001653650001501673650001301688650001701701650001201718650001501730650001301745650001001758650001301768650001601781650001601797651001601813653001601829653001501845653002801860653002501888653001801913653002701931700002001958700001601978773012201994856007702116852000902193655001202202IND60517567820221118052159.0160331e20150513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051756782DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2015-00812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrbach, D.N.10aCopulation rate declines with mating group size in dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchusobscurus)  ap. 503-507.  aMales in polygamous species often engage in intrasexual competition for mates. If females actively evade mating attempts, it may benefit males to cooperate to restrict female movement, as has been found in some mammals. We tested if male dusky dolphins (Lagenorhynchus obscurus (Gray, 1828)) cooperate or compete during group mating chases. If they cooperate, then the per-male probability of copulating should increase with group size; if they compete, then the probability should decrease. We followed mating groups by boat during the breeding season (October 2013 – January 2014) off Kaikoura, New Zealand. The copulation rate per male decreased with increasing group size and with the number of noncopulating males in proximity to a copulating female. Male dusky dolphins have multiple mates and appear to use sperm and exploitative scramble competition. Males may remain in mating groups despite competition because there are alliances within the groups, they are unable to exclude rivals from joining a group, the time and energy costs of searching for unescorted females exceed the costs of reduced mating opportunities in a group, they receive other direct or indirect benefits that offset the costs of reduced mating opportunities, or they are in the group largely for social learning rather than procreation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagenorhynchus 3aboats 3abreeding season 3acopulation 3adolphins 3aenergy costs 3afemales 3agroup size 3alearning 3amales 3apolygamy 3aprobability 3aspermatozoa 3aNew Zealand 0acooperation 0acopulation 0aintrasexual competition 0ascramble competition 0adusky dolphin 0aLagenorhynchusobscurus1 aRosenthal, G.G.1 aWürsig, B.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2015 May 13, v. 93, no. 6 p.503-507dNRC Research PresswJournal:19146x0008-43017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2015-00813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100003000150245009300180300001400273500001500287520119800302592002801500650001101528650001601539650001701555650001201572650001301584650001801597650001401615650002201629650001101651650001301662650002501675650002001700650001601720650001801736650001701754650002601771653001501797700003001812700002201842700003001864773008401894856008601978852000902064655001202073IND4479343820221119155324.0141110e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447934382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerra-Rodríguez, Esther10aModelling of the acid hydrolysis of potato (Solanum tuberosum) for fermentative purposes  ap. 59-68.  a2019-12-06  aThe hydrolysis of non-commercial potatoes to obtain glucose solutions has a double consequence, the elimination of a waste and the generation of a value-added product. Potato hydrolysates can be used to prepare growth media for fermentative processes. This work deals with the modelling of the acid hydrolysis of potato using sulphuric acid. The effect of temperature, time, acid concentration and liquid/solid ratio were evaluated. Considering the important effect and interactions of the variable involved, a statistical Box-Behnken design was conducted including the cited variables as operational variables and concentrations of glucose, fructose, arabinose, acetic acid, furfural and 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-furaldehyde (HMF) released as dependent variables. Significant models were obtained. The maximum glucose concentration predicted was 85 kg m⁻³. The conditions selected as optimal were: Temperature, 120 °C; time, 60 min; acid concentration, 2.4 kg m⁻³ and liquid/solid ratio, 9.8 g g⁻¹. The acid hydrolysis of dried potatoes gave solutions with 58 kg m⁻³ of glucose and only 0.47 kg m⁻³ of HMF. These solutions are adequate for further fermentation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3awastes 3aacetic acid 3afermentation 3aglucose 3afructose 3asulfuric acid 3aarabinose 3aSolanum tuberosum 3amodels 3apotatoes 3avalue-added products 3aacid hydrolysis 3atemperature 3aculture media 3ahydrolysates 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 0ahydrolysis1 aPortilla-Rivera, Oscar M.1 aRamirez, Jose A.,1 aVázquez Murillo, Manuel,0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2012 July, v. 42 p.59-68dElsevier Ltdx0961-95347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2012.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03351naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008400160300001600244500002000260520176300280592002802043650001702071650002602088650001902114650002102133650001102154650002402165650002002189650001002209650001502219650001302234650002302247650002602270650001902296650002202315650002002337650001602357650002502373651001902398651001402417700001802431700002002449700001502469700001502484700001502499700001502514700001702529700001602546700001402562773012602576856007402702852000902776655001202785IND60593975520221118034455.0180508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059397552DNAL7 a10.1111/avsc.123562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Vecchio, S.10aBiogeographic variability of coastal perennial grasslands at the European scale  ap. 312-321.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTION: Coastal environments have often been described as azonal. While this characteristic is clear for the foredune system, it seems less evident for more inland fixed dunes, which host habitats of major conservation concern, whose features seem to be more related to local climatic conditions. We hypothesized that, unlike other coastal habitats, dune perennial grasslands differ floristically and structurally across their European range and that patterns of variation are linked to the corresponding climate. LOCATION: European coasts (Atlantic Ocean, Baltic, Mediterranean, Black Sea). METHODS: We used a large data set of phytosociological relevés, representative of coastal grasslands throughout their European range. The role of climatic variables (temperature, precipitation and continentality) in determining the variability in species composition and vegetation structure (by means of life forms) was investigated through CCA, DCA and GLM. The degree of concentration of species occurrences within groups was calculated through the Phi coefficient. RESULTS: Through multivariate analyses we identified seven major types of coastal grassland, corresponding to different geographic areas. The groups significantly differed in their climatic envelope, as well as in their species composition and community structure. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the hypothesis that coastal dune perennial grasslands are subjected to local climate, which exerts significant effects on both floristic composition and community structure. As a consequence, coastal grasslands are particularly prone to the effect of possible climate change, which may alter species composition and distribution, and lead to shifts in the distribution of native plant communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abotanical composition 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3adata collection 3adunes 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3amultivariate analysis 3aphytosociology 3aplant communities 3aplants (botany) 3atemperature 3avegetation structure 3aAtlantic Ocean 3aBlack Sea1 aFantinato, E.1 aJanssen, J.A.M.1 aBioret, F.1 aAcosta, A.1 aPrisco, I.1 aTzonev, R.1 aMarcenò, C.1 aRodwell, J.1 aBuffa, G.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2018 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.312-321dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58701x1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.123563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245014200176300001400318520171200332592002802044650001102072650002102083650001202104650001802116650001202134650001702146650001002163650001202173650001502185653001202200653001602212653003602228653001202264653001102276700001902287700002202306700006002328700001802388700002202406773009402428856008502522852000902607655001202616IND60612257920221121041535.0190801e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061225792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2018.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlabduljader, Kholoud10aEcological momentary assessment of food perceptions and eating behavior using a novel phone application in adults with or without obesity  ap. 35-41.  aWe developed a smart phone application to measure participants' food-reward perceptions and eating behavior in their naturalistic environment. Intensity ratings (0 - not at all to 10 - very strongly) of perceived anticipation of food (wanting) and food enjoyment at endpoint of intake (liking) were recorded as they occurred over a period of 14 days. Moreover, food craving trait, implicit and explicit attitude towards healthy food, and body composition were assessed. 53 participants provided complete data. Participants were classified by percentage of body fat; 33 participants with lower body fat (L-group) and 20 with higher body fat (H-group; ≥25% body fat for males and ≥32% for females). L-group participants reported 6.34 (2.00) food wanting events per day, whereas H-group participants recorded significantly fewer food wanting events (5.07 (1.42)); both groups resisted about the same percentage of wanting events (L-group: 29.2 (15.5)%; H-group 27.3 (12.8)%). Perceived intensity ratings were significantly different within the L-group in the order liking (7.65 (0.81)) > un-resisted wanting (leading to eating) (7.00 (1.01)) > resisted wanting (not leading to eating) (6.02 (1.72)) but not in the H-group. Liking scores (L-group: 7.65 (0.81); H-group: 7.14 (1.04)) were significantly higher in L-group than in H-group after controlling for age. Our results show that individuals with higher percentage of body fat show less food enjoyment after intake and reveal no differentiation in intensity ratings of perceived anticipatory and consummatory food reward. These results are consistent with a hypothesized reward deficiency among individuals with higher percentage of body fat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abody composition 3acraving 3aeating habits 3afemales 3ahealthy diet 3amales 3aobesity 3atelephones 0aObesity 0aFood reward 0aEcological momentary assessment 0aCraving 0aEating1 aCliffe, Marion1 aSartor, Francesco1 aPapini, Gabriele1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5752-92261 aCox, W.

Previously, we have reported that the ethoxylated chalcone derivative (E)-1-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-3-(fluorophenyl)prop-2-en-1-one (E7) showed potent, reversible, and competitive MAO-B inhibition with an IC₅₀ value of 0.053 μm. The present study aims to investigate the anti-Parkinson activity of compound E7 in a haloperidol-induced animal model of mice. The disease was induced with haloperidol (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal route) once daily for 21 days. E7 was given at dose levels of 10, 20, and 30 mg/kg/day for 21 days, consecutively. Behavioural tests were carried out during and at the end of the study. Biochemical analyses such as oxidative stress biomarkers and neurotransmitters were quantified on the brain homogenate at the end of the study. Behavioural results showed that there is a marked improvement in locomotor activity and motor coordination in the treatment group. Oxidative stress biomarkers such as SOD, CAT, and GSH levels were increased dose-dependently with a maximum at 30 mg/kg, whereas the dose-dependent decrease (30 mg/kg) in the MDA and nitrite levels were observed in the treatment groups. Levels of neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline, were increased in the treatment groups while dopamine and noradrenaline levels were more than in the standard treated group. MAO-B level was also decreased dose dependently in the treatment group in comparison with the control group. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the E7 compound exhibited anti-Parkinson activity which was more evident at 30 mg/kg oral dose as evaluated by the haloperidol-induced animal model of mice.  aPublisher supplied data  aRGP-159-42.cFemale Center for Scientific and Medical Colleges, King Saud University 3aParkinson disease 3aanimal models 3abiomarkers 3abrain 3achalcone 3adopamine 3adose response 3aelderly 3ahaloperidol 3alocomotion 3aneurotransmitters 3anitrites 3anorepinephrine 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3apollution 3aresearch 3aserotonin1 aSaleem, Uzma1 aAnwar, Fareeha1 aShah, Muhammad Ajmal1 aAhmad, Bashir1 aUmer, Filzah1 aAlmoyad, Mohammad Ali Abdullah1 aParambi, Della Grace Thomas1 aBeeran, Asmy Appadath1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2617-17351 aNath, Lekshmi R1 aAleya, Lotfi1 aMathew, Bijo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6658-44970 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 5 p.7271-7282dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15955-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245007700161300001400238520130300252592002801555650001801583650001201601650001701613650001301630650001201643650001601655650001601671650001401687650001201701650001801713650000901731650002501740650001101765650002301776650002301799650001901822650001401841650001201855650001501867650001301882650001901895650001101914650001101925650002001936650002501956650001101981650001301992653000802005653000802013653000602021653000702027653000602034653000802040653000802048653000802056653001702064653001602081653001102097653001002108653001402118653001702132653001502149700002002164700001702184700001602201700001602217700001502233700001602248773015402264856008302418852000902501655001202510IND60525640720221118190154.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052564072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2015.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZrig, A.10aEffect of rootstock on salinity tolerance of sweet almond (cv. Mazzetto)  ap. 50-59.  aThe current work aims to assess whether the rootstock can improve the salinity tolerance of an almond cultivar. The study included a description of the physiological and biochemical adaptations of one-year old scions of Mazzetto grafted onto either GF677 or Garnem rootstocks and exposed to increasing concentrations of NaCl in the growing medium. The plants were watered with a nutrient solution containing 0mM (control), 25mM, 50mM or 75mM NaCl. There was a significant reduction in shoot extension in response to increasing NaCl concentration in the growing medium especially in the plants grafted onto GF677. The better shoot growth of Mazzetto/Garnem plants appears to be due to their ability to limit the loss of photosynthetic activity by maintaining stomatal conductance and protecting chlorophyll and cytosolic assimilatory enzymes from toxic ions. Leaves of Mazzeto/Garnem had higher gs rates, carotenoids/chlorophyll and anthocyanins/chlorophyll ratios and a better nutritional status (higher K+ and Ca2+ and lower Na+) compared to Mazzeto/GF677. Furthermore, the former maintained higher proline and soluble sugar concentrations and lower leaf water potential. Our results suggest that Garnem offers a degree of protection against salinity which can be exploited in breeding programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus dulcis 3aalmonds 3aanthocyanins 3abreeding 3acalcium 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3aenzymes 3agrowing media 3aions 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3anutrient solutions 3anutritional status 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3aproline 3arootstocks 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3ascions 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3astomatal conductance 3asugars 3atoxicity 0aΨw 0aRWC 0aA 0ags 0aE 0aTSS 0aROS 0aTAA 0aAnthocyanins 0aCarotenoids 0aGarnem 0aGF677 0aRootstock 0aSweet almond 0aPolyamines1 aBen Mohamed, H.1 aTounekti, T.1 aKhemira, H.1 aSerrano, M.1 aValero, D.1 aVadel, A.M.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2016 Jan., v. 102 p.50-59dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2015.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245011500156300001600271500001900287520137200306592002801678650001601706650001601722650001801738650001701756650000901773650002001782650002701802650001001829650003501839650001601874650001801890650002701908650001201935650001801947650002201965650001801987650001602005650001302021650002102034650002602055650002102081653003202102653001102134700001502145773011302160856007102273852000902344655001202353IND60722553120221120222551.0210105s2021    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072255312DNAL7 a10.1071/FP192602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManan, Sehrish10aRole of Glycine max ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (GmABI3) in lipid biosynthesis and stress tolerance in soybean  ap. 171-179.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoybean is an important oilseed crop and primary dietary protein resource. The limited understanding of soybean oil biosynthesis has become a significant obstacle for the improvement of soybean oil production. A transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) is known for its role in plant development and seed dormancy in many crops. The current study was aimed to functionally characterise ABI3 homologue in Glycine max L. For this purpose, the GmABI3 gene was cloned and ectopically expressed in wildtype and abi3 mutant Arabidopsis. The GmABI3 expression in the atabi3 mutant enhanced the triacylglycerol (TAG) content (7.3%) in addition to modified fatty acid composition. The GmABI3 increased eicosenoic acid (20:1) up to 6.5% in genetically complemented Arabidopsis mutant seeds, which is essential for long-chain fatty acid synthesis. The transgenic GmABI3/wildtype seeds contain 34.9% more TAG content compared with wildtype seeds. The results showed that GmABI3 is responsible for seed-specific TAG and long-chain fatty acid biosynthesis in soybean. The exposure to cold and heat stress and exogenous supply of abscisic acid and jasmonic acid altered the level of GmABI3 in treated seeds and leaves. It also concluded that GmABI3 could regulate stress tolerance in soybean, which applies to a wide variety of crops to deal with biological stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aGlycine max 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acold 3adietary protein 3afatty acid composition 3agenes 3agenetically modified organisms 3aheat stress 3ajasmonic acid 3along chain fatty acids 3amutants 3aoilseed crops 3aplant development 3aseed dormancy 3asoybean oil 3asoybeans 3astress tolerance 3atranscription factors 3atriacylglycerols 0aABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 0alipids1 aZhao, Jian0 tFunctional plant biology.g2021, v. 48, no. 2 p.171-179dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl70735x1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP192603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245012000163300001600283500002000299520196500319592002802284650001202312650001702324650001102341650001202352650002302364650002202387650002002409650001802429650001702447650001802464650001102482650002202493650002102515650001502536651001202551700002202563773012602585856007402711852000902785655001202794IND60593975720221118034456.0180508e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059397572DNAL7 a10.1111/avsc.123402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrell, Hannah L.10aSeeding alters plant community trajectory: Impacts of seeding, grazing and trampling on semi‐arid re‐vegetation  ap. 240-249.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aQUESTIONS: How do seeding, cattle grazing, and vehicular use impact vegetation establishment and soil movement on a newly reclaimed pipeline right‐of‐way? Will these factors result in differing plant community trajectories? LOCATION: Southern Arizona (USA). METHODS: Within a pipeline disturbance, we randomly selected nine plots to be seeded with an 18 species mix and nine to be left unseeded. Adjacent to the disturbance, we selected nine undisturbed unseeded control plots for a total of 27 plots (30 m × 45 m each). Within each of the 27 plots, we established a grazed–trampled, grazed–untrampled and ungrazed–untrampled subplot. One year after pipeline reclamation, we analysed the impacts of seeding, grazing and trampling on native plant cover, undesirable plant cover, herbaceous biomass, species richness, soil movement and plant community trajectories in comparison to surrounding undisturbed sites. RESULTS: Seeding disturbed sites with a diverse seed mix resulted in greater native plant cover, higher species richness and fewer undesirable species than were found in unseeded disturbed sites. Unseeded disturbed areas were similar to the undisturbed control areas in species richness and had comparable plant community trajectories. The combined impacts of grazing and trampling reduced native plant cover and herbaceous biomass and were associated with increased soil erosion in comparison to subplots protected from grazing and trampling. CONCLUSIONS: Natural vegetation recruitment can be a viable option in semi‐arid reclamation projects when the soil seed bank is preserved and there are proximal seed sources. While seeding improved quantitative vegetation metrics, using a seed mix comprised of different species than the preexisting vegetation may set the reclaimed vegetation on a different plant community trajectory. The general prescription of protecting new reclamation sites from grazing and trampling is supported.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aburied seeds 3acattle 3agrazing 3aindigenous species 3aplant communities 3aplants (botany) 3arights of way 3asoil erosion 3asoil movement 3asowing 3aspecies diversity 3atrampling damage 3avegetation 3aArizona1 aFehmi, Jeffrey S.0 tApplied vegetation science.g2018 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.240-249dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58701x1402-20017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avsc.123403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05023naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245015200153300001600305520366200321592002803983650002204011650000904033650001204042650001404054650000904068650001004077650002204087650001004109650001304119650001104132650001304143650001204156650003004168650001204198650002404210650001004234650002204244650001304266650001504279651002204294700001804316700001704334773011004351856007104461852000904532655001204541IND60518273420221120232826.0160411e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051827342DNAL7 a10.2307/19426152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbott, Ian10aComparative Ecology of Galapagos Ground Finches (Geospiza Gould): Evaluation of the Importance of Floristic Diversity and Interspecific Competition  ap. 151-184.  aDistribution, abundance, diet, and beak morphology of the six Geospiza finch species were studied at eight sites on seven Galapagos islands. The resulting information was used to test the theories of Lack and Bowman that interspecific competition (Lack) and floristic and food differences among islands (Bowman) determine the ecological and morphological characteristics of the finches. Both factors were found to be important in different aspects of finch ecology. Most of the 21 populations studied spent more time foraging for seeds and fruits than for insects. Most populations had generalized diets and nine out of 18 pairs of sympatric populations had diets overlapping by 50% or more. Diet breadth was positively correlated with variety of available foods (classified by an index comprising measures of size and hardness), but was not correlated with abundance or biomass of sympatric populations of finches (potential competitors). Competitive release, in the form of large population biomass on islands with few congeners, was not found. Nor was population biomass related to variety of available food. Overlap in diet between two species was greatest when the species were most similar in abundance and body size. Interspecific competition is indicated by the distribution and morphology of the finches. The absence of four combinations of species cannot be attributed to change: (1) G. conirostris and G. fortis, (2) G. conirostris and G. scandens, (3) G. difficilis and G. fuliginosa, and (4) G. scandens and G. difficilis. These absences cannot be attributed to the absence of suitable foods. and sites with similar floras and suites of food types do not necessarily have similar ground finch faunas. The ecological and morphological similarity of members of each of the four pairs suggests an inability to coexist for competitive reasons. In contrast, where only two species occur together on an island they tend to differ markedly in size (beak and body) and diet. Species with large beaks can eat larger and harder seeds and fruits than species with small beaks, and as a consequence they tend to have more diverse diets. Species with large beaks also eat medium—sized seeds and fruits quicker than species with small beaks. Species with small beaks may be able to deal with small soft seeds more efficiently than species with large beaks, but the data are not clear on this point. In addition, small species with small beaks have a metabolic advantage over large species with large beaks. Variety of available foods influences the large species more than the small species: the two largest species, G. magnirostris and G. conirostris, occur only on sites where plants producing large and hard seeds and fruits are plentiful. Food variety apparently does not influence the degree of diet overlap. The number of plant species on an island statistically determines the number of land—bird species in general, and Geospiza species in particular, which occur on that island. The influence is probably mediated through food supply, since 53% of the variation in Geospiza species diversity among the eight sites was accounted for in a multiple linear regression analysis by diversity of available seeds and fruits. We conclude that food supply and interspecific competition have jointly determined the ecological course of the radiation of Darwin's finches and the resulting pattern of species diversity. Interisland variation in vegetation favored the initial steps of differentiation. Competitive interactions among species influenced later stages by determining which ecological types could coexist on an island with a given array of foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeospiza scandens 3abeak 3abiomass 3abody size 3adiet 3afauna 3afood availability 3afoods 3aforaging 3afruits 3ahardness 3ainsects 3ainterspecific competition 3aislands 3aregression analysis 3aseeds 3aspecies diversity 3asympatry 3avegetation 3aGalapagos Islands1 aAbbott, L.

In Drosophila, little is known about which is the preponderant evolutionary pattern, since the adaptive radiation hypothesis first proposed by Throckmorton assumed niche divergence (ND) according to a niche occupancy scenario. Nevertheless, this hypothesis has not yet been straightforwardly tested. Our aim here was to test the role of NC patterns across evolution of American drosophilids belonging to the tripunctata and virilis-repleta lineages of the Drosophila subgenus, through measures of geographical, abiotic and biotic niche overlap and evaluations regarding the presence of phylogenetic signal or niche identity. We recovered phylogenetic signal attributable to phylogenetic niche conservatism when all species were analyzed together, but not in more restricted groups. Identity tests showed that niche equivalency was seldom rejected for the tripunctata lineage species. So, in general, neither the results for the Drosophila subgenus nor those for the tripunctata lineage support the hypothesis of an adaptive radiation. Notwithstanding, there were also several isolated cases supporting a scenario of ND, and ecological speciation was evident in some of the evaluated sister species pairs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aadaptive radiation 3aecology 3aphylogeny 3atropics1 aGottschalk, Marco Silva1 aRobe, Lizandra Jaqueline0 tEvolutionary ecology.g2016 Feb., v. 30, no. 1 p.47-67dSpringer International Publishingx0269-76537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10682-015-9805-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02979naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245011200185300001800297520150900315592002801824650003001852650001101882650000901893650002901902650002401931650001501955650001001970650002401980650001402004650001702018650000902035650002702044650001902071650001502090650001702105650002002122650001202142651001002154653000802164653000802172653002802180653002502208700002002233773013002253856008102383852000902464655001202473IND60651507420221123000814.0190711e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065150742DNAL7 a289885672pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800170025922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsakura, Keiko10aSFA intake among Japanese schoolchildren: current status and possible intervention to prevent excess intake  ap. 3247-3256.  aAlthough a high intake of fat, particularly SFA, is a well-known risk factor for CVD, fat intake in Japan has attracted relatively little attention from health professionals to date due to the low intake in the Japanese population. However, recent surveys have shown an increase in fat intake in younger Japanese populations. Here, we described the fat intake and dietary sources of SFA in Japanese schoolchildren. Also, we experimentally exchanged a high-SFA food with a low-SFA substitute in the data, and calculated the resulting changes in nutrient intakes. The study was conducted nationwide under a cross-sectional design. A non-consecutive, three-day diet record was performed on two school days and a non-school day. Fourteen elementary and thirteen junior high schools. Elementary-school children (n 629) and junior high-school children (n 281). Prevalence of excess fat intake was 35·4 % in boys and 45·0 % in girls. Excess SFA intake was suspected in 97·7 % of boys and 99·4 % of girls when the dietary reference intake values for adults were applied. Major dietary sources of SFA were meat (26·4 % of total SFA intake), dairy products (25·7 %) and confectioneries (11·3 %). Since one-third to nearly one-half of our Japanese schoolchildren consumed excess fat, careful monitoring of fat intake in the Japanese population should be continued. Adoption of low-fat milk and/or lean meat in daily meals might be a suitable means of reducing fat, particularly SFA intake, in schoolchildren.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDietary Reference Intakes 3aadults 3aboys 3adietary nutrient sources 3aelementary students 3afat intake 3agirls 3ahealth care workers 3alean meat 3alow fat milk 3ameat 3amiddle school students 3amiddle schools 3amonitoring 3arisk factors 3aschool children 3asurveys 3aJapan 0aFat 0aSFA 0aJapanese schoolchildren 0aVirtual intervention1 aSasaki, Satoshi0 tPublic health nutrition.g2017 Dec., v. 20, no. 18 p.3247-3256dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170025923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002000136245012100156300001600277520172400293592002802017650001102045650002302056650002602079650001302105651001002118700002502128700001902153700001802172773010302190856003902293852000902332655001202341IND4475410720221116213351.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447541072DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.12152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArakida, Hazuki10aMapping the potential distribution of shorebirds in Japan: the importance of landscape‐level coastal geomorphology  ap. 553-563.  aSeveral recent studies have predicted potential habitats along coastal areas using large‐scale physical environmental variables to identify target areas for conservation. However, no indices or methodologies for predicting tidal‐flat habitats at a large spatial scale have been developed. Tidal flats supporting large populations of shorebirds have been identified in semi‐enclosed seas. Thus, bays are probably important topographic units for evaluating the locations of shorebirds' non‐breeding habitats. A GIS‐based methodology was developed to extract ‘bay units’ at any scale from coastline data. Using three environment variables (the area of the bay units at three spatial scales, the percentage of shallow water area in each bay unit, and the spring‐tide range), it was possible to predict tidal‐flat habitats for six shorebird species with high accuracy (AUC > 0.95, sensitivity >90%). Results showed that the percentage of shallow water area in small‐ and medium‐scale bays was the best predictor of tidal‐flat habitats, followed by the area of bays at a large spatial scale. This indicates that the size (scale) of a bay and the percentage of shallow water present are highly related to the presence of tidal‐flat habitats. The prediction maps for individual species of shorebirds clearly showed differences in the distribution patterns of species. These maps were overlaid to identify potentially species‐rich areas and thus where conservation and restoration of the tidal flats in these bays would be important. The model, which uses simple coastal data, is a useful, resource‐efficient method for identifying target conservation and restoration areas across broad scales.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitats 3aJapan1 aMitsuhashi, Hiromune1 aKamada, Mahito1 aKoyama, Kazuo0 tAquatic conservation.g2011 Sept., v. 21, no. 6 p.553-563dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.1215  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001900138245010500157520145200262592002801714650001301742650002201755650001601777650002101793650001801814650002101832650002101853650001301874650001401887650001501901650001001916650001401926650001801940700001701958700001501975700001601990700001302006773011802019856007202137852000902209655001202218IND60653184420221117225532.0190714e20161224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065318442DNAL7 a10.3390/w90100062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xiangju10aEffects of Nonaerated Circulation Water Velocity on Nutrient Release from Aquaculture Pond Sediments  aSustaining good water quality in aquaculture ponds is vital. Without an aerator, the dissolved oxygen in ponds comes primarily from mass transfer at the water-ambient atmosphere interface. As sediment can seriously affect water quality, this study used indoor experiments to examine the nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) release mechanisms and fluxes from sediment in aquaculture ponds with moving water but no aeration. The results showed that the ammonia nitrogen (NH<inf>3</inf>-N) concentration in the overlying water was inversely proportional to flow velocity and that a higher flow velocity tended to result in a lower concentration in the overlying water, a steeper vertical gradient of concentration within the bed sediments, and a faster release rate from the sediments. The sediment disturbed by flowing water released more nitrate nitrogen (NO<inf>3</inf>-N) and nitrite nitrogen (NO<inf>2</inf>-N) into the overlying water and NO<inf>2</inf>-N could become oxidized into NO<inf>3</inf>-N. In still water, NO<inf>3</inf>-N was released gradually and some anaerobic NO<inf>3</inf>-N was nitrified into NO<inf>2</inf>-N. Phosphorus release from the sediments was controlled by the adsorption–desorption balance, with the phosphorus concentration in the overlying water dropping gradually to a steady value from its initial maximum. The relationship between NH<inf>3</inf>-N release flux and flow rate is described by a cubic function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aammonium nitrogen 3aaquaculture 3adissolved oxygen 3amass transfer 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrite nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3aponds 3asediments 3awater quality1 aZhu, Dantong1 aWang, Xixi1 aYu, Deguang1 aXie, Jun0 tWater.g2016 Dec. 24, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90100063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010000170300001400270520161200284592002801896650001601924650001101940650001701951650001601968650002101984650001502005650001402020650002202034650001102056650001202067650001502079651001202094653001302106653001502119653001302134653001002147700002102157700006202178700006102240700002102301700002002322773008502342856008502427852000902512655001202521IND60630985020221118224233.0190509e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063098502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Anand K.10aCoBAGNPS: A toolbox for simulating water and sediment control basin, WASCoB through AGNPS model  ap. 49-65.  aA WASCoB constituting a modest detention pond (berm), surface inlets and tile drains; designed to capture the flow and release it gradually into the drainage system is an efficient watershed BMP. Henceforth; a toolbox, CoBAGNPS for the AGNPS model, is developed to simulate WASCoBs through the AGNPS model. The toolbox utilizes the inputs from AGNPS, through the launching of an application for execution of the WASCoB module. Finally, the output files are generated after routing flow through WASCoBs. The toolbox was applied with a case study in the Gully creek watershed and one of its sub-basins (DFTILE sub-basin) located in Ontario, Canada. The toolbox reproduced the required outputs successfully. Henceforth, significantly enhancing the capability of the AGNPS model to simulate flow through a WASCoB and a network of WASCoBs. Furthermore; the efficiency of the drainage system is also analyzed under different scenarios of pipe risers and tile drains. Also, few scenario analyses were considered in which different diameter drainage pipes were considered to route flow for extreme events for WASCoB3 in the DFTILE sub-basin. A 375-mm diameter drainage pipe is efficient in routing flow for a 10-year 24-h design storm without it overtopping the berm. Finally, another component of the toolbox was tested, where the flow from the DFTILE sub-basin was directly routed to the outlet of the Gully creek watershed (GULGUL 5) through a drainage pipe of 200 mm with 1% slope, assuming a lag time. The hydrograph at the watershed outlet increased marginally due to the small size of the DFTILE sub-basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAGNPS model 3abasins 3acase studies 3adrain pipes 3adrainage systems 3ahydrograph 3asediments 3asimulation models 3astorms 3astreams 3awatersheds 3aOntario 0aCoBAGNPS 0aPipe riser 0aModeling 0aAGNPS1 aRudra, Ramesh P.1 aGharabaghi, Bahram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0454-28111 aDaggupati, Prasad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7044-34351 aGoel, Pradeep K.1 aShukla, Rituraj0 tCatena.g2019 Aug., v. 179 p.49-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245014600160300001600306520068700322592002801009650001801037650001101055650001601066650001001082650001201092650004301104650001101147650001401158650001001172653001901182653001901201653002801220700002101248700002301269700002001292773015401312856008001466852000901546655001201555IND60522979720221119153302.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052297972DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2000-11-12132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Lei10aRemoval of Magnesium by Mg-dechelatase Is a Major Step in the Chlorophyll-Degrading Pathway in Ginkgo biloba in the Process of Autumnal Tints  ap. 923-926.  aAutumnal tints are one of the most manifest and fascinating natural phenomena, but the mechanism of chlorophyll (Chl)-breakdown in deciduous trees has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we analyzed the composition of Chl-related compounds and determined the activities of initial Chl-degrading enzymes in Ginkgo leaves at various stages in the process of autumnal coloring. Only pheophytin a (Pheo a, Mg-free Chl a) was detected in yellow leaves by HPLC analysis, and the activity of Mg-dechelatase in yellow leaves was found to be higher than in green leaves. These findings showed that the removal of magnesium from Chl a occurred in advance of dephytylation in the Ginkgo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGinkgo biloba 3aautumn 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aenzymes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3atrees 0aChlorophyllase 0aMg-dechelatase 0aChlorophyll Degradation1 aOkazawa, Atsushi1 aFukusaki, Eiichiro1 aKobayashi, Akio0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 55, no. 11-12 p.923-926dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2000-11-12133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02998naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245015200170500002200322520169700344592002802041650002002069650001402089650001302103650001802116650001502134650002302149650002602172650001402198653002402212653003702236653001902273653003602292700002102328700002002349700006302369773007402432856008502506852000902591655001202600IND60630985220221118224309.0190403e20190207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063098522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTinebra, Ilenia10aComparing different application procedures of the water drop penetration time test to assess soil water repellency in a fire affected sicilian area  aPre-press version  aThe Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) technique was applied in two subsequent years (2016 and 2017) to check surface soil water repellency (SWR) in a Sicilian mountain area affected by a wildfire on June 2016. A total of 93 sites were sampled and from 3 to 100 droplets were used to characterize a site. The detected SWR varied with the severity of the wildfire, being practically absent in the unburnt control area and slight to extreme in the burnt areas. The percentage of extremely repellent sites increased with wildfire severity. SWR vanished one year after the passage of the fire in sites where fire severity was moderate but it persisted in the case of a severe wildfire. In general, the number of applied droplets at a site (from 3 to 100) and the SWR classification methodology (modal class, mean of the measured WDPTs) did not have a strong impact on SWR assessment. However, the data collected with the first few droplets (i.e. three or four) could help to make choices about the number of droplets to be used to reliably characterize a site. If all the initially used droplets give clear signals of wettable conditions, it is plausible to believe that a small number of droplets will be enough to characterize the site. If signs of water repellency are detected, then it could be advisable to use larger samples sizes. Complementing a detailed information on the spatial distribution of wildfire severity with a WDPT experiment appears appropriate to establish where fire mitigation techniques should promptly be implemented after the fire. Experimental developments with larger databases are advisable to improve our ability to capture spatial and temporal variability of SWR.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adroplets 3afire severity 3asoil water 3atemporal variation 3awater repellent soils 3awildfires 0aSoil hydrophobicity 0aWater drop penetration time test 0aField sampling 0aSmall-scale spatial variability1 aAlagna, Vincenzo1 aIovino, Massimo1 aBagarello, Vincenzo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3575-549X0 tCatena.g2019 Feb. 07, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04173naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001700167245010900184300001600293520182600309592002802135650001502163650001402178650001002192650001302202650001002215650000902225650003502234650002202269650002802291650002502319650001502344650004802359650001102407650004902418650001902467650003802486650001302524650006202537650001102599650000902610650001602619650003602635650002602671650001702697650002302714650004702737653000702784653000802791653000702799653001002806653001402816653000802830653000802838653001402846653000702860653000702867653000802874653000702882653001502889653000802904653000802912653000702920653000802927653001402935653001902949653002302968653001902991653002403010700001503034700001803049700001603067700001303083700002103096700001403117773007303131856008203204852000903286655001203295IND60099052720221117200905.0161021e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009905272DNAL7 a234156272pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.01.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Yantao10aAssociation of two ERCC4 tagSNPs with susceptibility to atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer in Chinese  ap. 335-342.  aGenetic polymorphisms in excision repair cross-complementing group 4 (ERCC4) may contribute to the risk of cancer development. However, there are few reports regarding to susceptibility to gastric cancer (GC) or its precursor, atrophic gastritis (AG). Thereby, we investigated the association between two tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) rs6498486 and rs254942, which represents the majority of common SNPs of ERCC4 gene, and the risks of GC and AG development in a sex- and age-matched case–control designed study. We found that rs6498486 polymorphism was associated with a reduced AG risk in total population (for AC vs. AA: OR=0.69, 95%CI=0.52–0.94, P=0.016; for AC/CC vs. AA: OR=0.68, 95%CI=0.51–0.92, P=0.010) as well as in the subpopulation of youngers (age<60years) (for AC/CC vs. AA: OR=0.67, 95%CI=0.45–0.99, P=0.048). For the rs254942 polymorphism, compared with the common TT genotype, the genotypes of CT and CT/CC were only observed to reduce AG risk in the subgroups of males (for CT vs. TT: OR=0.64, 95%CI=0.45–0.90, P=0.012; for CT/CC vs. TT: OR=0.66, 95%CI=0.47–0.92, P=0.016) and youngers (for CT vs. TT: OR=0.72, 95%CI=0.53–0.97, P=0.035; for CT/CC vs. TT: OR=0.74, 95%CI=0.55–0.99, P=0.045). However, no significant statistical association of the two SNPs with GC susceptibility was observed in the total population. Only rs6498486 AC and AC/CC genotypes were found to be marginally associated with a reduced GC risk in the subgroup of males (for AC vs. AA: OR=0.69, 95%CI=0.49–0.99, P=0.043; for AC/CC vs. AA: OR=0.71, 95%CI=0.50–0.99, P=0.046). Our findings suggested that the ERCC4 rs6498486 and rs254942 may be associated with AG risk. Further validation of our results in larger populations and additional studies evaluating their molecular function are required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA repair 3agastritis 3agenes 3agenotype 3amales 3arisk 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3astomach neoplasms 2aAsian Peoplexgenetics. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDNA Repair 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGastritis, Atrophicxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenotype 2aHelicobacter pylorixgrowth & developmentxpathogenicity. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aRetrospective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSelection, Genetic 2aStomach Neoplasmsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 0aAG 0aCHB 0aCI 0aELISA 0aH. pylori 0aHWE 0aIgG 0aERCC4/XPF 0aGC 0aLD 0aNER 0aOR 0aPCR–RFLP 0aROS 0aSNP 0aUV 0aXPA 0aERCC4/XPF 0aSusceptibility 0aAtrophic gastritis 0aGastric cancer 0aHelicobacter pylori1 aHe, Caiyun1 aDuan, Zhipeng1 aSun, Liping1 aXu, Qian1 aXing, Chengzhong1 aYuanyuan,0 tGene.g2013 May 01, v. 519 p.335-342dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.01.0593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001600138245009100154520155900245592002801804650002301832650001101855650001101866650002801877650002201905650001501927650002001942650001301962650001301975650000901988650001601997650001602013650001502029650002402044651001002068700001302078700001702091700001502108700001902123700001402142700001902156773011802175856007202293852000902365655001202374IND60653184620221117225512.0190714e20170113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065318462DNAL7 a10.3390/w90100492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chitao10aImpacts of Ridge-Furrow Planting on Salt Stress and Cotton Yield under Drip Irrigation  aFlat (F), mini-ditch (MD), and ridge-furrow (RF) are three conventional cotton planting patterns that are usually adopted around the world, yet soil and crop responses to these three patterns are poorly studied, as is their suitability for increasing yield for coastal areas in Eastern China. The effects of three planting methods on water and salt dynamics as well as on growth and lint yield of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) were investigated in a saline field in Bohai Rim, China, to select the best planting pattern for cultivating coastal saline fields of Eastern China. Soil moisture in the root zone with RF was 11.9% and 12.1% higher than with F and MD, whereas the electrical conductivity of a saturated soil extract (EC<inf>e</inf>) in the root zone with RF was 18.0% and 13.8% lower than with MD and F, respectively, during the growth period, which indicated that RF could efficiently collect rainfall and leach salt in the root zone. After drip irrigation, the infiltration and salt-leaching depth with RF were both deeper than that with F and MD. The stand establishment of MD was the highest (80.3%) due to the greenhouse effect from film mulching, and was 12.8% and 4.6% higher than that with F and RF, respectively. Growth indicators and lint yield demonstrated that RF was superior to F and MD because of the higher soil moisture and lower EC<inf>e</inf>. The lint yield was significantly higher in RF, suggesting that RF can be an optimal planting pattern for agricultural reclamation in similar saline-alkaline areas around the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acoasts 3acotton 3aelectrical conductivity 3agreenhouse effect 3alint yield 3amicroirrigation 3amulching 3aplanting 3arain 3arhizosphere 3asalt stress 3asoil water 3astand establishment 3aChina1 aFeng, Di1 aMi, Zhaorong1 aLi, Caixia1 aZhang, Junpeng1 aGao, Yang1 aSun, Jingsheng0 tWater.g2017 Jan. 13, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90100493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245019400205520190300399592002802302650001902330650001002349650001202359650002602371650001502397650003102412650001702443650002202460650000702482650001502489650002202504650001402526650001402540650002402554650000902578650000902587650001502596650000902611650002402620653001202644653003802656653001802694653002002712653001502732700001702747700001202764700001702776700001502793700001802808700001802826700001602844700005402860700001602914773011102930856008503041852000903126655001203135IND60740469120221119095618.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074046912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1175042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xuerui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7761-207014aThe Cd phytoextraction potential of hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii-oilseed rape intercropping system under different soil types and comprehensive benefits evaluation under field conditions  aSoil trace elements (TEs) contamination has become a worldwide problem in arable lands and poses great risk to human health via food chain. Intercropping of hyperaccumulator and cash crops is now proposed as a promising alternative phytoremediation technique to address the issue. However, the effect of intercropping in different soil types and field-scale benefits evaluation are rarely reported. A greenhouse pot experiment and a field trial were therefore designed to explore the effects of intercropping Sedum alfredii (hyperaccumulative population) and oilseed rape on Cd phytoextraction potential, Cd transport and crop production, as well as establishing a feasible assessment framework on the basis of benefits evaluation in contaminated soils. Compared with oilseed rape monoculture, intercropping with S. alfredii significantly and consistently increased biomass, seed yield and Cd accumulation in oilseed rape in five typical soil types. Accumulations of Cd varied with soil types, ranging from 22.8 to 4000 μg pot⁻¹. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis (SMLRA) showed Cd concentrations in plants were related to available phosphorus (AP), pH, soil organic matter (OM), available potassium (AK), silt and sand; R² values varied from 0.834 to 0.994 (P < 0.05). A field trial also verified that intercropping could significantly enhance Cd phytoextraction. The highest index for comprehensive benefits evaluation was 0.61 observed in the S. alfredii and oilseed rape intercropping system. This system presented higher Cd phytoextraction potential and comprehensive benefits index whilst allowing ongoing agricultural activities in slightly and moderately Cd-contaminated soils. These results provide a possible technical approach for phytoremediation practice and give new insights into theoretical reference for development of Cd phytoextraction and benefits evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aSedum 3abiomass 3afield experimentation 3afood chain 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahuman health 3ahyperaccumulators 3apH 3aphosphorus 3aphytoaccumulation 3apollution 3apotassium 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asand 3aseed yield 3asilt 3asoil organic matter 0aCadmium 0aComprehensive benefits evaluation 0aIntercropping 0aPhytoextraction 0aSoil types1 aWang, Xiaozi1 aLu, Min1 aHamid, Yasir1 aLin, Qiang1 aLiu, Xingxing1 aLi, Tingqiang1 aLiu, Guoqun1 aHe, Zhenli1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7761-20701 aYang, Xiaoe0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 285 p.117504-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1175043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245030800175506002800483520110800511592002801619506003701647650002201684650002501706650003601731650001201767650001301779650001001792651001101802651001201813700002001825700002101845700002401866773009501890856008301985852000902068655001202077IND60739947620221207105143.0161026s2016    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073994762DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201607030242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabbado, Flores Shana10aCompetitive and innovation factors in wine tourism clusters: A comparative study between consolidated and emerging regions in Brazil and Uruguay / Factores de competitividad e innovación en clusters enoturísticos: Un estudio comparativo entre las regiones consolidadas y emergentes en Brasil y Uruguay  aResource is Open Access  aThe purpose of this article is to establish a cross-country analysis of the structure and organization of wine tourism clusters in consolidated and emerging wine regions in Brazil and Uruguay, looking for identifying the key factors for competitiveness and innovation. The regions chosen for analysis are: Vale dos Vinhedos, Campanha and Vale do São Francisco, in Brazil, and sites on Montevideo and Canelones, in Uruguay. The study analyze competitive factors in each region, including: the structure and density, support institutions at national and regional level, educational and research institutions, organization process for the geographical indication and the relationship between wine tourism and the promotion of wine and region. Further than comparing the two countries, the research also puts stop regions according to their stage of development in each assessed factor. Thus, the study suggests strategies that can be adopted at regional level or in cooperation between regions (in the country or bi-national cooperation) to strengthen and develop the tourist areas of the wine as a whole.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomparative study 3adevelopmental stages 3aprotected designation of origin 3atourism 3atourists 3awines 3aBrazil 3aUruguay1 aClaudio, Farias1 aGabriel, Andrade1 aTeresa, Russi Maria0 tBIO web of conferences.g2016, v. 7 p.03024-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201607030243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01520naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245014700165300001800312520047000330592002800800650001300828650001800841650001200859650001200871650001300883650001200896700002000908700002000928700001700948700001800965773010500983856008501088852000901173655001201182IND60579249520221117001406.0170816e20160318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057924952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b002122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Qiupeng10aRh-Catalyzed One-Pot Sequential Asymmetric Hydrogenation of α-Dehydroamino Ketones for the Synthesis of Chiral Cyclic trans-β-Amino Alcohols  ap. 1290-1293.  aCatalyzed by a rhodium complex of P-stereogenic diphosphine ligand (R)-2-tert-butylmethylphosphino-3-(di-tert-butylphosphino)quinoxaline ((R)-3H-QuinoxP*), five-membered cyclic α-dehydroamino ketones bearing endocyclic vinyl and endocyclic keto-carbonyl groups were sequentially hydrogenated to give chiral cyclic trans-β-amino alcohols with two contiguous stereocenters in quantitative conversions, excellent enantioselectivities and good diastereoselectivities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3ahydrogenation 3aketones 3aligands 3amoieties 3arhodium1 aChen, Jianzhong1 aZhang, Zhenfeng1 aLiu, Yangang1 aZhang, Wanbin0 tOrganic letters.g2016 Mar. 18, v. 18, no. 6 p.1290-1293dAmerican Chemical Societyx1523-70527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.orglett.6b002123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245010200209300001800311500002900329520074900358592002801107650002001135650002101155650001801176650001301194650002201207650001301229700003001242700006201272700006201334700005801396700005501454700006801509700002201577773012001599856008401719852000901803655001201812IND60717210920210811000000.0201110e20201022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071721092DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoris, Michèle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7350-007910aUnraveling the Supramolecular Organization Mechanism of Chiral Star-Shaped Poly(3-alkylthiophene)  ap. 9513-9520.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aThe supramolecular organization of star-shaped polythiophenes was investigated in a solvent/nonsolvent system and upon cooling. Both systems yield entirely different supramolecular aggregates. Classical characterization techniques can give some insight; the exact mechanism is currently not understood. By introducing second- and third-harmonic light scattering and its combination with other optical techniques, we were able to fully investigate the evolution of the supramolecular organization in both regimes. This approach allowed an unprecedented insight into the different stages of the process. A markedly different assembly mechanism is proposed for both regimes, which results in a different supramolecular organization of the polymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3acooling systems 3alight scattering 3aorganizations 3apolymers 3aprocessing stages 3asolvents1 aVan Den Eede, Marie-Paule1 aKoeckelberghs, Guy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1412-84541 aDeschaume, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6222-09471 aBartic, Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9577-28441 aClays, Koen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9490-00231 aVan Cleuvenbergen, Stijn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5955-23931 aVerbiest, Thierry0 tMacromolecules.g2020 Oct. 22, v. 53, no. 21 p.9513-9520dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c012323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02849naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245016100160300002000321520153800341592002801879650003501907650002101942650002001963650001201983650001101995650001102006650001802017650000902035650001502044650001802059650001502077650001502092650001302107650001402120700002102134700001802155700001502173700002002188773012402208856007402332852000902406655001202415IND60666788020221120230638.0190919e20141017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066678802DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra07941h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsu, Keng-Chang10aCombining microdialysis sampling and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for dynamic monitoring of trace metal ions during bacterial growth periods  ap. 51716-51721.  aMonitoring the dynamic variations of trace metal ions allows us to understand their roles in basic cellular functions and also in microbial-mediated detoxification of metal pollutants. The objective of this study was to develop an easily operated, simultaneous, and continuous method for dynamic monitoring of trace metal ions during bacterial growth periods. Here, we used a microdialysis (MD) sampling technique combined with detection through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine and quantify trace metal ions. After optimization, we used a retrodialysis technique and a no-net-flux method to assess the probe recovery and analytical performance of the proposed system. The mean probe recoveries of cobalt, copper, strontium, cadmium, and lead were 64.4, 92.6, 40.8, 84.2, and 54.7%, respectively, with typical precision values of 0.5–6.2, 1.1–7.7, 2.0–6.3, 2.3–7.8, and 1.5–7.8%, respectively. To further evaluate the practical applicability of using our proposed MD/ICP-MS method, we monitored, continuously for 24 h, the dynamic variations of the concentrations of each metal ion in four standardized bacterial species (ATCC 35218, 25922, 25923, 29213). Our analytical results revealed that MD sampling combined with ICP-MS detection had the ability to accurately and continuously monitor the levels of trace metal ions in microbial inoculated culture broths, potentially benefiting research into the bioavailability and detoxification processes of trace metal ions in microbial samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abacterial growth 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acobalt 3acopper 3aculture media 3alead 3ametal ions 3amicrodialysis 3amonitoring 3apollutants 3asampling 3astrontium1 aHung, Chih-Chang1 aLee, Cheng-Fa1 aHsu, Pi-Fu1 aHuang, Yeou-Lih0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 17, v. 4, no. 93 p.51716-51721dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra07941h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014600156300002000302520125300322592002801575650001601603650002201619650001201641650001601653650001101669650001801680650001501698650001701713650001901730650001501749650001301764650001901777650001701796650001801813700001701831700001301848700001401861700001901875773014401894856007402038852000902112655001202121IND60641790120221119203758.0190506e20160719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064179012DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta02570f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Lili10aConstruction of nitrogen-doped porous carbon buildings using interconnected ultra-small carbon nanosheets for ultra-high rate supercapacitors  ap. 11388-11396.  aHere, for the first time, we demonstrate a facile one-step construction of a nitrogen-doped porous carbon building (N-PCB) using interconnected ultra-small carbon nanosheets through the carbonization of biomass (Auricularia) using ZnCl₂ as the activating agent and NH₄Cl as the nitrogen source. Due to its high specific surface area (1607 m² g⁻¹) with a high mesopore ratio (91%), interconnected porous structure with short ion diffusion paths, and nitrogen doping (4.8 at%), the N-PCB electrode exhibits a high specific capacitance of 347 F g⁻¹ at 1 A g⁻¹, excellent rate capability (278 F g⁻¹ at 50 A g⁻¹, 80% of capacitance retention) and outstanding cycling stability (only 2% loss in specific capacitance after 10 000 cycles). Moreover, the assembled N-PCB symmetric supercapacitor is stabilized with excellence cycling stability (4% loss after 20 000 cycles) at 1.6 V in 1 M Na₂SO₄ aqueous electrolyte, delivering a high energy density of 22 W h kg⁻¹, much higher than that of most of the reported carbon-based symmetric supercapacitors in aqueous electrolytes. Therefore, these exciting results suggest a low-cost and environmentally friendly design of electrode materials for high-performance supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAuricularia 3aammonium chloride 3abiomass 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aenergy density 3ananosheets 3anitrogen 3asodium sulfate 3asurface area 3azinc chloride1 aSheng, Lizhi1 aChen, Xu1 aWei, Tong1 aFan, Zhuangjun0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 July 19, v. 4, no. 29 p.11388-11396dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta02570f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02444naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013600182300001800318520110400336592002801440650002001468650001501488650001501503650001101518650001901529650001301548650001701561650002601578653002501604653003101629700003201660700002801692700002101720700001901741700002301760700002901783773012701812856008601939852000902025655001202034IND60794555620221122062903.0220926e20220921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079455562DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2021.19140302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFouedjou, Romuald Tématio10aTwo new triterpenoid saponins: telephiifoliosides A and B from the roots of Corrigiola litoralis subsp. telephiifolia (Pourr.)

(Caryophyllaceae) was investigated for its constituents and two previously unreported monodesmosides triterpene saponins, telephiifoliosides A and B (1 and 2), along with the known bonushenricoside A (3) were isolated. Their structures were elucidated by combined spectroscopic and spectrometric techniques (¹H NMR, ¹³C NMR, HSQC, ¹H-¹H COSY, HMBC, TOCSY, NOESY, HRESIMS) and chemical methods. The structures of the new saponins were established as; 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranosyljaligonic acid (1), and 3-O-α-L-arabinopyranosylphytolaccagenin ester (2). Upon evaluation of the antiproliferative activity on human malignant epithelial (HeLa) cells, none of the isolated compounds was efficient at the concentration of 33 µM. HighlightsThis is the first phytochemical study on Corrigiola litoralis subsp. telephiifolia. Two new saponins were isolated from the roots of Corrigiola litoralis subsp. telephiifolia.

This tree is exposed to several tree-killing bark beetle-microbial complexes, including the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and the phytopathogenic fungus Grosmannia clavigera that it vectors, which are among the most important. Induced responses play a crucial role in conifer defenses, yet these have not been reported in ponderosa pine. We compared concentrations of terpenes and a phenylpropanoid, two phytochemical classes with strong effects against bark beetles and their symbionts, in constitutive phloem tissue and in tissue following mechanical wounding or simulated D. ponderosae attack (mechanical wounding plus inoculation with G. clavigera). We also tested whether potential induced responses were localized or systemic. Ponderosa pines showed pronounced induced defenses to inoculation, increasing their total phloem concentrations of monoterpenes 22.3-fold, sesquiterpenes 56.7-fold, and diterpenes 34.8-fold within 17 days. In contrast, responses to mechanical wounding alone were only 5.2, 11.3, and 7.7-fold, respectively. Likewise, the phenylpropanoid estragole (4-allyanisole) rose to 19.1-fold constitutive levels after simulated attack but only 4.4-fold after mechanical wounding. Overall, we found no evidence of systemic induction after 17 days, which spans most of this herbivore’s narrow peak attack period, as significant quantitative and compositional changes within and between terpenoid groups were localized to the wound site. Implications to the less frequent exploitation of ponderosa than lodgepole pine by D. ponderosae, and potential advantages of rapid localized over long-term systemic responses in this system, are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aGrosmannia 3aPinus ponderosa 3abark 3abark beetles 3aconifers 3aditerpenoids 3aecosystems 3aherbivores 3amethyl chavicol 3amonoterpenoids 3aphloem 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3asesquiterpenoids 3asymbionts 3atrees 3aNorth America1 aTrowbridge, Amy1 aMason, Charles J.1 aRaffa, Kenneth F.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2016 Jan., v. 42, no. 1 p.1-12dSpringer USx0098-03317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-015-0659-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004400113040001800157100001600175245007200191300001600263520096100279592002801240650001101268650001201279650001101291650001201302650001401314650001201328650003901340650001401379650001001393650001301403650001201416650006801428650002501496650005701521650001001578650005501588651002001643651003501663700001501698700001401713773011301727856005701840852000901897655001201906IND50089066320221120211921.0140426e200106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008906632DNAL7 a114912232pmid7 a10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb12990.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPHILBEY, AW12aA neurological locomotor disorder in sheep grazing Stachys arvensis  ap. 427-430.  aObjective To describe the clinical signs and pathology of a neurological locomotor disorder in sheep associated with ingestion of Stachys arvensis. Design Field observations and laboratory examinations. Procedure Clinical and pathological examinations were performed on sheep with suspected S arvensis intoxication. Field observations Merino sheep in a flock on the southwestern slopes of New South Wales developed a neurological disorder after grazing S arvensis. Affected animals had pelvic limb paresis and a proprioceptive deficit. When forced to exercise they stumbled and collapsed. Recovery following removal from the plant was slow. Many deaths were associated with the outbreak. Results Affected sheep developed a mild degenerative myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy. Deficiencies of vitamins A and E were also observed in the affected flock. Conclusion Grazing S arvensis is sometimes associated with a neurological locomotor disorder in sheep.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aStachys 3aflocks 3agrazing 3aingestion 3aparesis 3aperipheral nervous system diseases 3apoisoning 3asheep 3avitamins 2aAnimals 2aGait Disorders, Neurologicxepidemiologyxetiologyxveterinary. 2aLamiaceaexpoisoning 2aPlant Poisoningxepidemiologyxetiologyxveterinary. 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxetiologyxpathology. 3aNew South Wales 0aNew South Walesxepidemiology.1 aHAWKER, AM1 aEVERS, JV0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2001 June, v. 79, no. 6 p.427-430dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb12990.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008500168520173600253592002801989650001602017650001302033650001402046650001602060650001902076650001502095653001702110653000902127653002702136653002602163700001702189700002002206700001802226700001702244773011102261856008502372852000902457655001202466IND60740469420221119095608.0220321e20210915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074046942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1175122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Wenjiao10aInfluencing factors of PM2.5 and O3 from 2016 to 2020 based on DLNM and WRF-CMAQ  aIn this study, distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) were built to characterize the non-linear exposure-lag-response relationship between the concentration of PM₂.₅ and O₃ and multiple influencing factors, including basic meteorological elements and precursors. Then, a stratified analysis of different years, seasons, pollution levels, and wind direction was conducted. DLNMs and coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Model-Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (WRF-CMAQ) were used to evaluate PM₂.₅ and O₃ changes attributed to meteorological conditions and anthropogenic emissions comparing 2020 with 2016. As DLNMs showed, PM₂.₅ pollution was promoted by low wind speed, high temperature, low humidity, and high concentrations of SO₂, NO₂, and O₃, among which NO₂ tended to be the dominant influencing factor. O₃ pollution was promoted by low wind speed, high temperature, low humidity, high concentration of PM₂.₅ and low concentration of NO₂, among which temperature tended to be the dominant influencing factor. Moreover, north-south and easterly winds showed the greatest contribution to PM₂.₅ and O₃, respectively. Both DLNMs and CMAQ showed that anthropogenic factors alleviated PM₂.₅ pollution but aggravated O₃ pollution in 2020 in comparison with 2016, so did meteorological factors, but with smaller impacts. And anthropogenic influences were more evident in heavily polluted seasons for both PM₂.₅ and O₃. This research may help understand the influencing factors of PM₂.₅ and O₃ and provide scientific guide for abatement policies. Moreover, the good consistency in the results obtained from DLNMs and CMAQ indicated the reliability of the two models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3ahumidity 3apollution 3atemperature 3awind direction 3awind speed 0aPM2.5 and O3 0aDLNM 0aMeteorological effects 0aAnthropogenic effects1 aWang, Xiaoqi1 aCheng, Shuiyuan1 aWang, Ruipeng1 aZhu, Jiaxian0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Sept. 15, v. 285 p.117512-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.1175123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01903naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011200174300001800286520044300304536016100747592002800908650001300936650000900949650001900958650001500977650001300992650002601005650002201031653002501053653001301078653001501091653001501106700002101121700001601142700001901158700002401177700002001201700002601221773012701247856008601374852000901460655001201469IND60794555820221122063527.0220926e20220921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079455582DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2021.19146112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, Nhan Trung10aTwo new derivatives of 8-prenyl-5,7-dihydroxycoumarin from the stems of Streblus ilicifolius (S.Vidal) Corn  ap. 4967-4972.  aFrom the EtOAc-soluble extract of the stems of Streblus ilicifolius (Moraceae), two new secondary metabolites named strebluses A (1) and B (2) were isolated.

Photographs of 1005 beverage packages were quantitatively content-analysed to code whether a variety of child-directed, health-oriented and other marketing strategies (e.g. sales promotions) were present on each product’s FOP. Strategies were then analysed based on beverages’ product category, total sugar, energy and tax status (beverages with added sugars are taxed at different rates). Photographs were taken in six urban supermarkets in Santiago, Chile, representing five different supermarket chains. Beverages using child-directed characters or nature/fruit references were higher in total sugar and beverages with child-directed characters or childhood/family references were higher in energy than beverages without these respective strategies. Of the beverages taxed at the highest rate (greatest amount of added sugars), 49 % used nutrition and health appeals and 80 % used nature or fruit appeals. Plain waters and plain milks were less likely than other selected product categories to use health-oriented appeals or multiple FOP strategies in combination. FOP marketing on beverages varied according to the nutritional quality of the product, with heavier use of health-oriented and child-directed strategies in less healthy products. Marketing activities warrant continued observation to evaluate how industry responds to new marketing restrictions as these restrictions are evaluated in the light of existing taxes and other regulatory efforts to improve diets and reduce obesity-related disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadded sugars 3abeverages 3achildhood 3adiet 3aenergy content 3afruits 3amarketing strategies 3anutritive value 3aobesity-related diseases 3apackaging 3aphotographs 3asales 3asupermarkets 3ataxes 3ayouth 3aChile 0aChild-directed 0aFront-of-package 0aMarketing 0aSugar-sweetened beverages1 aBarker, Joshua O1 aKanter, Rebecca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4867-54481 aCorvalán, Camila1 aReyes, Marcela1 aTaillie, Lindsey Smith1 aDillman Carpentier, Francesca R0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 Feb., v. 21, no. 3 p.454-464dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170026713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02479naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001900159245013100178500002200309520104000331592002801371650001501399650001501414650001401429650001401443650001601457650001101473650001901484650002401503650002601527650001701553653002801570653002901598653002901627653002101656653002401677700001401701700002001715700001401735700005301749700001401802773010201816856009401918852000902012655001202021IND60662861420221119055218.0190906e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066286142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.1089582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Heng-Xiang10aInfluence of the degree of polymerization of cellulose on the water absorption performance of hydrogel and adsorption kinetics  aPre-press version  aThe cellulose with different degrees of polymerization (DPs) was successfully prepared and applied to synthesize a series of superabsorbent hydrogel (SAH) by grafting polymerization. Cellulose could be partly degraded by the combined effect of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO). The DP of cellulose decreased by 21% under this pretreatment method. The quantity of water absorption (Q) of SAH derived from the cellulose with different DPs was evaluated. Results indicated that the DP of cellulose and the Q value of SAH had a good linear relationship when DP ranged from 101.5 to 195. The Q value increased linearly when DP decreased. The Q values of SAH synthesized from the cellulose (II), produced after the combined effect of UV and NaClO, were 328 and 129 g/g in distilled water and 0.9 wt% NaCl solution, respectively. The kinetic mechanism for the water absorption of SAH was efficiently described by the second-order model. This work can provide a guide for SAH synthesis based on DP of cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3ahydrogels 3airradiation 3amodels 3apolymerization 3asodium hypochlorite 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater uptake 0aSuperabsorbent hydrogel 0aDegradation of cellulose 0aDegree of polymerization 0aWater absorption 0aAdsorption kinetics1 aWang, Qun1 aZhang, Lüming,1 aTian, Xin1 aCao, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6871-56921 aJin, Li'e0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2019 Sept. 02, dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2019.1089583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001300188245010000201300001200301506007600313520079400389592002801183596005901211596005901270596006401329596006401393596007801457596008001535506003701615650002101652650002301673650001301696650002401709650002301733650001101756650002601767650002101793650001701814650001901831650003801850700001501888700001301903700001701916700001901933700001601952700001401968773011701982856008202099852000902181655001202190IND60614280220221207073533.0181102e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061428022DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-018-1456-z2doi7 aPMC61603722pmcid7 a303059922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Hao10aProduction of succinate by recombinant Escherichia coli using acetate as the sole carbon source  ap. 421.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAcetate is a potential low-cost carbon source that can be generated by biological and chemical processes. In this study, deletion of sdhAB encoding succinate dehydrogenase, iclR encoding the isocitrate lyase regulator, and maeB encoding the malic enzyme, and overexpression of acs encoding acetyl-CoA synthetase, gltA encoding citrate synthase, and acnB encoding aconitate hydratase in the wild-type Escherichia coli MG1655 strain yielded the recombinant E. coli strain WCY-7, which could synthesize succinate from acetate. After 48 h batch fermentation, this strain accumulated 11.23 mM succinate from 50 mM sodium acetate.

They were so-called bifunctional surfactants synthesized to be used as common pesticides or as antioxidants. The latter application was to be ensured by providing the compounds studied with an antioxidant group. Studies on antioxidative possibilities of those compounds were performed on pig erythrocytes. Due to their hydrophobic parts, they anchor in the erythrocyte membrane and influence the degree of lipid oxidation in the erythrocyte membrane subjected to UV radiation. It was found that compounds of both series decreased the oxidation of the membrane lipids. The inhibition of this oxidation increased with the length of their hydrophobic chains up to fourteen carbon atoms. The compounds of the longest hydrophobic chains showed a somewhat weaker antioxidative activity. Of the two series studied compounds were more effective having bromide ions as counterions. The corresponding compounds of a second series (chlorides) protected erythrocyte significantly weaker against oxidation. The effect of the compounds on fluidity of the erythrocyte membrane has been studied in order to explain the oxidation results. Change in fluidity of the erythrocyte ghost membranes was found also dependent on length of the hydrophobic part of the compounds and was more pronounced in the case of bromide surfactants.The final conclusion is that the compounds studied can be succesfully used as antioxidant agents of good efficacy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium salts 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarbon 3acell membranes 3achlorides 3aerythrocytes 3ahydrophobicity 3aions 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3aoxidation 3apesticides 3asurfactants 3aswine 3aultraviolet radiation 0aErythrocyte Membrane 0aAntioxidant Activity 0aFluidity1 aSarapuk, Janusz1 aOświęcimska, Małgorzata1 aWitek, Stanisław0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 55, no. 11-12 p.976-980dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2000-11-12213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245015600165300001600321520127900337592002801616650004401644650002201688650002901710650001301739650001301752650001301765650001001778650002001788650002401808650000901832650002201841650002601863650001201889650002401901650001701925650001101942650001501953650001801968650002201986650001802008650002102026650001602047653001702063700001402080700001302094700001702107700001702124700001302141700001902154700001402173773013502187856008702322852000902409655001202418IND60662861820221119055228.0191231e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066286182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.08.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Ke10aEffect of syringic acid incorporation on the physical, mechanical, structural and antibacterial properties of chitosan film for quail eggs preservation  ap. 876-884.  aThe physical mechanics and structural properties of composite films based on chitosan and syringic acid (SA) were studied in this study. The results indicated that the addition of SA made the chitosan-SA films exhibited higher density, water solubility and opacity, but the water vapor permeability and water content were decreased. In addition, Chitosan-SA films had a significant antibacterial effect on test bacteria. The surface and cross-section of chitosan-SA films were more uniform and smoother when combined with 0.25% and 0.5% 0f SA. The FT-IR and XRD spectra of the chitosan-SA film indicated that the interaction between chitosan and SA may be non-covalent, and DSC indicated that the thermal stability of the composite film was reduced. In summary, the modified color, increased bacteriostatic and water-blocking properties, as well as the slight changes in mechanical properties indicated that the addition of SA may contribute to extend the shelf life of the food. Thus, chitosan-SA films incorporating 0.25% and 0.5% of SA can be further explored as active packing materials for food preservation. The composite film was used for the preservation of quail egg coatings, and it was found that 0.25% and 0.5% of the coating film had a good preservation effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3achitosan 3acoatings 3acolor 3acomposite films 3acomposite materials 3aeggs 3afood preservation 3amechanical properties 3aopacity 3apackaging materials 3apermeability 3aquails 3ashelf life 3asyringic acid 3athermal stability 3awater content 3awater solubility 3awater vapor 0aAntibacteria1 aDang, Hui1 aLiu, Liu1 aHu, Xinzhong1 aLi, Xiaoping1 aMa, Zhen1 aWang, Xiaolong1 aRen, Tian0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 141 p.876-884dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.08.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245010900164520147300273592002801746650001801774650001101792650001701803650001501820650002001835650001901855650001301874773011801887856007202005852000902077655001202086IND60653185520221117225511.0190714e20161224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065318552DNAL7 a10.3390/w90100052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangergraber, Guenter10aApplying Process-Based Models for Subsurface Flow Treatment Wetlands: Recent Developments and Challenges  aTo date, only few process-based models for subsurface flow treatment wetlands have been developed. For modelling a treatment wetland, these models have to comprise a number of sub-models to describe water flow, pollutant transport, pollutant transformation and degradation, effects of wetland plants, and transport and deposition of suspended particulate matter. The two most advanced models are the HYDRUS Wetland Module and BIO-PORE. These two models are briefly described. This paper shows typical simulation results for vertical flow wetlands and discusses experiences and challenges using process-based wetland models in relation to the sub-models describing the most important wetland processes. It can be demonstrated that existing simulation tools can be applied for simulating processes in treatment wetlands. Most important for achieving a good match between measured and simulated pollutant concentrations is a good calibration of the water flow and transport models. Only after these calibrations have been made and the effect of the influent fractionation on simulation results has been considered, should changing the parameters of the biokinetic models be taken into account. Modelling the effects of wetland plants is possible and has to be considered when important. Up to now, models describing clogging are the least established models among the sub-models required for a complete wetland model and thus further development and research is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3afractionation 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3asubsurface flow 3awetland plants 3awetlands0 tWater.g2016 Dec. 24, v. 9, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w90100053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245015700190300001600347520172500363592002802088650001502116650003002131650002702161650002002188650001202208650002002220650002602240650002402266650001402290650001202304650002402316650002502340650001002365650002002375650002202395650001502417653003502432653001902467653001502486653003702501653002302538700002002561700002302581700001902604773012702623856008102750852000902831655001202840IND60651508520221121031926.0190711e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065150852DNAL7 a290813152pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800170027862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraziose, Matthew M10aSystematic review of the design, implementation and effectiveness of mass media and nutrition education interventions for infant and young child feeding  ap. 273-287.  aTo systematically review the design, implementation and effectiveness of mass media and nutrition education interventions for improving infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices and related psychosocial factors. A search of PubMed, Embase and PsycINFO databases, a Google search, and a consultation with experts in the field of IYCF performed in July 2016. Low- and middle-income countries, as defined by the World Bank Group. Eligible studies: included a mass media component (with or without nutrition education); conducted a pre–post evaluation (with or without a control group); assessed IYCF knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and/or practices; and were published in English between 2000 and present. Eighteen unique studies were identified that examined the effect of mass media (types included: television; print; voice and/or SMS (text) messages; radio; megaphones/loudspeakers; videos; social media; songs/dramas) and nutrition education interventions on IYCF practices within thirteen countries. Of these, fifteen studies reported improvements in breast- and/or complementary feeding practices, using indicators recommended by the WHO, and six studies reported improvements in related psychosocial factors. However, little detail was provided on the use of formative research, a formal behaviour change theory and behaviour change techniques. Few studies reported both dose delivered and participants’ exposure to the intervention. Despite evidence of effectiveness, few common elements in the design of interventions were identified. Future research should consistently report these details to open the ‘black box’ of IYCF interventions, identify effective design components and ensure replicability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Bank 3aWorld Health Organization 3aattitudes and opinions 3abehavior change 3abreasts 3achild nutrition 3acomplementary feeding 3acomplementary foods 3adatabases 3aexperts 3anutrition education 3apsychosocial factors 3aradio 3asocial networks 3asystematic review 3atelevision 0aInfant and young child feeding 0aBreast-feeding 0aMass media 0aLow- and middle-income countries 0aBehavioural theory1 aDowns, Shauna M1 aO’Brien, Quentin1 aFanzo, Jessica0 tPublic health nutrition.g2018 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.273-287dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800170027863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01357naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245007500168300001800243520027200261592002800533650001400561650001400575650002300589650001100612650001600623650002200639700002000661700001700681700001500698700001600713700001800729700001800747700001900765773010500784856008500889852000900974655001200983IND60579250220221117001732.0170816e20160318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057925022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.6b002412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lin-Bao10aCobalt(II)-Catalyzed C–H Amination of Arenes with Simple Alkylamines  ap. 1318-1321.  aA new method of cobalt-catalyzed amination of arylamides with simple alkylamines is reported through C(sp²)–H bond functionalization.

Then we focus on the 186 contributions approached from a social sciences perspective, establishing a taxonomy to classify the contributions into the main issues covered. We identify contributions dealing with governance, with public acceptance, with markets and prices, and with political or policy determinants of renewable energies. In an empirical application we show that more democratic countries tend to invest more in renewable energies, taking into account other determinants (e.g. income, energy dependence, pollution emissions) of this investment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aenergy 3agovernance 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3apolitics 3apollution 3aprices 3aprotocols 3arenewable energy sources 3asocial sciences 3asystematic review 3ataxonomy 0aRenewable energy 0aPolitics 0aPolicy 0aDemocracy 0aDevelopment 0aC35 0aC36 0aQ43 0aO11 0aO13 0aO501 aSantos, Marcelo Serra0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Aug. 10, v. 192 p.553-568dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.04.1903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245008400159300001600243520206000259592002802319650002202347650001302369650001002382650001002392650001502402650001102417650002602428650002402454650002502478650001302503651002202516700002302538773011002561856007102671852000902742655001202751IND60518274820221121002837.0160411e197802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051827482DNAL7 a10.2307/29373002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnor, Edward F.10aSpecies Number and Compositional Similarity of the Galapagos Flora and Avifauna  ap. 219-248.  aThe flora and avifauna of the Galapagos Islands are used to reexamine quantitative analyses of species numbers and compositional similarities. Conflicts in the results of previous analyses of the Galapagos flora are reconciled and are shown to be the result of using different species numbers and physiographic parameter measurements. The idea that Galapagos plant species numbers largely reflect conditions in the archipelago during the Pleistocene glaciations (i.e., that relaxation times are very long) is criticized, and the more parsimonious alternative, that they reflect recent conditions, is proposed. Generalizations about factors determining species numbers that are based on multiple regression and correlation are precarious. The number of botanical collecting trips to each of the Galapagos Islands is a better predictor of species numbers than are area, elevation, or isolation. Two null hypotheses concerning the determination of floral and avifaunal compositional similarities among the Galapagos Islands are proposed and tested, through the application of a new method of similarity analysis employing the "expected number of taxa shared" (Eₜ ₛ) and its variance (VE ₜ ₛ). These hypotheses view compositional similarities as resulting from the stochastic dispersal and persistence of a pool of species equally likely to colonize (Null Hypothesis I), and of a pool of species with different dispersal and persistence abilities (Null Hypothesis II). Although both hypotheses are found to be inadequate models of compositional similarity in the Galapagos, the results suggest that a substantial proportion of compositional similarity can be considered a consequence of stochastic processes of dispersal and persistence, and that compositional similarity arises indirectly as a result of similar species numbers rather than directly in a fashion determined by the physical environment or species interactions. Analyses of the distribution of congeneric bird species in the Galapagos, based on similarity analyses, are also criticized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleistocene epoch 3aavifauna 3abirds 3aflora 3aglaciation 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3aregression analysis 3astochastic processes 3avariance 3aGalapagos Islands1 aSimberloff, Daniel0 tEcological monographs.g1978 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.219-248dEcological Society of Americax0012-96157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/29373003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03381naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012100162300001800283500001500301520184200316592002802158650001702186650001702203650002502220650001102245650001102256650001802267650002702285650000802312650001402320650001402334650003402348650000702382650002502389650002202414650001602436650003102452650003302483650001802516653002502534700002102559700002402580700001702604773017902621856007802800852000902878655001202887IND60118226820221119132638.0141126e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011822682DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.060871-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirota, Kikue10aGracilibacillus alcaliphilus sp. nov., a facultative alkaliphile isolated from indigo fermentation liquor for dyeing  ap. 3174-3180.  a2019-12-04  aA facultatively alkaliphilic, lactic-acid-producing and halophilic strain, designated SG103T, was isolated from a fermented Polygonum indigo (Polygonum tinctorium Lour.) liquor sample for dyeing prepared in a laboratory. 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny suggested that SG103T is a member of the genus Gracilibacillus with the closest relatives being ‘Gracilibacillus xinjiangensis’ J2 (similarity: 97.06 %), Gracilibacillus thailandensis TP2-8T (97.06 %) and Gracilibacillus halotolerans NNT (96.87 %). Cells of the isolate stained Gram-positive and were facultatively anaerobic straight rods that were motile by peritrichous flagella. The strain grew at temperatures between 13 and 48 °C with the optimum at 39 °C. It grew in the range pH 7–10 with the optimum at pH 9. The isoprenoid quinone detected was menaquinone-7 (MK-7) and the DNA G+C content was 41.3 mol%. The whole-cell fatty acid profile mainly (>10 %) consisted of iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and anteiso-C17 : 0. Unlike other reported species of the genus Gracilibacillus, the strain lacked diphosphatidylglycerol as a major polar lipid. DNA–DNA hybridization experiments with strains exhibiting greater than 96.87 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, ‘G. xinjiangensis’ J2, G. thailandensis TP2-8T and G. halotolerans NNT, revealed 2±4 %, 4±9 % and 3±2 % relatedness, respectively. On the basis of the differences in phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, and the results of phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences and DNA–DNA relatedness data from reported species of the genus Gracilibacillus, strain SG103T merits classification as a members of a novel species, for which the name Gracilibacillus alcaliphilus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SG103T ( = JCM 17253T = NCIMB 14683T).  aPublisher supplied data 3amicrobiology 3afermentation 3aPersicaria tinctoria 3adyeing 3aindigo 3aribosomal RNA 3afatty acid composition 3aDNA 3aphylogeny 3aflagellum 3aGracilibacillus thailandensis 3apH 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence homology 3atemperature 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aGracilibacillus halotolerans 3achemotaxonomy 0aPolygonum tinctorium1 aHanaoka, Yoshiko1 aNodasaka, Yoshinobu1 aYumoto, Isao0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2014 Sept., v. 64, no.

We investigated Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes from Benin and Togo for their intensity of insecticide resistance and we discussed the involvement of genotyped mechanisms in the resistance-phenotypes observed. Three- to five-day-old adult mosquitoes emerged from field and laboratory An. gambiae larvae were assayed using WHO tube intensity tests against various doses of deltamethrin: 1× (0.05%); 2× (0.1%); 5× (0.25%); 7.5× (0.375%) and those of pirimiphos-methyl: 0.5× (0.125%); 1× (0.25%). Members of An. gambiae complex were screened in field populations using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The presence of kdrᴿ(1014F/1014S) and ace-1ᴿ(119S) mutations was also investigated using TaqMan and PCR-RFLP techniques, respectively. Anopheles gambiae from field were very resistant to deltamethrin, whereas KisKdr and AcerKdrKis strains displayed 100% mortality rates at 2× the diagnostic dose. In contrast, the field mosquitoes displayed a low resistance-intensity against 1× the diagnostic dose of pirimiphos-methyl, whereas AcerKis and AcerKdrKis strains showed susceptibility at 0.5× the diagnostic dose. Anopheles gambiae s.s., Anopheles coluzzii, and Anopheles arabiensis were identified. Allelic frequencies of kdrᴿ (1014F) and ace-1ᴿ (119S) mutations in the field populations varied from 0.65 to 1 and 0 to 0.84, respectively. The field An. gambiae displayed high-resistance levels against deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl when compared with those of the laboratory An. gambiae-resistant strains. These results exhibit the complexity of underlying insecticide resistance mechanisms in these field malaria vectors. Graphical Abstract Summary: The field An. gambiae displayed high resistance levels against deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl when compared to those of the laboratory An. gambiae resistant strains. These results exhibit the complexity of underlying insecticide resistance mechanisms in these field malaria vectors. Figure.

For this purpose, the study collects the data of South Asian Economies for 2000–2018 from different sources such as world development indicators (WDI), International Energy Statistics (IES), and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) statistics. The study applied Pesaran’s (2007) second-generation unit root test to test the stationarity of the data. Wasteland’s (2007) test of cointegration was applied to examine the long-run association among modeled variables. The study confirmed the long-run association among modeled variables that turn to be stationary at the first differences. Moreover, the study applied fully modified least square (FMOLS) and dynamic least square (DOLS) to estimate the empirical results of the study. Results of the study show that the production of clean energy, green innovation, and green trade positively contributes to the green economic growth of South Asian Economies Graphical abstract  aPublisher supplied data 3aclean energy 3aeconomic development 3aeconomic sustainability 3aenergy 3apollution 3aresearch 3astatistics 3asustainable technology 3atrade 3awastelands1 aKousar, Shazia1 aPervaiz, Amber1 aTrinidad-Segovia, Juan E.1 adel Pilar Casado-Belmonte, Maria1 aAhmed, Wisal0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 5 p.6871-6885dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-15881-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245013200167300002000299520209000319592002802409650002202437650001502459650001902474650001002493650001402503650001802517650002202535650001602557650001602573650001502589650002102604650002502625650001502650650001402665650002102679650001102700650001202711650001902723650001702742650001002759651001302769700001802782700001902800700001702819700001802836700001802854700001602872773015502888856008303043852000903126655001203135IND60645939120221118013708.0220211e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064593912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-019-05061-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIjaz, Muhammad10aSewage waste water application improves the productivity of diverse wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars on a sandy loam soil  ap. 17045-17054.  aWater stress due to climate change is an emerging threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) productivity in the arid regions of the world which will impact the future food security. In this scenario, the investigations are needed to check the feasibility of alternate sources of irrigation water to fulfill the irrigation demands of the crops in the arid regions. This 2-year study was aimed to investigate the influence of three irrigation sources (sewage water, canal water, and underground water) on the productivity of 10 wheat cultivars under an arid climate of Layyah, Pakistan. The results indicated that the number of fertile tillers, grains per spike, 1000-grain weight, and grain yield varied from 114 to 168 m⁻², 34.8 to 53.3, 33.4 to 38.4 g, and 2.68 to 4.05 Mg ha⁻¹, respectively in various wheat cultivars. The highest fertile tillers (168 m⁻²) were recorded in cultivar Gold-2016 followed by Aas-2011 (155 cm), AARI-2011 (153 m⁻²), and Ujala-2016 (150 m⁻²). The highest 1000-grain weight of 38.4 g was recorded in cultivar NARC-2016. The grains per spike (53.3) were the highest in cultivar Ujala-2016. The grain yields were the highest in cultivars Ujala-2016 (4.05 Mg ha⁻¹) and Gold-2016 (3.91 Mg ha⁻¹). The highest grain yield of 3.71 Mg ha⁻¹ was recorded with sewage water irrigation against the grain yield of 3.18 and 2.91 Mg ha⁻¹ in canal and underground water irrigation, respectively. There existed a strong co-relation of fertile tillers and grains per spike with the grain yield of wheat. Application of sewage water also enhanced the total nitrogen, extractable potassium, and available phosphorous in soil. In crux, the cultivation of recently bread wheat cultivars (viz. Ujala-2016, Gold-2016) and the irrigation of field with sewage water in the absence of canal water might be a viable option to boost wheat productivity under arid regions. A range of genetic variability existed for different traits in the cultivars; therefore, these can be used to breed wheat cultivars to be used for sewage water cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3acrops 3acultivars 3afood security 3agenetic variation 3agrain yield 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3amunicipal wastewater 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asandy loam soils 3asewage 3atillers 3atotal nitrogen 3awater stress 3awheat 3aPakistan1 aWaheed, Abdul1 aUl-Allah, Sami1 aNawaz, Ahmad1 aWasaya, Allah1 aSattar, Abdul1 aSher, Ahmad0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2019 June, v. 26, no. 17 p.17045-17054dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-019-05061-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009200168300001600260500001900276520047900295592002800774650001600802650001400818650002900832650002700861650002100888700001700909700001600926700001900942700001900961700001700980700001800997700001701015700001801032700005001050773011801100856008301218852000901301655001201310IND60726498820221120070715.0210205e20210114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072649882DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c036882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Huai-Wei10aRhᴵᴵᴵ-Catalyzed C–H (Het)arylation/Vinylation of N-2,6-Difluoroaryl Acrylamides  ap. 656-662.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRhᴵᴵᴵ-catalyzed sp² C–H cross-coupling of acrylamides with organoboron reactants has been accomplished using a commercially available N-2,6-difluoroaryl acrylamide auxiliary.

The gene, corresponding to a differentially expressed LPS-responsive EST, was fully characterised to investigate its involvement in LPS-induced responses. The full genomic sequence, designated Nt-Sd-RLK, encodes for a S-domain RLK protein containing conserved modules (B-lectin-, S- and PAN-domains) reported to function in mediating protein–protein and protein–carbohydrate interactions in its extracellular domain, as well as the molecular architecture to transduce signals intracellularly through a Ser/Thr kinase domain. Phylogenetic analysis clustered Nt-Sd-RLK with S-domain RLKs induced by bacteria, wounding and salicylic acid. Perception of LPS induced a rapid, bi-phasic response in Nt-Sd-RLK expression with a 17-fold up-regulation at 3 and 9h. A defence-related W-box cis element was found in the promoter region of Nt-Sd-RLK and the transient induction of Nt-Sd-RLK in cultured cells by LPS exhibited a pattern typical of early response defence genes. Nt-Sd-RLK was also responsive to salicylic acid induction and was expressed in differentiated leaf tissue, where LPS elicited local as well as systemic up-regulation. The results contribute new knowledge about the potential role that S-domain RLKs may play within interactive signal transduction pathways associated with immunity and defence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aimmunity 3alipopolysaccharides 3aphylogeny 3aexpressed sequence tags 3asignal transduction 3acultured cells 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aleaves 3asalicylic acid 3agene expression regulation 3apromoter regions 3abacteria 2aCells, Cultured 2aExpressed Sequence Tags 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aLipopolysaccharidesxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Kinasesxgenetics 2aTobaccoxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenes1 avan Heerden, Henriëtte1 aDubery, Ian A.0 tGene.g2012 June 10, v. 501, no. 1 p.39-48dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2012.03.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245016300214300001600377520163800393592002802031650001602059650001502075650000902090650001202099650001202111650002502123650001002148650003602158650001202194650001902206650002402225650001802249650001202267650001902279650001002298651001802308653002202326653004002348653002102388653001502409653001202424653001502436700002202451700002702473773009602500856008402596852000902680655001202689IND60612254720221122014155.0180905e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061225472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2017.07.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHazzard, Vivienne M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3933-176610aWeight misperception and disordered weight control behaviors among U.S. high school students with overweight and obesity: Associations and trends, 1999–2013  ap. 189-195.  aTo examine prevalence of weight misperception (incongruence between one's perceived weight status and one's actual weight status) and disordered weight control behaviors (DWCBs; unhealthy behaviors aiming to control or modify weight), associations between weight misperception and DWCBs, and temporal trends in prevalence and associations among adolescents with overweight and obesity from 1999 to 2013.Self-reported data from eight biennial cycles (1999–2013) of the cross-sectional national Youth Risk Behavior Survey were used in analyses restricted to respondents with overweight/obesity. Data on weight status perception, use of fasting, purging, and diet pills to control weight, sex, race/ethnicity, and grade in school were used in multivariate logistic regression models.Among U.S. high school students with overweight and obesity, no linear temporal trends were detected for prevalence of weight misperception, fasting, or purging between 1999 and 2013, while a significant linear decrease was observed for prevalence of diet pill use between 1999 and 2013 (b=−0.81, p<0.01). Using data pooled across 1999–2013, weight misperception predicted lower use of all DWCBs examined in this study among females and lower use of fasting to control weight among males. No significant changes over time in associations of weight misperception with fasting or purging were observed, though the association between weight misperception and diet pill use weakened somewhat across 1999–2013.In the context of increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity, weight misperception appears to be a robust protective factor for DWCBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abody image 3adiet 3afasting 3afemales 3ahigh school students 3amales 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aobesity 3apurging (food) 3aregression analysis 3arisk behavior 3asurveys 3aweight control 3ayouth 3aUnited States 0aWeight perception 0aDisordered weight control behaviors 0aEating disorders 0aBody image 0aObesity 0aAdolescent1 aHahn, Samantha L.1 aSonneville, Kendrin R.0 tEating behaviors.g2017 Aug., v. 26 p.189-195dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2017.07.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010400168300001600272506011700288506007600405520097100481592002801452506003701480650001901517650001001536650001001546650001301556650001801569650002001587650001701607650001701624653002401641653001901665653002001684653002201704653002701726653001601753700001701769700002201786700002501808773011101833856008601944852000902030655001202039IND60778744420221207135821.0221004e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077874442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamada, Yuma10aInnovative cancer nanomedicine based on immunology, gene editing, intracellular trafficking control  ap. 357-369.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe recent rapid progress in the area of drug delivery systems (DDS) has opened a new era in medicine with a strong linkage to understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with cancer survival.

Lastly, a new organelle, mitochondria will be the focus of creating a new cancer treatment strategy by a MITO-Porter which can deliver macromolecules directly to mitochondria of cancer cells via a membrane fusion approach and the impact of controlled intracellular trafficking will be discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acancer therapy 3adrugs 3agenes 3aimmunity 3aimmunotherapy 3amembrane fusion 3amitochondria 3ananomedicine 0aLipid nanoparticles 0aGenome editing 0aInnate immunity 0aAdjuvant delivery 0aMitochondrial delivery 0aMITO-porter1 aSato, Yusuke1 aNakamura, Takashi1 aHarashima, Hideyoshi0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Aug., v. 348 p.357-369dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2022.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03975naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245021100172300001600383520199600399592002802395650003102423650001302454650003102467650001202498650002202510650001202532650002602544650001502570650001402585650002102599650002302620650002202643650001502665650001402680650004102694650001302735650001602748650001302764650001602777650001002793650001402803650002302817650001702840650000902857650001902866650001102885650001402896650001102910653000902921653002502930653001602955653003302971653000803004653001103012700005503023700001603078700001503094773010903109856008603218852000903304655001203313IND60634803720221119164659.0190425e20190627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063480372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.02.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPathak, Deepmala10aIsolation, screening and molecular characterization of free-living bacteria of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and their interplay impact on growth and production of potato plant under Mycorrhizal association  ap. 388-397.  aPlant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are associated both with the rhizosphere and/or may be non-rhizospheric. The present study isolation, screening and molecular characterisation of PGPR from the potato cultivars Kufri sindhuri, Kufri chipsona-3 and Kufri lauvkar. These isolates were screened for their traits like production of indole acetic acid (IAA), ammonia, hydrogen cyanide (HCN), siderophore presence, phosphate solubilisation (P-solubilisation) and also antifungal activity. All the bacterial isolates were found positive for P-solubilisation, IAA, ammonia and siderophore production. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens followed by Pseudomonas brassicacearum showed highest P-solubilisation and IAA production whereas HCN production was found in three isolates. Certain species of Bacillus and Pseudomonas were showing antifungal activity against Pythium sp. and Fusarium sp. Phylogentic relationship among the identified PGPR as a phylogenetic tree was generated by neighbour joining approach with the help of MEGA 6.06 version and UPGMA dendogram constructed. When compared PGPR isolates, PB12, PR3 and PR1 were found to be closely associated and PB10 and PB11 were distantly related. Mycorrhizal fungi are symbionts forming mutualistic relationship with plant roots. In this study, surface-sterilized potato tubers were sown in earthen pots filled with sterile soil. Pots were inoculated with AMF along with the PGPRs and another half without any AMF and PGPRs inoculation representing control. Inoculation was done twice 3 days before sowing the tubers and on the onset of seedling emergence. Plants along with their controls were sampled at 90 days after planting (DAP). The potato growth parameters including the tuber yield had increased by using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) bioinoculants in interplay with PGPRs under pot culture conditions. AMF and PGPRs are environmentally friendly and are known to offer sustainable approach in increasing the production of crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aFusarium 3aPseudomonas brassicacearum 3aPythium 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aammonia 3aantifungal properties 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3ahydrogen cyanide 3aindole acetic acid 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aphosphates 3aphylogeny 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplanting 3apot culture 3apotatoes 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3ascreening 3aseedling emergence 3asiderophores 3asoil 3asolubilization 3asowing 3asymbionts 3atubers 0aPGPR 0aBacillus pseudomonas 0aRhizosphere 0aNon rhisospheric (bulk) soil 0aAMF 0aPotato1 aLone, Rafiq1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8732-60001 aKhan, Salim1 aKoul, K.K.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 June 27, v. 252 p.388-397dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.02.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245007500162300001600237520142600253592002801679650001501707650001501722650001401737650001201751650002301763650001401786650001101800650001001811650003201821650002701853653001501880653001701895653002001912653001801932653002101950653002301971653002501994700001602019773010702035856007702142852000902219655001202228IND60517565020221118052138.0160331e20150204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051756502DNAL7 a10.1139/cjz-2014-02312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorcoran, A.J.10aNegligible energetic cost of sonar jamming in a bat–moth interaction  ap. 331-335.  aEnergetic cost can constrain how frequently animals exhibit behaviors. The energetic cost of acoustic signaling for communication has been the subject of numerous studies; however, the cost of acoustic signaling for predator defense has not been addressed. We studied the energetic cost and efficiency of sound production for the clicks produced by the moth Bertholdia trigona (Grote, 1879) (Grote’s bertholdia) to jam the sonar of predatory bats. This moth is an excellent model species because of its extraordinary ability to produce sound—it clicks at the highest known rate of any moth, up to 4500 clicks·s–¹. We measured the metabolic cost of clicking, resting, and flying from moths suspended in a respirometry chamber. Clicking was provoked by playing back an echolocation attack sequence. The cost of sound production for B.trigona was low (66% of resting metabolic rate) and the acoustic efficiency, or the percentage of metabolic power that is converted into sound, was moderately high (0.30% ± 0.15%) compared with other species. We discuss mechanisms that allow B.trigona to achieve their extraordinary clicking rates and high acoustic efficiency. Clicking for jamming bat sonar incurs negligible energetic cost to moths despite being the most effective known anti-bat defense. These results have implications for both the ecology of predator–prey interactions and the evolution of jamming signals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBertholdia 3aChiroptera 3aacoustics 3aanimals 3acost effectiveness 3aevolution 3aflight 3amoths 3apredator-prey relationships 3aresting metabolic rate 0aenergetics 0abioacoustics 0apredator–prey 0asonar jamming 0asound production 0aBertholdia trigona 0aGrote’s bertholdia1 aWoods, H.A.0 tCanadian journal of zoology.g2015 Feb. 4, v. 93, no. 4 p.331-335dNRC Research Pressx1480-32837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2014-02313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04565naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001300162245010600175300001800281520235900299592002802658650001602686650001802702650001502720650002002735650002202755650002002777650001402797650001402811650001002825650002002835650002302855650001802878650001502896650000902911650001502920650002802935650001502963650001502978650002402993650001503017650001103032650002303043650004703066650001203113650001803125650002303143650004303166650004603209650001403255650002103269650001103290650002603301650002003327650002503347650008003372653001803452653001503470653001403485700001603499700001603515700001603531700001503547700001703562773015303579856007803732852000903810655001203819IND60083480520221120175314.0190215e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008348052DNAL7 a235670512pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-63362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlop, G.10aMeta-analysis of factors that affect the utilization efficiency of phosphorus in lactating dairy cows  ap. 3936-3949.  aA meta-analysis investigation based on literature data was conducted to estimate the effect size of nutritional and animal factors on phosphorus (P) excretion in feces and concentrations of P in milk. Two data sets were created for statistical analysis: One to derive prediction equations for P in feces (25 studies; 130 treatments) and another for P in milk (19 studies; 94 treatments). Prediction equations were derived using mixed model regression analysis with a random effect for study, and equations were evaluated based on values for Bayesian information criterion (BIC), root mean square prediction error (RMSPE), and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) statistics. In terms of RMSPE and CCC values, fecal P excretion was best predicted by P intake, where P in feces (g/d)=−3.8(±3.45) + 0.64(±0.038) × P intake (g/d) (RMSPE: 18.3%, CCC: 0.869). However, significant effects of crude protein [g/kg of dry matter (DM)], neutral detergent fiber (g/kg of DM), and milk yield (kg/d) on fecal P excretion were also found. Despite a lack of improvement in terms of RMSPE and CCC values, these parameters may still explain part of the variation in fecal P excretion. For milk P, expressed as a fraction of P intake, the following equation had the highest CCC and the lowest RMSPE value: P in milk as a fraction of P intake (g/g)=0.42(±0.065) + 0.23(±0.018) × feed efficiency (i.e., fat- and protein-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) − 0.11(±0.0199) × P in feed (g/kg of DM) (RMSPE: 19.7%; CCC: 0.761). Equations derived to predict fecal P as a fraction of P intake (g/g) or milk P content (g/kg) could not adequately explain the observed variation and did not perform well in terms of RMSPE and CCC values. Examination of the residuals showed that P balance was a seemingly confounding factor in some of the models. The results presented here can be used to estimate P in feces and milk based on commonly measured dietary and milk variables, but could also be used to guide development of mechanistic models on P metabolism in lactating dairy cattle. Factors to consider in future research and modeling efforts regarding efficiency of P use include the effects of dietary neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, starch, variation in P content of milk, and effects of P resorption from bone and body tissues during early lactation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3acrude protein 3adairy cows 3adata collection 3adry matter intake 3aearly lactation 3aequations 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afeed conversion 3amechanistic models 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolism 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aresorption 3astarch 3astatistical models 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDietary Fiberxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDigestion 2aFecesxchemistry 2aFemale 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPhosphorus, Dietaryxadministration & dosagexmetabolismxpharmacokinetics. 0ameta-analysis 0aphosphorus 0adairy cow1 aEllis, J.L.1 aBannink, A.1 aKebreab, E.1 aFrance, J.1 aDijkstra, J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 June, v. 96, no. 6 p.3936-3949dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-63363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04198naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001700162245011100179300001800290520233000308592002802638650001302666650001602679650002302695650001802718650002002736650002202756650001302778650001402791650001402805650001002819650002302829650001602852650002402868650001602892650004702908650001202955650002102967650003302988650001303021650002103034650002103055650001103076650003303087650002003120650002203140653001703162653002103179653001803200653001503218700001303233700001903246700001803265700001903283700001803302773015303320856007803473852000903551655001203560IND60083480620221120175230.0190318e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008348062DNAL7 a235873812pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2013-66252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreter, A.M.10aGrowing dairy heifers prefer supplementary long straw when fed a nutrient-dense ration in a limited amount  ap. 3950-3958.  aThe objective of this study was to determine whether limit-fed heifers will choose to consume long particles, rather than short, of a low-nutritive feedstuff to ameliorate rumen function and meet foraging needs. Ten Holstein heifers 261.6±39.2 (mean ± SD) d of age were exposed to each of 2 dietary treatments, in a random order, over 2 successive 7-d treatment periods (4-d adaptation period and a 3-d data collection period) using a crossover design. The treatments were (1) a provision of long particle oat straw (85% of particles>8mm; LS) and (2) provision of short particle oat straw (45% of particles >8mm; SS). Both treatments were offered following consumption of a limit-fed, nutrient-dense total mixed ration fed at 2.05% of body weight. Following each 7-d period, heifers were given access to both types of straw during an additional 2-d preference period; individual intakes were recorded daily. Feeding and lying behavior were recorded during the last 3d of each treatment period. Ruminal temperature was recorded during the last 3d of each treatment period using a telemetric acquisition system and rumen boluses. Dry matter intake of both the total mixed ration (6.3kg/d) and straw (0.36kg/d) was similar between treatments. Heifers fed LS spent more time feeding (197.7 vs. 175.2min/d) throughout the day than heifers fed SS due to the increase in time required to consume long particles in the LS (59.8 vs. 34.2min/d). Daily lying time (974.7min/d) and time spent standing without eating (278.9min/d) was similar between treatments. The preference period showed a strong preference ratio for LS rather than SS (preference ratio=0.83), with heifers consuming 0.43±0.2kg/d of LS and 0.07±0.1kg/d of SS (mean ± SD). Heifers maintained similar mean (38.3°C), minimum (35.1°C), and maximum (38.9°C) rumen temperature across treatments. The amount of time that rumen temperature was elevated over 38.6°C, 39.0°C, and 39.4°C was similar between treatments. In conclusion, heifers will consume similar amounts of supplementary long or short straw if provided to them alongside of a limit-fed TMR.

However, realizing a green supply chain depends on partners’ collaboration intentions. The purposes of this study are to explore the influence of oligopolies created through government intervention and how they can promote supply chain partners’ collaboration intentions in the context of green supply chains. Spearman’s correlation analysis, partial least squares, and the Sobel test are the main approaches adopted to evaluate the theoretical framework and hypotheses of this study. Our findings indicate that, in addition to a few leaders of the supply chain obtaining market order distribution authority, oligopolies created through government intervention guide consumers to more fully scrutinize these supply chain leaders and their partners. When their partners exhibit a lower collaboration intention in green supply chain improvement and increase the pollution emission risk, it is easy to induce and increase social pressure from consumers and thus pressure these leaders to reduce or even cancel the order distribution of these partners. To avoid order profit loss, these partners will continue to actively maintain their collaboration intentions in the green supply chain. In addition, environmental risk audits by supply chain leaders’ interventions are a common approach to improve green supply chains. However, partners are usually unwilling to cooperate with leaders’ audit interventions and show lower collaboration intentions. However, social pressure can threaten partners’ order profits and thus drive partners to show positive collaboration intentions and further accept leaders’ reasonable interventions in environmental risk audits and will have a positive effect on green supply chain improvement. Based on the above, to expedite the improvement of the green supply chain, oligopolies created through government intervention are not only an important external force but also an important national strategy in green environmental improvement.  aPublisher supplied data  a71872131cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3amarkets 3aoligopoly 3apollution 3aresearch 3arisk 3asupply chain1 aShi, Zhangyu,0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 5 p.6433-6448dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16064-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245012700168300001600295500001900311520063600330592002800966650001600994650001301010650001101023650001601034650001301050650001401063700005601077773011801133856008301251852000901334655001201343IND60726499520221120051623.0210205e20210114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072649952DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c038612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhorai, Sourav10aSelectivity for Alkynyl or Allenyl Imidamides and Imidates in Copper-Catalyzed Reactions of Terminal 1,3-Diynes and Azides  ap. 697-701.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCopper-catalyzed reactions of terminal 1,3-diynes with electron-deficient azides to generate either 3-alkynyl or 2,3-dienyl imidamides and imidates are described. The selectivity depends on the diyne substituents and the nucleophile that reacts with the ketenimide intermediate generated from the corresponding triazole precursor. Reactions of 1,3-diynes containing a propargylic acetate afford [3]cumulenyl imidamides, while reactions using methanol as the trapping agent selectively generate 2,3-dienyl imidates.

However, controversial results concerning OER/ORR performance exist between different types of cobalt-based catalysts, especially for Co(OH)₂ and Co₃O₄. To address this issue, we develop a facile electrochemical deposition method to grow Co(OH)₂ directly on the skeleton of carbon cloth, and further Co₃O₄ was obtained by post thermal treatment. The entire synthesis strategy removes the use of any binders and also avoids the additional preparation process (e.g., transfer and slurry coating) of final electrodes. This leads to a true comparison of the ORR/OER catalytic performance between Co(OH)₂ and Co₃O₄, eliminating uncertainties arising from the electrode preparation procedures. The surface morphologies, microstructures, and electrochemical behaviors of prepared Co(OH)₂ and Co₃O₄ catalysts were systemically investigated by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and electrochemical characterization methods. The results revealed that the electrochemically deposited Co(OH)₂ was in the form of vertically aligned nanosheets with average thickness of about 4.5 nm. After the thermal treatment in an air atmosphere, Co(OH)₂ nanosheets were converted into mesoporous Co₃O₄ nanosheets with remarkably increased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA). Although the ORR/OER activity normalized by the geometric surface area of mesoporous Co₃O₄ nanosheets is higher than that of Co(OH)₂ nanosheets, the performance normalized by the ECSA of the former is lower than that of the latter. Considering the superior apparent overall activity and durability, the Co₃O₄ catalyst has been further evaluated by integrating it into a Zn–air battery prototype. The Co₃O₄ nanosheets in situ supported on carbon cloth cathode enable the assembled Zn–air cells with large peak power density of 106.6 mW cm–², low charge and discharge overpotentials (0.67 V), high discharge rate capability (1.18 V at 20 mA cm–²), and long cycling stability (400 cycles), which are comparable or even superior to the mixture of state-of-the-art Pt/C and RuO₂ cathode.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aatomic force microscopy 3abatteries 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3acoatings 3acobalt 3acobalt oxide 3adurability 3aelectrochemistry 3ageometry 3aheat treatment 3amicrostructure 3ananosheets 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3aporous media 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aslurries 3asurface area 3atransmission electron microscopy 3auncertainty 0aZn−air battery 0aelectrochemical deposition 0aORR/OER 0aCo(OH)2 0aCo3O4 0abifunctional catalysts1 aHan, Xiaopeng1 aDeng, Yida1 aZhao, Naiqin1 aHu, Wenbin1 aZhong, Cheng0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 July 12, v. 9, no. 27 p.22694-22703dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b053953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03939naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245017600172500001900348520222800367592002802595650002202623650002002645650002202665650002402687650001502711650001302726650001902739650002102758650001302779650002502792650001002817650001402827650002702841650001302868650000902881650002102890650001902911650001602930650001402946651001102960700002402971700002202995700002103017700002703038700002903065700002703094700002903121700002403150773012203174856008003296852000903376655001203385IND60735033820221119025332.0210423e20210326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073503382DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy110406382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedeiros, Marcelo  B.10aStatus of the Ex Situ and In Situ Conservation of Brazilian Crop Wild Relatives of Rice, Potato, Sweet Potato, and Finger Millet: Filling the Gaps of Germplasm Collections  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study presents the status of ex situ and in situ conservation for the crop wild relatives of rice, potato, sweet potato, and finger millet in Brazil, and the subsequent germplasm collection expeditions. This research is part of a global initiative entitled “Adapting Agriculture to Climate Change: Collecting, Protecting, and Preparing Crop Wild Relatives” supported by the Global Crop Diversity Trust. Species of the primary, secondary, and tertiary gene pools with occurrences reported in Brazil were included: Oryza alta Swallen, O. grandiglumis (Döll) Prod., O. latifolia Desv., O. glumaepatula Steud., Eleusine tristachya (Lam.) Lam., E. indica (L.) Gaertn., Solanum commersonii Dunal, S. chacoense Bitter, Ipomoea grandifolia (Dammer) O’Donell, I. ramosissima (Poir.) Choisy, I. tiliacea (Willd.) Choisy, I. triloba L., and I. cynanchifolia Meisn. The status of the ex situ and in situ conservation of each taxon was assessed using the gap analysis methodology, and the results were used to plan 16 germplasm collection expeditions. Seeds of the collected material were evaluated for viability, and the protocols for seed germination and cryopreservation were tested. The final conservation score, resulting from the gap analysis and including the average of the ex situ and in situ scores, resulted in a classification of medium priority of conservation for all the species, with the exception of I. grandifolia (high priority). The total accessions collected (174) almost doubled the total accessions of these crop wild relatives incorporated in Embrapa’s ex situ conservation system prior to 2015. In addition, accessions for practically absent species were collected for the ex situ conservation system, such as Ipomoea species, Eleusine indica, and Solanum chacoense. The methods used for dormancy breaking and low temperature conservation for the Oryza, Eleusine, and Ipomoea species were promising for the incorporation of accessions in the respective gene banks. The results show the importance of efforts to collect and conserve ex situ crop wild relatives in Brazil based on previous gap analysis. The complementarity with the in situ strategy also appears to be very promising in the country.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEleusine coracana 3aEleusine indica 3aSolanum chacoense 3aSolanum commersonii 3aTristachya 3aagronomy 3aclimate change 3acryopreservation 3adormancy 3aex situ conservation 3agenes 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3apotatoes 3arice 3aseed germination 3asweet potatoes 3atemperature 3aviability 3aBrazil1 aValls, José  F.

This technique is used to study the activity of bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolytic enzymes named autolysins. Zymography is particularly suited for PG autolysin characterization as bulk PG is notorious to work with due to its highly insoluble nature. This recalcitrant property of PG therefore makes the set-up of PG hydrolytic activity assay very challenging. In the course of studying the catalytic activity of the CwlS protein, a D,L NlpC/P60 endopeptidase possessing multiple LysM carbohydrate-binding domains from Bacillus subtilis, we observed a potential artifact of the zymography technique. The generation of CwlS truncated mutants impaired in their PG binding capacity presented lower apparent hydrolytic activities on zymograms. Furthermore, a catalytically dead version of CwlS, or a CwlS mutant that possesses only its LysM domains and no catalytic domain, maintained similar apparent PG hydrolytic properties as wild-type CwlS on zymograms. Additionally, a mutant harboring twelve mutations in the four LysM domains, previously demonstrated to be unable to bind PG but has a similar net positive charge as the wild-type protein also presented apparent activity on zymogram. We demonstrate in this study that zymography results, which are meant to be interpreted in favor of apparent PG hydrolytic activities, are instead reflecting impairment of gel staining probably due to the very high net positive charge of the protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aactive sites 3acarbohydrate binding 3acatalytic activity 3agametolysin 3agels 3amutants 3apeptidoglycans 0aLysM 0aZymography 0aPeptidoglycan 0aNlpC/P60 endopeptidase1 aBlaise, Mickaël1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7860-34640 tBiochimie.g2020 Oct., v. 177 p.25-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2020.07.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014300169300001500312520129100327592002801618650002301646650002101669650003201690650001601722650001301738650001401751650001301765653001501778653001901793653002601812653004101838653001201879653002001891700002401911773009501935856008402030852000902114655001202123IND60612255520221122054006.0180905e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061225552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2017.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClinton, David10aClassifying empirically valid and clinically meaningful change in eating disorders using the Eating Disorders Inventory, version 2 (EDI-2)  ap. 99-103.  aThe study examined the ability of the EDI-2 to classify empirically valid and clinically meaningful change using clinical significance and the Reliable Change Index (CS/RCI), and compared CS/RCI to classification based on diagnostic change. Eating disorder (ED) patients (N=363) were assessed at intake and after 36months on measures of ED and psychiatric symptoms, self-image, interpersonal relationships, treatment satisfaction and general outcome. Patients were categorized using a four-way classification scheme as “Deteriorated”, “Unchanged”, “Improved” or “No ED”; and using a two-way classification scheme as either in remission or not in remission. Compared to similar two- and four-way classification based on diagnostic change, CS/RCI using the EDI-2 total score demonstrated greatest overall utility in explaining outcome variance. The EDI-2 can generate empirically valid and clinically meaningful classification of change. Systematic application of CS/RCI using the EDI-2 benefits both clinicians and researchers by providing a simple, clinically relevant, scientifically robust, and cost-effective means of classifying outcome. It may be especially relevant in alerting clinicians to problem cases in need of additional or alternative treatment strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3aeating disorders 3ainterpersonal relationships 3ainventories 3apatients 3aremission 3avariance 0aAssessment 0aClassification 0aClinical significance 0aEating Disorders Inventory version 2 0aOutcome 0aReliable change1 aBirgegård, Andreas0 tEating behaviors.g2017 Aug., v. 26 p.99-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2017.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002400141245011700165300001600282500001900298520181800317592002802135650002202163650002302185650001202208650001102220650001202231650002302243650001102266650003202277650001502309651001302324653002402337653002702361653002502388653002302413653001802436700002402454700002102478700002202499700001702521700003402538773014202572856007502714852000902789655001202798IND60732978520221122013845.0210402e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073297852DNAL7 a10.1093/jme/tjaa2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSukkanon, Chutipong10aField Evaluation of a Spatial Repellent Emanation Vest for Personal Protection Against Outdoor Biting Mosquitoes  ap. 756-766.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aExophilic vectors are an important contributor to residual malaria transmission. Wearable spatial repellents (SR) can potentially provide personal protection in early evening hours before people retire indoors. An SR prototype for passive delivery of transfluthrin (TFT) for protecting humans against nocturnal mosquitoes in Kanchanaburi, western Thailand, is evaluated. A plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) sheet (676 cm²) treated with 55-mg TFT (TFT-PET), attached to the back of short-sleeve vest worn by human collector, was evaluated under semifield and outdoor conditions. Field-caught, nonblood-fed female Anopheles minimus s.l. were released in a 40 m length, semifield screened enclosure. Two collectors positioned at opposite ends conducted 12-h human-landing collections (HLC). The outdoor experiment was conducted between treatments among four collectors at four equidistant positions who performed HLC. Both trials were conducted for 30 consecutive nights. TFT-PET provided 67% greater protection (P < 0.001) for 12 h compared with unprotected control, a threefold reduction in the attack. In outdoor trials, TFT-PET provided only 16% protection against An. harrisoni Harbach & Manguin (Diptera: Culicidae) compared with unprotected collector (P = 0.0213). The TFT-PET vest reduced nonanophelines landing by 1.4-fold compared with the PET control with a 29% protective efficacy. These findings suggest that TFT-PET had diminished protective efficacy in an open field environment. Nonetheless, the concept of a wearable TFT emanatory device has the potential for protecting against outdoor biting mosquitoes. Further development of portable SR tools is required, active ingredient selection and dose optimization, and more suitable device design and materials for advancing product feasibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnopheles minimus 3aactive ingredients 3afemales 3ahumans 3amalaria 3amedical entomology 3apeople 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3aprototypes 3aThailand 0aAnopheles harrisoni 0aAnopheles minimus s.l. 0aoutdoor transmission 0aspatial repellency 0atransfluthrin1 aTisgratog, Rungarun1 aMuenworn, Vithee1 aBangs, Michael J.1 aHii, Jeffrey1 aChareonviriyaphap, Theeraphap0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 58, no. 2 p.756-766dEntomological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl45776x0022-25857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjaa2133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011800163300002000281520112800301592002801429650002401457650002001481650001401501650001301515650002401528650001601552650001901568650002201587650001901609653002101628653001801649653001701667653001601684653001801700653001701718700001501735700001301750700001501763700001801778700001701796700001701813700001401830700001401844700001301858773012601871856008001997852000902077655001202086IND60572259720221121111723.0170713e20170712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057225972DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b055922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiaolong10aLoading Cd0.5Zn0.5S Quantum Dots onto Onion-Like Carbon Nanoparticles to Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation  ap. 22560-22567.  aCarbon dots (C dots, size < 10 nm) have been conventionally decorated onto semiconductor matrixes for photocatalytic H₂ evolution, but the efficiency is largely limited by the low loading ratio of the C dots on the photocatalyst. Here, we propose an inverse structure of Cd₀.₅Zn₀.₅S quantum dots (QDs) loaded onto the onionlike carbon (OLC) matrix for noble metal-free photocatalytic H₂ evolution. Cd₀.₅Zn₀.₅S QDs (6.9 nm) were uniformly distributed on an OLC (30 nm) matrix with both upconverted and downconverted photoluminescence property. Such an inverse structure allows the full optimization of the QD/OLC interfaces for effective energy transfer and charge separation, both of which contribute to efficient H₂ generation. An optimized H₂ generation rate of 2018 μmol/h/g (under the irradiation of visible light) and 58.6 μmol/h/g (under the irradiation of 550–900 nm light) was achieved in the Cd₀.₅Zn₀.₅S/OLC composite samples. The present work shows that using the OLC matrix in such a reverse construction is a promising strategy for noble metal-free solar hydrogen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon quantum dots 3aenergy transfer 3afullerene 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotoluminescence 3asemiconductors 0aonionlike carbon 0aphotocatalyst 0aH2 evolution 0aCd0.5Zn0.5S 0ananoparticles 0aquantum dots1 aWang, Xina1 aFeng, Xi1 aZhang, Kun1 aPeng, Xiaoniu1 aWang, Hanbin1 aLiu, Chunlei1 aHan, Yibo1 aWang, Hao1 aLi, Quan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 July 12, v. 9, no. 27 p.22560-22567dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b055923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04265naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003100113040001800144100001400162245008800176300001800264520240900282592002802691650001302719650001802732650001902750650001902769650001002788650000902798650001602807650001402823650002002837650002102857650000902878650001002887650001202897650003102909650001302940650002102953650001102974650003702985650000903022650001403031650003403045650002303079651001203102651001103114651001203125651001103137653002503148653002303173653001503196653002803211700001503239700001603254700001603270700002003286700001703306700001603323700001203339773015303351856007803504852000903582655001203591IND60083481220221120171053.0190215e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008348122DNAL7 a235482982pmid7 a10.3168/jds.2012-61482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoker, S.10aDevelopment of a genetic evaluation for body condition score for Canadian Holsteins  ap. 3994-4004.  aValacta (Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Québec, Canada) is the Canadian Dairy Herd Improvement organization responsible for milk recording in Québec and Atlantic provinces. Up to 14 first-lactation body condition score (BCS) records were collected per cow (average of 2.5 records per cow), allowing the trait to be described by a random regression animal model so that animals could be ranked by the shape of their BCS curve. However, Valacta’s BCS are available from Québec herds only and the long-term objective of this research is to develop a nationwide genetic evaluation of sires and cows for BCS. Alternatively, Holstein Canada (Brantford, Ontario, Canada) collects type trait records nationwide, primarily for first-lactation cows. Holstein Canada typically collects a single record per trait, so that selection for Holstein Canada BCS would be based on overall BCS level rather than the shape of the BCS curve. Several different methods of genetically evaluating Valacta’s BCS were investigated, including consideration of average BCS level across lactation, the amount of fluctuation in the BCS curve during lactation, and combinations of BCS level and BCS fluctuation. Sires with ≥25 daughters were compared (as opposed to comparing cows) because their BCS estimated breeding values (EBV) are based on more information, and so should be more reliable. Of the different methods of calculating Valacta BCS EBV, ranking bulls based on overall BCS level gave the best results in that their daughter phenotypic BCS curves showed limited loss in early lactation BCS and replenished condition by the end of lactation. Whereas Valacta’s BCS were analyzed using a random regression animal model, Holstein Canada only needs to collect 1 BCS record per cow at classification and the resulting BCS EBV was strongly correlated with Valacta’s BCS EBV. Furthermore, because Holstein Canada’s BCS are collected nationally and Valacta’s BCS are not, a national genetic evaluation for Holstein Canada’s BCS is more convenient. The results of this study do not eliminate the possibility of a genetic evaluation of BCS as a longitudinal trait, but indicate that other methods of calculating Valacta BCS EBV should be explored. Until that time, genetically evaluating Holstein Canada’s BCS is simple, easily implemented, and may be effective in altering the level and shape of the genetic BCS curve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanimal models 3abody condition 3abreeding value 3abulls 3acows 3adairy herds 3adaughters 3aearly lactation 3aherd improvement 3amilk 3asires 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxgenetics 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aFemale 2aLactationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMale 2aPhenotype 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSelection, Genetic 3aOntario 0aCanada 0aOntario 0aQuebec 0abody condition score 0agenetic evaluation 0atype trait 0arandom regression model1 aBastin, C.1 aMiglior, F.1 aSewalem, A.1 aSchaeffer, L.R.1 aJamrozik, J.1 aOsborne, V.1 aAli, A.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2013 June, v. 96, no. 6 p.3994-4004dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2012-61483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245011800184300002000302520091800322592002801240650001601268650002201284650001501306650001701321650001001338650001501348650001101363650002001374650000701394650001701401650003701418650001501455650002501470650003601495650003101531650001301562650003701575650003701612650004501649650001901694650005301713650003201766650002201798700001501820700001801835700001601853700001701869773012001886856004802006852000902054655001202063IND50070317920221119073421.0131101e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007031792DNAL7 a239258622pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-013-3338-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMekhloufi, M.10aRemoval of 8-quinolinecarboxylic acid pesticide from aqueous solution by adsorption on activated montmorillonites  ap. 10365-10375.  aSodium montmorillonite (Na-M), acidic montmorillonite (H-M), and organo-acidic montmorillonite (Org-H-M) were applied to remove the herbicide 8-quinolinecarboxylic acid (8-QCA). The montmorillonites containing adsorbed 8-QCA were investigated by transmission electron microscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction analysis, X-ray fluorescence thermogravimetric analysis, and physical adsorption of gases. Experiments showed that the amount of adsorbed 8-QCA increased at lower pH, reaching a maximum at pH 2. The adsorption kinetics was found to follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Langmuir model provided the best correlation of experimental data for adsorption equilibria. The adsorption of 8-QCA decreased in the order Org-H-M > H-M > Na-M. Isotherms were also used to obtain the thermodynamic parameters. The negative values of ΔG indicated the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3afluorescence 3agases 3aherbicides 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3apH 3aspectroscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy 2aAdsorption 2aBentonitexchemistry 2aChemical Fractionationxmethods 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aPesticidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aQuinolinesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aThermodynamics 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aWater Purificationxmethods 2aX-Ray Diffraction1 aZehhaf, A.1 aBenyoucef, A.1 aQuijada, C.1 aMorallon, E.0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2013 Dec., v. 185, no. 12 p.10365-10375dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-013-3338-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245013500165520131600300592002801616650001801644650001501662650001501677650001801692651001101710700001701721700001701738700001801755700001601773700001801789700001901807700001901826700001901845700001701864700001601881700001701897700001501914700001801929773009401947856008402041852000902125655001202134IND60706789020221122041236.0201202e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070678902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1116932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKenna, R.10aOn the socio-technical potential for onshore wind in Europe: A response to Enevoldsen et al. (2019), Energy Policy, 132, 1092-1100  aA recent article in this journal claimed to assess the socio-technical potential for onshore wind energy in Europe. We find the article to be severely flawed and raise concerns in five general areas. Firstly, the term socio-technical is not precisely defined, and is used by the authors to refer to a potential that others term as merely technical. Secondly, the study fails to account for over a decade of research in wind energy resource assessments. Thirdly, there are multiple issues with the use of input data and, because the study is opaque about many details, the effect of these errors cannot be reproduced. Fourthly, the method assumes a very high wind turbine capacity density of 10.73 MW/km² across 40% of the land area in Europe with a generic 30% capacity factor. Fifthly, the authors find an implausibly high onshore wind potential, with 120% more capacity and 70% more generation than the highest results given elsewhere in the literature. Overall, we conclude that new research at higher spatial resolutions can make a valuable contribution to wind resource potential assessments. However, due to the missing literature review, the lack of transparency and the overly simplistic methodology, Enevoldsen et al. (2019) potentially mislead fellow scientists, policy makers and the general public.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy policy 3awind power 3awind speed 3awind turbines 3aEurope1 aRyberg, D.S.1 aStaffell, I.1 aHahmann, A.N.1 aSchmidt, J.1 aHeinrichs, H.1 aHöltinger, S.1 aLilliestam, J.1 aPfenninger, S.1 aRobinius, M.1 aStolten, D.1 aTröndle, T.1 aWehrle, S.1 aWeinand, J.M.0 tEnergy policy.g2020 Oct., v. 145 p.111693-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2020.1116933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245020100164300001800365520148900383592002801872596005901900596005901959596005902018650002102077650002302098650001902121650001802140650001602158650000902174650002902183650001402212650001802226650001302244651001002257700001702267700001902284700001802303700002102321700001802342700001602360700001302376700005502389773015202444856008302596852000902679655001202688IND60763222720221118183410.0220220e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076322272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-021-16176-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhao,10aTracing historical changes, degradation, and original sources of airborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Jilin Province, China, by Abies holophylla and Pinus tabuliformis needle leaves  ap. 7079-7088.  aDue to their wide distribution and availability, plant leaves can be considered interesting candidates as biomonitoring substrates for the evaluation of atmospheric pollution. In addition, some species can also retain historical information, for example, related to environmental pollution, due to their leaf class age. In this study, the content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Abies holophylla and Pinus tabuliformis needle samples in the function of their class age has been investigated to obtain information regarding the degradation constant for each PAH under investigation (α values ranging from 0.173 to 1.870) and to evaluate the possibility to correlate the presence of PAHs in needles with some important pollution environmental factors. Considering air pollutant variables registered in Jilin Province, interesting correlations (at 95% confidence level) have been found between coal consumption per year and anthracene contents in needles, while fluorene, phenanthrene, and anthracene results correlated with coal consumption. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the total PAH concentration in needles, for both species, increased with their age (from 804 to 3604 ng g–¹ dry weight), showing a general tendency to accumulate these substances through years. PAH degradation rates increased instead with molecular complexity. This study could be considered a first trial to obtain historical environmental information by pine needles biomonitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  a21775134cnational natural science foundation of china  a22066025cnational natural science foundation of china  aD18012chigher education discipline innovation project 3aAbies holophylla 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aanthracenes 3acoal 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afluorenes 3aphenanthrenes 3aresearch 3aChina1 aJin, Xiangzi1 aKaw, Han Yeong1 aFatima, Zakia1 aQuinto, Maurizio1 aZhou, John L.1 aJin, Dongri1 aHe, Miao1 aLi, Donghao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7033-66720 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2022 Jan., v. 29, no. 5 p.7079-7088dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16176-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245014000211300001200351506007600363520161400439592002802053506003702081650002602118650001202144650002002156650001402176650001302190650001102203650001502214650001202229650001302241650002002254650001602274650001102290650001702301650001602318653002602334653001202360653002002372653003302392700002002425700002502445700002102470700002302491700002702514700001902541700002302560773009202583856008402675852000902759655001202768IND60612256020221207081502.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061225602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eatbeh.2017.08.0012doi7 aPMC57008422pmcid7 a288431362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMason, Tyler B.10aCorrelates of weight-related quality of life among individuals with binge eating disorder before and after cognitive behavioral therapy  ap. 1-6.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIndividuals with obesity and binge eating disorder (BED) report poorer weight-related quality of life (WRQOL) compared to individuals with obesity alone. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), the best available treatment for BED, does not consistently produce weight loss or improvements in weight QOL. The purpose of the current study was to examine baseline and longitudinal associations between eating-related and psychosocial variables and dimensions of weight QOL. We examined associations between predictor variables, including body mass index (BMI), eating disorder (ED) psychopathology, and psychosocial factors, in relation to three dimensions of WRQOL among 171 patients whom received CBT for BED. Participants completed interviews and self-report measures at baseline prior to CBT and at end of treatment. At baseline the following associations were significant: BMI, ED psychopathology, and self-esteem were associated with weight-related self-esteem; gender, BMI, and self-esteem were associated with weight-related public distress (i.e., stigma and worry in public because of one's weight); and age, BMI, and ED psychopathology were associated with weight-related physical function. At end of treatment, the following associations were significant: changes in ED psychopathology and coping predicted weight-related self-esteem; changes in coping and self-esteem predicted weight-related public distress; and changes in BMI and subjective binge eating predicted weight-related physical function. Overall, changes in a number of ED and associated symptoms were associated with improvements in WRQOL.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinge eating disorder 3abinging 3abody mass index 3acognition 3adistress 3agender 3ainterviews 3aobesity 3apatients 3aquality of life 3aself-esteem 3astigma 3atherapeutics 3aweight loss 0aBinge eating disorder 0aObesity 0aQuality of life 0aCognitive behavioral therapy1 aCrosby, Ross D.1 aKolotkin, Ronette L.1 aGrilo, Carlos M.1 aMitchell, James E.1 aWonderlich, Stephen A.1 aCrow, Scott J.1 aPeterson, Carol B.0 tEating behaviors.g2017 Dec., v. 27 p.1-6dElsevier LtdwJournal:12066x1471-01537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2017.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245011600172300001600288520128700304592002801591650002101619650001201640650002001652650002501672650002101697650001601718650001101734650001901745650001701764650001701781650002801798650002501826650002501851653000701876653000701883653000801890653001201898653001301910653001201923653001601935653000801951653000701959653000801966653000801974653000801982653001201990653001802002653001702020653002802037653002502065653001702090653000902107700002602116773015602142856008302298852000902381655001202390IND60525639020221119170237.0190318e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052563902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2015.05.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoukes, Gerhardt J.10aIn vitro modulation of the innate immune response and phagocytosis by three Hypoxis spp. and their phytosterols  ap. 120-126.  aHypoxis forms an important part of South African traditional medicine. Crude Hypoxis extracts and hypoxoside have extensively been investigated for its biological activities. This study investigated the in vitro biological activities of Hypoxis extracts and its phytosterols on the innate immune system. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) production in undifferentiated and/or differentiated human promonocytic U937 leukemia cells were investigated using the fluorescent dyes, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and 5,6-diaminofluorescein diacetate, respectively. The phagocytic ability of U937 cells was investigated using pHrodo™ E. coli Bioparticle® Conjugate. Superoxide dismutase activation in Chang liver cells were measured following (phyto)sterol treatment. Hypoxis stellipilis extract has shown the highest ROS and NO production. Hypoxis extracts and β-sitosterol significantly increased phagocytic activity of pretreated differentiated U937 cells. For superoxide dismutase activation, only the (phyto)sterols had an effect. Phytosterols, in combination with other compounds found in Hypoxis extracts, might be responsible for increased ROS and NO production and phagocytosis seen in U937 cells, ultimately influencing the innate immune system response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aHypoxis 3abeta-sitosterol 3abioactive properties 3afluorescent dyes 3ahepatocytes 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3anitric oxide 3aphagocytosis 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atraditional medicine 0aAA 0aCD 0aCOX 0acPLA A2 0aDAF-2 DA 0aDCFH-DA 0a1,25(OH)2D3 0aMFI 0aNO 0aPMA 0aROS 0aSOD 0aHypoxis 0aβ-Sitosterol 0aNitric oxide 0aReactive oxygen species 0aSuperoxide dismutase 0aPhagocytosis 0aU9371 aVan de Venter, Maryna0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2016 Jan., v. 102 p.120-126dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2015.05.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245009600158300001800254520102800272592002801300650001901328650000801347650000901355650001201364650001601376650001701392650001701409650002501426650001901451650001801470651002101488700001401509700002001523700002001543700001801563700001801581700001701599773017901616856007801795852000901873655001201882IND60118228520221119132211.0141126e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011822852DNAL7 a10.1099/ijs.0.064907-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Long10aFlaviflexus salsibiostraticola sp. nov., an actinobacterium isolated from a biofilm reactor  ap. 3293-3296.  aA Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming, cocci-shaped actinobacterium, designated strain EBR4-1-2T, was isolated from a biofilm reactor in Korea. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence studies showed the isolate was clearly affiliated with the class Actinobacteria, and was related most closely to Flaviflexus huanghaiensis H5T, showing 98.9 % similarity. Cells of strain EBR4-1-2T formed yellow colonies on R2A agar, contained MK-9(H4) as the predominant menaquinone, and included C18 : 1ω9c, C16 : 0, C16 : 1ω9c and C14 : 0 as the major fatty acids. The cell-wall peptidoglycan type was A5α (l-Lys–l-Ala–l-Lys–d-Glu). The G+C content of the genomic DNA of strain EBR4-1-2T was 65.6 mol%. Thus, the combined genotypic and phenotypic data supported the conclusion that strain EBR4-1-2T represents a novel species of the genus Flaviflexus, for which the name Flaviflexus salsibiostraticola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EBR4-1-2T ( = KCTC 33148T = JCM 19016T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinobacteria 3aDNA 3aagar 3abiofilm 3afatty acids 3amenaquinones 3amicrobiology 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptidoglycans 3aribosomal RNA 3aKorean Peninsula1 aKo, So-Ra1 aLee, Hyung-Gwan1 aKim, Byung-Hyuk1 aKim, Hee Sik,1 aAhn, Chi-Yong1 aOh, Hee-Mock0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2014 Sept., v. 64, no.

Erosion exceeding the level of detection was observed at 55% of cliffs. State-averaged cliff face and top retreat rates were both 0.06 m yr⁻¹, and varied alongshore, with more erosion in northern California compared to southern and central California. Retreat rates were higher for unarmored cliffs and cliffs fronted by sandy beaches. Mean cliff top retreat rates were lower than in previous studies conducted between the 1920s–1930s and 1998/2002, and between 1998 and 2009–2011. However, the average cliff face retreat rates and statistical distributions were similar (r² = 0.99) for the 1998 to 2009–2011 and 2009–2011 to 2016 time periods. No significant correlation was found between cliff erosion rates and environmental factors such as rock hardness, rainfall, groundwater, waves, and relative sea level change. However, the highest cliff face retreat rates (>1 m yr⁻¹) occurred at locations with weak rocks.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acliffs 3adata collection 3agroundwater 3alidar 3arain 3asea level 3aCalifornia 0aCoastal cliffs 0aCliff erosion 0aLiDAR 0aCalifornia coast1 aYoung, Adam P.0 tGeomorphology.g2022 Sept. 01, v. 412 p.108318-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2022.1083183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012200158300002000280520153500300592002801835650001101863650001101874650001301885650002201898650001301920650001201933650002201945650001401967650001201981650001901993650001802012650001502030650000802045700001602053700001302069700001302082700001802095700001802113700001702131700001502148700001302163773014402176856007402320852000902394655001202403IND60641787820221121071841.0190506e20160628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064178782DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ta02442d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hanyin12aA spherical Sn–Fe₃O₄@graphite composite as a long-life and high-rate-capability anode for lithium ion batteries  ap. 10321-10328.  aIn order to further enhance the reversible capacity and cyclability for lithium storage of Sn-based alloy anode materials, a spherical-shaped Sn–Fe₃O₄@C ternary-phase composite consisting of nanosized tin (Sn), magnetite (Fe₃O₄), and graphite (C) was prepared via a two-step process using high-efficiency discharge plasma-assisted milling (P-milling). Ultrafine Sn nanoparticles were embedded and tightly contacted with nanosized Fe₃O₄, with graphite nanosheets coating the outside to form a multiscale spherical structure. The Sn–Fe₃O₄@C nanocomposite anodes demonstrate a stable and high capacity of 793 mA h g⁻¹ after 240 cycles between 0.01 and 3.0 V vs. Li/Li⁺ at 200 mA g⁻¹. Furthermore, a reversible capacity of ∼750 mA h g⁻¹ was obtained after 500 cycles, even when the current density increased to 2000 mA g⁻¹. The high capacity, good cycle performance, and superior high-rate capability characteristics were attributed to the unique nanostructure of the Sn–Fe₃O₄@C composites. The good dispersion of co-existing Sn and Fe₃O₄ nanoballs in a spherical carbon matrix resulted in an electrode with high structural stability and fast kinetics for Li ion and electron transfer, which contributed to high reversibility of alloying reactions in Sn and conversion reactions of Fe₃O₄. Furthermore, the spherical shape of the materials and simple preparation as compared to those of commercial anodes make the Sn–Fe₃O₄@C composites good candidates for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aanodes 3acoatings 3aelectron transfer 3agraphene 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amagnetite 3amilling 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3ananosheets 3atin1 aHu, Renzong1 aLiu, Hui1 aSun, Wei1 aLu, Zhongchen1 aLiu, Jiangwen1 aYang, Lichun1 aZhang, Yao1 aZhu, Min0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 June 28, v. 4, no. 26 p.10321-10328dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta02442d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012100167500002200288520101700310592002801327650001301355650001801368650001801386650002301404650001101427650001301438650001401451650001701465650002101482650001501503650002301518650001301541650000901554650001901563650002101582650000901603650001201612653000901624653001801633653001901651653002201670653002401692700001601716700001401732700001701746700001901763700001601782700001901798700002101817773008401838856008701922852000902009655001202018IND60630983620221118224337.0190402e20190202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063098362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, Aiqian10aCoagulation Behaviour of Milk under Gastric Digestion: Effect of Pasteurisation and Ultra-high temperature treatment  aPre-press version  aThe digestion behaviours of pasteurized and UHT homogenized milks were investigated in in vivo rat stomach and in an in vitro dynamic human gastric simulator. The formation of coagulum under gastric conditions and the protein digestion profiles were similar in both systems. UHT milk formed curds with fragmented and crumbled structures, compared with the more cohesive curds formed from unheated or pasteurized milk. UHT milk had faster rates of protein hydrolysis and of the release of fat globules during digestion. These results are attributed to the differences in the structures of the curds formed from the samples with different treatments. The fragmented and crumbled structure of the curds obtained from UHT milk was probably the result of β-lactoglobulin binding with casein micelles during processing, which sterically hindered aggregation of the casein micelles under gastric conditions. This study provides knowledge for understanding the gastric emptying and digestion of processed consumer milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUHT milk 3aUHT treatment 3aanimal models 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acasein 3acoagulum 3adigestion 3afat globules 3agastric emptying 3ahydrolysis 3ain vitro digestion 3amicelles 3amilk 3apasteurization 3apasteurized milk 3arats 3astomach 0aMilk 0aUHT treatment 0aPasteurization 0aGastric digestion 0aProtein coagulation1 aLiu, Weilin1 aCui, Jian1 aKong, Xiunan1 aRoy, Debashree1 aKong, Youyu1 aHan, Jianzhong1 aSingh, Harjinder0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Feb. 02, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245007900170300001300249506002800262520146300290592002801753506003701781650001401818650001501832650001401847650004401861650002301905650001401928650001701942650001501959650001301974650001501987650001302002650002402015651001102039653001602050653001302066653002602079653002002105700002502125700003102150700002502181700002402206773012302230856007802353852000902431655001202440IND60739945420221207111854.0200602s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073994542DNAL7 a10.2298/ZMSPN2038009V2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVidojević, Dragana D.10aCorrelations between soil organic carbon, land use and soil type in Serbia  ap. 9-18.  aResource is Open Access  aCorrelation between soil organic carbon (SOC) and land use and soil type were investigated in the soils of the Republic of Serbia. The database included a total of 1,140 soil profiles. To establish the correlation between organic carbon content and soil type, a soil map of Serbia was adapted to the WRB classification and divided into 15,437 polygons (map units). The SOC stock values were calculated for each reference soil group based on mean values of SOC at 0-30 and 0-100 cm and their areas. The largest SOC stocks for the soil layers 0-30 cm were found in Cambisol 194.76 x 1012 g and Leptosol 186.43 x 1012 g and for the soil layers 0-100 cm in Cambisol 274.87 x 1012 g and Chernozem 230.43 x 1012 g. Using the Corine Land Cover (CLC) database, the major categories of land use were defined. Based on the obtained mean values of organic carbon content for the soil layers 0-30 and 0-100 cm and the areas indicated by Corine Land Cover categories of land use, the organic carbon stocks in agricultural soil, forest soil, semi-natural areas, and artificial areas were calculated. The correlation of organic carbon stocks and the different land use categories, soil reference group, and soil depth was studied for reference groups that occupy the major part of central Serbia, such as Cambisol (taking up 37.76% of the territory) and Leptosol (22.22% of the territory), and have a sufficient number of sites that were required for this type of analysis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCambisols 3aChernozems 3aLeptosols 3aWorld Reference Base for Soil Resources 3aagricultural soils 3adatabases 3aforest soils 3aland cover 3aland use 3asoil depth 3asoil map 3asoil organic carbon 3aSerbia 0acorrelation 0aland use 0aorganic carbon stocks 0areference group1 aManojlović, Maja S.1 aĐorđević, Aleksandar R.1 aNešić, Ljiljana M.1 aPredić, Tihomir M.0 tZbornik Matice srpske za prirodne nauke.g2020, v. 2020, no. 138 p.9-18dMatica srpskawJournal:27734x0352-49067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ZMSPN2038009V3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04053naa a2200997 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100001900167245010000186300001400286520144800300592002801748650003801776650001901814650001001833650002201843650001501865650001501880650001901895650000801914650001701922650001301939650003001952650002801982650001902010650001602029650001002045650000902055650004102064650002502105650001902130650003802149650001502187650001102202650003202213650000902245650001602254650005802270650004202328650003602370651002602406653001602432653000802448653000802456653000602464653000702470653000802477653000902485653000802494653000802502653000802510653000902518653000702527653000902534653000702543653000802550653000802558653000702566653000802573653000802581653000802589653000702597653000602604653000902610653000802619653001402627653002102641653001702662653001602679700002702695700002602722700002402748700001802772700002202790700001802812700002902830700002102859773007202880856008202952852000903034655001203043IND60099051320221117052659.0161021e20130425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009905132DNAL7 a234196082pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBianco, Bianca10aVariants in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene in idiopathic infertile Brazilian men  ap. 13-17.  aIn recent years, considerable concern has been expressed about the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS) on sperm function, because ROS at high levels is potentially detrimental to sperm function and quality. Nitric oxide (NO) is a powerful anti-oxidant present in seminal plasma. The aim of the study was to analyze the distribution of the of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene (T-786C, G894T, e 4a/b) polymorphisms in idiopathic infertile Brazilian men and evaluate the possible role of these polymorphisms in sperm count.A case–control study was performed comprising 208 infertile men [n=74 with non-obstructive azoospermia and n=134 with severe oligozoospermia] and 201 fertile men as controls. Genotyping of eNOS polymorphisms was performed by real time (T-786C and G894T) and conventional PCR (4a/b). The results were analyzed statistically and a p-value<0.05 was considered significant.According to the sperm count, relatively similar eNOS polymorphism genotypes and allele frequencies were found among the groups. Combined genotypes of the eNOS polymorphisms did not identify a haplotype associated with idiopathic infertility, even when the patients were separated in non-obstructive azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia.In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that, in Brazilian population studied, genetic variations, T-786C, G894T, and e 4a/b, of the eNOS gene are not associated with male infertility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendothelial nitric oxide synthase 3agene frequency 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping 3ahaplotypes 3amale fertility 3amen 3anitric oxide 3apatients 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areactive oxygen species 3aseminal plasma 3aspermatozoa 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAzoospermiaxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aCase-Control Studies 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aHaplotypes 2aHumans 2aInfertility, Malexgenetics 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIIxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOligospermiaxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 0aBrazilxepidemiology. 0aABCD region 0aAsp 0aAZF 0aC 0aCI 0aDNA 0aeNOS 0aFSH 0aGlu 0aHWE 0aiNOS 0aLH 0anNOS 0aNO 0aNOA 0aNOS 0aOR 0aPCR 0aROS 0aSNP 0aSO 0aT 0aVNTR 0aWHO 0aeNOS gene 0aMale infertility 0aPolymorphism 0aSperm count1 aGhirelli-Filho, Milton1 aCavalheiro, Camila M.1 aCavalcanti, Viviane1 aPeluso, Carla1 aGava, Marcello M.1 aGlina, Sidney1 aChristofolini, Denise M.1 aBarbosa, Caio P.0 tGene.g2013 Apr. 25, v. 519 p.13-17dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245011800211300001400329506007600343520192800419592002802347506003702375650002502412650002202437650001502459650002602474650003602500650002402536700002002560700001902580700002202599700002302621700003202644700002602676700002002702700001702722700002002739700002502759700002302784773011002807856008802917852000903005655001203014IND4444553320221207100557.0141112e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444455332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.08.0082doi7 aPMC29740082pmcid7 a208699912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Xiuhong10aRemodeling of protein and mRNA expression in Leishmania mexicana induced by deletion of glucose transporter genes  ap. 39-48.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGlucose is a major nutrient in the insect vector stage of Leishmania parasites. Glucose transporter null mutants of Leishmania mexicana exhibit profound phenotypic changes in both insect stage promastigotes and mammalian host stage amastigotes that reside within phagolysosomes of host macrophages. Some of these phenotypic changes could be either mediated or attenuated by changes in gene expression that accompany deletion of the glucose transporter genes. To search for changes in protein expression, the profile of proteins detected on two-dimensional gels was compared for wild type and glucose transporter null mutant promastigotes. A total of 50 spots whose intensities changed significantly and consistently in multiple experiments were detected, suggesting that a cohort of proteins is altered in expression levels in the null mutant parasites. Following identification of proteins by mass spectrometry, 3 such regulated proteins were chosen for more detailed analysis: mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, ribokinase, and hexokinase. Immunoblots employing antisera against these enzymes confirmed that their levels were upregulated, both in glucose transporter null mutants and in wild type parasites starved for glucose. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed that the levels of mRNAs encoding these enzymes were also enhanced. Global expression profiling using microarrays revealed a limited number of additional changes, although the sensitivity of the microarrays to detect modest changes in amplitude was less than that of two-dimensional gels. Hence, there is likely to be a network of proteins whose expression levels are altered by genetic ablation of glucose transporters, and much of this regulation may be reflected by changes in the levels of the cognate mRNAs. Some of these changes in protein expression may reflect an adaptive response of the parasites to limitation of glucose.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aisoelectric focusing 3amass spectrometry 3ahexokinase 3aliquid chromatography 3apost-translational modification 3aLeishmania mexicana1 aFeistel, Torben1 aBuffalo, Cosmo1 aMcCormack, Ashley1 aKruvand, Elizabeth1 aRodriguez-Contreras, Dayana1 aAkopyants, Natalia S.1 aUmasankar, P.K.1 aDavid, Larry1 aJardim, Armando1 aBeverley, Stephen M.1 aLandfear, Scott M.0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2011 Jan., v. 175, no. 1 p.39-48dElsevier B.V.x0166-68517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2010.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245016700170300001200337520144500349592002801794650002201822650002201844650001501866650001501881650001601896650000901912650002001921650001301941650001201954650001401966650002001980650002102000650001402021650001102035650000702046650001502053650001602068650002302084650002102107650002002128700002002148700002502168700002202193700002702215700002202242773012802264856008102392852000902473655001202482IND60614278020221119172539.0181114e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061427802DNAL7 a10.1007/s13201-018-0825-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShikuku, Victor O.10aSingle and binary adsorption of sulfonamide antibiotics onto iron-modified clay: linear and nonlinear isotherms, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanistic studies  ap. 175.  aIron-modified raw kaolinite clay (Fe-MC) was synthesized by co-precipitation method, characterized, and then applied as a low-cost adsorbent to sequester sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) and sulfadimethoxine (SDM), emergent water contaminants, from aqueous media by batch equilibration at circumneutral pH. The adsorption rate was kinetically described by the pseudo-second-order model. Equilibrium monocomponent sorption data were fitted to three two-parameter linear and nonlinear isotherm models. The data were best described by Temkin and Langmuir nonlinear equations. Linearization of adsorption isotherms is demonstrated to be an unsuitable analytical tool for predicting adsorption isotherms. The Langmuir monolayer maximum adsorption capacities were 4.561 and 1.789 mg/g for SCP and SDM, respectively. The binary adsorption study showed an antagonistic adsorption process of SCP (Rq, SCP= 0.625) in the presence of SDM (Rq, SDM = 1.032). The thermodynamic parameters, namely enthalpy (ΔH), Gibbs free energy (ΔG), entropy (ΔS), Arrhenius activation energy (ΔEₐ), and sticking probability (S*), indicated that the processes are spontaneous, exothermic, and physical in nature.

However, controlling porous morphologies during phase inversions for efficient lithium ionic transportation is a critical issue for more optimized battery performances. Here, we report an LIB separator via phase inversion by selecting non-solvents from the combinatorial approach. Interestingly, the formation of PVdF–HFP skeletons was governed by the controlled phase inversion with various mixtures of water, methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. For a single non-solvent system, a water-based non-solvent (4 wt% water) was the best choice for the phase-inversion-based PVdF–HFP separators for LIBs. However, when a mixture of 2 wt% water and 3 wt% methanol was used as the non-solvent, the best rate capability and long-term stability were obtained, which led to better LIB performances than those of commercialized polyethylene separators.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemistry 3acommercialization 3aethanol 3aisopropyl alcohol 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amethanol 3apolyethylene 3aseparators1 aChoi, Yunah1 aChung, Kyung Yoon1 aPark, Jong Hyeok0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 June 14, v. 4, no. 24 p.9496-9501dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta02472f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006500152245012100217520093500338592002801273650001101301650002301312650002801335650001801363650001601381650001801397650001501415650003301430650001201463651001301475653003101488653002301519653001401542653002601556653001201582700003901594700001801633700002801651700001401679773009601693856008701789852000901876655001201885IND60647544820221122182355.0190628e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064754482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuby, Genevie Eleanor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6475-017510aPredicting intention on safe food handling among adult consumers: A cross sectional study in Sibu district, Malaysia  aThis study employed the extended theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict the intention of adult consumers towards safe food handling at home. A self-administered survey was distributed to a total of 623 respondents who lived in the Sibu district, Malaysia and analyzed the data using the partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. The empirical results revealed that consumers' attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control were statistically significant and positively linked to the intention of safe food handling. Furthermore, the results indicated that the main predictor of consumer safe food handling intention was subjective norm. This study confirmed that food safety knowledge had a positive impact on consumer's attitude. From a practical standpoint, this study provided justification in highlighting the roles of family that encouraged consumers to perform safe food handling at home.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aconsumer attitudes 3across-sectional studies 3afood handling 3afood safety 3aleast squares 3aprediction 3astructural equation modeling 3asurveys 3aMalaysia 0aTheory of planned behavior 0aSafe food handling 0aIntention 0aFood safety knowledge 0aPLS-SEM1 aUngku Zainal Abidin, Ungku Fatimah1 aLihan, Samuel1 aJambari, Nuzul Noorahya1 aRadu, Son0 tFood control.g2019 Dec., v. 106 p.106696-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245008500210300002000295500001900315520126900334592002801603650001601631650001501647650003001662650001301692650001201705650001201717650001701729650001701746650001701763700001701780700002001797700002601817773011601843856008401959852000902043655001202052IND60717209320221122164240.0201110e20201028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071720932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c024252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsaduzzaman, Abu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6385-301410aEffect of Ligand Adsorption on the Electronic Properties of the PbS(100) Surface  ap. 13312-13319.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA first-principles density functional theory calculation was carried out to study the adsorption of acetic acid, methyl amine, methanethiol, and hydrogen iodide on the (100) surface of PbS. All four ligands are common capping agents used in colloidal PbS quantum dot-based photovoltaics. Interestingly, among the considered adsorbates, dissociative adsorption was energetically preferred for hydrogen iodide, while associative adsorption was favorable for the rest. Associative adsorption was driven by strong interactions between the electronegative elements (Y) in the respective ligands and the Pb surface atoms via Pb 6p–Y np bond hybridization (n represents the valence quantum number of the respective electronegative elements). Importantly, the adsorption of ligands altered the work function of PbS, with contrasting trends for associative (decrease in the work function) versus dissociative (increase in the work function) adsorption. The changes in the work function correlates well with a corresponding shift in the 5d level of surface Pb atoms. Other important observations include variations in the work function that linearly change with increasing the surface coverage of adsorbed ligands as well as with the strength of the adsorption of ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadsorption 3adensity functional theory 3ahydrogen 3aiodides 3aligands 3amethanethiol 3aquantum dots 3asolar energy1 aRunge, Keith1 aDeymier, Pierre1 aMuralidharan, Krishna0 tLangmuir.g2020 Oct. 28, v. 36, no. 44 p.13312-13319dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c024253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245015800185300001800343520142800361592002801789650003201817650002701849650003101876650002401907650002801931650002301959650001701982650002401999650001802023650001202041650002302053650002102076650001402097650001902111650001402130650001902144700002002163700002302183700001602206700002102222773011602243856008102359852000902440655001202449IND50089708720221118040958.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008970872DNAL7 a246824802pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-014-5610-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagh, Jitendra10aHeterologous expression of pyrroloquinoline quinone (pqq) gene cluster confers mineral phosphate solubilization ability to Herbaspirillum seropedicae Z67  ap. 5117-5129.  aGluconic acid secretion mediated by the direct oxidation of glucose by pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) is responsible for mineral phosphate solubilization in Gram-negative bacteria. Herbaspirillum seropedicae Z67 (ATCC 35892) genome encodes GDH apoprotein but lacks genes for the biosynthesis of its cofactor PQQ. In this study, pqqE of Erwinia herbicola (in plasmid pJNK1) and pqq gene clusters of Pseudomonas fluorescens B16 (pOK53) and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (pSS2) were over-expressed in H. seropedicae Z67. Transformants Hs (pSS2) and Hs (pOK53) secreted micromolar levels of PQQ and attained high GDH activity leading to secretion of 33.46 mM gluconic acid when grown on 50 mM glucose while Hs (pJNK1) was ineffective. Hs (pJNK1) failed to solubilize rock phosphate, while Hs (pSS2) and Hs (pOK53) liberated 125.47 μM and 168.07 μM P, respectively, in minimal medium containing 50 mM glucose under aerobic conditions. Moreover, under N-free minimal medium, Hs (pSS2) and Hs (pOK53) not only released significant P but also showed enhanced growth, biofilm formation, and exopolysaccharide (EPS) secretion. However, indole acetic acid (IAA) production was suppressed. Thus, the addition of the pqq gene cluster, but not pqqE alone, is sufficient for engineering phosphate solubilization in H. seropedicae Z67 without compromising growth under nitrogen-fixing conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter calcoaceticus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aHerbaspirillum seropedicae 3aPantoea agglomerans 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aaerobic conditions 3abiosynthesis 3agene overexpression 3agluconic acid 3aglucose 3aindole acetic acid 3amultigene family 3aoxidation 3arock phosphate 3asecretion 3asolubilization1 aŚāha, Sonala,1 aBhandari, Praveena1 aArchana, G.1 aKumar, G.

Microbial biotemplates are useful for synthesizing nano/micro structural materials based on a bottom up approach. Being from nature, microbial biotemplates with their extraordinarily molecular machinery have been reported to be considerably superior and cost effective for fabricating complex and heterogeneous structures when compared to the conventional and advanced lithographic techniques. The advantage of speedy growth and multiplication along with controlled shape, structure and size, make microorganisms a viable template for preparing nanomaterials of defined size and shape. In this review, we have consolidated the recent advances in the synthesis of nano/micro structures using biotemplates obtained from various types of microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, algae and virus, and have highlighted its possible applications.

In 2017, we monitored the distributions of pathogenic Vibrio strains in seawater and bivalves collected along the Gyeongnam coast in Korea, a major source of bivalve shellfish, particularly oysters, as well as products of the raw seafood industry. In addition, we determined the features of virulence and antibiotic resistance in V. parahaemolyticus isolates. Among these pathogenic Vibrio strains, V. parahaemolyticus was present at the highest level in both seawater samples (23.1%) and bivalves (39.4%). Importantly, V. parahaemolyticus were detected at high levels (>75%) in oysters during the summer and frequently present during the oyster-harvesting season, ranging from 12.5% to 50.0%. All strains positive for the virulence genes were isolated from oysters, which are commonly consumed raw in many countries, and the oyster growing water. More than 90.0% of V. parahaemolyticus isolates were susceptible to 16 of the 23 antimicrobials tested, which are effective against V. parahaemolyticus illness. More than half of the isolates were resistant to at least three antimicrobials; in particular, three antibiotics (ampicillin, cefazolin, and streptomycin) should be excluded as treatment options for V. parahaemolyticus infections due to the higher resistance of the isolates. The consumption of raw seafood, including oysters, is common in Korea; therefore, to ensure seafood safety, continuous monitoring of Vibrio strains, as well as their virulence and antimicrobial resistance, is necessary in marine food sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBivalvia 3aVibrio cholerae 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aVibrio vulnificus 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3acefazolin 3acoasts 3afish industry 3agenes 3amollusc culture 3amonitoring 3aoysters 3apathogens 3araw seafoods 3aseafood-borne illness 3aseawater 3ashellfish 3astreptomycin 3asummer 3avirulence 3aKorean Peninsula 0aVibrio species 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aOyster 0aVirulence 0aAntimicrobial resistance 0aKorea1 aRyu, Ara1 aKwon, Ji Young1 aKim, Byeori1 aPark, Kunbawui0 tFood control.g2019 Dec., v. 106 p.106697-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.06.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245006200179300001200241520150100253592002801754650001401782650001501796650002001811650002701831650001801858650002501876650001501901650001101916650001901927650001501946650002501961650001601986700002302002700002802025700002702053773013302080856008102213852000902294655001202303IND60479893920221117101531.0160325e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047989392DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-016-5092-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade-la-Ossa-Carretero, J. A.10aMonitoring the effects of wastewater treatment strategies  ap. 110.  aWastewater disposal in coastal waters causes widespread environmental problems. Secondary treatment is expected to reduce the adverse effects of insufficiently treated wastewater. The environmental impact of sewage disposal via 18 wastewater treatment plants was analysed using the benthic opportunistic polychaetes and amphipods (BOPA) index. In previous studies this index proved to be an effective tool for monitoring sewage pollution. The impact of these discharges was highly related to treatment level, which ranged from pre-treatment to biological, as well as to flow rates and outfall position. Locations affected by pre-treated wastewater showed environmental degradation, especially marked near outfalls with higher flow rates. At most locations, biologically treated wastewater did not cause a significant impact and an improvement in ecological integrity was detected after this secondary treatment had been implemented. The impact of discharge was highly related to chemical oxygen demand (COD), suspended solids and nutrient concentrations, which are all lower in biologically treated wastewater. A ‘moderate’ ecological status was observed not only near sewage outfalls with high wastewater flow rates (>1,500,000 m³/month) with a COD over 200 mg/l but also near those with lower flow rates but with a COD over 400 mg/l. To reduce the impact of sewage disposal, it is necessary to carry out adequate treatment, have site outfalls deep enough, and implement water recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aPolychaeta 3aadverse effects 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoastal water 3aenvironmental impact 3amonitoring 3asewage 3awaste disposal 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse1 aDel-Pilar-Ruso, Y.1 aGiménez-Casalduero, F.1 aSánchez-Lizaso, J.

The ECPs of organisms originally isolated from diseased kuruma prawn or small abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta were more lethal (LD₅₀ value of 0.48 or 0.41 μg protein/g prawn) than those from diseased tiger prawn P.monodon, yellowfin porgy Acanthopagrus latus or horse mackerel (LD₅₀ value of 0.98 -1.17 μg protein/g prawn). All the ECPs manifested strong, weak and no activities against gelatin, sheep erythrocytes and chitin, respectively. In immunodiffusion tests using rabbit antiserum to a purified 33 kDa serine protease of strain Swy against ECP of each tested strain produced one single precipitation band in each treatment. Furtherm ore, the serine protease was suggested to be the dominant protease secreted by V. alginolyticus strains tested since the majority of enzymatic activity of the respective ECP was inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). A higher inhibition of serine protease activity by PMSF resulted in lower mortality rate of the ECPs injected into the prawns suggesting that the protease is one of the major lethal factor(s) secreted by Valginolyticus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthopagrus 3aHaliotis diversicolor supertexta 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3aPenaeus 3aVibrio alginolyticus 3aabalone 3aantiserum 3achitin 3aenzyme activity 3aerythrocytes 3afluorides 3agelatin 3aimmunodiffusion tests 3alethal dose 50 3amackerel 3amortality 3aporgy 3arabbits 3aserine proteinases 3asheep 3ashrimp 0aExtracellular Products 0aLethality 0aPenaeus japonicus 0aSerine Protease 0aVibrio alginolyticus1 aLiu, Bingzhong,1 aLee, Kuo-Kau0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 55, no. 1-2 p.94-99dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2000-1-2183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04615naa a2200949 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003600113040001800149100003000167245008900197300001600286520207500302592002802377650001302405650001102418650001402429650001002443650001202453650001302465650001102478650001002489650002102499650002502520650002202545650001402567650002502581650001402606650003002620650002002650650003302670650001202703650002402715650001202739650001302751650002102764650001002785650001902795650002002814650005102834650002802885650001402913650003002927650002602957650003302983650002303016653000803039653000903047653000803056653000803064653000903072653000803081653001003089653000803099653000803107653000803115653000703123653000703130653000703137653000703144653000703151653000703158653002703165653004603192653003303238653002603271653001403297653002203311700002703333700002703360700002003387700003103407700001803438700001703456700001503473773007403488856008203562852000903644655001203653IND60099051620221117053820.0161021e20130425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009905162DNAL7 a233337292pmid7 a10.1016/j.gene.2013.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiovambattista, Guillermo10aCharacterization of bovine MHC DRB3 diversity in Latin American Creole cattle breeds  ap. 150-158.  aIn cattle, bovine leukocyte antigens (BoLAs) have been extensively used as markers for diseases and immunological traits. However, none of the highly adapted Latin American Creole breeds have been characterized for BoLA gene polymorphism by high resolution typing methods. In this work, we sequenced exon 2 of the BoLA class II DRB3 gene from 179 cattle (113 Bolivian Yacumeño cattle and 66 Colombian Hartón del Valle cattle breeds) using a polymerase chain reaction sequence-based typing (PCR-SBT) method. We identified 36 previously reported alleles and three novel alleles. Thirty-five (32 reported and three new) and 24 alleles (22 reported and two new) were detected in Yacumeño and Hartón del Valle breeds, respectively. Interestingly, Latin American Creole cattle showed a high degree of gene diversity despite their small population sizes, and 10 alleles including three new alleles were found only in these two Creole breeds. We next compared the degree of genetic variability at the population and sequence levels and the genetic distance in the two breeds with those previously reported in five other breeds: Holstein, Japanese Shorthorn, Japanese Black, Jersey, and Hanwoo. Both Creole breeds presented gene diversity higher than 0.90, a nucleotide diversity higher than 0.07, and mean number of pairwise differences higher than 19, indicating that Creole cattle had similar genetic diversity at BoLA-DRB3 to the other breeds. A neutrality test showed that the high degree of genetic variability may be maintained by balancing selection. The FST index and the exact G test showed significant differences across all cattle populations (FST=0.0478; p<0.001). Results from the principal components analysis and the phylogenetic tree showed that Yacumeño and Hartón del Valle breeds were closely related to each other. Collectively, our results suggest that the high level of genetic diversity could be explained by the multiple origins of the Creole germplasm (European, African and Indicus), and this diversity might be maintained by balancing selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3aShorthorn 3aWagyu 3aalleles 3aantigens 3acattle 3aexons 3agenetic distance 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aimmunologic diseases 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation size 3aprincipal component analysis 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattlexgenetics 2aExons 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Markers 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aSelection, Genetic 0aMHC 0aBoLA 0aPCR 0aSBT 0aRFLP 0aIPD 0aUPGMA 0aHWE 0aPCA 0aPCs 0ana 0aho 0ahe 0adn 0ads 0aNJ 0aBoLA-DRB3 polymorphism 0aMajor histocompatibility complex class II 0aLatin American Creole cattle 0aSequence-based typing 0aYacumeño 0aHartón del Valle1 aTakeshima, Shin-nosuke1 aRipoli, Maria Veronica1 aMatsumoto, Yuki1 aFranco, Luz Angela Alvarez1 aSaito, Hideki1 aOnuma, Misao1 aAida, Yoko0 tGene.g2013 Apr. 25, v. 519 p.150-158dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2013.01.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04505naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002400168245009100192300001800283520212600301592002802427650001802455650001902473650001202492650001902504650001302523650001202536650001102548650002402559650004402583650002002627650001002647650001402657650002302671650002602694650002802720650002202748650002602770650001502796650003002811650003702841650001802878650001902896650001802915650001802933650002502951650004402976650002703020650001703047650003503064650004003099650004803139650004403187650002403231650002903255650002003284650002203304650004103326650002603367651001003393700001603403700002003419700002103439700001503460700001503475700002003490700001603510773010303526856008503629852000903714655001203723IND4473103520221122030542.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447310352DNAL7 a207240602pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez-Leblic, M.I.10aInfluence of xenobiotic contaminants on landfill soil microbial activity and diversity  ap. S285-S290.  aLandfills are often the final recipient of a range of environmentally important contaminants such as hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In this study the influence of these contaminants on microbial activity and diversity was assessed in a municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill placed in Torrejón de Ardoz (Madrid, Spain). Soil samples were collected from four selected areas (T2, T2B, T8 and T9) in which the amount of total hydrocarbons, PAHs and PCBs were measured. Soil biomass, substrate induced respiration (SIR) and physiological profiles of soil samples were also determined and used as indicators of total microbial activity. Highest concentration of total hydrocarbons was detected in T2 and T9 samples, with both PCBs and benzopyrene being detected in T9 sample. Results corresponding to microbial estimation (viable bacteria and fungi, and SIR) and microbiological enzyme activities showed that highest values corresponded to areas with the lowest concentration of hydrocarbons (T2B and T8). It is noticeable that in such areas was detected the lowest concentration of the pollutants PAHs and PCBs. A negative significant correlation between soil hydrocarbons concentration and SIR, total bacteria and fungi counts and most of the enzyme activities determined was established. DGGE analysis was also carried out to determine the microbial communities’ structure in the soil samples, establishing different profiles of Bacteria and Archaea communities in each analysed area. Through the statistical analysis a significant negative correlation was only found for Bacteria domain when Shannon index and hydrocarbon concentration were correlated. In addition, a bacterial 16S rRNA gene based clone library was prepared from each soil. From the clones analysed in the samples, the majority corresponded to Proteobacteria, followed by Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria. It is important to remark that the most polluted sample (T9) showed the lowest microbial diversity only formed by six phyla being Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria the most representative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aArchaea 3aProteobacteria 3abacteria 3abiomass 3aclones 3acommunity structure 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3alandfills 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobial contamination 3amolecular cloning 3amunicipal solid waste 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aribosomal RNA 3asoil pollution 3asoil profiles 3asoil sampling 3astatistical analysis 2aActinobacteriaxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aBacteriaxdrug effects 2aBiodiversity 2aFungixdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxtoxicity 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxtoxicity. 2aProteobacteriaxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16S 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aXenobioticsxtoxicity 0aSpain1 aTurmero, A.1 aHernández, M.,1 aHernández, A.J.1 aPastor J.,1 aBall, A.S.1 aRodríguez, J.,1 aArias, M.E.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2012 Mar., v. 95S p.S285-S290dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008000167300001600247520101500263592002801278650001901306650002201325650001101347650001301358650001201371650001801383650002001401650001901421773012001440856008301560852000901643655001201652IND60620820920221118233220.0181114e200201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062082092DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642020450050102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aROTHSTEIN, BO10aCooperation for Social ProtectionbExplaining Variation in Welfare Programs  ap. 901-918.  aThe welfare state can be seen as a measure of the social protection. A major finding within the comparative welfare state research is the differences in scope, institutionalization, and effectiveness against poverty between the institutionalized forms of social protection among the industrialized Western democracies. The major question in this article is, How can we understand and explain the causal mechanism between such institutions, social norms, and human behavior? A model is presented to show that if voters/taxpayers act out of self-interest, both a selective/minimal and an encompassing/universal welfare state are likely outcomes. The different outcomes cannot be explained by the importance of the ideology of ruling political parties or that citizens in these different countries have different basic values about social justice. Instead, the argument is that the puzzle why structurally similar countries vary so much in their systems of social protection can be solved by institutional theory.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman behavior 3aindustrialization 3amodels 3apolitics 3apoverty 3apublic policy 3asocial behavior 3asocial justice0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g2002 Jan., v. 45, no. 5 p.901-918dSage PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642020450050103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01539naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007300126300001600199520062300215650001600838650002100854650002000875650001200895650001300907650001300920650001500933650001700948700001400965700001900979773013700998852000901135930003301144945001301177946001101190655001201201IND2057003120221119012337.0970509e19970201ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205700312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, B.C.10aPhosphotransferase activity of acid phosphatases of a Citrobacter sp  ap. 103-108.  aThe acid phosphatase of an atypical Citrobacter sp. was purified in two isoforms, designated CPI and CPII, which had different Km values for glycerol 1-phosphate and glycerol 2-phosphate.

Comparative expression studies in L. japonicus and A. thaliana showed that sbp transcripts are present in various tissues and at different levels. Especially in L. japonicus nodules and seedpods and A. thaliana siliques, sbp expression appears to be developmentally up-regulated. sbp Gene transcripts were localized by in situ hybridization in the infected cells and vascular bundles of young nodules, while in mature nodules, low levels of expression were only detected in the parenchymatous cells. Expression of sbp transcripts in young seedpods and siliques was clearly visible in vascular tissues and embryos, while in embryos, low levels of expression were detected in the root epidermis and the vascular bundles. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a truncated LjSBP recombinant protein recognized a polypeptide of about 60 kDa in nodule extracts. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that accumulation of LjSBP occurred in root hairs, in the root epidermis above the nodule primordium, in the phloem of the vasculature, and abundantly in the infected cells of young nodules. Irrespective of the presence of rhizobia, expression of SBP was also observed in root tips, where it was confined in the root epidermis and protophloem cells. We hypothesize that LjSBP may have more than one physiological role and can be implicated in controlling the oxidation/reduction status of target proteins, in vesicular Golgi transport, or both. 3apolypeptides 3amessenger RNA 3aplant development 3acomplementary DNA 3aMedicago sativa 3aroot nodules 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3aLotus 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aroot hairs 3aphloem 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apods 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequencexgenetics 2aDNA, Complementaryxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Plantxchemistryxgenetics. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aLotusxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMammals 2aMedicagoxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Epidermisxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSeedsxmetabolism 2aSelenium-Binding Proteins 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSymbiosis 0aepidermis 0aplant vascular system 0amolecular sequence data 0aroots1 aAgalou, A.1 aKavroulakis, N.1 aDimou, M.1 aMartsikovskaya, A.1 aSlater, A.1 aSpaink, H.P.1 aRoussis, A.1 aKatinakis, P.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2002 Apr., v. 15, no. 4 p.313-322x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.4.3133Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02603naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002700193245015100220300001600371520151700387650001801904653004901922653002601971700001301997700001602010773013402026852000902160856007602169930003302245946001102278655001202289IND4386911720221119012009.0070116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438691172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03273.x2doi7 aPMC18104652pmcid7 a172239762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller-Steinhardt, M.14aThe impact of interleukin-6 promoter ⁻⁵⁹⁷/⁻⁵⁷²/⁻¹⁷⁴genotype on interleukin-6 production after lipopolysaccharide stimulation  ap. 339-345.  aInterleukin (IL)-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine, produced by different cells. There is accumulating evidence that IL-6 promoter polymorphisms impact substantially on various diseases and we identified kidney transplant recipients carrying the IL-6 GGG/GGG ⁻⁵⁹⁷/⁻⁵⁷²/⁻¹⁷⁴genotype to have superior graft survival. To prove a functional impact on gene expression, we analysed systematically IL-6 production in healthy individuals with respect to the IL-6 ⁻⁵⁹⁷/⁻⁵⁷²/⁻¹⁷⁴genotype. IL-6 was determined in 100 healthy blood donors at protein and mRNA levels upon specific stimulation in monocytes and T lymphocytes under whole blood conditions. GGG/GGG individuals showed a lower IL-6 secretion upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation versus all others (P = 0·039). This link was even stronger when ⁻⁵⁹⁷ and ⁻¹⁷⁴GG genotypes were reanalysed separately (P = 0·008, P = 0·017). However, we found neither a difference at the mRNA level or percentage of CD14⁺ cells nor after T cell stimulation. We found evidence for the IL-6 ⁻⁵⁹⁷/⁻⁵⁷²/⁻¹⁷⁴genotype to affect IL-6 synthesis, i.e. lower levels of IL-6 protein upon LPS-stimulation in GGG/GGG individuals. Further studies are needed in kidney transplant recipients to investigate the potential link between the GGG/GGG genotype and graft survival. In line with this, determination of the genetic risk profiles might be promising to improve the transplant outcome in the individual patient. 3ainterleukin-6 0a⁻⁵⁹⁷/⁻⁵⁷²/⁻¹⁷⁴genotype 0apromoter polymorphism1 aEbel, B.1 aHärtel, C.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Feb., v. 147, no. 2 p.339-345dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03273.x3electronic resource  a20070116b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02572naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245012100165300001600286500002400302500001500326520139100341650001001732650001101742650001401753650001101767650002501778650001001803650000701813650001601820650002201836650001201858650001101870653001901881700001801900773009601918852000902014856008302023856006802106655001202174IND4459461120221119012525.0110629s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445946112DNAL7 a10.5344/ajev.2010.100052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorris, Justin R.13aAn Investigation of Training System, Pruning Severity, Spur Length, and Shoot Positioning on Cynthiana/Norton Grapes  ap. 445-450.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis five-year study evaluated the effects of Geneva double-curtain (GDC) and single-curtain (SC) training systems, 30+10 and 60+10 balanced pruning severities, 3- and 6-node spur lengths, and shoot positioning on yield and fruit composition of Arkansas-grown Cynthiana/Norton, aestivalis-type grapes. The GDC-trained vines had a 46% higher yield than SC-trained vines, but yield per m/cordon was lower for GDC-trained vines. Additional yield on GDC-trained vines appeared to come from noncount shoots. Vine dormant prunings, number of retained nodes, and cluster weights were similar between training systems. Juice pH was lower on GDC-trained vines; other measures of fruit composition were similar between training systems. Pruning to a 60+10 severity increased the number of retained nodes and increased yield and clusters per vine as compared to 30+10 but did not affect fruit composition. There was no difference in yield on vines pruned to 3- or 6-node spurs and there was no difference in fruitfulness associated with node position along the spur. Pruning to 3-node spurs increased the percentage of soluble solids while maintaining slightly greater vine vigor than pruning to 6-node spurs. Shoot positioning did not affect vine yield but did reduce vine vigor and lower fruit pH. Shoot positioning should be considered based on individual vineyard vigor and production methods. 3avines 3ajuices 3avineyards 3agrapes 3atotal soluble solids 3avigor 3apH 3afruit yield 3afruit composition 3apruning 3ashoots 0asoluble solids1 aMain, Gary L.0 tAmerican journal of enology and viticulture.g2010, v. 61, no. 4 p.445-450x0002-92547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5344/ajev.2010.100053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.ajevonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02923naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245013000173300001600303520162200319650001301941650001201954650001501966650002501981650001602006650001702022650001802039650001502057650001102072650001602083650001502099651001202114651001902126653002502145653001302170653003002183700002302213773011502236852000902351856008502360930003302445946001102478655001202489IND4402204020221119012630.0080302e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440220402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-005-0450-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitzsimons, Vincent P. 10aEstimating groundwater recharge through tills: a sensitivity analysis of soil moisture budgets and till properties in Ireland  ap. 548-561.  aThe study highlights the dangers of limiting recharge calculations in humid climates to meteorological and soil considerations. It highlights the importance of developing a conceptual understanding of the influence of geology on recharge mechanisms and recharge rates. Uncertainties in recharge estimates through tills are examined by a study of the available literature, combined with sensitivity analyses of soil moisture budget parameters and of hypothetical scenarios of till properties and hydraulic gradients that are realistic for Irish conditions. The sensitivity analyses demonstrate that till properties have a greater influence over recharge than the soil moisture budgeting parameters. Results are considered in terms of recharge coefficients, representing the proportion of effective precipitation that becomes actual recharge to the aquifer. The literature review identifies a range in recharge coefficients from 4% to 90% in selected field and catchment scale studies from bedrock aquifers in Ireland and the U.K. The sensitivity analyses are able to simulate a similar range in recharge coefficient of 2% to 80% by varying only till permeability, thickness and vertical hydraulic gradients. In the scenarios examined, the greatest sensitivity to vertical till permeability lies between 0.001 m/day and 0.01 m/day. The sensitivity to soil moisture budgeting parameters is much less apparent. It is concluded that this is due to the dominance of grassland in Ireland and the relatively wet summers, resulting in the limited development of soil moisture deficits by comparison with some parts of the U.K. 3aaquifers 3abedrock 3agrasslands 3agroundwater recharge 3ahumid zones 3apermeability 3asoil analysis 3asoil water 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aIreland 3aUnited Kingdom 0aSoil moisture budget 0aBaseflow 0aGlacial till permeability1 aMisstear, B.

The global pattern of gene expression during these stages in the birch (Betula pendula)-Paxillus involutus ECM association was analyzed using cDNA microarrays. In comparison with nonsymbiotic conditions, 251 fungal (from a total of 1,075) and 138 plant (1,074 in total) genes were found to be differentially regulated during the ECM development. For instance, during mantle and Hartig net development, there were several plant genes upregulated that are normally involved in defense responses during pathogenic fungal challenges. These responses were, at later stages of ECM development, found to be repressed. Other birch genes that showed differential regulation involved several homologs that usually are implicated in water permeability (aquaporins) and water stress tolerance (dehydrins). Among fungal genes differentially upregulated during stages of mantle and Hartig net formation were homologs putatively involved in mitochondrial respiration. In fully developed ECM tissue, there was an upregulation of fungal genes related to protein synthesis and the cytoskeleton assembly machinery. This study highlights complex molecular interactions between two symbionts during the development of an ECM association. 3aBetula pendula 3aplant proteins 3agene expression regulation 3acomplementary DNA 3aplant genetics 3amicroarray technology 3aectomycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aPaxillus involutus 3anucleotide sequences 2aBase Sequence 2aBasidiomycotaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBetulaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Plant 2aMycorrhizaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aSymbiosis 2aWaterxmetabolism 0amolecular sequence data1 aWright, D.P.1 aSoderstrom, B.1 aTunlid, A.1 aJohansson, T.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 July, v. 18, no. 7 p.659-673wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-06593Available from publisher's Web site  a20080229b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/08  aOther US 7aarticle02116naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245012400181300001600305520080800321650001101129650001201140650001501152650001501167650000901182650001601191650001701207650002001224650001401244650000901258650001301267650002001280653001501300653003101315653003101346700002501377773014701402852000901549856009201558930003301650946001101683655001201694IND4405721720221119012235.0080516e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440572172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2007.01545.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArvanitoyannis, Ioannis.10aCorn and rice waste: a comparative and critical presentation of methods and current and potential uses of treated waste  ap. 958-988.  aAlthough corn and rice waste can be hardly classified among the most hazardous waste, their treatment is very important in view of the great volume of waste materials involved.

Here, we report that expressing the same gene from a mild strain induced similar symptoms that correlated with accumulation of p23 protein irrespective of the source strain. CTV inoculation of transgenic limes showing CTV-like leaf symptoms and high p23 accumulation did not modify symptoms initially, with the virus titer being as in inoculated nontransgenic controls; however, at later stages, symptoms became attenuated. Transformation with p23-T36 of CTV-susceptible sweet and sour orange and CTV-resistant trifoliate orange also led to CTV-like leaf symptoms that did not develop when plants were transformed with a truncated p23 version. In transgenic citrus species and relatives other than Mexican lime, p23 was barely detectable, although symptom intensity correlated with levels of p23 transcripts. The lower accumulation of p23 in sweet and sour orange compared with Mexican lime also was observed in nontransgenic plants inoculated with CTV, suggesting that minimal p23 levels cause deleterious effects in the first two species. Conversely, transgenic expression of p23 in CTV nonhost Nicotiana spp. led to accumulation of p23 without phenotypic aberrations, indicating that p23 interferes with plant development only in citrus species and relatives. 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aplant viruses 3agenetic variation 3aviral proteins 3atransgenes 3agenetic transformation 3apathogenicity 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3alimes 3aCitrus sinensis 3aoranges 3aCitrus aurantium 3asour oranges 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3atransgenic plants 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3atobacco 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aCitrusxmetabolismxvirology. 2aClosterovirusxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aGene Expressionxphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPlant Leavesxvirology 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTobaccoxvirology 2aViral Proteins 0asymptoms 0amolecular sequence data1 aLopez, C.1 aMoreno, P.1 aNavarro, L.1 aFlores, R.1 aPena, L.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 May, v. 18, no. 5 p.435-445wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-04353Available from publisher's Web site  a20080310b20080404c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/08  aOther US 7aarticle03009naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245012100210300001400331520167800345650003102023650001802054653002802072653001902100653002302119700001502142700001302157700001402170700002702184700001502211700001502226700001402241700001502255700001302270700001502283773013202298852000902430856009202439930003302531946001102564655001202575IND4394721420221119012518.0070906e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439472142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03443.x2doi7 aPMC22192842pmcid7 a176149732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiobara, N.10aBacterial superantigens and T cell receptor β-chain-bearing T cells in the immunopathogenesis of ulcerative colitis  ap. 13-21.  aUlcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing-remitting inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that affects the colon and the rectum producing debilitating symptoms, which impair ability to function and quality of life. The aetiology of IBD is incompletely understood, but within the lymphocyte population, specific T cell subsets are known to be major factors in the development of intestinal immune pathology while different subsets are essential regulators, controlling IBD. Hence, IBD is thought to reflect dysregulated T cell behaviour. This study was to investigate if the normal molecular configuration of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is compromised in patients with UC. The percentage of T cell-bearing β-chain 4 (TCRBV4) was high in patients with UC, and T cells showed polyclonal expansion in the presence of bacterial superantigens (SA) such as streptococcal mitogenic exotoxin Z-2 (SMEZ-2), indicating that bacterial SA promote specific TCRBV family expansion. Further, in patients with UC, the duration of UC was significantly longer in patients with skewed TCRBV4 compared with patients without TCRBV4 skewing, suggesting that long-term exposure to bacterial SA such as SMEZ-2 might promote systemic immune disorders like the remission-relapsing cycles seen in patients with UC. In conclusion, our observations in this study support the perception that the systemic activation of T cells by enteric bacterial SA might lead to a dysregulated, but exuberant immune activity causing the remission and flare-up cycle of mucosal inflammation in patients with UC. Future studies should strengthen our findings and increase understanding on the aetiology of IBD. 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aT-lymphocytes 0abacterial superantigens 0aTCR repertoire 0aulcerative colitis1 aSuzuki, Y.1 aAoki, H.1 aGotoh, A.1 aFujii, Y.q(Yoshiyuki)1 aHamada, Y.1 aSuzuki, S.1 aFukui, N.1 aKurane, I.1 aItoh, T.1 aSuzuki, R.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Oct., v. 150, no. 1 p.13-21dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03443.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02654naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245016000154300001600314520124800330650001601578650001901594650000801613650002401621650002401645650002201669650002001691650004101711650001201752650002601764650002201790650001601812650001501828650001101843650003001854650001201884653002201896700001201918700001601930773012201946852000902068856007502077930003302152946001102185655001202196IND4407882820221119012141.0080717s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440788282DNAL7 a10.1071/AP080492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatterjee, A.10aAcquisition, transmission and host range of a begomovirus associated with yellow vein mosaic disease of mesta (Hibiscus cannabinus and Hibiscus sabdariffa)  ap. 511-519.  aYellow vein mosaic, a disease causing serious reductions in fibre yield of mesta (Hibiscus cannabinus and Hibiscus sabdariffa) and associated with a begomovirus, was effectively transmitted by cleft grafting and whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), but not through seed or by mechanical means. Association of the begomovirus with infected experimental host plants was determined by Southern hybridisation using a DNA A targeting probe and PCR amplification primed with specific primers. The minimum whitefly acquisition access period was 12 h and the minimum inoculation access period was 4 h. The minimum incubation period was 9 days. The whitefly transmission efficiency was 85% for H. sabdariffa and 78% for H. cannabinus. The transmissibility through cleft grafting was 80% to H. sabdariffa and 60% to H. cannabinus. The same isolate produced leaf crumpling symptoms in Vigna umbellata and Vigna unguiculata ssp. unguiculata (cowpea). The virus infection causing yellow vein mosaic symptoms on mesta was confirmed by back inoculation and molecular diagnostics. The disease incidence in fields was found to be 92.5% for H. sabdariffa and 89.5% for H. cannabinus, while under experimental conditions the incidence was of 63.7% and 37.2%, respectively. 3aBegomovirus 3aBemisia tabaci 3aDNA 3aHibiscus cannabinus 3aHibiscus sabdariffa 3aSouthern blotting 3aVigna umbellata 3aVigna unguiculata subsp. unguiculata 3acowpeas 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease incidence 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3aleaves 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 0avarietal response1 aRoy, A.1 aGhosh, S.K.0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2008, v. 37, no. 5 p.511-519dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0815-31917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AP080493Available from publisher's Web site  a20081002b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03159naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245014700167300001600314520162700330650001201957650001701969650001501986650004102001650001402042650001502056650001702071650002202088650001602110650004502126650001902171650001302190651001102203653002802214653002702242653001902269700002102288700002002309700001802329700003102347700001802378700001902396773011202415852000902527856008502536930003302621946001102654655001202665IND4409923120221119012750.0080905e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440992312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00040-008-0992-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancisco, F.

An example in Plebeia remota (Holmberg, 1903) (Apidae, Meliponini)  ap. 231-237.  aWe see today many efforts to quantify biodiversity in different biomes. It is very important then to develop and to apply other methodologies that allow us to assess biodiversity. Here we present an example of application of three tools with this goal. We analyzed two populations of Plebeia remota from two distinct biomes that already showed several differences in morphology and behavior. Based on these differences, it has been suggested that the populations of Cunha and Prudentópolis do not represent a single species. In order to verify the existence or absence of gene flow between these two groups, we characterized the patterns of mtDNA through RFLP, the patterns of wing venation through geometric morphometry, and the cuticular hydrocarbons through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We used bees collected in these two locations and also from colonies which have being kept for around 9 years at Sao Paulo University. We found six different haplotypes in these specimens, of which three of them occurred exclusively in the population of Cunha and three only in the Prudentópolis population. The fact that the populations do not share haplotypes suggests no maternal gene flow between them. The two populations were differentiated by the pattern of the wing veins. They also had different mixtures of cuticle hydrocarbons. Furthermore it was shown that the colonies kept at the university did not hybridize. These two groups may constitute different species. We also show here the importance of using other methodologies than traditional taxonomy to assess and understand biodiversity, especially in bees. 3aTrigona 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agene flow 3ahaplotypes 3ahydrocarbons 3amitochondrial DNA 3amorphometry 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asocial insects 3ataxonomy 3aBrazil 0ageometric morphometrics 0acuticular hydrocarbons 0aPlebeia remota1 aNunes-Silva, P. 1 aFrancoy, T.

  1 aIniguez, A.L.10aRegulation of enteric endophytic bacterial colonization by plant defenses  ap. 169-178.  a2019-12-04  aBacterial endophytes reside within the interior of plants without causing disease or forming symbiotic structures. Some endophytes, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae 342 (Kp342), enhance plant growth and nutrition. Others, such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium), are human pathogens that contaminate raw produce. Several lines of evidence are presented here to support the hypothesis that plant defense response pathways regulate colonization by endophytic bacteria. An ethyleneinsensitive mutant of Medicago truncatula is hypercolonized by Kp342 compared to the parent genotype. Addition of ethylene, a signal molecule for induced systemic resistance in plants, decreased endophytic colonization in Medicago spp. This ethylene-mediated inhibition of endophytic colonization was reversed by addition of the ethylene action inhibitor, 1-methylcyclopropene. Colonization of Medicago spp. by S. typhimurium also was affected by exogenous ethylene. Mutants lacking flagella or a component of the type III secretion system of Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (TTSS-SPI1) colonize the interior of Medicago spp. In higher numbers than the wild type. Arabidopsis defense response-related genotypes indicated that only salicylic acid (SA)-independent defense responses contribute to restricting colonization by Kp342. In contrast, colonization by S. typhimurium is affected by both SA-dependent and -independent responses. S. typhimurium mutants further delineated these responses, suggesting that both flagella and TTSS-SPI1 effectors can be recognized. Flagella act primarily through SA-independent responses (compromising SA accumulation still affected colonization in the absence of flagella). Removal of a TTSS-SPI1 effector resulted in hypercolonization regardless of whether the genotype was affected in either SA-dependent or SA-independent responses. Consistent with these results, S. typhimurium activates the promoter of PR1, a SA-dependent pathogenesisrelated gene, while S. typhimurium mutants lacking the TTSS-SPI1 failed to activate this promoter. These observations suggest approaches to reduce contamination of raw produce by human enteric pathogens and to increase the number of growth-promoting bacteria in plants. 3aendophytes 3aethylene 3asystemic acquired resistance 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3asignal transduction 3atype III secretion system 3aMedicago truncatula 2aArabidopsisxmicrobiology 2aEthylenes 2aHypocotylxmicrobiology 2aKlebsiella pneumoniaexphysiology 2aMedicagoxmicrobiology 2aMedicago sativaxmicrobiology 2aMedicago truncatulaxmicrobiology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonas syringaexphysiology 2aSalicylic Acid 2aSalmonella entericaxphysiology 2aTime Factors 2aTriticumxmicrobiology 0aplant biochemistry 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0aType III secretion system1 aDong, Y.M.1 aCarter, H.D.1 aAhmer, B.M.M.1 aStone, J.M.1 aTriplett, E.W.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.169-178x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-01693Available from publisher's Web site  a20080813b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/04  aOther US 7aarticle01951naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010100128300001600229500001500245520083700260650002901097650002201126650001301148650002101161650001501182650001501197650001501212650002901227650000901256650001101265650002001276650001801296650001301314653001501327653002001342700001701362700001701379773007801396852000901474939003301483946001301516655001201529IND9302691720221119012451.0930504e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930269172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, M.J.10aConstitutive and nitrate-induced, membrane-bound nitrate reductase from Bradyrhizobium japonicum  ap. 121-124.  a2019-12-04  aNitrate reductase (NR) activity was detected in membranes from cells of Bradyrhizobium japonicum cultured in defined medium either with glutamate or nitrate as the only nitrogen source.

  1 aSekine, K.T.10aEnhanced resistance to Cucumber mosaic virus in the Arabidopsis thaliana ssi2 mutant is mediated via an SA-independent mechanism  ap. 623-632.  aThe Arabidopsis thaliana SSI2 gene encodes a plastid-localized stearoyl-ACP desaturase. The recessive ssi2 mutant allele confers constitutive accumulation of the pathogenesis-related-1 (PR-1) gene transcript and salicylic acid (SA), and enhanced resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens. In addition, the ssi2 mutant is a dwarf and spontaneously develops lesions containing dead cells. Here, we show that the ssi2 mutant also confers enhanced resistance to Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Compared with the wild-type plant, viral multiplication and systemic spread were diminished in the ssi2 mutant plant. However, unlike the ssi2-conferred resistance to bacterial and oomycete pathogens, the ssi2-conferred enhanced resistance to CMV was retained in the SA-deficient ssi2 nahG plant. In addition, SA application was not effective in limiting CMV multiplication and systemic spread in the CMV-susceptible wild-type plant. The acd1, acd2, and cpr5 mutants which, like the ssi2 mutant, accumulate elevated SA levels, constitutively express the PR-1 gene, spontaneously develop lesions containing dead cells, and are dwarfs, are, however, fully susceptible to CMV. Our results suggest that dwarfing, cell death, and constitutive activation of SA signaling are not important for the ssi2-conferred enhanced resistance to CMV. However, the sfd1 and sfd4 mutations, which affect lipid metabolism, suppress the ssi2-conferred enhanced resistance to CMV, thus implicating a lipid or lipids in the ssi2-conferred resistance to CMV. Interestingly, the ssi2-conferred resistance to CMV was compromised in the ssi2 eds5 plant, suggesting the involvement of an SA-independent, EDS5-dependent mechanism in the ssi2-conferred resistance to CMV. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3aplant proteins 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3adisease resistance 3aresistance mechanisms 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3aplant viruses 3avirus replication 3aCucumber mosaic virus 2aAlleles 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aCucumovirusxpathogenicity 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseasesxvirology 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxvirology. 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aSuppression, Genetic 0astearoyl ACP desaturase 0asuppressor of fatty acid desaturase deficiency 1 protein1 aNandi, A.1 aIshihara, T.1 aHase, S.1 aIkegami, M.1 aShah, J.1 aTakahashi, H.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2004 June, v. 17, no. 6 p.623-632x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2004.17.6.6233Available from publisher's Web site  a20050816b00000000c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/04/23  aOther US 7aarticle02541naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001600193245017200209300001600381520128000397653001801677653003801695653000801733653001801741700001701759700001701776700001801793700001701811700001701828700001301845700001801858773013401876852000902010856009202019930003302111946001102144655001202155IND4398566720221119012152.0071209e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439856672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03534.x2doi7 aPMC22769272pmcid7 a179912872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaculik, C.10aShift of C3 deposition from localization in the glomerulus into the tubulo-interstitial compartment in the absence of secreted IgM in immune complex glomerulonephritis  ap. 146-154.  aThe role of secretory IgM in protecting kidney tissue from immune complex glomerulonephritis induced by 4 mg horse spleen apoferritin and 0·05 mg lipopolysaccharide has been investigated in mutant mice in which B cells do not secrete IgM, but are capable of expressing surface IgM and IgD and secreting other Ig isotypes. Glomerular size, number of glomeruli per cross-section, glomerular cellularity and urine content of protein and creatinine was comparable in treated secreted IgM (sIgM)-deficient and wild-type mice. Assessment of urinary proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a 30 kDa low molecular weight protein in treated sIgM-deficient animals only, reflecting dysfunction of proximal tubules. A shift of bound C3 from glomeruli to the tubulo-interstitial compartment in sIgM-deficient mice also suggests tubulo-interstitial damage. In contrast, local C3 synthesis within the kidney tissue did not differ between the two treated groups. Apoptosis physiologically present to maintain kidney cell homeostasis was increased slightly in treated wild-type mice. These results indicate that secretory IgM can protect the tubulo-interstitial compartment from immune complex-induced damage without having an effect on the glomerulus. 0acomplement C3 0aimmune complex glomerulonephritis 0aLPS 0asecretory IgM1 aRüger, B.M.1 aYanagida, G.1 aHollemann, D.1 aSoleiman, A.1 aLosert, U.M.1 aChen, J.1 aFischer, M.B.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 Jan., v. 151, no. 1 p.146-154dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03534.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02964naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245019100210300001400401520169900415650001202114650004002126653004102166653002802207653001402235700001602249700002402265700001802289700001802307773013202325852000902457856009202466930003302558946001102591655001202602IND4398567920221119012215.0071209e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439856792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03537.x2doi7 aPMC22769222pmcid7 a179834442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDriver, J.P.10aComparative therapeutic effects of orally administered 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ and 1alpha-hydroxyvitamin D₃ on type-1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice fed a normal-calcaemic diet  ap. 76-85.  aFrequent injections of the hormonal form of vitamin D₃, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (1,25D3) reportedly inhibits autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1D) in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice by correcting some of the abnormalities in antigen-presenting cells which contribute the development of pathogenic T cell responses. This route of administration greatly elevates the levels of these compounds in the bloodstream for hours after treatment, which requires mice to be fed diets formulated to contain much reduced levels of Ca to avoid the toxic effects of hypercalcaemia. In the current work, we demonstrate that feeding 1,25D3 or its synthetic precursor, 1alpha(OH) vitamin D₃ (1alphaD3), as part of a T1D supportive chow diet containing normal levels of Ca, is an effective means of reducing the incidence of disease in NOD mice, but the doses required for protection elicited hypercalcaemia. However, T1D protection elicited by D3 analogue feeding appears, at least partially, to have an immunological basis, as splenic T cells from treated mice had a decreased capacity to adoptively transfer disease. Protection is associated with an increased proportion of T cells with CD4⁺ forkhead box P3⁺ regulatory phenotype within the islet infiltrate of treated animals. The 1alphaD3 precursor is converted rapidly to the active 1,25D3 isoform in vivo. However, feeding the 1alphaD3 analogue elicited stronger T1D protection than the 1,25D3 compound, but also induced more severe hypercalcaemia. In future, the dietary supplementation of novel low-calcaemic D3 analogues may enable their continuous delivery at levels that inhibit T1D development in susceptible humans consuming normal levels of Ca. 3acalcium 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 0a1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ analogues 0adietary supplementation 0aNOD mouse1 aForeman, O.1 aMathieu, Charlotte.1 avan Etten, E.1 aSerreze, D.V.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 Jan., v. 151, no. 1 p.76-85dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03537.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03635naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072001700140072001700157072001700174100001600191245015100207300001600358520203800374650002202412650002602434650001202460650002802472650003002500650002302530650003202553650002702585650002702612650001102639650002002650650001802670650002002688650002502708653001302733653002802746700002702774700001402801700001502815700001502830773011202845852000902957856008002966930003303046945002503079946001303104655001203117IND4369302320221119012518.0050427e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436930232DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-18-01832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHuitema, E.10aDifferences in intensity and specificity of hypersensitive response induction in Nicotiana spp. by INF1, INF2, and INF2B of Phytophthora infestans  ap. 183-193.  aElicitins form a family of structurally related proteins that induce the hypersensitive response (HR) in plants, particularly Nicotiana spp. The elicitin family is composed of several classes. Most species of the plant-pathogenic oomycete genus Phytophthor produce the well-characterized 10-kDa canonical elicitins (class I), such as INF1 of the potato and tomato pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Two genes, inf2A and inf2B, encoding a distinct class (class III) of elicitinlike proteins, also occur in P. infestans. Unlike secreted class I elicitins, class III elicitins are thought to be cell-surface- anchored polypeptides. Molecular characterization of the inf2 genes indicated that they are widespread in Phytophthora spp. and occur as a small gene family. In addition, Southern blot and Northern blot hybridizations using gene-specific probes showed that inf2A and inf2B genes and transcripts can be detected in 17 different P. infestans isolates. Functional secreted expression in plant cells of the elicitin domain of the inf1 and inf2 genes was conducted using a binary Potato virus X (PVX) vector (agroinfection) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens transient transformation assays (agroinfiltration), and resulted in HR-like necrotic symptoms and induction of defense response genes in tobacco. However, comparative analyses of elicitor activity of INF1, INF2A, and INF2B revealed significant differences in intensity, specificity, and consistency of HR induction. Whereas INF1 induced the HR in Nicotiana benthamiana, INF2A induced weak symptoms and INF2B induced no symptoms on this plant. Nonetheless, similar to INF1, HR induction by INF2A in N. benthamiana required the ubiquitin ligase-associated protein SGT1. Overall, these results suggest that variation in the resistance of Nicotiana spp. to P. infestans is shadowed by variation in the response to INF elicitins. The ability of tobacco, but not N. benthamiana, to respond to INF2B could explain differences in resistance to P. infestans observed for these two species. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3atobacco 3ahypersensitive response 3afungal diseases of plants 3adisease resistance 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3agenome 3afungal proteins 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3aamino acid sequences 0aelicitin 0amolecular sequence data1 aVleeshouwers, V.G.A.A.1 aCakir, C.1 aKamoun, S.1 aGovers, F.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2005 Mar., v. 18, no. 3 p.183-193wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-18-01833Available from publisher's Web site  a20080807b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2005/11/07  aOther US 7aarticle02239naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001500193245006000208300001600268520125200284653002401536653002901560700001901589700001801608700002001626773013401646852000901780856009201789930003301881946001101914655001201925IND4398566120221119012004.0071209e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439856612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03550.x2doi7 aPMC22769332pmcid7 a180052592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRich, A.L.10aSerial lung function tests in primary immune deficiency  ap. 110-113.  aPulmonary complications are common in patients with primary immune deficiency (PID).

Seven patients showed a decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second over the period of the study. An additional five patients showed a decline in TLCO. Of these 12 patients, two had no radiographic evidence of lung disease. Higher levels of immunoglobulin were associated with slower decline in LFTs (P < 0·05). The analysis of antibiotic usage and LFTs failed to show a statistically significant effect, although there was a trend towards a slower rate of decline with greater use of antibiotics. LFTs decline slowly in patients with PID. Annual testing (both spirometry and transfer factor) is useful in the assessment of these patients, and should not be confined to those with radiological evidence of lung disease. 0alung function tests 0aprimary immunodeficiency1 aLe Jeune, I.R.1 aMcDermott, L.1 aKinnear, W.J.M.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 Jan., v. 151, no. 1 p.110-113dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03550.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071209b20080102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03255naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148072000900166072000900175100002700184245009200211300001600303500002400319520138300343650002201726650001501748650001501763650002201778650001801800650001601818650002501834650001001859650001401869650001101883650001601894650001801910650000901928650001301937650001801950650002701968650002201995650004502017650001102062650002302073650001302096650000902109650002902118650004702147650002002194650002102214650001202235650001002247650001602257651001802273651001802291700002502309773008202334852000902416856008702425930003302512945002502545946001102570655001202581IND4417299420221119012617.0090306e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441729942DNAL7 a191528222pmid7 a10.1016/j.appet.2008.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aByrd-Bredbenner, Carol10aDifferences in food supplies of U.S. households with and without overweight individuals  ap. 479-484.  aIncludes references  aHousehold food supplies of families with at least one child 12 years or younger (n =100) were inventoried in order to describe its nutrient content and compare food supplies of families with and without overweight individuals (i.e., healthy vs. overweight mothers; healthy vs. overweight fathers; healthy vs. overweight child[ren]). Nutrient adequacy ratios (NAR) for carbohydrate, dietary fiber, calcium, iron, total fat, and saturated fat were approximately one indicating amounts available per 2000 calories approximately equaled the Daily Value. NARs for protein, sugar, vitamin A, vitamin C, and sodium exceeded one and cholesterol NAR was less than one. Households were similar in number of household members, days until they planned to grocery shop again, and total days of meals and snacks to be served from household food supplies until the next grocery shopping trip. Frozen vegetables contributed significantly greater amounts of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein and meat supplied significantly more fat and protein in households with overweight fathers than in households with healthy weight fathers. In households with an overweight child, grains supplied significantly more protein and carbohydrate than in comparison households.

They are produced industrially by species of the genera Corynebacterium and Brevibacterium. The branched biosynthetic pathway of these amino acids in corynebacteria is unusual in gene organization and in the control of key enzymatic steps with respect to other microorganisms. This article reviews the molecular control mechanisms of the biosynthetic pathways leading to threonine and lysine in corynebacteria, and their implications in the production of these amino acids. Carbon flux can be redirected at branch points by gene disruption of the competing pathways for lysine or threonine. Removal of bottlenecks has been achieved by amplification of genes which encode feedback resistant aspartokinase and homoserine dehydrogenase (obtained by in vitro directed mutagenesis). 3aBrevibacterium 3aCorynebacterium 3aaspartate kinase 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aessential amino acids 3agene targeting 3agenes 3ahomoserine 3alysine 3amicroorganisms 3amutagenesis 3athreonine1 aMartin, J.F.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1996 Oct. 1, v. 143, no. 2/3 p.103-114aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02574naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245010600136300001400242500001500256520143600271650001401707650002301721650001001744650002801754650002501782650002001807650001101827653002401838653001501862653001201877700002501889700001801914700002801932700002501960700001801985773009302003852000902096930003302105945001302138946001302151655001202164IND2045182720221119012222.0950321e199501  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204518272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez-Fernandez, G.10aNewly hatched chick ovarian subpopulations metabolize distinctively progestin and androgen precursors  ap. 31-41.  a2019-12-05  aThe aim of this study was to characterize the ability of four different cell fractions (F1, F2, F3, and F4), isolated from the ovary of newly hatched chick by means of subsequent metrizamide gradients (0-15%), to metabolize progestins and androgens. The results showed the presence of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase and 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3 beta-HSD) activities in the typical steroidogenic cells isolated in F1 (d = 1.012 g/ml). Primary oocytes present in F2 (d = 1.037 g/ml) did not show relevant steroid metabolism in the various assays that were carried out. Fractions 3 (d = 1.055 g/ml) and 4 (d = 1.071 g/ml), which contained a mixture of prefollicular and poorly differentiated epithelial cells, presented both 5 beta-reductase and aromatase activities, whereas 17 beta-HSD activity was mainly located in the cells of fraction 3. It is highly possible that poorly differentiated epithelial cells of fractions 3 and 4 are responsible for the steroidogenic activity. We conclude that in newly hatched chick ovary, typical steroidogenic cells metabolize progestins to androgens, and poorly differentiated epithelial cells further aromatize androgens to estrogens. In addition, we suggest the existence of at least two metabolically distinct poorly differentiated epithelial cell subpopulations, one presenting 5 beta-reductase and aromatase activities and another exhibiting 17 beta-HSD activity. 3aandrogens 3asteroid metabolism 3acells 3aprogestational hormones 3acell differentiation 3aenzyme activity 3achicks 0asteroidogenic cells 0aprecursors 0aovaries1 aJuarez-Oropeza, M.a.1 aVelazquez, P.1 aGonzalez del Pliego, M.1 aMendez-Herrera, M.C.1 aPedernera, E.0 tGeneral and comparative endocrinology.g1995 Jan., v. 97, no. 1 p.31-41x0016-64807nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle00843naa a2200253 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245010000137300001400237520008200251651001200333653003300345700002100378700001700399773010000416852000900516939003300525945000800558946001100566655001200577991584353050742620221119012428.0830308e198202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAde-Serrano, M.A.10aTreatment of human tungiasis with niridazole (ambilhar) a double-blind placebo-controlled trial  ap. 89-92.  aTunga penetrans, schoolchildren, effective treatment with niridazole: Nigeria 3aNigeria 0aTunga penetrans (Arthropoda)1 aOlomolehin, O.G.1 aAdewunmi, A.0 tAnnals of tropical medicine and parasitology.g1982 Feb., v. 76, no. 1 p.89-92x0003-49837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830308c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03289naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146072000900155072000900164072000900173100001700182245018700199300001600386500002400402500001500426520140900441650002201850650002401872650002201896650000901918650002601927650001701953650001101970650002401981650002002005650001402025650001402039650001902053650001502072650002002087650002202107650002002129650002202149650002502171650002502196653002502221653002802246653003102274700001602305700001902321700002302340700001802363773011802381852000902499856008602508930003302594945002502627946001102652655001202663IND4431875220221119012423.0100126e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443187522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL001 0aL400 0aL2001 aTokuda, Gaku10aDigestive β-glucosidases from the wood-feeding higher termite, Nasutitermes takasagoensis: Intestinal distribution, molecular characterization, and alteration in sites of expression  ap. 931-937.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aβ-Glucosidase [EC 3.2.1.21] hydrolyzes cellobiose or cello-oligosaccharides into glucose during cellulose digestion in termites. SDS-PAGE and zymogram analyses of the digestive system in the higher termite Nasutitermes takasagoensis revealed that β-glucosidase activity is localized in the salivary glands and midgut as dimeric glycoproteins. Degenerate PCR using primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the salivary β-glucosidase resulted in cDNA fragments of 1.7 kb, encoding 489 amino acids with a sequence similar to glycosyl hydrolase family 1. Moreover, these primers amplified cDNA fragments from the midgut, and the deduced amino acid sequences are 87–91% identical to those of the salivary β-glucosidases. Successful expression of the cDNAs in Escherichia coli implies that these sequences also encode functional β-glucosidases. These results indicate that β-glucosidases that primarily contribute to the digestive process of N. takasagoensis are produced in the midgut. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated the site-specific expression of β-glucosidase mRNAs in the salivary glands and midgut. These results suggest that termites have developed the ability to produce β-glucosidases in the midgut, as is the case for endo-β-1,4-glucanase, in which the site of expression has shifted from the salivary glands of lower termites to the midgut of higher termites. 3asequence analysis 3ainsect biochemistry 3acomplementary DNA 3awood 3asubterranean termites 3aNasutitermes 3amidgut 3atissue distribution 3ainsect genetics 3acellulose 3adigestion 3abeta-glucanase 3aintestines 3asalivary glands 3adigestive enzymes 3agene expression 3amolecular cloning 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0adigestive physiology 0amolecular sequence data 0aNasutitermes takasagoensis1 aMiyagi, Mio1 aMakiya, Hiromi1 aWatanabe, Hirofumi1 aArakawa, Gaku0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2009 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.931-937dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.11.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/02/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03125naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245008900207300001600296500002400312506007600336520187500412506003702287650000902324650001002333650001002343650001502353650001702368650001202385650002802397700002402425700002102449773011502470852000902585856006202594856008302656655001202739IND4459474720221207045027.0110630s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445947472DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.238.7.9152doi7 aPMC41873592pmcid7 a214531812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeBlanc, Nicole L.10aOcular lesions associated with systemic hypertension in dogs: 65 cases (2005–2007)  ap. 915-921.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aObjective—To characterize ocular findings in hypertensive dogs, determine prevalence of hypertension in dogs with ocular disease suggestive of hypertension, and examine possible relationships between degree of hypertension and ocular disease. Design—Retrospective case series. Animals—65 dogs initially referred for blood pressure measurement (n = 22), ophthalmic examination (25), or both (18). Procedures—Medical records were reviewed to identify dogs examined at the teaching hospital that underwent a complete ophthalmic examination and blood pressure measurement within a 24-hour period between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007. Signalment, history, blood pressure measurements, ophthalmic examination findings, and any vasoactive drug treatments were recorded. Ocular lesions considered likely to be associated with systemic hypertension included retinal hemorrhage, retinal detachment, hyphema, tortuous vessels, and subretinal edema. Results—Of the 65 dogs, 42 were hypertensive (systolic blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg) and 23 were normotensive. Sixty-two percent (26/42) of hypertensive dogs had ≥ 1 type of ocular lesion identified. Retinal hemorrhage was the most common ocular lesion in hypertensive dogs (17/42 [40%]). The presence of ≥ 1 type of ocular lesion had moderate sensitivity and specificity of 62% and 61 %, respectively, for identification of hypertension. Fifteen of the 25 (60%) dogs referred for blood pressure measurement after initial ophthalmic examination were found to be hypertensive. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Ocular lesions are common in dogs with systemic hypertension. Dogs with hypertension or diseases associated with hypertension should be monitored carefully for evidence of ocular target organ damage, and hypertension should be systematically ruled out in dogs with characteristic ocular lesions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adogs 3adrugs 3aedema 3ahemorrhage 3ahypertension 3amercury 3asystolic blood pressure1 aStepien, Rebecca L.1 aBentley, Ellison0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 238, no. 7 p.915-921x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.avma.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.238.7.9153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03381naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192072000900201100002500210245008500235300001600320500002400336500001500360520122100375650002401596650002201620650001201642650001701654650002201671650002501693650002201718650001701740650002001757650002501777650002201802650001501824650002001839650002201859650002501881650002001906650002201926650001101948650002401959650001201983650001801995650002802013650003102041650002802072650003502100650003602135653001702171653002802188653001502216653002302231700002902254700002502283700002102308700002402329773011802353852000902471856008602480930003302566945002502599946001102624655001202635IND4431874920221119012435.0100126e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443187492DNAL7 a199313922pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL200 0aL001 0aL821 0aF8511 aTaranushenko, Yuliya10aPeptidase inhibitors from the salivary glands of the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea  ap. 920-930.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInhibitory activity against subtilisin, proteinase K, chymotrypsin and trypsin was detected in the salivary glands and saliva of the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea (Blattoptera: Blaberidae). Fractionation of the salivary glands extract by affinity chromatography followed by reverse-phase HPLC yielded five subtilisin-inhibiting peptides with molecular masses ranging from 5 to 14 kDa. N-terminal sequences and subsequently full-length cDNAs of inhibitors designated NcPIa and NcPIb were obtained. The NcPIa cDNA contains 216 nucleotides and encodes a pre-peptide of 72 amino-acid residues of which 19 make up the signal peptide. The cDNA of NcPIb consists of 240 nucleotides and yields a putative secretory peptide of 80 amino-acid residues. Mature NcPIa (5906.6 Da, 53 residues) and NcPIb (6713.3 Da, 60 residues) are structurally similar (65.4% amino acid overlap) single-domain Kazal-type peptidase inhibitors. NcPIa with Arg in P1 position and typical Kazal motif VCGSD interacted stoichiometrically (1:1) with subtilisin and was slightly less active against proteinase K. NcPIb with Leu in P1 and modified Kazal motif ICGSD had similar activity on subtilisin and no on proteinase K but was active on chymotrypsin. 3aenzyme inactivation 3asequence analysis 3atrypsin 3ainsect pests 3acomplementary DNA 3adigestive physiology 3aNauphoeta cinerea 3achymotrypsin 3ainsect genetics 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme inhibitors 3asubtilisin 3asalivary glands 3ainsect physiology 3anucleotide sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inhibition 3asaliva 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCockroachesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxmetabolism 2aProtease Inhibitorsxmetabolism 0aproteinase K 0amolecular sequence data 0apeptidases 0amolecular genetics1 aVinokurov, Konstantin S.1 aKludkiewicz, Barbara1 aKodrík, Dalibor1 aSehnal, František.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2009 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.920-930dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.11.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/02/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03900naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100002900201245015900230300001600389500002400405500001500429520156300444650002002007650002202027650001402049650002502063650001202088650002002100650002002120650001402140650001802154650002402172650001902196650001802215650002002233650002702253650002202280650002902302650002102331650001602352650002402368650001202392650001802404650002102422650001402443650002302457650001102480650005802491650004302549650002802592650003202620650002102652650003502673653002002708653002202728653001402750653002402764653001202788700001902800700001702819773011802836852000902954856008602963930003303049945002503082946001103107655001203118IND4431874120221119012655.0100126e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443187412DNAL7 a198611642pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL600 0aL200 0aL0031 aGeorgomanolis, Theodoros10aBmCAP, a silkmoth gene encoding multiple protein isoforms characterized by SoHo and SH3 domains: Expression analysis during ovarian follicular development  ap. 892-902.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCAP/ArgBP2/vinexin family proteins, adaptor proteins characterized by three SH3 domains at their C-termini and a SoHo domain towards their N-termini, are known to regulate cell adhesion, cytoskeletal organization, and growth factor signaling. Here we present the isolation and ovarian expression of the BmCAP gene which encodes CAP/ArgBP2/vinexin family proteins in the silkmoth, Bombyx mori. Screening for full-length cDNA clones identified three mRNA isoforms, BmCAP-A1, BmCAP-A2 and BmCAP-B, which show expression throughout ovarian follicular development. Using an antibody raised against a unique region between the SoHo and SH3 domains, BmCAP-A protein isoforms were identified that show specific expression in different compartments of the ovarian follicles. Immunofluorescence staining of the cells of the follicular epithelium establishes a dynamic pattern of BmCAP-A protein localization during choriogenesis. During early choriogenesis, BmCAP-A has a diffuse localization in the cytoplasm but could also be found concentrated at the apical and basal sides at the cell–cell junctions. During late choriogenesis, the diffuse cytoplasmic staining of BmCAP-A disappears while the staining pattern at the apical side resembles a blueprint for the eggshell surface structure. We suggest that BmCAP-A isoforms have important functions during ovarian development, which involve not only the traditional roles in actin organization or cell–cell adhesion but also the regulation of secretion of chorion proteins and the sculpting of the chorion surface. 3aprotein binding 3aovarian follicles 3asilkworms 3acell differentiation 3achorion 3ainsect genetics 3agene expression 3acytoplasm 3achoriogenesis 3aegg shell formation 3avitellogenesis 3amessenger RNA 3ainsect proteins 3afollicular development 3aprotein synthesis 3aphysiological regulation 3aprotein isoforms 3aBombyx mori 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBombyxxgenetics 2aCell Line 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxphysiology 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOvaryxgrowth & development 2aProtein Isoforms 2asrc Homology Domainsxgenetics 0acell physiology 0ainsect physiology 0aoogenesis 0ainsect reproduction 0avinexin1 aIatrou, Kostas1 aSwevers, Luc0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2009 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.892-902dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.10.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/02/23  aNon-US 7aarticle01989naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007000127300001600197520099400213650002301207650001201230650002201242650002501264650002001289650001301309650002201322650001101344650001701355700001901372700001501391700001601406773013901422852000901561930003301570945001301603946001101616655001201627IND2057477620221119013017.0970604e19961001ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205747762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordan, K.N.10aFormation of diacetyl by cell-free extracts of Leuconostoc lactis  ap. 291-297.  aDiacetyl formation was linear with time and with protein concentration when a cell-free extract of Leuconostoc lactis NCW1 was added to a buffer system containing pyruvate, thiamine pyrophosphate and MgSO4 (final concentrations 60 mM, 0.11 mM and 0.22 mM, respectively). No diacetyl was detected in the absence of pyruvate or cell-free extract and no increase in diacetyl formation was detected on the addition of acetyl-CoA. When 2-acetolactate (1.6 mM) was the substrate, autodecarboxylation to diacetyl and acetoin occurred under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. When cell-free extract was added, decarboxylation of 2-acetolactate to acetoin and diacetyl increased 4-6-fold, under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. When the cell-free extract was boiled, diacetyl formation from 2-acetolactate was reduced to the level of autodecarboxylation. The results suggest that diacetyl is formed enzymatically in the presence and absence of oxygen, as well as spontaneously, from 2-acetolactate. 3aLeuconostoc lactis 3aacetoin 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3aanaerobic conditions 3adecarboxylation 3adiacetyl 3amagnesium sulfate 3aoxygen 3apyruvic acid1 aO'Donoghue, M.1 aCondon, S.1 aCogan, T.M.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1996 Oct. 1, v. 143, no. 2/3 p.291-297aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03484naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174072000900183100002400192245015400216300001600370500002400386500001500410520128300425650001801708650002701726650003901753650001601792650002001808650001801828650001301846650002901859650001001888650003401898650001601932650001101948650002301959650001201982650001201994650002702006650003702033650002302070650004102093650004302134650003302177650002202210650001602232650003902248653002202287653001202309653002202321653001502343653002002358653002202378653001502400700002402415700002202439700001902461773011802480852000902598856008602607930003302693945002502726946001102751655001202762IND4431873620221119012714.0100126e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443187362DNAL7 a198793572pmid7 a10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL001 0aL2001 aKoštál, Vladimír10aCell cycle arrest as a hallmark of insect diapause: Changes in gene transcription during diapause induction in the drosophilid fly, Chymomyza costata  ap. 875-883.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe division cycle of CNS cells was arrested in G0/G1 (86.6%) and G2 (12.8%) phases in diapausing larvae of Chymomyza costata. A two-step response was observed when the diapause was induced by transferring the 3rd instar larvae from long-day to short-day conditions: first, the proportion of G2-arrested cells increased rapidly within a single day after transfer; and second, the increase of G0/G1-arrested cells started with a delay of 5 days after transfer. The changes of relative mRNA levels of seven different genes, which code for important cell cycle regulatory factors [Cyclins D and E, kinases Wee1 and Myt1, phosphatase Cdc25 (String), Dacapo (p27), and PCNA] were followed using qRT-PCR technique. Two reference genes (Rp49 and ß-tubulin) served as a background. Significant transcriptional responses to photoperiodic transfer were observed for two genes: while the relative levels of dacapo mRNA increased during the rapid entry into the G2 arrest, the pcna expression was significantly downregulated during the delayed onset of G0/G1 arrest. In addition, moderate transcriptional upregulations of the genes coding for two inhibitory kinases, wee1 and myt1 accompanied the entry into diapause. The other genes were expressed equally in all photoperiodic conditions. 3aDrosophilidae 3acentral nervous system 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3afruit flies 3ainsect genetics 3acell division 3adiapause 3atranscription (genetics) 3agenes 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aphotoperiod 3alarvae 3ainsect development 3acyclins 2aAnimals 2aCell Cyclexphysiology 2aCentral Nervous Systemxcytology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDrosophilidaexcytologyxphysiology. 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLarvaxcytologyxphysiology. 2aLife Cycle Stages 2aPhotoperiod 2aTranscription, Geneticxphysiology 0acell cycle arrest 0akinases 0aChymomyza costata 0ainhibitors 0acell physiology 0ainsect physiology 0acell cycle1 aŠimůnková, Petra1 aKobelková, Alena1 aShimada, Kimio0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g2009 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.875-883dElsevier Sciencex0965-17487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibmb.2009.10.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100323b20100403c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/02/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03989naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002000157245014100177300001800318500002400336520158000360650002101940650002501961650002701986650002502013650002602038650002002064650001302084650001102097650001002108650003702118650001802155650003602173650001302209650002602222650001802248650001102266650001002277650001302287650001302300650002802313650003802341650005102379650005502430650004402485650003802529650002002567650003002587650002502617650007002642650001402712650004202726650003302768650002102801650004202822650005202864650002502916650001702941700001902958700001902977700002002996700001903016700001903035773011403054852000903168856007803177655001203255IND4458133920221119012621.0110520e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445813392DNAL7 a212823222pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq4512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAriizumi, Tohru10aGenetic suppression analysis in novel vacuolar processing enzymes reveals their roles in controlling sugar accumulation in tomato fruits  ap. 2773-2786.  aIncludes references  aIn plant cells, many vacuolar proteins are synthesized as precursors in the endoplasmic reticulum and are subsequently transported to the vacuole. These precursors are subject to post-translational modifications to allow the active mature forms to be produced. Vacuolar processing enzyme (VPE) has been identified as a family of cysteine proteases involved in protein maturation in the vacuole. In this study, novel VPE genes were isolated from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and they were designated SlVPE1-SlVPE5. Phylogenic analysis suggested that SlVPE1 and SlVPE2 were categorized as the seed coat type, SlVPE4 was categorized as the seed type, and both SlVPE3 and SlVPE5 were categorized as the vegetative type. Expression analysis demonstrated that these genes were expressed during fruit development, and that their expression profiles agreed with this classification. High VPE enzyme activity was observed during tomato fruit development; the enzyme activity was correlated with the SlVPE mRNA levels, indicating that the SlVPE encoded active VPE proteins. The total sugar content was higher in RNA interference (RNAi) lines compared with the control plants, suggesting negative roles for SlVPE in sugar accumulation. The quantitative expression analysis of each SlVPE gene in the RNAi lines suggested that the suppression of SlVPE5 probably had the strongest effect on the sugar accumulation observed. The suppression of SlVPE did not influence the total amino acid content, suggesting that the molecular targets of SlVPE were mainly involved in sugar accumulation. 3aRNA interference 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aamino acid composition 3acysteine proteinases 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenzyme activity 3afruiting 3afruits 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3amessenger RNA 3apost-translational modification 3aproteins 3aquantitative analysis 3asugar content 3asugars 3atesta 3atomatoes 3avacuoles 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aCarbohydrate Metabolismxgenetics 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFruitxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGlucuronidasexmetabolism 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aSolanum lycopersicumxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aRNA Interference 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSuppression, Genetic 2aTime Factors1 aHiguchi, Kenji1 aArakaki, Shoko1 aSano, Tsunenori1 aAsamizu, Erika1 aEzura, Hiroshi0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 May, v. 62, no. 8 p.2773-2786dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq4513Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01212naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245008300151300001600234520007300250650002600323650001200349650001100361650003200372650002900404650000900433650000900442650002100451650002600472650004100498650003000539650001700569653003400586700001400620773011900634852000900753939003300762945000800795946001100803655001200814991584351270742620221119012706.0830308s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021532DNAL7 a71014042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoloney, N.A.12aA rapid method for the infection of laboratory mice with Schistosoma japonicum  ap. 200-203.  aSchistosoma japonicum, rapid method for infection of laboratory mice 3aSchistosoma japonicum 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aInjections, Subcutaneous 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred CBA 2aParasitologyxmethods 2aSchistosoma japonicumxpathogenicity 2aSchistosomiasisxetiology 2aTime Factors 0aTechnique, Experimental hosts1 aWebbe, G.0 tTransactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.g1982, v. 76, no. 2 p.200-203x0035-92037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830308c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03108naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245015300186300001600339500002400355520115800379650002501537650004101562650001601603650002101619650001001640650001301650650001401663650002701677650001001704650001201714650003001726650003201756650003701788650003301825650002101858650002701879650003201906650002001938650002701958650001301985650001501998650003102013650003702044650005602081650002602137650003702163650003702200650005002237700001802287700002002305700001602325773010802341852000902449856004802458655001202506IND4448539620221119012649.0110128e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444853962DNAL7 a209247452pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-010-1462-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDadkhodaie, N.

Four F ₃ families were produced from a cross between a line carrying Lr53 and Yr35 (98M71) and the leaf rust and stripe rust susceptible genotype Avocet “S” and were rust tested using Puccinina triticina pathotype 53-1,(6),(7),10,11 and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotype 110 E143 A+. The homozygous resistant lines produced infection types of “;1−” and “;N” to these pathotypes, respectively. The Chi-squared tests indicated goodness-of-fit of the data for one leaf rust gene and one stripe rust gene segregation. Linkage analysis using this population demonstrated recombination of 3% between the genes. Microsatellite markers located on the short arm of chromosome 6B were used to map the genes, with the markers cfd1 and gwm508 being mapped approximately 1.1 and 4.5 cM, respectively, proximal to Lr53. Additional studies of the relationship between Lr36, also located on the short arm of chromosome 6B, and Lr53 indicated that the two genes were independent. 3aPuccinia striiformis 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides 3achromosomes 3agene segregation 3agenes 3agenotype 3aleaf rust 3amicrosatellite repeats 3awheat 2aAlleles 2aBasidiomycotaxphysiology 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aChromosome Segregationxgenetics 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Locixgenetics 2aGenotype 2aHomozygote 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMicrosatellite Repeatsxgenetics 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aRecombination, Geneticxgenetics 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & development. 2aTriticumxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology.1 aKaraoglou, H.1 aWellings, C.

Partial sequences extending from open reading frame 1b through to the heat shock protein homologue were obtained for PMWaV-1, -3 and -5. Phylogenetic analyses of selected regions of these sequences indicated that PMWaV-5 is a distinct species and most closely related to PMWaV-1. The amino acid sequence variation observed in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region of PMWaV-1 isolates was 95.8-98.4% and of PMWaV-3 isolates was 92.2-99.5%. In surveys of mealybug wilt disease (MWD) affected crops, none of the four viruses was clearly associated with the disease at all survey sites. A statistically significant association (P < 0.001) between the presence of PMWaV-2 and symptoms was observed at one survey site (site 3), but the virus was at a low incidence at the remaining three survey sites. By contrast, although PMWaV-1 and -3 were equally distributed between symptomless and MWD-affected plants at site 3, there was a statistically significant (P < 0.001) association between each of these two viruses and MWD at sites 1 and 4. At site 2, there was a statistically significant (P < 0.001) association only between PMWaV-3 and MWD. PMWaV-1 was the most commonly found of the four viruses and conversely PMWaV-5 was only occasionally found. Australian isolates of PMWaV-1, -2 and -3 were transmitted by the mealybug species Dysmicoccus brevipes. 3aheat shock proteins 3asequence diversity 3aopen reading frames 3agenetic variation 3aphylogeny 3asurveys 3aamino acid sequences 3avascular wilt 3aviruses 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3apineapples 3aDysmicoccus brevipes 3aPineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus 1 3acrops 0aPineapple mealybug wilt-associated virus 0amealybug wilt of pineapple 0aAnanas comosus closterovirid1 aSteele, V.1 aGeering, A.D.W.1 aThomas, J.E.0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2008, v. 37, no. 2 p.95-105dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0815-31917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AP070963Available from publisher's Web site  a20081002b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02648naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001900168245016400187300001600351500002400367520131400391650001301705650000901718650002101727650001901748650001701767650001801784650001601802650001501818650002201833650001801855650002801873700002001901700002201921773010301943852000902046856009002055930003302145945002502178946001102203655001202214IND4417295320140725000000.0090306e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441729532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF6001 aPitann, Britta14aThe apoplastic pH and its significance in adaptation to salinity in maize (Zea mays L.): Comparison of fluorescence microscopy and pH-sensitive microelectrodes  ap. 497-504.  aIncludes references  aThe apoplastic ionic milieu contains essential determinants for cell expansion and plant growth. Since pH is a multifunctional basic component of this extracellular space, the knowledge of its behaviour during stress situations is of major importance. In detached leaves of maize (Zea mays L. cvs. Pioneer 3906 and SR 03) the effect of salinity on apoplastic pH was measured to investigate its adaptive role to salt stress applying two different methods: an optical approach using pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC), fluorescein tetramethylrhodamine-dextran (FTMR) and Oregon Green® 488), and an electrophysiological technique, pH-sensitive microelectrodes. Both approaches yielded similar results. In the presence of 100mM NaCl, which was added to the growth medium, apoplastic pH of the salt-sensitive maize genotype Pioneer 3906 leaves increased in maximum by 0.4 units (pH microelectrodes) and by 0.3 units (fluorescent dyes); the salt-resistant SR 03 hardly responded. The same treatment reduced leaf growth by 60% in Pioneer 3906, but only by 40% in SR 03. Since according to acid growth considerations apoplastic pH is an important factor in elongation growth, we suggest that this pH increase is a main cause for reduced leaf growth under salt stress conditions. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aplant adaptation 3asalt tolerance 3aplant growth 3asoil salinity 3asalt stress 3aelectrodes 3aelectrophysiology 3aacidification 3afluorescence microscopy1 aKranz, Thorsten1 aMühling, Karl H.0 tPlant science.g2009 Apr., v. 176, no. 4 p.497-504dElsevier Science Ireland Ltd.x0168-94527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2009.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090415b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/04/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02318naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009300166300001600259520131700275653001401592653003001606653002701636700002001663700002201683700002301705700002201728773011601750852000901866856008501875930003301960946001101993655001202004IND4408523320221119012303.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440852332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-1032-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinod kumar, K. 10aAnalysis of the 2003 Varunawat Landslide, Uttarkashi, India using Earth Observation data  ap. 789-799.  aMass movements such as landslides in mountainous terrains are natural degradation processes and one of the most important landscape-building factors. Varunawat Parbat overlooking Uttarkashi town witnessed a series of landslides on 23 September 2003 and the debris slides and rock falls continued for 2 weeks. This landslide complex was triggered due to the incessant rainfall prior to the event, and its occurrence led to the blockage of the pilgrim route to Gangotri (source of the Ganges river) and evacuation of thousands of people to safer places. Though there was no loss of lives due to timely evacuation, heavy losses to the property were reported. High-resolution stereoscopic earth observation data were acquired after the incidence to study the landslide in detail with emphasis on the cause of the landslide and mode of failure. Areas along the road and below the Varunawat foothill region are mapped for landslide risk. It was found that the foothill region of the Varunawat Parbat was highly disturbed by man-made activities and houses are dangerously located below steep slopes. The potential zones for landslides along with the existing active and old landslides are mapped. These areas are critical and their treatment with priority is required in order to minimise further landslide occurrences. 0aLandslide 0aCause and mode of failure 0aEarth observation data1 aLakhera, R.

The resulting DNA sequence information was compared to previously published tnpR DNA sequences and to previously published restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data, permitting the relationships between DNA sequencing and RFLP approaches to be studied by the use of phylogenetic trees. DNA maximum likelihood and DNA parsimony were used to construct a variety of phylogenetic trees. DNA sequencing confirmed the validity of RFLP analysis and highlighted the importance of restriction endonuclease choice upon the resulting RFLP patterns and dendrogram topology. The tnpR genes of two previously uncharacterised mercury resistant bacteria, T2-7 and T2-12 were also studied. DNA sequence data placed T2-7 in a previously described gene class, tnpR-D and T2-12 in a new gene class, tnpR-F. The significance of this data with respect to the recombination and evolution events occurring within bacterial populations are discussed. 3aDNA 3agenes 3amercury 3ametal tolerance 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3arestriction endonucleases 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asequence analysis 3asoil bacteria 3atopology 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Nucleotidyltransferasesxclassificationxgenetics. 2aDrug Resistance, Microbial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMercuryxpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxmethods 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTransposases1 aStrike, P.1 aBruce, K.D.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1996 Oct. 15, v. 144, no. 1 p.95-102aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01089naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245007000148300001600218520007100234650002500305650001300330650001200343650001300355650003800368650004100406650005100447653005300498700002000551773011900571852000900690939003300699945000800732946001100740655001200751991584349570742620221119012054.0830308s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021572DNAL7 a70486492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwen, D.G.10aSuccessful cryopreservation of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae  ap. 232-233.  aWuchereria bancrofti, successful cryopreservation of microfilariae 3aWuchereria bancrofti 3afreezing 2aAnimals 2aFreezing 2aPreservation, Biologicalxmethods 2aWuchereriaxisolation & purification 2aWuchereria bancroftixisolation & purification 0aTechnique, Specimen preparation and preservation1 aAnantaraman, M.0 tTransactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.g1982, v. 76, no. 2 p.232-233x0035-92037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830308c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03523naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012400166300001600290520189200306650001002198650000902208650001302217650001302230650001102243650002602254650001302280650002102293650001302314650002102327650001902348650001102367650002102378650002502399650002202424650001802446650001502464650001602479650001202495650001002507653003002517653001802547653001902565653003002584653002402614700002602638700001802664700002902682773010802711852000902819856008502828930003302913946001102946655001202957IND4402537620221119012627.0080309e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440253762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00049-007-0385-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeiska, Susanne 10aBark salicylates and condensed tannins reduce vole browsing amongst cultivated dark-leaved willows (Salix myrsinifolia)  ap. 245-253.  aVole feeding amongst herbal willows that have a high concentration of salicylates in their bark and leaves, and may therefore be cultivated for use as raw material for herbal medicine was tested in the field and in laboratory conditions. Eight clones of dark-leaved willow (Salix myrsinifolia Salisb.) were cultivated for two years with six different methods combining three fertilisation levels (none, low and high), black plastic mulch applied for suppressing weed competition and unmulched control. Samples for the laboratory feeding trial were taken from the unfertilised plants during willow winter dormancy and twigs were fed to 16 voles as a multi-choice experiment. The bark area removed was calculated from image analysis of the material left by the voles. The diameter and the bark thickness of the twigs were measured. Concentrations of salicin, salicortin, HCH-salicortin, picein, triandrin, triandrin derivative, gallocatechin, (+)-catechin, luteolin-7-glucoside, hyperin, total condensed tannins and total nitrogen were measured from the twigs fed to voles in the laboratory. Browsing by a natural population of voles amongst winter-dormant willows was measured in the field. In the laboratory, voles browsed on 80% of the twigs and in the field voles browsed on 33% of the twigs. Vole feeding followed similar patterns in the field and in the laboratory experiment; feeding was clearly higher amongst the plants grown in unmulched control compared to those in plastic mulch. The same clones, 1, 2 and 6 were preferred in both experiments. Voles preferred thin twigs to thick ones. Feeding correlated negatively with concentrations of salicylates and tannins. As vole feeding seems to be highly affected by willow cultivation method and plant genotype, careful selection of cultivated clones and cultivation methods can enhance the reliability of herbal willow cultivation. 3aSalix 3abark 3abranches 3abrowsing 3aclones 3acrop-weed competition 3adormancy 3aepigallocatechin 3agenotype 3aherbal medicines 3aimage analysis 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aplastic film mulches 3aproanthocyanidins 3araw materials 3asalicortin 3asalicylates 3atannins 3avoles 0aHerbal willow cultivation 0aplastic mulch 0abark phenolics 0aSalix myrsinifolia Salisb 0aMicrotus agrestis L1 aTikkanen, Olli-Pekka 1 aRousi, Matti 1 aJulkunen-Tiitto, Riitta 0 tChemoecology.g2007 Sept., v. 17, no. 4 p.245-253dBasel : SP Birkhäuser Verlag Baselx0937-74097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-007-0385-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080309b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01974naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245007000163300001800233520091400251650001401165650001101179650001201190650001101202650001501213650001501228700001601243700002201259700002101281700002501302700002101327773012601348852000901474856008301483939003301566946001301599655001201612IND4458425220221119012640.0110527e20110527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445842522DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11964042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTéglás, Ernő10aPure Reasoning in 12-Month-Old Infants as Probabilistic Inference  ap. 1054-1059.  aMany organisms can predict future events from the statistics of past experience, but humans also excel at making predictions by pure reasoning: integrating multiple sources of information, guided by abstract knowledge, to form rational expectations about novel situations, never directly experienced. Here, we show that this reasoning is surprisingly rich, powerful, and coherent even in preverbal infants. When 12-month-old infants view complex displays of multiple moving objects, they form time-varying expectations about future events that are a systematic and rational function of several stimulus variables. Infants' looking times are consistent with a Bayesian ideal observer embodying abstract principles of object motion. The model explains infants' statistical expectations and classic qualitative findings about object cognition in younger babies, not originally viewed as probabilistic inferences. 3acognition 3ahumans 3ainfants 3amodels 3aprediction 3astatistics1 aVul, Edward1 aGirotto, Vittorio1 aGonzalez, Michel1 aTenenbaum, Joshua B.1 aBonatti, Luca L.0 tScience.g2011 May 27, v. 332, no. 6033 p.1054-1059dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11964043Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110527  aOther US 7aarticle03246naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001500165245013800180300001600318500001500334520125700349650001801606650003301624650001401657650002201671650002001693650001601713650002801729650002301757650002001780650002301800650004301823650004601866650003401912650002301946650006501969650003702034650004602071650002802117650003902145650005002184653004302234653002902277653002802306653002602334700002802360700001402388773011202402852000902514856008602523930003302609945001302642946001302655655001202668IND2330050420221119012648.0021212e200207  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233005042DNAL7 a121188792pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.7.6372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarois, E.14aThe Xanthomonas type III effector protein AvrBs3 modulates plant gene expression and induces cell hypertrophy in the susceptible host  ap. 637-646.  a2019-12-04  aXanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria bacteria expressing the type III effector protein AvrBs3 induce a hypersensitive response in pepper plants carrying the resistance gene Bs3. Here, we report that infection of susceptible pepper and tomato plants leads to an AvrBs3-dependent hypertrophy of the mesophyll tissue. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of the avrBs3 gene in tobacco and potato plants resulted in a similar phenotype. Induction of hypertrophy was shown to depend on the repeat region, nuclear localization signals, and acidic transcription activation domain (AAD) of AvrBs3, suggesting that the effector modulates the host's transcriptome. To search for host genes regulated by AvrBs3 in an AAD-dependent manner, we performed a cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis of pepper mRNA populations. Thirteen AvrBs3-induced transcripts were identified and confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis revealed homologies to auxin-induced and expansinlike genes, which playa role in cell enlargement. These results suggest that some of the AvrBs3-induced genes may be involved in hypertrophy development and that xanthomonads possess type III effectors that steer host gene expression. 3amessenger RNA 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aphenotype 3acomplementary DNA 3aCapsicum annuum 3ahost plants 3aXanthomonas vesicatoria 3adefense mechanisms 3agene expression 3abacterial proteins 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aCapsicumxcytologyxgenetics. 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxpharmacology 2aSolanum lycopersicumxcytologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aXanthomonas campestrisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aXanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria 0ahypersensitive responses 0amolecular sequence data 0abiological resistance1 aAckerveken, G. van den.1 aBonas, U.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2002 July, v. 15, no. 7 p.637-646wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.7.6373Available from publisher's Web site  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02753naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245005800169300001600227520154600243650000801789650002401797650001801821650002201839650001501861650000901876650003701885650002701922650002401949650001301973651001601986653002802002653001502030700001702045700002002062773011602082852000902198856009202207930003302299946001102332655001202343IND4406442620221119012656.0080606e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440644262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00168.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, H.C.10aReduced MHC variation in a threatened tuatara species  ap. 206-214.  aThe relationship between neutral and adaptive genetic diversity is important to understand in assessing the implications of a population bottleneck. Fitness-related genes, such as those of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), may be influenced by selection, and so retain diversity even when it is lost at neutral markers. We measured MHC class I variation in an archaic reptile species Sphenodon guntheri [North Brother Island (NBI) tuatara], which naturally occurs on one 4 ha island in Cook Strait, New Zealand, and has low levels of microsatellite diversity. MHC variation in S. guntheri was compared with microsatellite DNA variation, and with MHC variation in a large population of Sphenodon punctatus (Cook Strait tuatara) on Stephens Island. The NBI population shows significantly decreased levels of genetic diversity compared with the Stephens Island population. Only three different MHC sequences and three genotypes were found on NBI, compared with 15 sequences and 21 genotypes in a similar sample size from Stephens Island. Two sequences appear to be unique to the NBI population. The assortment of sequence variants into genotypes suggests strong gametic disequilibrium between two MHC class I loci in S. guntheri, and only two haplotypes that were present in Hardy-Weinberg proportions were identified. MHC diversity in NBI tuatara appears to be largely influenced by genetic drift, consistent with a recent population bottleneck. This may compromise the ability of this population to respond to novel disease threats. 3aDNA 3aSphenodon punctatus 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation dynamics 3areptiles 3aNew Zealand 0aBrothers Island tuatara 0abottleneck1 aMiller, K.A.1 aDaugherty, C.H.0 tAnimal conservation.g2008 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.206-214dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1367-94307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00168.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01163naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245003900151300001600190520008200206650001000288650001300298650001200311650001000323650002400333650001700357650004100374650001100415650002400426650003700450650000900487650004600496653002200542653002100564773011900585852000900704939003300713945000800746946001100754655001200765991584347200742620221119012531.0830307s1982    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021472DNAL7 a68087182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBradley, D.J.10aHost genetics and tropical disease  ap. 155-156.  ahost genetics and tropical diseases, brief review and conclusion to symposium 3ahosts 3agenetics 2aAnimals 2aChild 2aGenes, MHC Class II 2aHLA Antigens 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class II 2aHumans 2aLeprosyximmunology 2aMajor Histocompatibility Complex 2aMice 2aParasitic Diseasesxgeneticsximmunology. 0atropical diseases 0aResistance, Host0 tTransactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.g1982, v. 76, no. 2 p.155-156x0035-92037nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830307c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03722naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001400165245012400179300001600303500001500319520148700334650001101821650001801832650002201850650001401872650002301886650001701909650002501926650002001951650002501971650001201996650002102008650003102029650001102060650001402071650004602085650002402131650001802155650003802173650002302211650001602234650002302250650004402273650003802317650001702355650002802372650004402400650004302444650003402487650005202521650005002573650002302623650003402646650002702680653002802707653001002735700001302745773011202758852000902870856008602879930003302965945001302998946001303011655001203024IND2329282720221119012748.0021010e200203  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232928272DNAL7 a119521232pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.3.2092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, H.B.10aDifferential expression patterns of an acidic chitinase and a basic chitinase in the root nodule of Elaeagnus umbellata  ap. 209-215.  a2019-12-04  aTwo cDNA clones encoding chitinase were isolated from a root nodule cDNA library of Elaeagnus umbellata by the hybridization-competition method. The two clones, EuNOD-CHT1 and EuNOD-CHT2, encode for 335 and 317 amino acid residues with the molecular mass of mature proteins being 33.3 and 31.1 kDa, respectively. The two chitinases showed similar protein structures consisting of four domains: hydrophobic signal peptide domain, cysteine-rich chitin-binding domain, hinge domain, and catalytic domain. The EuNOD-CHT1 gene showed similar expression levels in root nodules and leaves, with no detection of transcripts in the roots. The EuNOD-CHT2 gene was expressed at similarly high levels in the roots and root nodules, but at a very low level in the leaves. In situ hybridization showed that EuNOD-CHT1 transcripts were strongly detected in the meristem zone, but weakly detected in the outer cortex layer of the root nodule and in the uninfected cells of the fixation zone. On the other hand, EuNOD-CHT2 transcripts were strongly detected in the infected cells of the fixation zone and central vascular system, but weakly detected in the senescence zone. Our results suggest that the two chitinases may play different biological roles in the root nodule. EuNOD-CHT2 may be involved in a defense response against internal symbionts, external pathogens, or both, while EuNOD-CHT1 may be involved in normal plant development as well as in a defensive role against external pathogens. 3acortex 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3asymbiosis 3adefense mechanisms 3aroot nodules 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aFrankia 3amolecular weight 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aleaves 3achitinase 2aActinomycetalesxisolation & purification 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aChitinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Library 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlantsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aRosaceaexenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0aroots1 aAn, C.S.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2002 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.209-215wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.3.2093Available from publisher's Web site  a20030101b20030107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02094naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245011900161300001800280520105600298650001701354650002501371653002501396653001901421653001701440700001701457700001901474700001901493773011801512852000901630856008501639930003301724946001101757655001201768IND4400982520221119012230.0080203e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440098252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-007-0780-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yibo 10aErosion rates evaluated by the ¹³⁷Cs technique in the high altitude area of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau of China  ap. 1743-1749.  aStudying spatial and temporal variation of soil loss is of great importance because of global environmental concerns. Understanding the spatial distribution of soil erosion and deposition in the high-cold steppe is important for designing soil and water conservation measures. Measured ¹³⁷Cs losses (Bq m-²) from long-term high altitude (4,000 m above sea level) watershed plots on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and derived soil erosion estimates (Mg ha-¹ year-¹) were significantly correlated to directly measured soil losses from the same plots, over the same period (1963-2005). The local reference inventory was estimated to be 2,468 Bq m-². The result of analyzing ¹³⁷Cs distribution and its intensity in the soil profiles in this area shows similarities to ¹³⁷Cs distribution in other areas. ¹³⁷Cs is basically distributed in the topsoil layer of 0-0.3 m. Soil erosions vary greatly in the entire sampled area, ranging from 5.5 to 23 Mg ha-¹ year-¹, with an average of 16.5 Mg ha-¹ year-¹ which is a moderate rate of erosion. 3asoil erosion 3aspatial distribution 0aThe ¹³⁷Cs method 0aSurface runoff 0aRadionuclide1 aWang, Genxu 1 aHu, Hongchang 1 aCheng, Huiyan 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2008 Feb., v. 53, no. 8 p.1743-1749dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-007-0780-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20080205b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02163naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007300164300001800237520094300255650001601198650001601214650002101230650002401251650001101275650001301286650000901299650002501308650002001333651001001353653002201363653002601385653001701411700002001428700001801448700001601466773012101482852000901603856008501612930003301697946001101730655001201741IND4409947620221119012357.0080905e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440994762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-007-9232-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDabral, P.

In the present study, monthly stochastic model was developed using rainfall data for Doimukh (Itanagar), Arunachal Pradesh, India. The rainfall series was assumed to be composed of deterministic and stochastic components. The trend component was found to be non-significant. Fourier series analysis was used to identify the periodic component. Three harmonics were found significant. The stochastic component was modeled by fitting into auto regressive model of order 6. The Mean and standard deviation of the generated series were found to be close to the historical values. The value of absolute error, relative error, correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient indicated a high degree of model fitness to the observed data series. 3acorrelation 3ahumid zones 3ahydrologic cycle 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3aplanning 3arain 3astochastic processes 3awater resources 3aIndia 0aStochastic models 0aAutoregressive models 0aHumid region1 aPandey, Ashish 1 aBaithuri, N. 1 aMal, B.

The nucleotide sequence of alsD encodes a putative protein of 239 amino acids showing significant similarity with other bacterial alpha-acetolactate decarboxylases. Upstream from alsD lies an open reading frame (alsS) which is highly similar to bacterial genes coding for catabolic alpha-acetolactate syntheses. Northern (RNA) blotting analyses indicated the presence of a 2.4-kb dicistronic transcript of alsS and alsD. This suggests that the alsS and alsD genes are organized in a single operon. 3aOenococcus oeni 3aRNA 3aamino acids 3agenomic libraries 3aopen reading frames 3aoperon 3ascreening 3asequence analysis 2aAcetolactate Synthasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCarboxy-Lyasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aLactatesxmetabolism 2aLeuconostocxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aRNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid1 aMonnet, C.1 aMartineau, B.1 aGuzzo, J.1 aCavin, J.F.1 aDivies, C.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1996 Dec. 15, v. 145, no. 3 p.445-450aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02547naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245015600143300001600299520090800315650000801223650002401231650002301255650001401278650001601292650001001308650002501318650003001343650003701373650001801410650002401428650001801452650002301470650002601493650003701519650002301556650002901579650003901608650002201647650001601669650002801685650003001713650003901743700001601782700001501798773013801813852000901951930003301960945001301993946001102006655001202017IND2056940020221119012954.0970507e19961215ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205694002DNAL7 a89780932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFekete, C.10aAssignment of a PCR-amplified chitinase sequence cloned from Trichoderma hamatum to resolved chromosomes of potential biocontrol species of Trichoderma  ap. 385-391.  aA 1424 bp DNA sequence containing the genetic determinants of the chitinase enzyme was identified in Trichoderma hamatum by PCR amplification.

Chromosome-sized DNAs of five potential biocontrol species of Trichoderma were separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The total number of chromosomes was six in all the species, with sizes ranging from 3.7 to 7.7 Mb; estimated genome sizes were between 30.5 and 35.8 Mb. When fractionated chromosomes of the five species were probed with radiolabelled Th-ch, strong hybridization signals developed in all cases, but the physical position of these signals varied among species indicating a polymorphic chromosomal location of the highly conserved 42 kDa chitinase gene within the genus Trichoderma. 3aDNA 3aTrichoderma hamatum 3abiological control 3achitinase 3achromosomes 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3aradiolabeling 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aChitinasesxgenetics. 2aChromosomes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field 2aIntronsxgenetics 2aKaryotyping 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aTrichodermaxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aWeszely, T.1 aHornok, L.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1996 Dec. 15, v. 145, no. 3 p.385-391aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02610naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002400128245014200152300001600294520080600310650002901116650001601145650001301161650002101174650001601195650001601211650002401227650002201251650002601273650002601299650004401325650003201369650003601401650001801437650004601455650004601501650002801547650003201575650005301607650003801660650002801698650003601726650001701762700002201779700001801801700001501819700001801834773013801852852000901990930003301999945001302032946001102045655001202056IND2056940320221119012934.0970507e19961215ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205694032DNAL7 a89780942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaart, J.M. van der14aThe beta-1,6-glucan containing side-chain of cell wall proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is bound to the glycan core of the GPI moiety  ap. 401-407.  aCell wall proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are anchored by means of a beta-1,6-glucan-containing side-chain. It is not known whether this chain is linked to the protein part (e.g. through carbohydrate side-chains) or to the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety of cell wall proteins. An IgA protease recognition site was introduced in Cwp2p, a beta-1,6-glucosylated cell wall protein, immediately N-terminal from the omega amino acid (the attachment site of the GPI moiety). Proteolytic cleavage of this site revealed that the beta-1,6-glucan epitope was not linked to the protein part. We conclude that neither N- or O-glycosylation is involved in beta-glucosylation of cell wall proteins. This confirms that the glycan core of the GPI moiety is the probable beta-1,6-glucan attachment site. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acids 3aepitopes 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3astructural proteins 2aBlotting, Western 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCell Wallxenzymology 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Reporterxphysiology 2aGlucansxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGlycosylation 2aGlycosylphosphatidylinositolsxmetabolism 2aMembrane Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexchemistryxenzymology. 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxmetabolism 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aalpha-Galactosidasexmetabolism 2abeta-Glucans1 aBiesebeke, R. te.1 aChapman, J.W.1 aKlis, F.M.1 aVerrips, C.T.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1996 Dec. 15, v. 145, no. 3 p.401-407aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03622naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001500165245014700180300001600327500001500343520138700358650002501745650001401770650001301784650002101797650002501818650002001843650001501863650002401878650002101902650001101923650006001934650005801994650004902052650003602101650006002137650004502197650001302242650004002255650005302295650004202348650005302390650004002443650003402483650004902517650002802566650002402594653001802618653002502636653002702661700001502688700001502703773011202718852000902830856008602839930003302925945001302958946001302971655001202984IND2329091520221119012920.0020927e200206  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232909152DNAL7 a120591002pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.6.5222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamu, S.K.10aNod factor induction of reactive oxygen species production is correlated with expression of the early nodulin gene rip1 in Medicago truncatula  ap. 522-528.  a2019-12-04  aPlant genes that are specifically activated by the rhizobial lipochitooligosaccharide signal molecule (Nod factor) in legume hosts are collectively referred to as nodulins. Although nodulin gene expression is both spatially and temporally correlated with symbiosis, the function of these genes and the molecular events underlying their expression remain unknown. Sequence analysis of rip1, an early nodulin gene encoding a putative peroxidase protein, revealed the existence of sequence motifs with homology to reactive oxygen species (ROS) responsive cis elements. Here we report that recognition of compatible Nod factor rapidly stimulates a spatially localized production of reactive oxygen species in legume roots. Sinorhizobium meliloti mutants that produce an altered Nod factor structure and a nonnodulating plant mutant, dmi1-1, that is implicated in Nod factor signal transduction are equally impaired in the ability to elicit ROS production and rip1 expression. Interestingly, both rip1 transcription and ROS production exhibit the same tissue-specific pattern of localization. Moreover, exogenous hydrogen peroxide is sufficient to activate rip1 transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that ROS production is a consequence of specific Nod factor perception and implicate H2O2 produced during this response as a mediator of Nod factor-induced rip1 expression. 3aregulatory sequences 3asymbiosis 3anodulins 3aEnsifer meliloti 3abiochemical pathways 3agene expression 3anodulation 3aMedicago truncatula 3aoligosaccharides 3aoxygen 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aLipopolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aMedicagoxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aMembrane Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation 2aNitroblue Tetrazoliumxpharmacology 2aPeroxidasesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxgenetics 2aSinorhizobium melilotixgrowth & development 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 0acompatibility 0anucleotide sequences 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aPeng, H.M.1 aCook, D.R.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2002 June, v. 15, no. 6 p.522-528wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.6.5223Available from publisher's Web site  a20021201b20021209c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02920naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002200193245015200215300001600367520182700383650001602210650001202226650001702238653000902255653002102264700001802285700001602303773013402319852000902453856007602462930003302538946001102571655001202582IND4386911120221119012615.0070116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438691112DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03267.x2doi7 aPMC18104812pmcid7 a172239732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe L.

They participate actively in homeostatic maintenance of the extracellular matrix, epithelial barrier function, repair mechanisms and leucocyte migration. In inflammation, they become activated, change matrix expression and synthesize proinflammatory mediators. Subpopulations of mucosal fibroblasts express CD40 and the aim of this study was to define its role in their proinflammatory function. Stable primary fibroblast lines derived from normal mouse colon and inflamed colon from CD4⁺ CD45RBhigh-transplanted SCID mice were used as models to explore the role of mucosal fibroblast CD40 in the inflammatory process. Phenotype correlated with in situ fibroblast phenotype in the tissues of origin. Lines from both sources co-expressed CD40 and Thy1·2 independently of α-smooth muscle actin. A subpopulation of CD40⁺ fibroblasts from normal colon expressed CD40 at high levels and expression was enhanced by interferon (IFN)-γ treatment, whereas all CD40⁺ fibroblasts from colitis expressed at low levels and expression was unaffected by IFN-γ treatment. Despite lower-level expression of CD40 by cells from colitis, they secreted constitutively interleukin (IL)-6 and C-C chemokine (CCL)2. Ligation of CD40 enhanced secretion of these mediators and induced secretion of CCL3. CD40 in cells from colitis was more responsive to ligation than CD40 on cells from normal tissue and this sensitivity was amplified selectively by the action of IFN-γ. We conclude that the inflammatory milieu in colitis induces long-lasting changes in phenotype and proinflammatory function in colonic fibroblasts. In particular, proinflammatory signalling from fibroblast CD40 is amplified synergistically by the Th1 effector T cell cytokine, IFN-γ. 3afibroblasts 3acolitis 3ainflammation 0aCD40 0ainterferon gamma1 aWhiting, C.V.1 aBland, P.W.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Feb., v. 147, no. 2 p.313-323dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03267.x3electronic resource  a20070116b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03250naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001200145245017100157300001600328500002400344520195000368650001202318650001302330650002102343650001402364650001902378650002002397650002102417650000902438650001302447650001702460651001902477651001302496700001602509700001702525700001402542700001602556700001602572700001602588773011802604852000902722856008502731655001202816IND4459463820221119011940.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445946382DNAL7 a10.1017/S002185961000078X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSip, V.10aEvidence of selective changes in winter wheat in middle-European environments reflected by allelic diversity at loci affecting plant height and photoperiodic response  ap. 313-326.  aIncludes references  aGenes for adaptation to climatic conditions can have an impact on the expression of genes for agricultural productivity. This study tested the hypothesis that winter wheat cultivars registered in middle Europe (especially the Czech and Slovak Republics) during the period 1976–2009 were differentially adapted to different regions, reflecting selection for different allelic combinations. This was tested by analysing for the presence of alleles at the Rht and Ppd loci using molecular markers and gibberellic acids (GA) response tests. Four allelic variants (174, 192, 165 and 198-bp) were detected at the Xgwm261 locus linked to Rht8 on chromosome 2D. The 198-bp allele was rare, but present in some of the most widely grown cultivars. Of 85 cultivars grown in the area of Czech Republic, the 174-bp allele predominated in frequency and area (39 cultivars), often in combination with Ppd-D1b (30 out of 39 cultivars) and Rht-D1b (15 out of 30 cultivars). In neighbouring Slovakia, the 192-bp allele, generally associated with Ppd-D1a, was detected in 30 out of 40 cultivars; in 12 cultivars accompanied by a GA-insensitive allele on 4B chromosome (pedigree analyses indicated a high prevalence of the Rht-B1d allele). The 192-bp (Rht8)/Ppd-D1a linkage block was broken up in 7 out of 22 cultivars that carried the 192-bp allele in the ‘Czech collection’. Analysis of the effects of year of registration on allele frequency showed a decline in GA-insensitive cultivars released recently in both countries, and great changes in the frequency of the 2D alleles during the period 1981–2009 in the Czech Republic. The pedigrees of successful cultivars were examined to find probable sources of Xgwm261 192-bp, 174-bp and 165-bp alleles on 2D and Rht genes located on chromosomes 4B and 4D. These results will impact on breeding strategies and the exploitation of existing registered wheat cultivars in different regions and growing systems. 3aalleles 3abreeding 3aclimatic factors 3acultivars 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3agibberellic acid 3aloci 3apedigree 3awinter wheat 3aCzech Republic 3aSlovakia1 aChrpova, J.1 aZofajova, A.1 aMilec, Z.1 aMihalik, D.1 aPankova, K.1 aSnape, J.W.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2011 June, v. 149, no. 3 p.313-326dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S002185961000078X3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03005naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001400193245013400207300001600341520180800357650001302165650001102178653002202189653000902211653000702220700001402227700001902241700001702260700001702277700001802294700001602312700001602328773013402344852000902478856007602487930003302563946001102596655001202607IND4387458320221119012048.0070204e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438745832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03307.x2doi7 aPMC18104852pmcid7 a173028962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, C.10aActivated T cell subsets in human type 1 diabetes: evidence for expansion of the DR⁺ CD30⁺ subpopulation in new-onset disease  ap. 472-482.  aAn important limitation in T cell studies of human autoimmune (type 1) diabetes is lack of direct access to cells infiltrating the pancreas. We hypothesized that cells recently released from the pancreas into the blood might express a characteristic combination of markers of activation. We therefore examined the recently activated circulating T cell population [CD3⁺, human leucocyte antigen D-related (HLA-DR⁺)] using cytokine production and 10 additional subset markers [CD69, CD25, CD122, CD30, CD44v6, CD57, CD71, CCR3 (CD193), CCR5 (CD195) or CXCR3 (CD183)], comparing newly diagnosed adult (ND) (age 18-40 years) patients (n = 19) to patients with diabetes for > 10 years [long-standing (LS), n = 19] and HLA-matched controls (C, n = 16). CD3⁺ DR⁺ cells were enriched by two-step immunomagnetic separation. No differences in basal or stimulated production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-13 or interferon (IFN)-γ by CD3⁺ DR⁺ enriched cells were observed between the different groups of subjects. However, among the CD3⁺ DR⁺ population, significant expansions appeared to be present in the very small CD30⁺, CD69⁺ and CD122⁺ subpopulations. A confirmatory study was then performed using new subjects (ND = 26, LS = 15), three-colour flow cytometry, unseparated cells and three additional subset markers (CD38, CD134, CD4/CD25). This confirmed the expansion of the CD3⁺ DR⁺ CD30⁺ subpopulation in ND subjects. We conclude that a relative expansion in the T cell subpopulation with the activated phenotype CD3⁺ DR⁺ CD30⁺ is seen in the peripheral blood of subjects with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. This subpopulation represents less than 0·7% of circulating T cells and may provide a rich source of disease-specific T cells that can be isolated from blood. 3adiabetes 3ahumans 0aactivated T cells 0aCD30 0aDR1 aChang, L.1 aElsegood, K.A.1 aBishop, A.J.1 aGannon, D.H.1 aNarendran, P.1 aLeech, N.J.1 aDayan, C.M.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Mar., v. 147, no. 3 p.472-482dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2006.03307.x3electronic resource  a20070204b20070303c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04293naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245013000170300001600300500002400316520273300340650001103073650002903084650001603113650001403129650002103143650001203164650002603176650001903202650001403221650001603235650001503251650001303266650001103279650001603290650002103306650002503327650001903352650002503371650002103396650002503417650001703442651001903459700001903478700001603497700002003513700001803533773011803551852000903669856008503678655001203763IND4459460120221119012143.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445946012DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596100007302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAravinda Kumar, B.N.10aRelationships between carbon isotope discrimination and grain yield in winter wheat under well-watered and drought conditions  ap. 257-272.  aIncludes references  aThe association of carbon isotope discrimination of grain (Δ13C) with yield performance under rain-fed and well-watered conditions was analysed using a doubled-haploid (DH) winter wheat population, derived from the cross between cvars Beaver×Soissons, within field experiments at two site-seasons. The aim of this work was to quantify associations between Δ13C and yield responses to drought and to test effects of major genes (the semi-dwarf genes, Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b, an awn suppressor gene, B1 and the 1BL.1RS wheat–rye chromosome translocation) segregating in the population for associations with Δ13C and drought performance. Carbon isotope discrimination, through its negative relationship with transpiration efficiency, may be used as a surrogate for this trait. Grain Δ13C was positively associated with grain yield under both irrigated and unirrigated conditions in each site-season and, overall, explained 0·34 of the phenotypic variation in grain yield amongst DH lines under drought and 0·14 under well-watered conditions. There was a positive association between specific leaf lamina N content (SLN) at anthesis and Δ13C under drought amongst DH lines in one site-season, suggesting higher SLN may confer increased stomatal conductance via higher photosynthetic capacity, hence increased grain Δ13C. Overall the Rht-D1b (semi-dwarf) lines had slightly higher Δ13C of grain (20·0‰) than the Rht-B1a/Rht-D1a (tall) group of lines (19·8‰). There were no significant differences between the Rht-B1b (semi-dwarf) or the Rht-B1b/Rht-D1b (dwarf) lines and the tall lines. Comparing their performance under irrigated and unirrigated conditions, the Rht groups of lines (Rht-B1b semi-dwarf, Rht-D1b semidwarf and dwarf and tall groups) responded no differently to drought for Δ13C. The Rht-D1b semi-dwarf lines had higher grain yield (9·50 t/ha) than the tall lines (8·76 t/ha), while the yield of the Rht-B1b semi-dwarf and dwarf lines did not differ significantly from the tall lines. In each site-season, the presence of the 1BL.1RS chromosome increased grain Δ13C (P<0·001), with an overall increase from 19·7‰ in the 1B lines to 20·0‰ in the 1BL.1RS lines (P<0·001). However, the 1BL.1RS and 1B lines responded similarly to drought. The effect of the presence/absence of awns on grain Δ13C was not statistically significant in either site-season. Overall, the present results show that Rht-D1b confers higher Δ13C and grain yield, and the 1BL.1RS translocation confers higher Δ13C. This implies that modern UK wheat cultivars may have lower water-use efficiency during the grain filling period than their predecessors, and therefore may require more water to fulfil their yield potential. 3acarbon 3achromosome translocation 3achromosomes 3acultivars 3adoubled haploids 3adrought 3afield experimentation 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3airrigation 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3amajor genes 3anitrogen content 3aphenotypic variation 3aphotosynthesis 3astomatal conductance 3asuppressor genes 3awater use efficiency 3awinter wheat 3aUnited Kingdom1 aAzam-Ali, S.N.1 aSnape, J.W.1 aWeightman, R.M.1 aFoulkes, M.J.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2011 June, v. 149, no. 3 p.257-272dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596100007303Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01841naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245007700132300001600209500002400225520086800249650001501117650001801132650000901150650001201159650001701171650001101188650001101199650001601210650001101226650001401237650001401251650001601265650001501281700002301296700002001319700002101339773008601360852000901446655001201455IND4459460220221119012704.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445946022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrancko, David A.12aA Topical Spray to Enhance Plant Resistance to Cold Injury and Mortality  ap. 109-118.  aIncludes references  aA novel topical spray was developed to increase resistance to both cold damage and cold mortality in plant foliage, flowers, and fruits.

The service-learning project enabled students to meet course learning objectives of understanding and becoming experienced in horticultural techniques, such as grafting, and to meet university learning objectives of developing critical thinking and communication skills and increasing community involvement. 3acase studies 3acollege students 3acommunication skills 3acommunity service 3afruit growing 3agrowers 3ahigh school students 3alearning 3ateachers 3aCalifornia0 tHortTechnology.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.119-125wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001800136245016600154300001600320500002400336520108700360650002901447650001101476650000901487650002101496650001301517650002601530700002001556773008901576852000901665856003901674655001201713IND4394663820221119012554.0070902e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439466382DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.15072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishida, Yuri13aAn experimental system for the study of mutations in the HMR locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the insertion of Ty into HMRa vs. the conversion of HMRa to HMRα  ap. 723-730.  aIncludes references  aA cross between a sir4-11 strain (sir4-11 HMLα MATα HMRa, non-mating type) and an a-mating strain (SIR⁺ HMLα MATa HMRa) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae forms diploid clones at a frequency of 5 x 10⁻⁶, but the obtained diploid clones often (>70%) have altered forms of the HMRa-containing restriction fragment, designated @ HMRa'. We previously found that some HMRa's are associated with the conversion of HMRa to HMRα. In this report, we present evidence that another @ HMRa' associates with the insertion of Ty into Ya of HMR. We also found that the sir4-11 strain increased mating frequency by UV irradiation to a level of 9 x 10⁻⁴, and that generation of HMRa' was completely prevented by disruption of RAD52 of the sir4-11 strain. Hence, we conclude that the mutations that cause generation of HMRa' occur in the sir4-11 strain prior to mating. Due to these mutations, the sir4-11 strain converts to α-mating type and readily mates with the a-mating strain. We discuss the usefulness of the sir4-11 strain for the study of mutations in the HMR locus of S. cerevisiae. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aclones 3aloci 3amating frequency 3amutation 3aultraviolet radiation1 aOno, Bun-ichiro0 tYeast.g2007 Sept., v. 24, no. 9 p.723-730dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0749-503X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.1507 7aarticle02408naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001300193245008300206300001600289520130800305650001501613650001601628653000801644653001501652653001101667700001601678700001301694700001701707700001601724700001501740773013401755852000901889856009201898930003301990946001102023655001202034IND4392223320221119011926.0070610e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439222332DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03376.x2doi7 aPMC19420242pmcid7 a174030592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, L.10aInhibition of human neutrophil degranulation by transforming growth factor-β1  ap. 155-161.  aNeutrophils enter tissues including the uterus and are found in the endometrium in increased numbers prior to menses. In this environment, they are exposed to transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 produced by endometrial stromal and epithelial cells. We observed that incubation of neutrophils in vitro with TGF-β1 at 1 pg/ml significantly reduced their secretion of lactoferrin in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This effect was achieved with as little as 15 min of pretreatment with TGF-β1. Inhibition of lactoferrin release by TGF-β1 was observed irrespective of whether neutrophils were stimulated by ligands for Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, TLR-4 or FPR, the G protein-coupled receptor for formylated peptides. Inhibition by TGF-β1 was negated by SB-431542, a small molecule inhibitor that specifically blocks the kinase activity of the type I TGF-β receptor (ALK5) In contrast to lactoferrin release, another important neutrophil function, interleukin (IL)-8 driven chemotaxis, was not affected by TGF-β1 at 1 pg/ml or 100 pg/ml. We conclude that in tissues of the female reproductive tract, TGF-β1 inhibition of neutrophil degranulation may prevent these cells from initiating an inflammatory response or releasing degradative enzymes that could potentially damage the oocyte or fetus. 3achemotaxis 3alactoferrin 0aLPS 0aneutrophil 0aTGF-β1 aSmith, J.M.1 aShen, Z.1 aEriksson, M.1 aSentman, C.1 aWira, C.R.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 July, v. 149, no. 1 p.155-161dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03376.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070610b20070702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01889naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009700126300001400223500002400237520104100261650002501302650001401327650001501341650001601356650001701372650002601389650001701415700001501432700001801447700001701465773008401482852000901566655001201575IND4459458520221119012528.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445945852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Lijuan10aUrea Ammonium Nitrate Additive and Raking Improved Mesotrione Efficacy on Creeping Bentgrass  ap. 41-45.  aIncludes references  aSelective control of creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) is desirable when it has escaped into other turfgrasses. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence on creeping bentgrass control from adding urea ammonium nitrate (UAN) to mesotrione plus non-ionic surfactant (NIS) spray solution, and raking to remove dead tissues of creeping bentgrass. A 2-year field study was conducted with a split-plot design, where raking was the whole plot treatment and herbicide was the sub-plot treatment. Herbicide treatments included application of mesotrione at 56 and 70 g·ha–1 singly and sequentially with 0.25% (v/v) NIS or 0.25% (v/v) NIS plus 2.5% (v/v) UAN solution. Sequential applications were made three times on a 2-week interval. Removing the dead clippings by raking improved the creeping bentgrass control from 60% to 73% averaged over rates, timings, adjuvants, and years. Adding UAN to NIS plus mesotrione improved creeping bentgrass control from 78% to 98% with three sequential applications at 70 g·ha–1. 3aAgrostis stolonifera 3aadjuvants 3amesotrione 3asurfactants 3aturf grasses 3aurea ammonium nitrate 3aweed control1 aLi, Deying1 aFang, Wenjuan1 aHowatt, Kirk0 tHortTechnology.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.41-45wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02312naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009600144300001400240520065300254650000800907650002200915650002800937650002500965650002000990650001001010650001001020650003001030650002401060650001801084650002301102650003001125650002301155650003101178650001101209650002801220650005101248650001401299650003001313650002701343653001901370653001901389653001901408653001901427653002801446700001501474700001401489700001401503700001501517773013601532852000901668930003301677945001301710946001101723655001201734IND2057089620221119012434.0970513e19961115ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205708962DNAL7 a89313292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamgung, J.10aCloning and characterization of chitin synthase gene fragments from Penicillium chrysogenum  ap. 71-76.  aDNA fragments homologous to chitin synthase were amplified from the genomic DNA of Penicillium chrysogenum by PCR.

There is a pressing need to identify factors that can play a role in OVCA growth and spread. Here, we focused on CD40, a member of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily with important functions in immune response. The expression of CD40 has been reported on various types of carcinoma cells, but its biological role is still poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression and function of the CD40 in OVCA cell lines. Detectable CD40 levels ranging from low to very high were found on the cell surface of several OVCA cell lines by flow cytometry analysis. Co-culture with a murine cell line transfected with CD40 ligand (CD40L) inhibited cell growth and up-regulated the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and TNF-α in high-level CD40-expressing OVCA cell lines. Similarly, an increase of IL-6 and IL-8 release could be obtained by adding a soluble form of CD40L to the OVCA cultures. These results suggest that CD40-CD40L interaction is an important pathway affecting growth regulation and cytokine production in OVCA. 0acytokines/interleukins 0aovarian carcinoma 0aphenotype/cell markers1 aGervais, A.1 aCabillic, F.1 aLe Gallo, M.1 aCoudrais, A.1 aLevêque, J.1 aCatros-Quemener, V.1 aGenetet, N.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Aug., v. 149, no. 2 p.372-377dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03426.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02999naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245012100162300001600283500002400299520166600323650005401989650002202043650002202065650002202087650002002109650002002129650002302149650001302172650005202185650001502237650001202252650000902264700002202273700002002295700001802315773009602333852000902429856008302438856006802521655001202589IND4459457720221119012233.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445945772DNAL7 a10.5344/ajev.2011.101042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosa, Cristina10aSymptomatology and Effects of Viruses Associated with Rugose Wood Complex on the Growth of Four Different Rootstocks  ap. 207-213.  aIncludes references  aThe rootstocks Vitis rupestris cv. St. George, Kober 5BB, LN33, and Freedom were graft-inoculated with viruses associated with the rugose wood complex (RW) to study their growth response and symptom expression. The virus sources used in this study were isolates LR127, CB111, CB105, and PA94-142 for Grapevine virus A (GVA), CB120 for Grapevine virus B (GVB), LV92-07 and a field selection of Chardonnay for Grapevine virus D (GVD), and a field selection of Cabernet Sauvignon for Grapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus (GRSPaV). Each rootstock plant was graft-inoculated with one, two, or three virus sources using bud chips from virus-infected grapevines. Plants were planted following a partially randomized block design. After two years, plant diameter was measured, barks were removed, and the woody cylinders were observed for the presence of RW symptoms and rated based on symptom severity. Selected plants were also tested by RT-PCR. The study showed that the greatest reduction in trunk diameter was in plants inoculated with the virus source combination of GVB/GVD/GRSPaV regardless of the rootstock type. Furthermore, treatments GVB/GVD, GVA/GVB/GVD and GVB/GVD/GRSPaV had the highest effect on LN33 growth, and GVA/GVB/GRSPaV, GVB/GVD/GRSPaV, and GVA/GVB had the highest growth effects on Kober 5BB. In general, GVB source had more adverse effect on growth in multiple infections, particularly in triple combination. In treatments with single virus source, GVD showed severe growth reduction in Freedom with no symptoms on the woody cylinder of the plants. Some sources of GVA impaired the growth of both Kober 5BB and Freedom rootstocks. 3aGrapevine rupestris stem pitting-associated virus 3aGrapevine virus A 3aGrapevine virus B 3aGrapevine virus D 3aVitis rupestris 3aadverse effects 3agrowth retardation 3aplanting 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arootstocks 3aviruses 3awood1 aJimenez, Jorge F.1 aMargaria, Paolo1 aRowhani, Adib0 tAmerican journal of enology and viticulture.g2011, v. 62, no. 2 p.207-213x0002-92547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5344/ajev.2011.101043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.ajevonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03694naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100002400182245008300206300001600289500002400305500001500329506007600344520168600420506003702106650001002143650001702153650000902170650002202179650001402201650001002215650001702225650001802242650002102260650002602281650004802307650002402355650003802379650002702417650004202444650002402486650003202510650005402542650004202596650007602638650002302714650002402737653001002761700002102771700002302792700001502815700002302830700002402853773011302877852000902990856008102999655001203080IND4458625120221207064144.0110603e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445862512DNAL7 a214826332pmid7 aPMC31772842pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.111.1725772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadeau, Courtney D.10aTissue-Specific Regulation of Gibberellin Biosynthesis in Developing Pea Seeds  ap. 897-912.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrevious work suggests that gibberellins (GAs) play an important role in early seed development. To more fully understand the roles of GAs throughout seed development, tissue-specific transcription profiles of GA metabolism genes and quantitative profiles of key GAs were determined in pea (Pisum sativum) seeds during the seed-filling development period (8-20 d after anthesis [DAA]). These profiles were correlated with seed photoassimilate acquisition and storage as well as morphological development. Seed coat growth (8-12 DAA) and the subsequent dramatic expansion of branched parenchyma cells were correlated with both transcript abundance of GA biosynthesis genes and the concentration of the growth effector GA, GA₁. These results suggest GA₁ involvement in determining the rate of seed coat growth and sink strength. The endosperm's PsGA20ox transcript abundance and the concentration of GA₂₀ increased markedly as the endosperm reached its maximum volume (12 DAA), thus providing ample GA₂₀ substrate for the GA 3-oxidases present in both the embryo and seed coat. Furthermore, PsGA3ox transcript profiles and trends in GA₁ levels in embryos at 10 to 16 DAA and also in embryo axes at 18 DAA suggest localized GA₁-induced growth in these tissues. A shift from synthesis of GA₁ to that of GA₈ occurred after 18 DAA in the embryo axis, suggesting that deactivation of GA₁ to GA₈ is a likely mechanism to limit embryo axis growth and allow embryo maturation to proceed. We hypothesize that GA biosynthesis and catabolism are tightly regulated to bring about the unique developmental events that occur during seed growth, development, and maturation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atesta 3abiosynthesis 3apeas 3aearly development 3aendosperm 3agenes 3agibberellins 3aPisum sativum 3aseed development 2aBiosynthetic Pathways 2aCotyledonxanatomy & histologyxmetabolism. 2aEndospermxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGibberellinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aOrgan Specificityxgenetics 2aPeasxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aStarchxmetabolism 2aSucrosexmetabolism 0aseeds1 aOzga, Jocelyn A.1 aKurepin, Leonid V.1 aJin, Alena1 aPharis, Richard P.1 aReinecke, Dennis M.0 tPlant physiology.g2011 June, v. 156, no. 2 p.897-912dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.1725773Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02729naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245009600210300001600306500001500322520158000337650002701917650001601944650002701960653002301987653002702010653001902037700001202056700002002068773013402088852000902222856009202231930003302323946001102356655001202367IND4399923820221119012838.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439992382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03551.x2doi7 aPMC22769412pmcid7 a180053612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurley, B.P.10aAdhesion molecules involved in hepoxilin A₃-mediated neutrophil transepithelial migration  ap. 297-305.  a2019-12-05  aA common feature underlying active states of inflammation is the migration of neutrophils (PMNs) from the circulation and across a number of tissue barriers in response to chemoattractant stimuli. Although our group has recently established a discreet role for the PMN chemoattractant, hepoxilin A₃ (HXA₃) in the process of PMN recruitment, very little is known regarding the interaction of HXA₃ with PMNs. To characterize further the event of HXA₃-induced PMN transepithelial migration, we sought to determine the adhesion molecules required for migration across different epithelial surfaces (T84 intestinal and A549 airway cells) relative to two well-studied PMN chemoattractants, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and leukotriene B₄ (LTB₄). Our findings reveal that the adhesion interaction profile of PMN transepithelial migration in response to HXA₃ differs from the adhesion interaction profile exhibited by the structurally related eicosanoid LTB₄. Furthermore, unique to PMN transepithelial migration induced by gradients of HXA₃ was the critical dependency of all four major surface adhesion molecules examined (i.e. CD18, CD47, CD44 and CD55). Our results suggest that the particular chemoattractant gradient imposed, as well as the type of epithelial cell monolayer, each plays a role in determining the adhesion molecules involved in transepithelial migration. Given the complexities of these interactions, our findings are important to consider with respect to adhesion molecules that may be targeted for potential drug development. 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aneutrophils 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 0aadhesion molecules 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0ahepoxilin A₃1 aSin, A.1 aMcCormick, B.A.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 Feb., v. 151, no. 2 p.297-305dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03551.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080113b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03097naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100001600128245009100144300001800235500002400253500001500277520176000292650001102052650002302063650003002086650001202116650001902128650002102147650001602168650001102184650002002195650002202215651001502237651001302252653001802265653002102283700002802304773014902332852000902481856007802490930003302568945002502601946001302626655001202639IND4431890720221119012102.0100128e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443189072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aB200 0aP2001 aKim, Ungtae10aClimate Change Impacts on Water Resources in the Upper Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia  ap. 1361-1378.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aClimate change affects water resources availability of international river basins that are vulnerable to runoff variability of upstream countries especially with increasing water demands. The upper Blue Nile River Basin is a good example because its downstream countries, Sudan and Egypt, depend solely on Nile waters for their economic development. In this study, the impacts of climate change on both hydrology and water resources operations were analyzed using the outcomes of six different general circulation models (GCMs) for the 2050s. The outcomes of these six GCMs were weighted to provide average future changes. Hydrologic sensitivity, flow statistics, a drought index, and water resources assessment indices (reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability) were used as quantitative indicators. The changes in outflows from the two proposed dams (Karadobi and Border) to downstream countries were also assessed. Given the uncertainty of different GCMs, the simulation results of the weighted scenario suggested mild increases in hydrologic variables (precipitation, temperature, potential evapotranspiration, and runoff) across the study area. The weighted scenario also showed that low-flow statistics and the reliability of streamflows are increased and severe drought events are decreased mainly due to increased precipitation. Joint dam operation performed better than single dam operation in terms of both hydropower generation and mean annual storage without affecting the runoff volume to downstream countries, but enhancing flow characteristics and the robustness of streamflows. This study provides useful information to decision makers for the planning and management of future water resources of the study area and downstream countries. 3abasins 3aevapotranspiration 3ainternational cooperation 3adrought 3aclimate change 3adams (hydrology) 3atemperature 3arunoff 3awater resources 3ahydrologic models 3aNile River 3aEthiopia 0aprecipitation 0awater management1 aKaluarachchi, Jagath J.0 tJournal of the American Water Resources Association.g2009 Dec., v. 45, no. 6 p.1361-1378dAmerican Water Resources Associationx1093-474X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.awra.org/jawra/index.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100301b20100305c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/03/01  aOther US 7aarticle04061naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002000183245009200203300001800295500002400313506007600337520156700413506003701980650004702017650002502064650002102089650002502110650001002135650001302145650001302158650001002171650001302181650001802194650001502212650001402227650000902241650002102250650001302271650001902284650002002303650001302323650004802336650002802384650006902412650005202481650002602533650010002559650007602659650002802735650001402763650004202777650003402819650005202853700001802905700003302923700001802956700001902974700001802993700001803011700002003029700002303049700002203072700002103094773010903115852000903224856008203233655001203315IND4429622320221207064131.0091207e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442962232DNAL7 a198807932pmid7 aPMC27822892pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.109.0669362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVrebalov, Julia10aFleshy Fruit Expansion and Ripening Are Regulated by the Tomato SHATTERPROOF Gene TAGL1  ap. 3041-3062.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe maturation and ripening of fleshy fruits is a developmental program that synchronizes seed maturation with metabolism, rendering fruit tissues desirable to seed dispersing organisms. Through RNA interference repression, we show that Tomato AGAMOUS-LIKE1 (TAGL1), the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) ortholog of the duplicated SHATTERPROOF (SHP) MADS box genes of Arabidopsis thaliana, is necessary for fruit ripening. Tomato plants with reduced TAGL1 mRNA produced yellow-orange fruit with reduced carotenoids and thin pericarps. These fruit are also decreased in ethylene, indicating a comprehensive inhibition of maturation mediated through reduced ACC Synthase 2 expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of TAGL1 in tomato resulted in expansion of sepals and accumulation of lycopene, supporting the role of TAGL1 in ripening. In Arabidopsis, the duplicate SHP1 and SHP2 MADS box genes regulate the development of separation layers essential for pod shatter. Expression of TAGL1 in Arabidopsis failed to completely rescue the shp1 shp2 mutant phenotypes, indicating that TAGL1 has evolved distinct molecular functions compared with its Arabidopsis counterparts. These analyses demonstrate that TAGL1 plays an important role in regulating both fleshy fruit expansion and the ripening process that together are necessary to promote seed dispersal of fleshy fruit. From this broad perspective, SHP1/2 and TAGL1, while distinct in molecular function, regulate similar activities via their necessity for seed dispersal in Arabidopsis and tomato, respectively.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA interference 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3acalyx 3aethylene 3afruiting 3agenes 3alycopene 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aphenotype 3apods 3aprogram planning 3aripening 3aseed dispersal 3aseed maturation 3atomatoes 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEthylenesxpharmacology 2aFruitxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aSolanum lycopersicumxclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMADS Domain Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aPan, Irvin L.1 aArroyo, Antonio Javier Matas1 aMcQuinn, Ryan1 aChung, MiYoung1 aPoole, Mervin1 aRose, Jocelyn1 aSeymour, Graham1 aGrandillo, Silvana1 aGiovannoni, James1 aIrish, Vivian F.0 tplant cell.g2009 Oct., v. 21, no. 10 p.3041-3062dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.109.0669363Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03252naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014500162300001600307500002400323520173300347650002302080650001002103650001302113650001602126650002602142650001302168650002202181650001402203650001702217650001702234650001602251650002202267650001502289650001202304650002502316650001602341650001002357650002402367650002302391650003002414650002102444700002402465700002402489700001702513700002202530700002302552773009002575852000902665856004802674655001202722IND4451556420221119012219.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445155642DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-010-0289-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shiming10aHeritability and predicted selection response of yield components and fibre properties in an inter-specific derived RIL population of cotton  ap. 309-320.  aIncludes references  aExploiting genetic variation through inter-specific breeding has improved cotton yield, fibre properties and adaptability. The objectives of this study were to examine heritability and predicted selection response of yield components and fibre properties in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from an inter-specific cross between Gossypium hirsutum (Gh) variety Guazuncho 2, and G. barbadense (Gb) line VH8-4602. A population of 93 and 82 RILs was tested in two seasons, with two parents and local controls, Sicot 75 (Gh) and Sipima 280 (Gb) in field experiments. Seed cotton samples hand harvested before and after defoliation were used to measure lint percent, boll weight, 100 seed weight and the lint to measure fibre length, uniformity, short fibre index (SFI), elongation, strength, micronaire, maturity ratio (MR), percent of maturity (PM) and fineness. There was large phenotypic variation for individual traits and transgressive segregation occurred in lint percent, lint weight/seed, fibre no./seed, uniformity, SFI, elongation, MR and PM. Narrow sense heritabilities were moderate for yield components (34.3-41.2%) and for key fibre properties, length, strength, micronaire and fineness (38.3-42.1%), which led to a predicted selection response of 6.7-24.0% for yield components and 3.9-10.9% for key fibre properties under a selection intensity of 10%. Favourable associations were found between key fibre properties, but an adverse association between lint percent and each of these fibre properties. Only five RILs were identified with desirable combinations. The results demonstrated the value of exploiting inter-specific variation to develop cotton germplasm and how breeding strategies can be improved. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abolls 3acrossing 3adefoliation 3afield experimentation 3afineness 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3ainbred lines 3alint cotton 3amanual harvesting 3amicronaire 3aparents 3aphenotypic variation 3aseed cotton 3aseeds 3aselection intensity 3aselection response 3atransgressive segregation 3ayield components1 aLlewellyn, Danny J.1 aStiller, Warwick N.1 aJacobs, John1 aLacape, Jean-Marc1 aConstable, Greg A.0 tEuphytica.g2011 Apr., v. 178, no. 3 p.309-320dSpringer Netherlandsx0014-23367nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-010-0289-6 7aarticle02074naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245012400173300001600297500002400313520101800337650002401355650001501379650001601394650001801410650001401428650002101442650001201463650001401475650001001489650001001499700001801509700002201527773009901549852000901648856005501657655001201712IND4458695920221119012308.0110603e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445869592DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2010.01371.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiang-Ping10aEffects of delayed mating on the fecundity, fertility and longevity of females of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella  ap. 305-310.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of delayed mating on the copulation duration, female fertility, fecundity, egg fertility, longevity and the number days alive after mating of females of diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, were studied.

Moreover, cyclophosphamide administration may not represent an optimal therapy to eliminate Treg, which further underlines the need to identify specific agents that would selectively deplete these cells. 3aimmunotherapy 0ametastatic carcinoma 0aregulatory T cells1 aNicolas, A.1 aCathelin, D.1 aLarmonier, N.1 aFerrand, C.1 aFoucher, P.1 aFanton, A.1 aBergoin, E.1 aMaynadie, M.1 aArnould, L.1 aBateman, A.1 aLorcerie, B.1 aSolary, E.1 aChauffert, B.1 aBonnotte, B.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Dec., v. 150, no. 3 p.523-530dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03521.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071111b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02722naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001700193245009800210300001600308520155200324650002301876653004601899653001301945653001001958653004701968700001802015700001702033700001602050700001502066773013402081852000902215856009202224930003302316946001102349655001202360IND4396218120221119011711.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439621812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03505.x2doi7 aPMC22193532pmcid7 a178880252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArcher, D.C.10aWY14,643, a PPARα ligand, attenuates expression of anti-glomerular basement membrane disease  ap. 386-396.  aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) ligands are medications used to treat hyperlipidaemia and atherosclerosis. Increasing evidence suggests that these agents are immunosuppressive. In the following studies we demonstrate that WY14,643, a PPARα ligand, attenuates expression of anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (AGBMD). C57BL/6 mice were fed 0·05% WY14,643 or control food and immunized with the non-collagenous domain of the α3 chain of Type IV collagen [α3(IV) NC1] in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). WY14,643 reduced proteinuria and greatly improved glomerular and tubulo-interstitial lesions. However, the PPARα ligand did not alter the extent of IgG-binding to the GBM. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that the prominent tubulo-interstitial infiltrates in the control-fed mice consisted predominately of F4/80⁺ macrophages and WY14,643-feeding decreased significantly the number of renal macrophages. The synthetic PPARα ligand also reduced significantly expression of the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1/CCL2. Sera from mice immunized with AGBMD were also evaluated for antigen-specific IgGs. There was a significant increase in the IgG1 : IgG2c ratio and a decline in the intrarenal and splenocyte interferon (IFN)-γ mRNA expression in the WY14,643-fed mice, suggesting that the PPARα ligand could skew the immune response to a less inflammatory T helper 2-type of response. These studies suggest that PPARα ligands may be a novel treatment for inflammatory renal disease. 3aglomerulonephritis 0aanti-glomerular basement membrane disease 0afibrates 0aMCP-1 0aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor1 aFrkanec, J.T.1 aCromwell, J.1 aClopton, P.1 aCunard, R.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2007 Nov., v. 150, no. 2 p.386-396dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2007.03505.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071021b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01195naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245008200149300001600231520009900247650001500346650001200361650001000373650002500383650002700408650004300435650002700478650002100505651001700526651001700543700001600560700001600576700001900592700002300611773010200634852000900736939003300745945000800778946001100786655001200797991584333900742620221119012702.0830308e198202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021832DNAL7 a72007602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonjour, L.10aMalaria and haptoglobin content of serum in a rural population in Upper Volta  ap. 105-107.  amalaria, human, lack of clear relationship with abnormal serum haptoglobin levels: Upper Volta 3aPlasmodium 3amalaria 3ablood 2aAntibodiesxanalysis 2aHaptoglobinsxanalysis 2aMalariaxbloodxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aPlasmodiumximmunology 2aRural Population 3aBurkina Faso 0aBurkina Faso1 aTrape, J.F.1 aDruilhe, P.1 aBourdillon, F.1 aFribourg-Blanc, A.0 tAnnals of tropical medicine and parasitology.g1982 Feb., v. 76, no. 1 p.105-107x0003-49837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830308c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle03640naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245009900180300001800279520136100297650002801658650001201686650002701698650005601725650006001781650004801841650002801889650003201917650003701949650001501986650007202001650006602073650005202139650004702191650002502238650002802263650005902291650000902350650003802359650002902397650000902426650002502435650001702460653001802477653003702495653001102532653003202543700001502575700001602590700001402606700001602620700001702636700001602653700001502669700001802684700001602702773011002718852000902828856008502837930003302922946001102955655001202966IND4401165120221119012259.0080210e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440116512DNAL7 a162832362pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-005-0005-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtsuka, A. 10aTemporary hyperglycaemia provokes monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in rat thoracic aorta  ap. 2667-2674.  aAims/hypothesis Several epidemiological data suggest that patients with postprandial hyperglycaemia are at high risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of a glucose 'spike' on monocyte adhesion to rat aortic endothelial cells. Materials and methods Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in vivo was quantitated using an en face method for observation of endothelial surface after immunohistochemical staining for CD68 in the thoracic aortas of Sprague-Dawley rats after several kinds of blood glucose rises. Results The number of monocytes adhering to endothelial cells increased at 30 min after injection of glucose in 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The increased adhesion returned to the basal level at 120 min after glucose injection, concomitantly with the return of blood glucose levels to normal. The infusion of octreotide to inhibit endogenous insulin secretion did not prevent the glucose-induced increase in monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells. On the other hand, the number of monocytes adhering to endothelial cells did not increase in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and sustained hyperglycaemia. Conclusions/interpretation Our data demonstrate that a temporary rise in blood glucose levels can in itself promote a reversible increase in monocyte adhesion to arterial endothelial cells. 3acardiovascular diseases 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, CDxanalysis 2aAntigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocyticxanalysis 2aAorta, Thoracicxchemistryxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aAtherosclerosisxetiologyxphysiopathology. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCell Adhesionxdrug effects 2aCell Communicationxdrug effects 2aCell Count 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxbloodxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aEndothelium, Vascularxchemistryxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aGlucosexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aHyperglycemiaxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aInsulinxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aMonocytesxpathologyxphysiology. 2aOctreotidexpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTime Factors 0aGlucose spike 0aMonocyte-endothelial interaction 0aNEMOes 0aPostprandial hyperglycaemia1 aAzuma, K. 1 aIesaki, T. 1 aSato, F. 1 aHirose, T. 1 aShimizu, T. 1 aTanaka, Y. 1 aDaida, H. 1 aKawamori, R. 1 aWatada, H. 0 tDiabetologia.g2005 Dec., v. 48, no. 12 p.2667-2674dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-005-0005-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01020naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245015900135300001600294520015700310650002400467650001500491650001300506650001500519700001300534700001400547700001300561773008100574852000900655939003300664945000800697946001300705655001200718991584333850742620221119012802.0830308e198112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830021902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaulfield, J.P.10aLight and electron microscopic appearance of rat peritoneal mast cells adhering to schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni by means of complement or antibody  ap. 776-783.  aSchistosoma mansoni, light and electron microscopic appearance of rat peritoneal mast cells adhering to schistosomula by means of complement or antibody 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3amast cells 3aimmunity 3acomplement1 aHein, A.1 aMoser, G.1 aSher, A.0 tJournal of parasitology.g1981 Dec., v. 67, no. 6 p.776-783x0022-33957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830308c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02610naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012900143300001600272520079600288650002201084650002801106650002701134650001301161650002301174650002301197650001601220650001001236650000901246650002201255650002401277650003101301650001801332650002301350650006601373650002701439650002601466650002101492650002301513650002801536650002401564650002401588650003301612653001901645653001901664653002801683700001401711700001201725700001301737700001101750700001601761700001601777773013701793852000901930930003301939945001301972946001101985655001201996IND2057095720221119012947.0970514e19970101ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205709572DNAL7 a90533812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhtani, K.10aCollagenase gene (colA) is located in the 3'-flanking region of the perfringolysin O (pfoA) locus in Clostridium perfringens  ap. 155-159.  aThe 3'-flanking region of the beta-galactosidase gene (pbg), which is located downstream of the perfringolysin O gene (pfoA), and the 5'-flanking region of the collagenase gene (colA) of Clostridium perfringens strains NCTC8237 and 13, respectively, were analyzed.

Twenty-three strains of O. tsutsugamushi were isolated from patients with scrub typhus in north-east (Udorn Thani province) and western Thailand (Tak province) between 2003 and 2005. The isolates were characterized by sequencing the entire ORF of the 56-kDa-type-specific antigen gene, followed by phylogenetic analysis. The majority (15/23) of isolates clustered with the Karp-type strain, six with a Gilliam-type strain and one each with the TA716- and TA763-type strains. Overall, there was considerable diversity in sequence, comparable to that seen in strains from across the rest of the scrub typhus-endemic world. There was no significant difference in the distributions of strains between the two provinces (P=0.08, Fisher's exact) nor a temporal change in distribution with year of isolation (P=0.80, Fisher's exact). Within this diversity there were also examples of isolates with identical 56-kDa genotypes that were cultured from patients from the same geographical areas. 3aOrientia tsutsugamushi 3aphylogeny 3ascrub typhus 2aAntigens, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aOrientia tsutsugamushixclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aScrub Typhusxmicrobiology 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aThailand 0aThailandxepidemiology. 0a56-kDa 0asenotype1 aLuksameetanasan, Rungnapa1 aKalambaheti, Thareerat1 aAukkanit, Nuntipa1 aParis, Daniel H.1 aMcGready, Rose1 aNosten, François1 aPeacock, Sharon J.1 aDay, Nicholas P.J.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2008 Apr., v. 52, no. 3 p.335-342dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2007.00375.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03537naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011500168300001600283520197400299650001502273650001402288650001402302650001802316650001602334650002502350650001202375650001102387650001702398650001502415650002502430650001802455650001202473650002302485650002202508650002002530650001902550650001302569650002202582650001502604650001502619650002702634653003202661653001402693700002002707700002502727773010502752852000902857856008502866930003302951946001102984655001202995IND4408476920221119010945.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440847692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-008-1063-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahaney, Wendy M. 10aImpacts of C₄ grass introductions on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling in C₃-dominated successional systems  ap. 295-305.  aWhile recent research has focused on the effects of exotic plant species on ecosystem properties, less is known about how restoring individual native plant species, differing in biomass and tissue chemistry, may impact ecosystems. We examined how three native C₄ prairie grasses affected soil C and N cycling 11 years after reintroduction into successional old-field communities dominated by non-native C₃ grasses. The species examined in this study differ in traits that are expected to influence soil C and N cycling (biomass and tissue chemistry). Thus, we hypothesized that cycling rates would decrease, thereby increasing pool sizes in soils under C₄ species compared under C₃ species. As predicted, the C₄ species had greater biomass and more recalcitrant tissue [higher C:N, acid detergent fiber (ADF):N] compared to the dominant C₃ species. The three C₄ species did not differ in tissue C:N, ADF:N, or root biomass, but Andropogon had more than twice the shoot biomass of Schizachyrium and Sorghastrum. Soils under the C₄ species did not differ in inorganic N levels, but levels were lower than in soils under the C₃ species, and soils under Andropogon had slightly lower in situ net N mineralization rates compared to those under C₃ species. We found little evidence of larger surface soil C pools under C₄ species versus C₃ species after 11 years and no differences in subsurface soil C or N among species. The C₄ species contributed a significant amount of C to both soil depths after 11 years. Our results demonstrate that C₄ species reintroduction into old-fields can alter C and N cycling on relatively short timescales, and that individual C₄ species differ in the magnitude of these effects. Improving our understanding of how species influence ecosystem properties is essential to predicting the ecosystem-level consequences of plant community alterations due to land use changes, global change, and species introductions. 3aAndropogon 3aC3 plants 3aC4 plants 3aSchizachyrium 3aSorghastrum 3aacid detergent fiber 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aglobal change 3agrasses 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aland use change 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3aprediction 3asoil depth 3aspecies reintroduction 0aStable carbon isotope ratio 0aOld-field1 aSmemo, Kurt A. 1 aGross, Katherine L. 0 tOecologia.g2008 Aug., v. 157, no. 2 p.295-305dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1063-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20080801b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02805naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003200145245010800177300001600285520134800301650000801649650001601657650001701673650001101690650001201701650001301713650001301726650001201739650000901751650001001760650001001770650001601780650001401796650001901810650003001829650003001859650002201889650003101911650002901942653001701971653001501988653001902003700002702022773011202049852000902161856008502170930003302255946001102288655001202299IND4409136520221119011731.0080815e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440913652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-007-9423-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaetano, Lisandra Cristina 10aMHM assay: molecular sexing based on the sex-specific methylation pattern of the MHM region in chickens  ap. 985-987.  aBird sex determination using molecular methods has proved to be a valuable tool in different studies. Although it is possible to sex most birds by coupling the CHD assay with others available methods, no sex-determining gene like SRY in mammalians has been identified in birds. The male hypermethylated (MHM) region on the Z chromosome has been found to be hypermethylated in males and hypomethylated in females in birds of the order Galliformes. We analyzed the DNA from feathers of 50 adult chickens to verify the methylation pattern of the MHM region by PCR and the restriction enzyme HpaII (a method named MHM assay). The results, visualized in agarose gel, were compared with PCR amplification of the CHD-Z and CHD-W genes (polyacrylamide gel) and with the birds' phenotype. All males (25) showed hypermethylation of the MHM region, and all females (25) showed hypomethylation. The sexing by MHM assay was in according with phenotype and CHD sexing. To our knowledge, this is the first study that uses the MHM region for sexing birds. Although the real role of the MHM region in the sex determination is still unclear, this could be a universal marker for sexing birds and may be involved in sex determination by its influence on transcriptional processes. The MHM assay could be a good alternative for CHD assay in developmental studies. 3aDNA 3aGalliformes 3aZ chromosome 3aadults 3aagarose 3achickens 3afeathers 3afemales 3agels 3agenes 3amales 3amethylation 3aphenotype 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction endonucleases 3asex determination 3asex determination analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 0aSexing birds 0aMHM region 0aNon-coding RNA1 aRamos, Ester Silveira 0 tConservation genetics.g2008 Aug., v. 9, no. 4 p.985-987dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-007-9423-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02326naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245012600146300001600272520074800288650001401036650002601050650002701076650001501103650002101118650002401139650001201163650002601175650002701201650003401228650004801262650003501310650006601345650002501411650004001436650001101476650002701487650002101514700001601535700001601551700001801567700001801585700001501603773013601618852000901754930003301763945001301796946001101809655001201820IND2058317920221119010548.0970710e19970501ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205831792DNAL7 a91639152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuendia, A.J.10aLocalization by immunoelectron microscopy of antigens of Chlamydia psittaci suitable for diagnosis or vaccine development  ap. 113-119.  aTwo different antigens of serotype 1 Chlamydia psittaci were localized using three immunoelectron microscopy techniques: non-embedding, pre-embedding and post-embedding. The antigens had previously been described as being of potential use in diagnosis (80-90 kDa protein region) and vaccine development (110 kDa protein). The results show a direct relationship between the protective capacity of the antigens and their surface localization on the elementary bodies, which are the infectious form of Chlamydia. The 80-90 kDa protein region is located on the surface of reticulate bodies but not of elementary bodies, where it was located periplasmically, while the 110 kDa protein occurs on the surface of both elementary and reticulate bodies. 3aChlamydia 3aChlamydophila abortus 3aChlamydophila psittaci 3amicroscopy 3asurface antigens 3avaccine development 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterial 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal 2aAntigens, Bacterialxanalysis 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxanalysis 2aBacterial Vaccinesximmunology 2aChlamydophila psittaciximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aMicroscopy, Immunoelectronxmethods 2aPorins 2aPsittacosisxdiagnosis 2aTissue Embedding1 aSalinas, J.1 aSanchez, J.1 aGallego, M.C.1 aRodolakis, A.1 aCuello, F.0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g1997 May 1, v. 150, no. 1 p.113-119aFederation of European Microbiological Societies.x0378-10977nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01148naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245004700130300001100177520045200188650001700640650002000657650001300677650002400690773008000714852001300794939003300807945000800840946001300848852000900861655001200870991584324530742620221119010441.0870810e198610  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870015832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStraka, A.10aChemicals to use for cleaning & sanitizing  ap. 42.  aPromptly removing food particles, soil and grease from equipment and areas throughout a food service operation are all parts of effective cleaning.

To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of plant-R. solanacearum interactions, we used differential display to isolate a cDNA fragment, A6, regulated in tobacco by inoculation with RsOE1-1. The deduced amino acid sequence predicted from full-length A6-cDNA showed similarity to small heat shock proteins from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana; hypothetical protein), Medicago truncatula, and Cucumis melo; we therefore designated A6 to correspond to Ntshsp17 (for tobacco small heat shock protein 17). Recombinant Ntshsp17 overproduced in Escherichia coli exhibited molecular chaperone function. Expression of Ntshsp17 was increased in tobacco leaves inoculated with both RsOE1-1 and Rs8107. Expression was induced by heat treatment and by treatment with aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid, hydrogen peroxide, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid. Ntshsp17 expression was induced by inoculation with a HR and pathogenicity gene mutant of Rs8107 that does not induce the HR, but not by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression of INF1, an HR elicitor. In Nbshsp17-silenced plants (an Ntshsp17 ortholog in Nicotiana benthamiana), expression of ETHYLENE-RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN, PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1a (PR1a), and PR4 genes was compromised, but expression of ELONGATION FACTOR1α was scarcely affected. Appearance of the HR was not affected in the silenced plants. In the silenced plants, growth of Rs8107 was accelerated. Bacterial growth and wilt symptoms elicited by RsOE1-1 were also accelerated in the silenced plants. These results indicate that this small heat shock protein might have a role in HR-independent defenses in Nicotiana plants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCucumis melo 3aEscherichia coli 3aMedicago truncatula 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3aamino acid sequences 3abacterial wilt 3acomplementary DNA 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3amethyl jasmonate 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3aplant response 3asalicylic acid 3atobacco 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aAlgal Proteinsximmunology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Deathxphysiology 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Silencing 2aHeat-Shock Proteins, Smallxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aHost-Pathogen Interactionsxphysiology 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseases 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPotexvirusxgenetics 2aProteins 2aPseudomonasximmunology 2aRalstonia solanacearumxgrowth & developmentximmunology. 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxmicrobiologyxphysiology.1 aOhnishi, Kouhei1 aHikichi, Yasufumi1 aYoshioka, Hirofumi1 aKiba, Akinori0 tPlant physiology.g2007 Dec., v. 145, no. 4 p.1588-1599dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.1053533Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle03618naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245005100192300001600243520165300259650001801912650001301930650001401943650001601957650002501973650001701998650001002015650001602025650001202041650001102053650001102064650001602075650001502091650001102106650002102117650001002138650002402148650001102172650001302183650001202196650001302208650001002221650001502231650001402246650001402260650001102274650004102285650003802326650004002364650003902404650004502443650003602488650002402524650002302548653002702571653001402598700003202612700002202644773010902666852000902775856009202784930003302876946001102909655001202920IND4405726920221119011027.0080516e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440572692DNAL7 a184768742pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03446.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwab, Wilfried10aBiosynthesis of plant-derived flavor compounds  ap. 712-732.  aPlants have the capacity to synthesize, accumulate and emit volatiles that may act as aroma and flavor molecules due to interactions with human receptors. These low-molecular-weight substances derived from the fatty acid, amino acid and carbohydrate pools constitute a heterogenous group of molecules with saturated and unsaturated, straight-chain, branched-chain and cyclic structures bearing various functional groups (e.g. alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters and ethers) and also nitrogen and sulfur. They are commercially important for the food, pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical industries as flavorants, drugs, pesticides and industrial feedstocks. Due to the low abundance of the volatiles in their plant sources, many of the natural products had been replaced by their synthetic analogues by the end of the last century. However, the foreseeable shortage of the crude oil that is the source for many of the artifical flavors and fragrances has prompted recent interest in understanding the formation of these compounds and engineering their biosynthesis. Although many of the volatile constituents of flavors and aromas have been identified, many of the enzymes and genes involved in their biosynthesis are still not known. However, modification of flavor by genetic engineering is dependent on the knowledge and availability of genes that encode enzymes of key reactions that influence or divert the biosynthetic pathways of plant-derived volatiles. Major progress has resulted from the use of molecular and biochemical techniques, and a large number of genes encoding enzymes of volatile biosynthesis have recently been reported. 3aagrochemicals 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aamino acids 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3adrugs 3aengineering 3aenzymes 3aesters 3aethers 3afatty acids 3afeedstocks 3aflavor 3aflavor compounds 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aketones 3anitrogen 3aodors 3apesticides 3apetroleum 3areceptors 3asulfur 2aAnthocyaninsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBetalainsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCarotenoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlavoring Agentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFlowersxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlantsxmetabolism 0afatty acid derivatives 0afuranones1 aDavidovich-Rikanati, Rachel1 aLewinsohn, Efraim0 tPlant journal.g2008 May, v. 54, no. 4 p.712-732dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2008.03446.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080516b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01817naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002400142245012900166300001600295500002400311520072100335650002201056650001301078650001401091650002001105650001601125650002301141650002701164700002501191700002401216700001401240700001701254773010501271852000901376856008201385655001201467IND4416427820221119011101.0090213s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441642782DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2004000222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoersma, Ykelien L.12aA validated gas chromatographic method for the evaluation of enzymatic enantioselectivity in kinetic resolution applications  ap. 501-505.  aIncludes references  aAn enantioselective gas chromatography (GC) method has been developed and validated for determination of the enantiomers of citronellol in kinetic resolution experiments.

In the first experiment, an excessive dose level of toxin (6 ppm) significantly reduced the anticoccidial efficacy of lasalocid at 75 ppm and almost completely eliminated that at 37.5 ppm in cockerels which had been infected with oocysts of Eimeria tenella and E. mitis. In the second experiment, the same dose of lasalocid was tested in combination with 0.5-1.25 ppm levels of toxin, i.e. levels occurring in the field, and all but the lowest level (0.5 ppm) significantly reduced the anticoccidial efficacy of lasalocid. Thus, in cases of outbreaks of coccidiosis, there is need to keep in mind such interaction between anticoccidials and mycotoxins. 3achickens 3aEimeria mitis 3aEimeria tenella 3acoccidiosis 3apoultry diseases 3adrug therapy 3aT-2 toxin 3alasalocid 2aAnimals 2aChickensxparasitology 2aCoccidiosisxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aLasalocidxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aPoultry Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aT-2 Toxinxpharmacology 0ainteractions1 aVanyi, A.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1992 July, v. 22, no. 4 p.523-525x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02283naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245015100172300001400323500002400337520136400361650001501725650001001740650001201750650001101762650001001773650001801783773009101801852000901892856009201901655001201993IND4399949420221119011126.0080113s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439994942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01421.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Troy G.10aDisplay of an Inedible Prop as a Signal of Aggression? Adaptive Significance of Leaf-Display by the Turquoise-Browed Motmot, Eumomota superciliosa  ap. 16-21.  aIncludes references  aThe incorporation of an inedible object (prop) into a behavioral display is rare among birds. Only four avian taxa have been reported to display with a prop, and in all studied species, prop use has been found to play a role in mate acquisition. However, little is known about the context and adaptive significance of prop use by the motmots. Both male and female motmots perform a leaf-display, whereby a leaf is held horizontally in the tip of the bill for an extended period. I collected observational data on leaf-display by the turquoise-browed motmots (Eumomota superciliosa) to investigate the potential role of this display as a mate-choice or agonistic signal. Observations of 61 leaf-displays by 27 individuals indicate that males and females are similarly likely to perform the leaf-display, that the leaf-display is performed throughout the long-breeding season, and that the display is performed by both paired and unpaired birds. These observations suggest that the leaf-display does not play a role in mate-attraction. However, the leaf-display was often performed in association with a chase or fight with a same-sex individual, and the display was sometimes performed in conjunction with an agonistic display at nest sites, suggesting that the leaf-display may function in both sexes as a signal of aggressive intent or as a signal of status. 3aaggression 3abirds 3afemales 3aleaves 3amales 3anesting sites0 tEthology.g2008 Jan., v. 114, no. 1 p.16-21dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-16137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01421.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02715naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245007600171300001800247520136300265650001401628650001901642650001401661650001901675650001701694650001001711650001801721650002201739650001101761650002301772650002701795650002601822650001201848650002401860650002201884650000901906650001701915700001701932700002001949700001801969773011301987852000902100856009202109930003302201946001102234655001202245IND4405957520221119010514.0080523e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440595752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06465.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEguchi, Megumi10aLeptin protects H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes from H₂O₂-induced apoptosis  ap. 3136-3144.  aObesity is a known risk factor for induction of myocardial infarction, but, paradoxically, may also confer a protective effect against subsequent remodeling leading to heart failure. In this study, we investigated the effect of leptin, the product of the obese (ob) gene, on cardiomyocyte apoptosis, a well-characterized component of cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction. Exposing H9c2 cells to H₂O₂ decreased cell viability, and this was attenuated by pretreating cells with leptin for 1 h, but not 24 h. Leptin also attenuated the ability of H₂O₂ to increase phosphatidylserine exposure and annexin V binding. Further investigation of underlying mechanisms of leptin's protective effect demonstrated that the H₂O₂-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (Ψ) leading to cytochrome c release was attenuated by leptin pretreatment, and this was associated with reduced translocation of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein to the mitochondrial membrane. Finally, leptin prevented H₂O₂-induced increases in caspase-3 cleavage and activity, although again 24 h leptin pretreatment did not confer significant protection. In summary, we have demonstrated that acute leptin pretreatment mediates anti-apoptotic effects in H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes, which may be of significance in clarifying the direct impact of leptin on the heart. 3aapoptosis 3acardiomyocytes 3acaspase-3 3acell viability 3acytochrome c 3agenes 3aheart failure 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleptin 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3amyocardial infarction 3aobesity 3aphosphatidylserines 3aprotective effect 3arats 3arisk factors1 aLiu, Yuantao1 aShin, Eyun-Jung1 aSweeney, Gary0 tFEBS journal.g2008 June, v. 275, no. 12 p.3136-3144dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1742-464X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06465.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02914naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001600165245010300181300001600284500001500300520129700315650002401612650001801636650001501654650002501669650001201694650001401706650002001720650002201740650001401762650002501776650001201801650001801813650001601831650001101847650000901858650004801867650003601915650003701951650002701988650002402015653000802039653001102047700001702058700001902075773011202094852000902206856008602215930003302301945001302334946001302347655001202360IND2330051620221119010326.0021212e200208  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233005162DNAL7 a121823312pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.8.7472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrwin, P.E.10aIngestion of double-stranded RNA by preparasitic juvenile cyst nematodes leads to RNA interference  ap. 747-752.  a2019-12-04  aRNA interference is of value in determining gene function in many organisms. Plant parasitic nematodes are refractory to microinjection as a means of introducing RNA and do not show any oral uptake until they are within plants. We have used octopamine to stimulate uptake by preparasitic second stage juveniles of two cyst nematodes, Helerodera glycines and Globodera pallida. This new technique was used to facilitate uptake of double stranded RNA (dsRNA) together with fluoroscein isothiocyanate as a visual marker. Targeting cysteine proteinases did not reduce the number of parasites but caused a shift from the normal female/male ratio of 3:1 to 1:1 by 14 days postinfection (dpi). Exposure of H. glycines to dsRNA corresponding to a newly characterized protein with homology to C-type lectins did not affect sexual fate, but 41% fewer parasites were recovered from the plants. As expected, treatment with dsRNA corresponding to the major sperm protein (MSP) had no effect on either parasite development or sexual fate over 14 days. Northern analysis showed lower transcript abundance for the two targeted mRNAs that occur in J2, plus a later inhibition for MSP transcripts when males developed sperm at 15 dpi. These findings establish a procedure for RNAi of plant parasitic nematodes. 3aHeterodera glycines 3amessenger RNA 3abiomarkers 3adevelopmental stages 3alectins 3asex ratio 3agene expression 3aGlobodera pallida 3aingestion 3acysteine proteinases 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aFemale 2aMale 2aNematodaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlantsxgeneticsxparasitology. 2aRNA, Double-Strandedxmetabolism 2aRNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity 0aRNA 0auptake1 aLilley, C.J.1 aAtkinson, H.J.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2002 Aug., v. 15, no. 8 p.747-752wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.8.7473Available from publisher's Web site  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02957naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245009700181300001600278500002400294500001500318520131200333650002601645650002701671650003201698650001501730650002601745650002601771650002201797650002301819650001601842650003501858650002801893650002701921650003901948650004101987650006702028650005802095650002102153653002402174700002602198700002502224700002502249773009502274852000902369856008502378655001202463IND4399891920221119011056.0080113s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439989192DNAL7 a179659122pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-007-9049-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Radha10aImpact of UV-B Radiation on Thylakoid Membrane and Fatty Acid Profile of Spirulina platensis  ap. 156-161.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUltraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation to thylakoid membrane and fatty acid profile has been investigated in cyanobacterium, Spirulina platensis. The thylakoid membrane was isolated by mechanical disruption of the freeze-dried and lysozyme-treated cells followed by differential density gradient centrifugation and morphological variations were examined. UV radiation distorted the membrane on the outer side with reduced chlorophyll a (chl a) content compared to its untreated counterpart. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was used for characterization of chl a of the thylakoid membrane. UV-B exposure resulted in alterations in the pigment-protein complexes 47 kDa and 43 kDa. Furthermore, 94 kDa and 20 kDa protein appeared in UV-B-exposed thylakoid membrane of S. platensis. The composition of fatty acid in response to UV-B radiation was detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry having 23.5% saturated fatty acid (SFA), 76.4% monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA). In contrast to its UV-B-untreated counterpart, SFA was 46.6%, and MUFA and PUFA were 53.3%. Our findings suggest that UV-B radiation not only affects membrane morphology and its protein profile but also reduces saturated fatty acid and increases unsaturated fatty acids in S. platensis. 3aultraviolet radiation 3afatty acid composition 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3athylakoids 3aArthrospira platensis 3asaturated fatty acids 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3achlorophyll 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aFatty Acidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aSpirulinaxchemistryxcytologyxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aThylakoidsxchemistryxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aSpirulina platensis1 aBhadauriya, Pratiksha1 aChauhan, Vinay Singh1 aBisen, Prakash Singh0 tCurrent microbiology.g2008 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.156-161dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-007-9049-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02835naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245013200182300001600314500002400330500001500354520096300369650002601332650001401358650002901372650001601401650003001417650002201447650002801469650002401497650003901521650001201560650002401572650002501596650006101621650002801682650003101710650001401741650003401755650005901789650005201848650002301900650003401923650002601957653002001983700001902003700001702022700001402039700001702053773010502070852000902175856008502184655001202269IND4416668420221119010246.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441666842DNAL7 a182863822pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9215-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xinxin10aEvolution-related amino acids play important role in determining regioselectivity of fatty acid desaturase from Pichia pastoris  ap. 567-573.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aω³-fatty acid desaturase and Δ¹²-fatty acid desaturase of Pichia pastoris with distinguishable regioselectivity and high degree of sequence similarity were chosen for regioselectivity research. Chimeras were constructed in which Histidine-rich boxes 1, 2 and the carboxyl terminal region of ω³-fatty acid desaturase were replaced with corresponding region of Δ¹²-fatty acid desaturase. The replacement was found to result in a change of regioselectivity from ωy to x + 3 by functionally characterizing these chimeric enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisae strain INVScI. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we further demonstrated that seven conserved amino acids of ω³-fatty acid desaturase within the first two Histidine-rich regions are responsible for the regioselectivity switch. Therefore, the regioselectivity of fatty acid desaturases may be better understood by investigating the evolutionary relationships of different fatty acid desaturases. 3aKomagataella pastoris 3achimerism 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acids 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3asequence homology 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acidsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Gas 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFatty Acid Desaturasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPhylogeny 2aPichiaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aPichia pastoris1 aWei, Dongsheng1 aLi, Mingchun1 aQi, Yuyan1 aXing, Laijun0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.567-573dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9215-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02661naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245010600188300001600294520082900310650001201139650002601151650001401177650002501191650002001216650002201236650002201258650001801280650002301298650002401321650001501345650001401360650001801374650003001392650001601422650003801438650001901476650004201495650004301537650004101580650002501621650002201646650002201668653001301690653001601703700002101719700001501740700001801755700002001773773011201793852000901905856008601914930003302000945001302033946001302046655001202059IND2330051720221119011307.0021212e200208  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233005172DNAL7 a121823322pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.8.7532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalmori-Mellan, E.10aSequence-, tissue-, and delivery-specific targeting of RNA during post-transcriptional gene silencing  ap. 753-763.  aTransgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants expressing an untranslatable version of the coat protein (CP) gene from the Tamarillo mosaic virus (TaMV) were either resistant to TaMV infection or recovered from infection. These phenotypes were the result of a post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) mechanism that targeted TaMV-CP sequences for degradation. The TaMV-CP sequences were degraded when present in the wild-type TaMV potyvirus, in transgene mRNA, or in chimeric viral vectors based on White clover mosaic virus. The more efficiently targeted region was mapped to a 134-nt segment. Differences were observed in the efficiency of targeting during cell-to-cell and long-distance movement of the chimeric viruses.

G2317 was regarded as an independent risk factor for Japanese myocardial infarction (MI) patients. We investigated the association between either A2317G or HumDN1 polymorphism of deoxyribonuclease I gene and MI in Han Chinese population. A2317G and HumDN1 polymorphisms in 278 MI patients and 297 unrelated controls were detected by PCR and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Plasma lipids were measured in fasting state by biochemical methods. A new HumDN1 genotype --HumDN1 4/6 was found in Han Chinese MI patients. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies of A2317G and HumDN1 did not differ between MI patients and control group (all P > 0.05). In addition, none of estimated haplotypes significantly increased or decreased the risk of MI. In analysis of covariance, plasma total cholesterol was observed to be associated with HumDN1 genotypes in MI patients (P = 0.02). Our data suggest HumDN1 genotypes are related to total cholesterol levels in Han Chinese MI patients, but deoxyribonuclease I gene polymorphisms are not associated with susceptibility to MI in Han Chinese. 3ablood lipids 3ahaplotypes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3afasting 3acholesterol 3agene frequency 3agenes 3apatients 3adeoxyribonuclease I 3acovariance 3amyocardial infarction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 2aAged 2aAsian Peoplexgenetics. 2aDeoxyribonuclease Ixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDiabetes Complicationsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMale 2aMyocardial Infarctionxcomplicationsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 0arisk1 aZhang, Jianjun0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.595-601dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9218-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03786naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245012900189300001800318500002400336500001500360520157400375650001501949650002301964650001601987650001602003650002402019650002602043650002302069650001302092650002902105650001602134650001202150650004602162650002602208650001502234650001502249650002402264650004002288650000902328650002302337650006402360650002102424650002502445650003702470650005602507653001802563653001402581653000802595653001602603653002702619653001802646653001902664700002102683700002102704700002102725700002202746700002202768700002202790700001902812700001802831700002002849773010102869852000902970856008502979655001203064IND4399907220221119011606.0080113s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439990722DNAL7 a180605702pmid7 a10.1007/s10577-007-1181-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrianna Caddle, Lura10aChromosome neighborhood composition determines translocation outcomes after exposure to high-dose radiation in primary cells  ap. 1061-1073.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRadiation exposure is an occupational hazard for military personnel, some health care professionals, airport security screeners, and medical patients, with some individuals at risk for acute, high-dose exposures. Therefore, the biological effects of radiation, especially the potential for chromosome damage, are major occupational and health concerns. However, the biophysical mechanisms of chromosome instability subsequent to radiation-induced DNA damage are poorly understood. It is clear that interphase chromosomes occupy discrete structural and functional subnuclear domains, termed chromosome territories (CT), which may be organized into 'neighborhoods' comprising groups of specific CTs. We directly evaluated the relationship between chromosome positioning, neighborhood composition, and translocation partner choice in primary lymphocytes, using a cell-based system in which we could induce multiple, concentrated DNA breaks via high-dose irradiation. We critically evaluated mis-rejoining profiles and tested whether breaks occurring nearby were more likely to fuse than breaks occurring at a distance. We show that CT neighborhoods comprise heterologous chromosomes, within which inter-CT distances directly relate to translocation partner choice. These findings demonstrate that interphase chromosome arrangement is a principal factor in genomic instability outcomes in primary lymphocytes, providing a structural context for understanding the biological effects of radiation exposure, and the molecular etiology of tumor-specific translocation patterns. 3aDNA damage 3aat-risk population 3achromosomes 3alymphocytes 3ahealth care workers 3aoccupational exposure 3amilitary personnel 3apatients 3achromosome translocation 3airradiation 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Aberrationsxradiation effects 2aChromosomesxgenetics 2aDNA Damage 2aGamma Rays 2aGenomic Instability 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aPrecursor Cells, B-Lymphoidxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aRadiation Dosage 2aSpectral Karyotyping 2aTranslocation, Geneticxgenetics 2aTumor Suppressor Protein p53xgeneticsxphysiology. 0aprimary cells 0aradiation 0ap53 0arisk groups 0achromosome positioning 0atranslocation 0anuclear domain1 aGrant, Jeremy L.1 aSzatkiewicz, Jin1 avan Hase, Johann1 aShirley, Bobbi-Jo1 aBewersdorf, Joerg1 aCremer, Christoph1 aArneodo, Alain1 aKhalil, Andre1 aMills, Kevin D.0 tChromosome research.g2007 Dec., v. 15, no. 8 p.1061-1073dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-38497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-007-1181-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03206naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245013000181300001600311500002400327500001500351520171000366650001002076650001302086650001102099650001902110650001102129650001202140650001102152650001202163650001302175650004802188650001302236650003602249650003402285650003502319650004902354651001302403653001002416700001402426700001802440700001402458700001502472700001402487773010502501852000902606856008502615655001202700IND4416668320221119011403.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441666832DNAL7 a182974142pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9214-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabar, M.

As a result six genotypes were established on the basis of polymorphic codons 154 and 171. The most scrapie-susceptible codon 136 (A/V) was monomorphic (A) in all breeds. Wild-type genotype ARQ/ARQ was detected with maximum prevalence ranging from 63.2% in crossbred Pak-karakul to 100% in native Buchi, Kachi and Thalli breeds. The most frequent of typical scrapie-associated genotypes was ARQ/ARR as indicated by five of nine breeds. The coding region of PrP gene of 49 animals from the total sampled was also sequenced to ascertain additional polymorphisms. Polymorphism was found in 13 animals of the six breeds in codons 101(Q/R), 112(M/T), 146(N/S) and 189(Q/L) and ten genotypes were established on the basis of these polymorphic codons. Only Hissardale possessed five of the ten genotypes. The most frequent genotype was M¹¹²ARQ/T¹¹²ARQ detected in Hissardale, Pak-karakul and Awassi, whereas genotypes ARQr²³¹/ARQr²³¹ and ARQR²³¹/ARQr²³¹ (established on the basis of silent polymorphism agg/cgg-R/R) were detected in all breeds. Some animals consisted of three polymorphisms at different PrP codons that are not common in European breeds. An infrequent double heterozygosity (c/c a/g g/t) for codon 171 resulting in a genotype R/H was also detected in three animals each one from Kajli, Hissardale and Pak-karakul. This study concludes that all native sheep breeds are poor in scrapie-resistant PrP genotypes and could contract scrapie if exposed to prions. 3asheep 3abreeding 3aAwassi 3aheterozygosity 3acodons 3ascrapie 3aprions 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aGenetic Predisposition to Diseasexgenetics 2aGenotype 2aPolymorphism, Geneticxgenetics 2aPrionsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aScrapiexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSheepxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aPakistan 0agenes1 aFarid, A.1 aBenkel, B.

We isolated and characterized BLR2, a gene that encodes a putative blue-light regulator similar to Neurospora crassa white collar-2 (WC-2). The deduced amino acid sequence of the BLR2 showed significant homology to other fungal blue-light regulator proteins in the Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) protein-protein interaction domain, nuclear localization signal, and GATA zinc finger DNA-binding domains. The BLR2-silenced transformants hardly produced conidia in the subsequent dark condition after near-ultraviolet (NUV) irradiation. Furthermore, the BLR2-silenced transformants suppressed the photolyase (PHR1) gene expression enhanced by NUV irradiation. These results indicate that BLR2 is necessary not only for conidial formation, but also for NUV radiation-enhanced photolyase gene expression in B. oryzae. 3aproteins 3arice 3aconidia 3aNeurospora crassa 3aBipolaris oryzae 3agene expression 3ablue light 3anuclear localization signals 3agenes 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3airradiation 3azinc finger motif 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGene Silencing 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeurospora crassaxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSpores, Fungalxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aCochliobolus miyabeanus1 aKatsube, Hirofumi1 aUeno, Makoto1 aArase, Sakae1 aKihara, Junichi0 tCurrent microbiology.g2008 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.115-121dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-007-9080-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02517naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245012500164300001600289500002400305520115700329650002201486650002001508650001801528650002501546650000901571650002201580650001301602650003101615650001001646650001301656650001501669650001101684650001801695650002401713650001701737650003701754650000801791650001701799700001801816700002601834773010501860852000901965856008501974655001202059IND4416668020221119011049.0090220s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441666802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11033-008-9211-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashmir Singh.10aDifferential expression of Histone H3 gene in tea (Camellia sinensis (L.)

Histone H3 is one of the four histones, along with H2A, H2B and H4, which forms the eukaryotic nucleosome octomer core. Using differential display of mRNA and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), a full-length Histone H3.1 cDNA (CsH3) was isolated from tea leaves. The open reading frame consisted of 411 nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequence comprised of 136 amino acid residues. CsH3 shared 79-82% and 98% identity at nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively with Histone H3 isolated from other plant species. During active-growth period of tea, higher expression was observed in apical buds that decreased gradually with increasing age of the leaf. During dormancy season, the expression of CsH3 was severely down-regulated in all the leaves studied. CsH3 was found to be down regulated in response to drought stress and ABA treatment and up-regulated by GA₃ treatment. A positive association of CsH3 abundance with active cellular growth suggested its role in plant growth and development. 3aCamellia sinensis 3aDNA replication 3aabscisic acid 3aamino acid sequences 3abuds 3acomplementary DNA 3adormancy 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistones 3ainterphase 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3aopen reading frames 3aplant growth 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3atea 3awater stress1 aKumar, Sanjay1 aAhuja, Paramvir Singh0 tMolecular biology reports.g2009 Mar., v. 36, no. 3 p.537-542dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-008-9211-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03050naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245009000180300001600270500002400286520095800310650002901268650001101297650001101308650001101319650001001330650002301340650001201363650001501375650002101390650001601411650001201427650001501439650001701454650002601471650002101497650001601518650001301534650001501547650004601562650002301608650004001631650003201671650004201703650001601745650005701761650003401818650003001852650001301882650002501895650006301920650003201983650002702015650002502042700001502067700001502082700002002097700001502117700001602132700001502148773009502163852000902258856008502267655001202352IND4399891720221119011309.0080113s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439989172DNAL7 a180741752pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-007-9075-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, B.

A mutant, termed Org, produced intense dark-brown pigmentation on rich medium. The Tn5-flanking sequence of the Org mutant showed high homology with the hmgA gene encoding the enzyme homogentisate dioxygenase, involved in the degradation of aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine. Growth of the hmgA mutant on L-tyrosine as sole carbon and energy sources was impaired. Growth on L-tyrosine was restored and production of the brown melanin pigment was eliminated when the mutant was complemented with the wild-type hmgA gene. The change in aromatic amino acids metabolism caused by the deletion of the hmgA gene function did not impair production of phenazines and biological traits connected to these secondary compounds: inhibition of fungal growth and inhibition of barley seed germination. 3aPseudomonas chlororaphis 3abarley 3acarbon 3aenergy 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3amelanin 3ametabolism 3amicrobial growth 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aphenazines 3apigmentation 3asecondary metabolites 3aseed germination 3atransposons 3atyrosine 2aAntibiosis 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxgenetics 2aFungixgrowth & development 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGermination 2aHomogentisate 1,2-Dioxygenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHordeumxgrowth & development 2aMutagenesis, Insertional. 2aMutation 2aPigments, Biological 2aPseudomonasxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSeedsxgrowth & development 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTyrosinexmetabolism1 aHan, S.

The method is based on the liberation of sulfur dioxide from endosulfan by adding acid reagent and alcoholic potassium hydroxide. The liberated sulfur dioxide is passed through potassium iodate solution and the iodine so liberated bleaches the violet color of thionin and blue color of methylene blue and is measured at 600 nm and 665 nm respectively. This decrease in absorbance is directly proportional to the endosulfan concentration. The Beer's law is obeyed in the range of 0.4-7.0 and 0.2-9.0 μg mL-¹ of endosulfan using thionin and methylene blue as reagents respectively. The molar absorptivity and Sandell's sensitivity were found to be 1.05 x 10⁵ and 5.03 x 10⁴ L mol-¹ cm-¹, 3.85 x 10-³ and 8.10 x 10-³ μg cm-² of endosulfan using thionin and methylene blue as reagents respectively. The method has been applied for the determination of endosulfan in water, soil and vegetables. 3aabsorbance 3ableaching agents 3acolor 3aendosulfan 3aiodine 3amethylene blue 3apotassium 3apotassium hydroxide 3asoil 3asulfur dioxide 3avegetables 2aEndosulfanxanalysisxchemistry. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aInsecticidesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMethylene Blue 2aSpectrophotometryxmethods1 aNarayana, Badiadka0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2008 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.85-89dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-007-9321-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03098naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245012500168300001600293500002400309520170700333650001702040650001002057650001702067650001102084650001002095650002402105650001202129650001202141650001602153650001102169650001402180650001002194650000702204650000902211650001102220650002302231650001202254650001002266650001602276651001202292700002402304700002002328773009602348852000902444856008302453856006802536655001202604IND4459456420221119011514.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445945642DNAL7 a10.5344/ajev.2010.100352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Profio, Frederick10aCanopy Management and Enzyme Impacts on Merlot, Cabernet franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon. II. Wine Composition and Quality  ap. 152-168.  aIncludes references  aMerlot, Cabernet franc, and Cabernet Sauvignon vines in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, were subjected to four treatments in a randomized complete block experiment: hedged control, cluster thinning at veraison (CT), basal leaf removal (BLR), and CT+BLR. Musts from each treatment replicate (CT+BLR excepted) were thereafter either left untreated or treated with one of ColorPro or Color X enzymes. In most cases, CT and CT+BLR treatments had the highest wine anthocyanin and phenol concentrations and the highest color intensities (A420 + A520). Leaf removal resulted in small increases in wine color intensity and anthocyanin and phenol concentrations. Cluster thinned and BLR treatments both reduced titratable acidity (TA) and increased pH relative to controls, but BLR tended to be more effective than CT. The CT+BLR treatments usually resulted in the lowest TA and the highest pH. Enzyme treatments increased wine TA and reduced pH and typically increased color intensity, total anthocyanins, and phenols. Both viticultural and enological treatments had noteworthy impacts on individual wine phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, although the viticultural treatments were more efficacious. The viticultural treatments enhanced intensities of several aroma and retronasal descriptors (e.g., black fruit, black pepper, tobacco) and reduced those of others (e.g., bean/pea, mushroom). The CT+BLR treatment has the potential to substantially improve fruit and wine composition in cool-climate regions; negatively, excessive leaf removal could result in lowered ethanol and undesirable increases in pH. Enzyme treatment has the potential for increased color intensity, but with occasional increases in TA. 3aanthocyanins 3abeans 3ablack pepper 3acanopy 3acolor 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3afruit wines 3aleaves 3amushrooms 3aodors 3apH 3apeas 3aphenol 3atitratable acidity 3atobacco 3avines 3aviticulture 3aOntario1 aReynolds, Andrew G.1 aKasimos, Angela0 tAmerican journal of enology and viticulture.g2011, v. 62, no. 2 p.152-168x0002-92547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5344/ajev.2010.100353Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.ajevonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02308naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245014300185300001400328500002400342520075800366650001101124650001701135650000901152650000901161650001201170650001401182650000901196650003301205650002201238650002801260650002301288651001001311651001001321700002701331700002001358700001701378700002001395700002401415700002201439700002301461700002101484700001801505700002401523700002201547773012701569852000901696856008501705655001201790IND4399860320221119010633.0080113s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439986032DNAL7 a180580452pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-007-9320-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakata, Haruhiko10aConcentrations and Distribution of Mercury and Other Heavy Metals in Surface Sediments of the Yatsushiro Sea including Minamata Bay, Japan  ap. 78-84.  aIncludes references  aThe concentrations and distribution of heavy metals, such as mercury, zinc, copper, lead, and iron in surface sediments from 234 stations of the Yatsushiro Sea including Minamata bay were investigated. High concentrations of mercury were found in sediments from Minamata bay and its vicinity, but the levels decreased gradually with distance from the bay. The concentrations of mercury in sediments decreased gradually from south to north of the Yatsushiro Sea. These imply the lack of movement of mercury from Minamata bay to the northern Yatsushiro Sea. The geographical profiles of zinc and copper were contrary to that found for mercury, indicating the presence of natural and anthropogenic sources of copper and zinc in the northern Yatsushiro Sea. 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3airon 3alead 3amercury 3asediments 3azinc 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aMercuryxanalysis 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aSeawaterxanalysis 3aJapan 0aJapan1 aAgencementc(Musician)1 aYoshimoto, Maki1 aNarumi, Rika1 aAkimoto, Kazumi1 aYamashita, Takayuki1 aMatsunaga, Tomoya1 aNishimura, Keisuke1 aTanaka, Masakazu1 aHiraki, Kenju1 aShimasaki, Hideyuki1 aTakikawa, Kiyoshi0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2008 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.78-84dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-007-9320-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03175naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001200165245016300177300001600340500001500356520145700371650002401828650001301852650001301865650002501878650001101903650001501914650003701929650002101966650002401987650001402011650002302025650004602048650001802094650002302112650001202135650001602147650003802163650001302201650001402214653001802228653002502246653002802271700001602299700001202315700001602327773011202343852000902455856008602464930003302550945001302583946001302596655001202609IND2330051220221119005149.0021212e200207  mnu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233005122DNAL7 a121188872pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.7.7092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, M.14aThe presence of diverse IS elements and an avrPphD homologue that acts as a virulence factor on the pathogenicity plasmid of Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae  ap. 709-716.  a2019-12-04  aThe pathogenicity of Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae (Ehg) and Erwinia herbicola pv. betae (Ehb) is dependent on a native plasmid (pPATH(Ehg) or pPATH(Ehb)) that harbors the hrp gene cluster, genes encoding type III effectors, phytohormones, biosynthetic genes, and several copies of IS1327. Sequence analysis of the hrp-flanking region in pPATH(Ehg)(cosmid pLA150) revealed a cluster of four additional IS elements designated as ISEhe1, ISEhe2, ISEhe3, and ISEhe4. Two copies of another IS element (ISEhe5) were identified on the upstream region of the indole-3-acetic acid operon located on the same cosmid. Based on homology of amino acids and genetic organization, ISEhe1 belongs to the IS630 family, ISEhe2 to the IS5 family, ISEhe3 and ISEhe4 to different groups of the IS3 family, and ISEhe5 to the IS1 family. With the exception of ISEhe4, one to three copies of all the other IS elements were identified only in pathogenic strains of Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae and Erwinia herbicola pv. betae whereas ISEhe4 was present in both pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains. An open reading frame that exhibited high identity (89% in amino acids) to AvrPphD of Pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola was present within the cluster of IS elements. An insertional mutation in the AvrPphD(Ehg) reduced gall size in gypsophila by approximately 85%. In addition, remnants of known genes from four different bacteria were detected on the same cosmid. 3aopen reading frames 3amutation 3aplasmids 3aamino acid sequences 3aoperon 3acytokinins 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3amultigene family 3aPantoea agglomerans 3avirulence 3aindole acetic acid 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCosmids 2aDNA Primers 2aErwiniaxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aPlasmids 2aVirulence 0apathogenicity 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aManulis, S.1 aMor, H.1 aBarrash, I.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2002 July, v. 15, no. 7 p.709-716wJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI.2002.15.7.7093Available from publisher's Web site  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02473naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003100110245014800141300001400289500002400303520143600327650002401763650001301787650002501800650002501825650001301850650001001863650001701873650001001890650001101900650001501911650000901926650001201935650001701947650001501964650002701979773008402006852000902090655001202099IND4459457220221119005031.0110629s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445945722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, M.

The GS had a total pore space (TPS) of 87.4% (by volume), which was higher than that of sphagnum peat and perlite but was similar to that of parboiled fresh rice hulls (PBH). The GS had an air-filled pore space (AFP) of 53.1%, which was higher than that of sphagnum peat and perlite but lower than that of PBH. At 34.3%, GS had a lower water-holding capacity (WHC) than sphagnum peat but a higher WHC than either perlite or PBH. The bulk density of GS was 0.19 g·cm–3 and was not different from that of the perlite but was higher than that of sphagnum peat and PBH. The addition of at least 15% GS to sphagnum peat increased the AFP of the resulting peat-based substrate. Substrates containing 25% or 30% GS had a higher AFP than substrates containing equivalent amounts of perlite but a lower AFP than substrates containing equivalent PBH. Substrates containing 20% or more GS had a higher WHC than equivalent perlite- or PBH-containing substrates. Growth of ‘Cooler Grape’ vinca (Catharanthus roseus), ‘Dazzler Lilac Splash’ impatiens (Impatiens walleriana), and ‘Score Red’ geranium (Pelargonium xhortorum) was similar for plants grown in GS-containing substrates and those grown in equivalent perlite- and PBH-containing substrates. 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aGeranium 3aImpatiens walleriana 3aPelargonium hortorum 3aSphagnum 3aVinca 3abulk density 3aglass 3agrapes 3aparboiling 3apeat 3aperlite 3aplant growth 3arice hulls 3awater holding capacity0 tHortTechnology.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.30-34wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02250naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245009200173520109000265592002801355650001501383650002501398650002801423650002101451650002101472650001201493650002201505653002601527653001801553653001601571700002001587700006201607773013201669856009001801852000901891655001201900IND60760293220221117225822.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076029322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1064592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalić, Semra13aAn update on the clinical pharmacology of miltefosine in the treatment of leishmaniasis  aMiltefosine is an alkylphosphocholine agent with a broad spectrum of antiparasitic properties. For over two decades, miltefosine has remained the only oral drug licensed and used in the treatment of the neglected tropical disease, leishmaniasis. The last extensive review of the pharmacology of miltefosine was published in 2012. Additional data on the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of miltefosine have become available in the last decade, and there are ongoing and future studies in this area. Miltefosine PK are characterized by slow absorption and elimination, resulting in accumulation of drug in plasma until the end of treatment. Several recent studies established exposure-response relationships for various regimens of miltefosine in the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, leading to the identification of PK parameters predictive of clinical relapse and outcome. This review provides an update on the most recent developments in the area of clinical pharmacology of miltefosine, including a discussion of the current dosing regimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aantiparasitic agents 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3apharmacodynamics 3apharmacokinetics 3arelapse 3atropical diseases 0aclinical pharmacology 0aLeishmaniasis 0amiltefosine1 aBeijnen, Jos H.1 aDorlo, Thomas P.C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3076-84350 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2022 Jan., v. 59, no. 1 p.106459-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1064593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245020900177500001900386520083500405592002801240650001201268650001101280650001401291650002801305650001001333650001801343650001301361650002401374650002401398650001301422650002101435653002001456653002401476653002601500653001701526700002101543700001901564700001901583700001601602700001901618700002001637773011101657856008501768852000901853655001201862IND60705485320221121004632.0201023e20200903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070548532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1522732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaikia, Ananya Anubhav10aSequencing [3+2]-cycloaddition and multicomponent reactions: A regioselective microwave-assisted synthesis of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles using ionic liquid supported Cu(II) precatalysts in methanol  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHeterocyclic compounds with two to three nitrogen atoms play a pivotal role in the normal life cycle of a cell. Further the design and synthesis of a quality heterocyclic compound library with N-atoms as new chemical probes active, is vital in drug discovery. In this context, an efficient one-pot multicomponent strategy for the synthesis of a mini library of 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles is described. This new multicomponent one-pot method features a combination of ionic liquid supported Cu(II) precatalysts in methanol catalyzed [3+2]-cycloaddition with microwave irradiation reactions. The synthetic manipulation involved the efficient reduction of ionic liquid supported Cu(II) catalyst by methanol followed by [3+2] cycloaddition with alkynes using in situ generated azides to obtain 1,2,3-triazoles regioselectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkynes 3aazides 3acatalysts 3acycloaddition reactions 3adrugs 3aionic liquids 3amethanol 3amicrowave radiation 3amicrowave treatment 3anitrogen 3aregioselectivity 0a1,2,3-Triazoles 0a(3+2) cycloaddition 0aMicrowave irradiation 0aIonic Liquid1 aNishanth Rao, R.1 aDas, Soumyadip1 aJena, Sushovan1 aRej, Sourav1 aMaiti, Barnali1 aChanda, Kaushik0 tTetrahedron letters.g2020 Sept. 03, v. 61, no. 36 p.152273-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2020.1522733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02707naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011700169300001800286520137800304592002801682650001301710650001201723650001601735650001701751650001201768650001501780650004301795650001801838650001301856651001101869653001701880653002901897653001601926653002101942653003001963653000801993700002302001700002202024700002902046773009602075856008102171852000902252655001202261IND60724950820221117231224.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072495082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Rio, Trinidad10aIntegrating local knowledge and remote sensing for eco-type classification map in the Barotse Floodplain, Zambia  ap. 2297-2304.  aThis eco-type map presents land units with distinct vegetation and exposure to floods (or droughts) in three villages in the Barotseland, Zambia. The knowledge and eco-types descriptions were collected from participatory mapping and focus group discussions with 77 participants from Mapungu, Lealui, and Nalitoya. We used two Landsat 8 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM) images taken in March 24th and July 14th, 2014 (path 175, row 71) to calculate water level and vegetation type which are the two main criteria used by Lozi People for differentiating eco-types. We calculated water levels by using the Water Index (WI) and vegetation type by using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We also calculated the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index. We excluded burned areas in 2014 and built areas to reduce classification error. Control points include field data from 99 farmers’ fields, 91 plots of 100 m² and 65 waypoints randomly selected in a 6 km radius around each village. We also used Google Earth Pro to create control points in areas flooded year-round (e.g., deep waters and large canals), patches of forest and built areas. The eco-type map has a classification accuracy of 81% and a pixel resolution of 30 m. The eco-type map provides a useful resource for agriculture and conservation planning at the landscape level in the Barotse Floodplain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aLandsat 3afloodplains 3afocus groups 3aforests 3alandscapes 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3athematic maps 3avillages 3aZambia 0aThematic map 0aLandsat-8 satellite data 0aBarotseland 0aVegetation types 0aGeographical distribution 0aGIS1 aGroot, Jeroen C.J.1 aDeClerck, Fabrice1 aEstrada-Carmona, Natalia0 tData in Brief.g2018 Aug., v. 19 p.2297-2304dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002500180245011500205300001800320500001500338506007600353520121900429592002801648506003701676650001901713650001501732650001501747650001301762650001901775650001201794650001601806650001101822650000701833650002501840650001701865650001401882650001101896653001201907700001701919700002101936700002001957700001601977700001901993700001702012700002102029700002102050773010802071856007502179852000902254655001202263IND60532701420221207083449.0160728e20121112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053270142DNAL7 a10.1021/bm300942c2doi7 aPMC34960232pmcid7 a229743642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Avila, Olga10aSelf-Assembly of Filamentous Amelogenin Requires Calcium and Phosphate: From Dimers via Nanoribbons to Fibrils  ap. 3494-3502.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnamel matrix self-assembly has long been suggested as the driving force behind aligned nanofibrous hydroxyapatite formation. We tested if amelogenin, the main enamel matrix protein, can self-assemble into ribbon-like structures in physiologic solutions. Ribbons 17 nm wide were observed to grow several micrometers in length, requiring calcium, phosphate, and pH 4.0–6.0. The pH range suggests that the formation of ion bridges through protonated histidine residues is essential to self-assembly, supported by a statistical analysis of 212 phosphate-binding proteins predicting 12 phosphate-binding histidines. Thermophoretic analysis verified the importance of calcium and phosphate in self-assembly. X-ray scattering characterized amelogenin dimers with dimensions fitting the cross-section of the amelogenin ribbon, leading to the hypothesis that antiparallel dimers are the building blocks of the ribbons. Over 5–7 days, ribbons self-organized into bundles composed of aligned ribbons mimicking the structure of enamel crystallites in enamel rods. These observations confirm reports of filamentous organic components in developing enamel and provide a new model for matrix-templated enamel mineralization.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amineralization 3ananofibers 3aprediction 3aproteins 3ahydroxyapatite 3acalcium 3aX-radiation 3amodels 3apH 3astatistical analysis 3acrystallites 3ahistidine 3aenamel 0areports1 aWu, Shenping1 aKim, Seung Joong1 aChʻeng, I-fan,1 aKhan, Feroz1 aSamudrala, Ram1 aSali, Andrej1 aHorst, Jeremy A.1 aHabelitz, Stefan0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Nov. 12, v. 13, no. 11 p.3494-3502dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm300942c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245010800171300001600279520128900295592002801584596005701612650002201669650001401691650001501705650001401720650001901734650002601753650002401779650002601803650001201829650001601841700006201857700002101919700002401940700002201964773011401986856008102100852000902181655001202190IND60614145520221120205612.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061414552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-018-4228-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoffacker, Mary Lou10aInterspecific interactions are conditional on temperature in an Appalachian stream salamander community  ap. 623-631.  aDifferences in the rates of responses to climate change have the potential to disrupt well-established ecological interactions among species. In semi-aquatic communities, competitive asymmetry based on body size currently maintains competitive exclusion and coexistence via interference competition. Elevated temperatures are predicted to have the strongest negative effects on large species and aquatic species. Our objectives were to evaluate the interaction between the effects of elevated temperatures and competitor identity on growth and habitat selection behavior of semi-aquatic salamanders in stream mesocosms. We observed interference competition between small and large species. Elevated temperatures had a negative effect on the larger species and a neutral effect on the smaller species. At elevated temperatures, the strength of interference competition declined, and the smaller species co-occupied the same aquatic cover objects as the larger species more frequently. Disruptions in competitive interactions in this community may affect habitat use patterns and decrease selection for character displacement among species. Determining how biotic interactions change along abiotic gradients is necessary to predict the future long-term stability of current communities.  aPublisher supplied data  aEnnen-2015cAquarium and Zoos Facilities Association 3aaquatic organisms 3aasymmetry 3abiocenosis 3abody size 3aclimate change 3acompetitive exclusion 3ahabitat preferences 3asalamanders and newts 3astreams 3atemperature1 aCecala, Kristen K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5739-41651 aEnnen, Joshua R.1 aMitchell, Shawna M.1 aDavenport, Jon M.0 tOecologia.g2018 Oct., v. 188, no. 2 p.623-631dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4228-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005500092040001800147072000900165100002600174245003600200300001800236500002400254500001500278520118000293650001701473650001201490650001501502650002101517650001901538650002601557651001101583653002301594653002501617653001701642700002001659700001501679773012501694852000901819856010501828930003301933945002501966946001301991655001202004IND4418883320221122034439.0090410e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441888332DNAL7 a10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101[1337:PCOL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aWeintraub, Phyllis G.10aPhysical Control of Leafhoppers  ap. 1337-1340.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn 2000, a severe outbreak of phytoplasma-caused disease in Limonium spp. flowers devastated the industry in Israel; insecticides were not able to knock down and kill leafhopper vectors before they could transmit the pathogen. Nonchoice laboratory studies were conducted to determine the effect of UV-absorbing plastics on the movement of leafhoppers toward light; UV-absorbing plastic significantly reduced leafhopper movement. In choice trials conducted in sunlight, significantly more leafhoppers moved into the cage covered with regular plastic as opposed to the cage covered with UV-absorbing plastic. Field studies were conducted to determine at what height leafhoppers enter 2.5-3-m high walk-in tunnels; the majority enter the tunnels low to the ground, up to 1 m. Finally, field studies were conduced to compare leafhopper population levels in walk-in tunnels covered with UV-absorbing plastic or screening, and with ventilation holes at different heights above the ground. Elevated ventilation holes and UV-absorbing tunnel covering significantly reduced Orosius orientalis entrance into tunnels. Ramifications of these finding for leafhopper control are discussed. 3aplastic film 3aOrosius 3aabsorbance 3aphysical control 3ainsect control 3aultraviolet radiation 3aIsrael 0aOrosius orientalis 0aUV-absorbing plastic 0aCicadellidae1 aPivonia, Shimon1 aGera, Abed0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2008 Aug., v. 101, no. 4 p.1337-1340dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493(2008)101[1337:PCOL]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090518b20090608c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/05/18  aOther US 7aarticle03060naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245011300203300001600316520176900332592002802101596006102129650001102190650001902201650001402220650002202234650002902256650002602285650001502311650001102326650001102337650001602348650001102364650002102375650001502396650001502411700002002426773011402446856008102560852000902641655001202650IND60614145620221120205609.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061414562DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-018-4226-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHopley, Tara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2712-984610aConnectivity in riparian plants: influence of vegetation type and habitat fragmentation overrides water flow  ap. 465-478.  aSpatial genetic patterns can be influenced by a broad range of factors across a landscape. The hypothesis that heterogeneous vegetation and habitat fragmentation rather than water flow influence genetic patterns in two riparian plant species with different niches was tested. Genotyping by sequencing was used to assess the genetic diversity and structure of each species at 12 sites across a river catchment. Generalized dissimilarity modelling examined the relative influence that vegetation type and habitat fragmentation had on patterns of genetic differentiation across the landscape. Restricted gene flow in the widespread species, Callistachys lanceolata, resulted in lower genetic differentiation than that exhibited by Astartea leptophylla, a restricted riparian species with high gene flow. Geographic distance and vegetation type explained the patterns of genetic differentiation in the widespread species, whereas habitat fragmentation and, to a lesser extent, vegetation type explained patterns in the restricted species. Water flow was not found to have significant impacts on patterns of genetic diversity in riparian plant species with restricted and widespread distribution. Impacts of vegetation type on genetic differentiation were most likely due to change in canopy density and associated pollinator communities in the vegetation types across the catchment. Reduced connectivity caused by habitat fragmentation was evident in the restricted riparian species, while reduced connectivity in the widespread species was related to the change of vegetation type between sites. Natural causes of reduced connectivity as well as anthropogenic causes need to be considered in future work to predict persistence and resilience under a changing climate.  aPublisher supplied data  aLSP-944784-1088cAustralian Government Biodiversity Fund 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3agenotyping by sequencing 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aniches 3apollinators 3arivers 3avegetation types 3awater flow 3awatersheds1 aByrne, Margaret0 tOecologia.g2018 Oct., v. 188, no. 2 p.465-478dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4226-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008300168300001600251520118700267592002801454653001201482653001501494653001501509653003101524653002201555653001501577653001501592653001501607653004601622653002401668700001901692700001801711700002201729773011801751856008601869852000901955655001201964IND60602551420221118223300.0180711e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060255142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.10.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuda, Sho10aLow GWP refrigerants R1234ze(E) and R1234ze(Z) for high temperature heat pumps  ap. 161-173.  aLow global warming potential refrigerants R1234ze(E) and R1234ze(Z) are anticipated to be the refrigerants of choice for high-temperature heat pump systems in industrial applications. Their thermodynamic attributes are thermodynamically, experimentally, and numerically assessed in this study. The thermodynamic assessment indicates that the theoretical coefficients of performances (COP) are maximized at a condensation temperature approximately 20 K below the critical temperatures for each refrigerant. However, when the volumetric capacity is inadequate, the actual COP differs from the theoretical COP because of the large pressure drop. The breakdown of irreversible losses, which are experimentally quantified at a condensation temperature of 75 °C, results in the largest portion of the total pressure drop. The simulation results obtained at condensation temperatures of 105 and 125 °C indicate higher COPs than that at 75 °C for R1234ze(Z). The major factor is the reduction in the irreversible loss caused by the pressure drop. The above assessments demonstrate that R1234ze(Z) is suitable for high-temperature applications rather than in typical air conditioners.  aPublisher supplied data 0aLow GWP 0aR1234ze(E) 0aR1234ze(Z) 0aHigh-temperature heat pump 0aIrreversible loss 0aFaible GWP 0aR1234ze(E) 0aR1234ze(Z) 0aPompe à chaleur à température élevée 0aPerte irréversible1 aKondou, Chieko1 aTakata, Nobuo1 aKōyama, Shigeru,0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Apr., v. 40 p.161-173dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.10.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04423naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003900130040001800169100005700187245008900244300001600333506002800349506003600377506007600413506003100489520214100520592002802661596008302689506003702772650002202809650001302831650000902844650001002853650001102863650002502874650001502899650001002914650002302924650001502947650002202962650001302984650001502997650001203012650001603024650001703040650001303057650002203070650001103092650001303103650001003116650001603126651002403142651001703166653001603183653001303199653001203212653001303224653001503237653001603252653001903268653001403287700001903301700001803320700001803338773013903356856008303495856004503578903002403623961000903647852000903656655001203665IND60615694320221215142403.0190318e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061569432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0142doi7 a10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0142chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvans, Elaine1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7190-829X10aWild, native bees and managed honey bees benefit from similar agricultural land uses  ap. 162-170.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aAlthough both managed and unmanaged bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, efforts to address questions about landscapes that best support pollinators often focus on either wild pollinators or honey bees. This study examined if there was concordance between the success of wild bee communities and managed honey bee colonies at sites varying in floral availability and disturbance level in a predominantly agricultural landscape. We also determined which agricultural land uses best supported wild bee communities. The study area in the state of North Dakota in Northern Great Plains in North America is home to understudied native bee communities as well as over ¼ of U.S. commercial honey bee colonies during the summer months. There is an assumption that honey bees can do well in agricultural areas but that wild bees need natural areas to thrive. We compared wild bee community success with health and survival of managed honey bees (data obtained from a related study) at six apiary locations over three years. We examined wild bee communities and surrounding land uses at 18 locations, three of which were spatially associated with each of six apiary locations. Wild bee abundance and species diversity were positively correlated with honey production, a measure of honey bee success, indicating that locations supporting successful honey bee colonies also supported successful wild bee communities. Grasslands, bee-forage crops, wooded areas, and wetlands were associated with increased abundance, species diversity, or functional diversity of wild bee communities. Crops not providing forage for bees, predominantly soybean, corn, and wheat, were associated with decreased functional diversity, decreased above-ground nesting bees and bees with shorter active season durations, and decreased honey bee survival. Pollinator conservation efforts retaining and enhancing grasslands, wooded areas, wetlands, and crops providing bee forage will likely support the growth, reproduction, and survival of diverse wild bee communities and the success of managed honey bees in areas dominated by intensive agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3aapiaries 3acorn 3acrops 3aforage 3afunctional diversity 3agrasslands 3ahoney 3ahoney bee colonies 3ahoney bees 3aintensive farming 3aland use 3alandscapes 3anesting 3apollinators 3areproduction 3asoybeans 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3awetlands 3awheat 3awild plants 3aGreat Plains region 3aNorth Dakota 0aAgriculture 0aLand use 0aApoidea 0aWild bee 0aNative bee 0aManaged bee 0aApis mellifera 0aHoney bee1 aSmart, Matthew1 aCariveau, Dan1 aSpivak, Marla0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2018 Dec. 1, v. 268 p.162-170dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2018.09.0143Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/6156943  aAccepted Manuscript  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011500167300001600282520062100298592002800919650001400947650001800961650002000979650001800999650002001017650001801037650001201055651001101067653001301078653002701091653001501118653001801133653002501151653002601176653002701202653002801229653001301257653002301270653002101293700002901314700001801343773009401361856008101455852000901536655001201545IND60724951120221117231151.0210124e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072495112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabahbeh, Ahmad10aFactors influencing SMEs CloudERP adoption: A test with generalized linear model and artificial neural network  ap. 969-977.  aThis article present data concerning the factors influencing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) intention to use/adopt CloudERP system in Jordan.

We tested this hypothesis under conditions of extreme drought by assessing plant nutrient (N, P and K) uptake and resorption in response to experimentally imposed precipitation reductions in two semiarid grasslands of northern China. These two communities shared similar environmental conditions, but had different dominant species—one was dominated by a rhizomatous grass (Leymus chinensis) and the other by a bunchgrass (Stipa grandis). Results showed that responses of N to drought differed between the two communities with drought decreasing green leaf N concentration and resorption in the community dominated by the rhizomatous grass, but not in the bunchgrass-dominated community. In contrast, negative effects of drought on green leaf P and K concentrations and their resorption efficiencies were consistent across the two communities. Additionally, in each community, the effects of extreme drought on soil N, P and K supply did not change synchronously with that on green leaf N, P and K concentrations, and senesced leaf N, P and K concentrations showed no response to extreme drought. Consistent with the dominance/mass ratio hypothesis, our findings suggest that differences in dominant species and their growth form (i.e., rhizomatous vs bunch grass) play an important nutrient-specific role in mediating plant internal nutrient cycling across communities within a single region.  aPublisher supplied data  a41600302cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41320104002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFC0500601cNational Basic Research Program of China 3aLeymus chinensis 3aStipa grandis 3aarid lands 3abiogeochemical cycles 3adominant species 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3aphosphorus 3aplant communities 3apotassium 3aresorption 3asoil 3aChina1 aXu, Chong1 aMa, Wang1 aYue, Xiyuan1 aLiang, Xiaosa1 aZuo, Xiaoan1 aKnapp, Alan K.1 aSmith, Melinda D.1 aSardans, Jordi1 aDijkstra, Feike A.1 aPeñuelas, Josep1 aBai, Yongfei1 aWang, Zhengwen1 aYu, Qiang1 aHan, Xingguo0 tOecologia.g2018 Oct., v. 188, no. 2 p.633-643dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4232-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245008700153300001800240520103000258592002801288650001301316650001601329650001301345650001001358650001101368650001901379650001601398700001801414700002001432700001901452700001901471700001501490700001601505700001501521773010801536856007501644852000901719655001201728IND60532701720221118232939.0160728e20121112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053270172DNAL7 a10.1021/bm301022p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shen10aBiomimetic Sheath Membrane via Electrospinning for Antiadhesion of Repaired Tendon  ap. 3611-3619.  aThe hierarchical architecture and complex biologic functions of native sheath make its biomimetic substitute a daunting challenge. In this study, a biomimetic bilayer sheath membrane consisting of hyaluronic acid–loaded poly(ε-caprolactone) (HA/PCL) fibrous membrane as the inner layer and PCL fibrous membrane as the outer layer was fabricated by a combination of sequential and microgel electrospinning technologies. This material was characterized by mechanical testing and analysis of morphology, surface wettability, and drug release. Results of an in vitro drug release study showed sustained release. The outer layer had fewer cells proliferating on its surface compared to tissue culture plates or the inner layer. In a chicken model, peritendinous adhesions were reduced and tendon gliding were improved by the application of this sheath membrane. Taken together, our results demonstrate that such a biomimetic bilayer sheath can release HA sustainably as well as promoting tendon gliding and preventing adhesion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abiomimetics 3achickens 3adrugs 3amodels 3atissue culture 3awettability1 aZhao, Jingwen1 aRuan, Hongjiang1 aTang, Tingting1 aLiu, Guangwang1 aYu, Degang1 aCui, Wenguo1 aFan, Cunyi0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Nov. 12, v. 13, no. 11 p.3611-3619dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm301022p3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03392naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007800147245009200225300001600317520186400333592002802197596008302225596008902308596005902397650001202456650002602468650003102494650001002525650001102535650001402546650001402560650001402574650001402588650001102602650001102613650002102624650001502645650000902660650001102669700002002680700003002700773011402730856008102844852000902925655001202934IND60614145820221120205617.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061414582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-018-4163-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardoso, João Custódio Fernandes1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0411-815910aSpecific parasites indirectly influence niche occupation of non-hosts community members  ap. 343-353.  aThe coexistence of phylogenetically related species is an attractive topic because of the potentially intense interspecific competition. The most often investigated mechanisms mediating coexistence of these species are environmental filtering and niche partitioning. However, the role of other factors, such as species-specific parasites, is still poorly understood. Along the riparian understory of a tropical forest, we explored niche occupation and coexistence between Chrysso intervales and Helvibis longicauda, two related syntopic web-building spiders. We also investigated the effect of H. longicauda mortality induced by a specific fungus parasite, Gibellula pulchra, on the dynamic of C. intervales spatial distribution. Coexistence was mediated mainly by a fine-scale horizontal spatial segregation. H. longicauda built webs almost exclusively close to the river, while C. intervales occupied adjacent areas (10–20 m away from margins). We also found differentiation in other niche dimensions that might allow coexistence, such as in plants occupied, height of web placement, width of leaves used for thread attachment and phenology. H. longicauda mortality caused by fungi was higher during winter than in summer. Consequently, the abundance of C. intervales increased at distances close to the river, indicating competitive release through a density-mediated indirect effect. This demonstrates how non-competitive specific-antagonists can indirectly affect other non-hosts competing community members and influence their spatial distribution in fine-scale ranges. We suggest that environmental filtering restricts H. longicauda to cooler regions; niche partitioning leads populations to occupy different vertical strata and competitive exclusion precludes C. intervales to reach river margins, generating an unusual horizontal zonation pattern.  aPublisher supplied data  aProc.

In particular, the dissemination of methicillin-resistant staphylococci, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), have significantly reduced the therapeutic options, making the management of these infections even more challenging. Dalbavancin is a second-generation lipoglycopeptide approved for the treatment of moderate to severe acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused by Gram-positive organisms, showing a bactericidal effect and a low propensity towards the selection of resistance over time. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of dalbavancin and other comparators against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive pathogens obtained from different sources and from several European countries, including countries of Southern and Eastern Europe, and Russia, where resistance rates are typically high. This study also aimed to describe the clonal relationship of MRSA strains circulating in Southern and Eastern Europe and Russia. In total, 1478 isolates were collected. Study results demonstrated the excellent and stable activity of dalbavancin against Gram-positive microorganisms, including MRSA. Interestingly, dalbavancin has retained unaltered minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC₅₀ and MIC₉₀) values over the years, and seems to have a low propensity towards the selection of resistance. These data support the potential efficacy of dalbavancin against Gram-positive bacteria and uncommon Gram-positive pathogens in patients with ABSSSIs. Of note, few coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) isolates were resistant to dalbavancin and susceptible to vancomycin, highlighting the importance of testing for susceptibility to dalbavancin before its administration for CoNS infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus 3aRussia 3aantibacterial properties 3adalbavancin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3atherapeutics 3avancomycin 3aEastern European region 0aGram-positive pathogens 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aABSSSIs1 aGiani, Tommaso1 aBaldi, Giulia1 aArcangeli, Sophie1 aAntonelli, Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0295-68771 aTellone, Valeria1 aDel Vecchio, Alessandra1 aDe Joannon, Alessandra Capezzone1 aRossolini, Gian Maria0 tInternational journal of antimicrobial agents.g2022 Feb., v. 59, no. 2 p.106503-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12451x0924-85797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2021.1065033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04084naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245011300175300001400288520241800302592002802720650001202748650001002760650001402770650001802784650001802802650001202820650001002832650001802842650002802860650001202888650001702900650001602917650001202933650001102945650001002956650001802966650001502984650001502999650000903014650001203023650001003035650001503045653001103060653002403071653001203095653001203107653000803119653001803127700002503145700002703170700002203197700002203219700002603241773010803267856008603375852000903461655001203470IND60543143620221119073622.0190410e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054314362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2015.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiuntini, Eliana B.10aGastrointestinal hormone modulation after a double-blind interventional study with unavailable carbohydrates  ap. 17-23.  aThe intake of unavailable carbohydrates—functional ingredients—has presented an inverse relationship with the risk for non-communicable diseases. Inulin and unripe banana flour (UBF) (source of resistant starch—55%) are among these ingredients. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of regular and discontinued intake of inulin or UBF on the plasma levels of gastrointestinal hormones and energy intake in healthy volunteers. A medium-term clinical assay was conducted with healthy volunteers, both males and females (n=33), who were oriented to consume soup with added inulin (INU group), UBF (UBF group) or maltodextrin (Control group) three times a week for six weeks. Prototypes of two different types of frozen soups were provided by a food industry. The plasma concentration of satiety-related gastrointestinal hormones was evaluated before and at the end of the intervention. Blood collection was performed 180min after the consumption of breakfast ad libitum. The energy intake was evaluated at the subsequent meal (180min). UBF consumption (8g) caused significant changes in the plasmatic levels of the gastrointestinal hormones when compared to the period before the intervention: there was a lower increase in ghrelin (T0, T60, T120 and T180min) and a decrease in insulin (T0 and T180min), hormones related to hunger, when at high levels, as well as an increase in peptide YY (PYY) at all timepoints. When comparing the Control and UBF groups at the end of the intervention, the latter presented a reduction in ghrelin (T0, 120 and 180min) and insulin (T0 and 180min) and an increase in PYY (T30 and 180min). The consumption of inulin (8g), compared to the period before and at the end of the intervention, resulted in a lower increase in ghrelin (T0, T120 and T180min) and a decrease in insulin (T180min). PYY also increased at all timepoints, which indicates higher satiety. When the Control and INU groups were compared at the end of the intervention, the INU group presented reductions in ghrelin (T0, 120 and 180min) and insulin (T180min) and an increase in PYY (T180min). At the subsequent meal, there was a reduction in energy intake of approximately 15% (129kJ) for the UBF and 12% (130kJ) for the INU groups. Both inulin and UBF present positive effects on gastrointestinal hormones and energy intake and may be used for producing products that stimulate healthy eating habits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abananas 3ablood 3abreakfast 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3afemales 3aflour 3afood industry 3agastrointestinal system 3aghrelin 3ahealthy diet 3aingredients 3ainsulin 3ainulin 3amales 3amaltodextrins 3apeptide YY 3aprototypes 3arisk 3asatiety 3asoups 3avolunteers 0aInulin 0aUnripe banana flour 0aGhrelin 0aInsulin 0aPYY 0aEnergy intake1 aSardá, Fabiana A.H.1 aLui, Maria Cristina Y.1 aTadini, Carmen C.1 aLajolo, Franco M.1 aMenezes, Elizabete W.0 tFood research international.g2015 Nov., v. 77 p.17-23dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2015.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02487naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245009700210300001600307500001900323500001100342520135100353592002801704650001301732650002301745650001901768650001601787650000901803700006001812700006701872773013101939856008202070852000902152655001202161IND60701681320221120225250.0200713e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070168132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-020-01195-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZelinka, Samuel L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1348-773010aEvaluation of previous measurements of water vapor sorption in wood at multiple temperatures  ap. 769-786.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReview  aWater vapor sorption is a fundamental physical property of wood and has numerous implications for the behavior of wood as a building material. As a result, water vapor sorption isotherms have been studied for over a century and are the topic of countless publications. Despite their importance and depth of study, there has not yet been a thorough review of these studies that can be used to guide readers to the highest quality sorption data. Sorption data acquired at multiple temperatures are frequently used for thermodynamic analysis or to validate sorption models. This review summarizes all known papers where water vapor sorption isotherms have been measured on wood at three or more temperatures and includes 27 studies published from 1930 to 2018. For each study, the quality of the data is evaluated from the experimental details listed in the publication. One of the essential details is the operational definition of equilibrium, often specified as a threshold for change in mass with time. Unfortunately, upon close examination of the methods, definitions of equilibrium in many cases were not specified or were lacking in stringency, which calls into question the accuracy of the data. In the end, only three of the 27 studies are recommended as being reliable for thermodynamic analysis or for validating sorption isotherm models.  aPublisher supplied data 3asorption 3asorption isotherms 3athermodynamics 3awater vapor 3awood1 aGlass, Samuel V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5451-18641 aThybring, Emil Engelund1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0471-69220 tWood science and technology.g2020 July, v. 54, no. 4 p.769-786dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl45947x0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-020-01195-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014100162300001600303520148900319592002801808596006401836596006401900650001901964650001101983650001201994650001102006650001902017650002202036650001702058650001202075650001702087650002502104650002102129650002102150651001002171700001702181700001602198700001302214700001602227700001202243700001302255700002002268700005202288773011402340856008102454852000902535655001202544IND60614145920221120205605.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061414592DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-018-4230-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hui10aShifts in functional trait–species abundance relationships over secondary subalpine meadow succession in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau  ap. 547-557.  aAlthough trait-based processes of community assembly during secondary succession invokes multiple factors that ultimately determine the presence or absence of a species, little is known regarding the impacts of functional traits on species abundance in successional plant communities. Here in species-rich subalpine secondary successional meadows of the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, we measured photosynthesis rate and leaf proline content that are related to plant growth and abiotic stress resistance, respectively, and seed germination rate that is closely correlated with plant germination strategy to test their influence on species abundance during succession. We used a linear mixed effects model framework to examine the shifts in trait–abundance relationships and the correlations among these three traits in successional communities. We observed significant shifts in trait–abundance relationships during succession, e.g., abundant species in early-successional meadows exhibited relatively high photosynthesis rates and leaf proline content, but showed low seed germination rates, whereas the converse were true in late successional communities. However, the correlations among the three traits were insignificant in most meadow communities. Our results show that functional traits associated with plant growth, stress resistance, and reproduction impose strong influence on species abundance during secondary subalpine meadow succession in the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau.  aPublisher supplied data  a31770469cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a31300334cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN) 3aabiotic stress 3aleaves 3ameadows 3amodels 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant communities 3aplant growth 3aproline 3areproduction 3asecondary succession 3aseed germination 3astress tolerance 3aChina1 aJohn, Robert1 aZhu, Shidan1 aLiu, Hui1 aXu, Qiuyuan1 aQi, Wei1 aLiu, Kun1 aChen, Han Y.

The power and cooling cycles through absorption are of great interest because they can use low temperature thermal energy sources as solar energy with a higher versatility than the separated production of power and cooling (refrigeration) to cover the typical variable cooling and power demands of the building. In this study we have considered several system configurations based on the Goswami and single-stage combined absorption power and cooling cycles and different solar thermal technologies: evacuated tube, parabolic trough and linear Fresnel solar collectors. To compare the configurations we have performed the energy and exergy analysis for a specific case located in Sevilla (Spain) with a coordinates of 37°22′38″N 5°59′13″W using TRNSYS software as simulation tool.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSolar thermal energy 0aCombined power-cooling 0aAbsorption 0aAmmonia 0aEnergie solaire thermique 0aRefroidissement combiné des systèmes électriques 0aAbsorption 0aAmmoniac1 aAyou, Dereje S.1 aBruno, Joan Carles1 aCoronas, Alberto0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Mar., v. 39 p.125-136dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05532naa a2201549 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010900168300001800277520145200295592002801747650001501775650002801790650002301818650001901841650001601860650001001876650001401886650001501900650002001915650001401935650001101949650002601960650001301986650000901999653005402008653003302062653003302095653003502128700001602163700001902179700005602198700001902254700002102273700001402294700001602308700001702324700001702341700001702358700001502375700001902390700001602409700001402425700001802439700005102457700001902508700001702527700001802544700001402562700001902576700002002595700001802615700001902633700001502652700001602667700001302683700001902696700001802715700001802733700001302751700001202764700001402776700001402790700001802804700001502822700001902837700001302856700001602869700001802885700001302903700001702916700001502933700001502948700001702963700001402980700001902994700001703013700001703030700001303047700001403060700001503074700001303089700001403102700001603116700001803132700001403150700001403164700001203178700001403190700001703204700001603221700001503237700001303252700001603265700001503281700001403296700001803310700001603328700001303344700001303357700001903370700001303389700001603402700001203418700001603430700001703446700001803463700001803481700001603499700001603515700001703531700001903548700001303567700001703580700002003597700002103617700001503638700001603653700001803669700001603687700001503703700001503718710003303733773011203766856008303878852000903961655001203970IND60716104920221121173731.0211114e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071610492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2020.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Qiongjing10aUrinary magnesium predicts risk of cardiovascular disease in Chronic Kidney Disease stage 1–4 patients  ap. 2394-2400.  aObservational studies on dietary or circulating magnesium and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage 1–4 have reported no-to-modest inverse associations. 24 h Urinary magnesium concentration (24 h UMg), an indicator of intestinal magnesium absorption, may provide better insight into the connection of CKD progression. We examined 3179 participants aged 18–74 years with CKD stage 1–4 in the Chinese Cohort Study of Chronic Kidney Disease (C-STRIDE) study, a prospective population-based cohort study. Data were analysed using Spearman rank-order correlation coefficients for all comparisons. We also performed a time-to-event analysis of the data using the Kaplan–Meier survival model, Cox proportional hazard model and competing risk Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard model. During a median follow-up of 4.19 years (interquartile range, 3.43–5.09 years), when modelling end-stage renal disease (ESRD), CVD and death, 24 h UMg was associated with risk of CVD (HR, 1.612 (95% CI, 1.056–2.460)), while no significant association with ESRD and death endpoints could be detected. 24 h UMg risk variants display a modest association with CVD in CKD stage 1–4 patients.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03041987.

These ground waters can degrade soil physical properties and require special land management to maintain soil salinity levels ideal for crop and rangeland production. The objectives of this study were to evaluate how saline and sodic solutions changed soil hydrologic properties and how hydrologic parameters change with solution composition. Four soils ranging in texture from sandy loam to silty clay, were saturated with solutions ranging in electrical conductivities (EC) of 0.5 to 8 dS m⁻¹ and sodium adsorption ratios (SAR) of 0 to 20. The hydraulic conductivity and water retention were measured using pressure plates, HYPROP evaporation method, and a dewpoint potentiometer. Data was fit with the van Genuchten and dual porosity models and the model parameters were evaluated. There was an increase in water retention and decrease in hydraulic conductivity when soils were near saturation as solution SAR increased and EC decreased at potentials near saturation. Water retention method combinations agreed well for low salinity treatments, but fitting parameters did not agree well for the higher salinity treatments. The coarser textured soil had a stronger disagreement in fitting parameters for the different water retention method combinations and greater salt build up near soil surface. Capillary rise of salt bearing waters of low EC and high SAR increases soil water retention and decreases hydraulic conductivity near saturation which will slow rates of downward water movement and salt leaching.  aPublisher supplied data  a1005366cUSDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch 3aadsorption 3acapillarity 3adewpoint 3aevaporation 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aland management 3aporosity 3apotentiometers 3arangelands 3asalinity 3asandy loam soils 3asilty clay soils 3asodium 3asoil salinity 3asoil salinization 3asoil water retention 3atexture1 aDaigh, A.L.M.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2020 Mar., v. 84, no. 2 p.354-370dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.200153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01938naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245013700153300001800290520079200308592002801100650001801128650002601146650002901172650002201201650002001223650001101243651001601254700002401270700001701294700001901311700001901330700001501349773013101364856007201495852000901567655001201576IND60648072520221118015044.0190626e20121218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064807252DNAL7 a10.3390/f30411332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerr, Suzi10aSpatial and Temporal Responses to an Emissions Trading Scheme Covering Agriculture and Forestry: Simulation Results from New Zealand  ap. 1133-1156.  aWe perform simulations using the integrated Land Use in Rural New Zealand (LURNZ) model to analyze the effect of various New Zealand emissions trading scheme (ETS) scenarios on land use, emissions and output in a temporally and spatially explicit manner. We compare the impact of afforestation to the impact of other land-use change on net greenhouse gas emissions and evaluate the importance of the forestry component of the ETS relative to the agricultural component. We find that the effect of including agriculture in the ETS is small relative to the effect of including forestry. We also examine the effect of land-use change on the time profile of net emissions from the forestry sector. Finally, we present projections of future agricultural output under various policy scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aafforestation 3aenvironmental markets 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3amodels 3aNew Zealand1 aAnastasiadis, Simon1 aOlssen, Alex1 aPower, William1 aTimar, Levente1 aZhang, Wei0 tForests.g2012 Dec. 18, v. 3, no. 4 p.1133-1156dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f30411333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245020200154300001800356520132500374592002801699650002501727650001601752650001701768650001301785650001801798650001501816650001401831650000901845650001401854650002201868650000901890650002401899650001601923700001701939700001401956773013901970856007302109852000902182655001202191IND60132253920221120082118.0150505e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013225392DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.122182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagen, A G10aLow concentrations of sodium hypochlorite affect population dynamics in Gyrodactylus salaris (Malmberg, 1957): practical guidelines for the treatment of the Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. parasite  ap. 1003-1011.  aAtlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. parr (age 1+), infected by the monogenean ectoparasite Gyrodactylus salaris (Malmberg, 1957), were exposed to chlorine (Cl)‐enriched water at three different concentrations: Clₗₒw(0–5 μg Cl L⁻¹), Clₘₑdᵢᵤₘ(18 μg Cl L⁻¹) and Clₕᵢgₕ(50 μg Cl L⁻¹). There was a negative correlation between G. salaris infections and the hypochlorite concentrations added. The parasite infection was eliminated by day 6–8 and day 2–4 in the groups Clₘₑdᵢᵤₘand Clₕᵢgₕ, respectively, while inhibition of G. salaris population growth was observed in the Clₗₒwgroup. An important note to this matter, however, is that the G. salaris specimens observed at day 6 in Clₘₑdᵢᵤₘand at day 2 in Clₕᵢgₕwere all considered dead by subjective judgement. No mortality in the salmon parr was observed during the first 8 days of the experiment, demonstrating that Cl has a stronger effect on G. salaris than on the salmonid host. The differences in sensitivity between the parasite and the Atlantic salmon indicate that hypochlorite has a potential use as a parasiticide with a therapeutic margin. The low‐dose sensitivity may imply that Cl pollution in urban areas may pose a greater risk towards biodiversity than previously assumed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGyrodactylus salaris 3aSalmo salar 3abiodiversity 3achlorine 3aectoparasites 3aguidelines 3amortality 3aparr 3apollution 3apopulation growth 3arisk 3asodium hypochlorite 3aurban areas1 aHytterød, S1 aOlstad, K0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2014 Dec., v. 37, no. 12 p.1003-1011dBlackwell Scientific Publications.wJournal:jnl10108x0140-77757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfd.122183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02013naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011700167300001600284520085700300592002801157650001601185650001301201650002601214650001101240650002401251650001601275650004401291650001501335650001501350650004301365700001801408700001401426700002101440700001401461773009501475856004801570852000901618655001201627IND4530049820221118231916.0140122e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453004982DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-012-0125-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFliegerovÃ¡, K.13aTheeffect of maize silage as co-substrate for swine manure on the bacterial community structure in biogas plants  ap. 281-284.  aThe qualitative and quantitative changes in the bacterial community composition in two mesophilic, commercially used biogas plants were monitored by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and real-time PCR.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of adding 10 g of cocoa-rich chocolate to the habitual diet of postmenopausal women daily on body composition. We conducted a 6-month, two-arm randomised, controlled trial. Postmenopausal women (57·2 (sd 3·6) years, n 132) were recruited in primary care clinics. Participants in the control group (CG) did not receive any intervention. Those of the intervention group (IG) received 10 g daily of 99 % cocoa chocolate in addition to their habitual diet for 6 months. This quantity comprises 247 kJ (59 kcal) and 65·4 mg of polyphenols. The primary outcomes were the between-group differences in body composition variables, measured by impendancemetry at the end of the study. The main effect of the intervention showed a favourable reduction in the IG with respect to the CG in body fat mass (–0·63 kg (95 % CI –1·15, –0·11), P = 0·019; Cohen’s d = –0·450) and body fat percentage (–0·79 % (95 % CI –1·31, –0·26), P = 0·004; Cohen’s d = –0·539). A non-significant decrease was also observed in BMI (–0·20 kg/m² (95 % CI –0·44, 0·03), P = 0·092; Cohen’s d = –0·345). Both the body fat mass and the body fat percentage showed a decrease in the IG for the three body segments analysed (trunk, arms and legs). Daily addition of 10 g of cocoa-rich chocolate to the habitual diet of postmenopausal women reduces their body fat mass and body fat percentage without modifying their weight.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fat 3achocolate 3adiet 3apolyphenols 3apostmenopause 3arandomized clinical trials 0aBody composition 0aBody fat distribution 0aBody weight changes1 aGarcia-Ortiz, Luis1 aGomez-Marcos, Manuel A.1 aRodriguez-Sanchez, Emiliano1 aLugones-Sanchez, Cristina1 aMaderuelo-Fernandez, Jose A.1 aRecio-Rodriguez, Jose I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3772-87460 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2021 Mar. 14, v. 125, no. 5 p.548-556dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145200030863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001600295520121000311592002801521650001101549650001501560650002001575650002801595650002101623650001501644650001801659650001801677650001001695650001301705650001101718650001401729650001101743650001701754650001401771650001101785650001501796653002401811653001801835653003101853653001301884653001401897700001601911700001601927700001701943700001301960700001601973700001801989700001602007773011102023856008302134852000902217655001202226IND60558607520221122054719.0180831e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055860752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Hong Yan10aSynthesis of ZnO nanowire arrays/3D graphene foam and application for determination of levodopa in the presence of uric acid  ap. 592-597.  aThree-dimensional (3D) graphene foam (GF) was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using nickel foam as the template. ZnO nanowire arrays (ZnO NWAs) were vertically grown on the 3D GF by hydrothermal synthesis to prepare ZnO NWAs/GF. This hybrid combines the properties of ZnO NWAs and 3D GF, which has favorable electrocatalysis and outstanding electrical conductivity. The vertically aligned ZnO NWAs grown on the GF enlarged the electroactive surface area, which was investigated from the Fe(CN)63-4+ redox kinetic study. The ZnO NWAs/GF was used as an electrochemical electrode for the determination of Levodopa (LD) in the presence of uric acid (UA). The electrochemical responses of the ZnO NWAs/GF electrode were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The results show that the sensitivity of the electrode for LD is 3.15μAμM⁻¹ in the concentration range of 0.05–20μM and the measured detection limit of the electrode for LD is 50nM. The electrode also shows good selectivity, reproducibility and stability. The proposed electrode is succsefully used to determine LD in human plasma samples and it is potential for use in clinical research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-dopa 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aferricyanides 3aferrocyanides 3afoams 3agraphene 3ahumans 3ananowires 3anickel 3asurface area 3auric acid 3avapors 3azinc oxide 0aZnO nanowire arrays 0aGraphene foam 0aElectrochemical biosensors 0aLevodopa 0aUric acid1 aZhang, Hong1 aHuang, Shuo1 aLin, Xuan Yu1 aGao, Xin1 aChang, Jing1 aYao, Long Hui1 aGuo, Er Jun0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 89 p.592-597dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.01.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009200173300001800265500001500283520093800298592002801236650000901264650002401273650001001297650002401307650001101331650002901342650001401371650001301385650001201398650005201410650003601462650001401498651001301512653004201525653000901567653001001576700001501586700001901601700005801620773011701678856008501795852000901880655001201889IND60527895020221119224211.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052789502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanayotova, Elitsa10aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus lineages Europe 1 and Europe 2 in Bulgarian ticks  ap. 1024-1028.  a2019-12-06  aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne human viral disease with fatality rate up to 30%. Two genetic lineages of CCHF virus (CCHFV) are present in Europe – lineage Europe 1 which contains pathogenic CCHFV strains, and lineage Europe 2 consisting of AP92 and AP92-like strains. In order to investigate CCHFV distribution and potential risk for humans, ticks were collected from livestock in the five districts where CCHF cases have been reported in the last five years in Bulgaria. CCHFV lineage Europe 1 was detected in 39 of 623 Hyalomma marginatum ticks (6.3%; range per village 2.7–15.2%), while CCHFV lineage Europe 2 was detected for the first time in Bulgaria in 49 of 415 Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato ticks (11.8%; range 0–58.3%). The present study shows that both Europe 1 and Europe 2 CCHFV lineages are present in Bulgaria. The pathogenic role of the AP92-like strains remains to be elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3aHyalomma marginatum 3ahumans 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3alivestock 3avillages 3aviruses 3aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus 3aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever 3amortality 3aBulgaria 0aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus 0aAP92 0aTicks1 aPapa, Anna1 aTrifonova, Iva1 aChristova, Iva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7878-39950 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2016 July, v. 7, no. 5 p.1024-1028dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03189naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015800171300001400329520099000343592002801333650002001361650001701381650002001398650002201418650001601440650001501456650003201471650001401503650002901517650001401546650001101560650001301571653004801584653005701632653002301689653002901712653002601741653002101767653000801788653000901796653000801805653000701813653000801820653000701828653000901835653001101844653001301855653000801868653000901876653001201885653001101897653000901908653000901917653000601926653000701932653000701939653000601946653000801952700001701960700002201977700002001999700002102019700002102040700002002061700002402081700002102105700005802126700002202184773009302206856008702299852000902386655001202395IND60605431720221120110711.0190408e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060543172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeyer, Estelle10aNovel approach to identify phenoloxidases inhibitors: Optimization of spectrophotometric MBTH assay for high throughput use enzymatic assays and analysis  ap. 83-91.  aThis study presents a miniaturized 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride-assay (MBTH-assay)1, optimized for high-throughput measurement of shrimp phenol oxidase activities and the screening of potential inhibitors of post-mortem melanosis.

The plant–animal interface is the most variable and least predictable of all levels in the food web. In order to study determinants of food quality in a large lake and to test the recently proposed central importance of the long‐chained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) at the pelagic producer–grazer interface, we tested the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) at the pelagic producer–consumer interface by correlating sestonic food parameters with somatic growth rates of a clone of Daphnia galeata. Daphnia growth rates were obtained from standardized laboratory experiments spanning one season with Daphnia feeding on natural seston from Lake Constance, a large pre‐alpine lake. Somatic growth rates were fitted to sestonic parameters by using a saturation function. A moderate amount of variation was explained when the model included the elemental parameters carbon (r² = 0.6) and nitrogen (r² = 0.71). A tighter fit was obtained when sestonic phosphorus was incorporated (r² = 0.86). The nonlinear regression with EPA was relatively weak (r² = 0.77), whereas the highest degree of variance was explained by three C₁₈‐PUFAs. The best (r² = 0.95), and only significant, correlation of Daphnia‘s growth was found with the C₁₈‐PUFA α‐linolenic acid (α‐LA; C18:3n–3). This correlation was weakest in late August when C:P values increased to 300, suggesting that mineral and PUFA‐limitation of Daphnia‘s growth changed seasonally. Sestonic phosphorus and some PUFAs showed not only tight correlations with growth, but also with sestonic α‐LA content. We computed Monte Carlo simulations to test whether the observed effects of α‐LA on growth could be accounted for by EPA, phosphorus, or one of the two C₁₈‐PUFAs, stearidonic acid (C18:4n–3) and linoleic acid (C18:2n–6). With >99 % probability, the correlation of growth with α‐LA could not be explained by any of these parameters. In order to test for EPA limitation of Daphnia‘s growth, in parallel with experiments on pure seston, growth was determined on seston supplemented with chemostat‐grown, P‐limited Stephanodiscus hantzschii, which is rich in EPA. Although supplementation increased the EPA content 80–800×, no significant changes in the nonlinear regression of the growth rates with α‐LA were found, indicating that growth of Daphnia on pure seston was not EPA limited. This indicates that the two fatty acids, EPA and α‐LA, were not mutually substitutable biochemical resources and points to different physiological functions of these two PUFAs. These results support the PUFA‐limitation hypothesis for sestonic C:P < 300 but are contrary to the hypothesis of a general importance of EPA, since no evidence for EPA limitation was found. It is suggested that the resource ratios of EPA and α‐LA rather than the absolute concentrations determine which of the two resources is limiting growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia galeata 3aMonte Carlo method 3aStephanodiscus 3aalpha-linolenic acid 3aaquatic food webs 3acarbon 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenergy transfer 3afood quality 3alaboratory experimentation 3alactalbumin 3alakes 3alinoleic acid 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aprobability 3avariance 3aLake Constance1 avon Elert, Eric0 tEcology.g2001 Sept., v. 82, no. 9 p.2507-2520dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2001)082%5B2507:PFAEFN%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02888naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245009800174300001600272520139300288592002801681650001901709650002001728650002901748650001101777650001501788650002601803650003501829650001901864650001501883650002401898650001301922653001401935653001101949653001801960653002001978653001301998700001302011700001602024700001902040700001402059700001402073700001902087700001602106700001402122700001702136700001602153773009102169856008902260852000902349655001202358IND60606365920221120110703.0180725e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060636592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.11.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Xiongwei10aEffects of soil properties on copper toxicity to earthworm Eisenia fetida in 15 Chinese soils  ap. 185-192.  aThe bioavailability and toxicity of metals in soil are influenced by a variety of soil properties, and this principle should be recognized in establishing soil environmental quality criteria. In the present study, the uptake and toxicity of Cu to the earthworm Eisenia fetida in 15 Chinese soils with various soil properties were investigated, and regression models for predicting Cu toxicity across soils were developed. The results showed that earthworm survival and body weight change were less sensitive to Cu than earthworm cocoon production. The soil Cu-based median effective concentrations (EC50s) for earthworm cocoon production varied from 27.7 to 383.7 mg kg⁻¹ among 15 Chinese soils, representing approximately 14-fold variation. Soil cation exchange capacity and organic carbon content were identified as key factors controlling Cu toxicity to earthworm cocoon production, and simple and multiple regression models were developed for predicting Cu toxicity across soils. Tissue Cu-based EC50s for earthworm cocoon production were also calculated and varied from 15.5 to 62.5 mg kg⁻¹ (4-fold variation). Compared to the soil Cu-based EC50s for cocoon production, the tissue Cu-based EC50s had less variation among soils, indicating that metals in tissue were more relevant to toxicity than metals in soil and hence represented better measurements of bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEisenia fetida 3abioavailability 3acation exchange capacity 3acopper 3aearthworms 3aenvironmental quality 3amedian effective concentration 3aorganic carbon 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3atoxicity 0aEarthworm 0aCopper 0aSoil property 0aBioavailability 0aToxicity1 aXu, Meng1 aZhou, Youya1 aYan, Zengguang1 aDu, Yanli1 aZhang, Lu1 aZhang, Chaoyan1 aBai, Liping1 aNie, Jing1 aChen, Guikui1 aLi, Fasheng0 tChemosphere.g2016 Feb., v. 145 p.185-192dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.11.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011900166300001800285520132300303592002801626650001101654650001601665650001301681650002001694650001401714650002401728650002601752650002401778650001301802650003101815650002201846700001501868700002001883773013701903856008102040852000902121655001202130IND60614143020221120230919.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061414302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-017-1528-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yong-Jiang10aSupplement intervention associated with nutritional deficiencies in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review  ap. 2571-2582.  aPURPOSE: Nutritional supplements have been used for correction of deficiencies that may occur in patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to improve core symptoms. We aim to provide current best evidence about supplements for nutritional deficiencies and core symptoms in children with ASD and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety. METHODS: A systematic literature search of scientific databases was performed to retrieve relevant randomized controlled trials. Risk of bias was assessed for each study. RESULTS: 18 randomized controlled trials of five supplements were included. B6/Mg was not helpful for improving ASD symptoms (seven RCTs). Two RCTs of methyl B12 reported some improvement in ASD severity but the effects on the correction of deficiencies were inconclusive. Two RCTs of vitamin D₃ both reported increased levels of mean 25(OH)D in serum but inconsistent results in behavioral outcomes. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation did not affect ASD behaviors but may correct deficiencies (six RCTs). One RCT of folinic acid reported positive results in improving ASD symptoms measured by various behavioral scales. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence for the use of supplements for correcting nutritional deficiencies in children with ASD and to improve the symptoms is little. More studies are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautism 3ablood serum 3achildren 3acholecalciferol 3adatabases 3adietary supplements 3anutrient deficiencies 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apatients 3arandomized clinical trials 3asystematic review1 aLi, Ya-Min1 aXiang, Da-Xiong0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2018 Oct., v. 57, no. 7 p.2571-2582dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-017-1528-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245010100165300001800266520058900284592002800873650001700901650001500918650002300933650002300956650001700979650003200996650001901028650001401047650004401061650002201105650002601127650002201153653002101175653003401196653001701230653003201247653003101279700001901310700001401329700001901343700001801362700001901380773010401399856008201503852000901585655001201594IND60615962720221119165233.0181025e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061596272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Dashan10aAlokicenones A-H, eight tetrahydroanthracenes from the mangrove-derived Streptomyces sp.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of C. burnetii phase II antibodies in two different groups (high and low risk) of healthy human population and investigate the epidemiological characteristics of the infection in the island of Crete (southern Greece). Collection and testing by IFA of 493 sample sera for IgG and IgM antibodies against C. bumetii phase II antigen indicated a prevalence of IgG antibodies of 48.7%. Of the seropositive individuals, 34% also revealed IgM seropositive antibody titers. Analysis of 225 sample sera by IFA from high risk population presented a prevalence for C. burnetii of 62.2%. Our findings revealed that C. burnetii is highly endemic in Crete, indicating a high exposure of the population to the pathogen regardless of occupation or place of residence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aQ fever 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3aat-risk population 3abacteria 3ahuman population 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3apathogens 3arisk 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3aCrete 3aGreece1 aKokkini, Sofia1 aChochlakis, Dimosthenis1 aSandalakis, Vassillios1 aPasparaki, Eirini1 aMinadakis, Georgios1 aGikas, Achilleas1 aTselentis, Yannis1 aPsaroulaki, Anna0 tComparative immunology, microbiology, and infectious diseases.g2012 Mar., v. 35, no. 2 p.123-127dElsevier Ltdx0147-95717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cimid.2011.11.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005600165300001600221520097400237592002801211650001501239650001401254650001401268650002101282650001801303650000901321650001101330650001101341650001301352650003901365650001301404650001501417650001801432650001201450700003101462700006501493773009401558856008101652852000901733655001201742IND60724948020221120043721.0210124e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoirala, Diwa10aData-independent proteome analysis of ARPE-19 cells  ap. 333-336.  aWe have performed a proteomics analysis of a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19), which represents a widely used model for in vitro studies of cellular and molecular mechanisms related to human RPE cells (Dunn et al., 1996; Weigel et al., 2002) [1,2]. Whole cell protein extracts were separated in four gel fractions via short (10 min) SDS-PAGE runs. Following fractionation and trypsin digestion, the resulting peptides were separated on a nano UPLC LC system and analyzed on-line with a QTof-IMS instrument: a tandem mass spectrometer with ion mobility separation (Synapt G2-Si). Data were acquired in data-independent mode (UDMSᴱ), which allows for absolute and/or relative post-acquisition protein quantification (Silva et al., 2006) [3]. The proteome profile data obtained from this study can be used as a protein reference database with qualitative and quantitative protein information related to ARPE-19 cells under normal growth conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell lines 3adatabases 3adigestion 3aepithelial cells 3afractionation 3agels 3ahumans 3amodels 3apeptides 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3aspectrometers 3atrypsin1 aBeranova-Giorgianni, Sarka1 aGiorgianni, Francesco1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3556-75010 tData in Brief.g2018 Oct., v. 20 p.333-336dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02540naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010700163300002000270520123200290592002801522650001501550650001501565650001101580650001301591650002101604650001201625650001401637650002301651650002101674650002201695650003401717650002201751700001401773700001901787700001601806700001701822700005201839773013801891856008002029852000902109655001202118IND60679457120221121165035.0191228e20191203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067945712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b074232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yuelin10aTheoretical Simulation of Structural Transformation and Chirality Switch in Host–Guest Self-Assembly  ap. 31238-31245.  aWith the aim of investigating the guest-induced structural transformation and chirality switch of host–guest self-assembly at the liquid/solid interface, the molecular self-assembly configurations of 5-(benzyloxy)-isophthalic acid derivative (host) and coronene (guest) were studied at the interface of (S)-2-nonanol/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite by modeling and simulation. The molecular models were established based on scanning tunneling microscopy images. Molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations were performed to calculate the adsorption energy, characteristic hydrogen-bonding parameters, surface density, host–guest interaction, and the structural evolution. It is observed that the structure undergoes a guest-induced responsive rearrangement from a honeycomb into a starfish structure, and the chirality is switchable after the addition of the guest. Furthermore, it is found that the underlying mechanisms of structure transformation and chirality switch are attributed to the roles of energy, size matching, and steric hindrance effect. This work can be utilized for the analogous host–guest self-assembly research and rational design of the host–guest system which can switch chirality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteroidea 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3agraphene 3ahydrogen bonding 3aliquids 3amechanics 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3aoptical isomerism 3ascanning tunneling microscopy 3asimulation models1 aQin, Yuan1 aYang, Yingying1 aFan, Huawei1 aWang, Xudong1 aYao, Man1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7322-92580 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Dec. 03, v. 123, no. 51 p.31238-31245dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b074233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009000166300001800256520138600274592002801660650002401688650002201712650002701734650002701761650002501788650002601813650001801839650001001857650002401867650001101891650001501902650001401917650001801931650002501949650000901974650002401983650001002007650001102017651001202028653003602040653002202076653001102098700001602109700002002125700002002145773011702165856008502282852000902367655001202376IND60527895320221119224016.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052789532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, Heidi10aPrevalence of Rickettsia species in Dermacentor variabilis ticks from Ontario, Canada  ap. 1044-1046.  aRelatively little is known about the prevalence of rickettsial species in Dermacentor ticks in eastern Canada. In this study, Dermacentor ticks from the province of Ontario, Canada, were tested for the presence of spotted fever group rickettsial (SFGR) species, Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis. Rickettsia rickettsii was not detected in any ticks tested, but R. montanensis was detected at a prevalence of 2.2% in D. variabilis (17/778). Two other SFGR species, R. parkeri and Candidatus R. andeanae, were detected individually in 2 Amblyomma maculatum ticks. Rickettsia peacockii, a non-pathogenic endosymbiont, was detected in two D. andersonii ticks. Given the highly abundant nature of D. variabilis, surveillance for human pathogens in this species of tick has important public health implications, but the lack of detection of known human pathogens indicates a low risk of infection via this tick species in Ontario. However, the detection of R. parkeri in an adventive A. maculatum tick indicates that health care providers should be aware of the possibility of spotted fever rickettsioses in individuals with a history of travel outside of Ontario and symptoms compatible with a spotted fever rickettsiosis. Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis, human pathogens also potentially transmitted by D. variabilis, were not detected in a subset of the ticks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma maculatum 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aDermacentor variabilis 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aRickettsia peacockii 3aRickettsia rickettsii 3aendosymbionts 3afever 3ahealth care workers 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apublic health 3arickettsial diseases 3arisk 3atick-borne diseases 3aticks 3atravel 3aOntario 0aSpotted fever group rickettsiae 0aDermacentor ticks 0aCanada1 aDillon, Liz1 aPatel, Samir N.1 aRalevski, Filip0 tTicks and tick-borne diseases.g2016 July, v. 7, no. 5 p.1044-1046dElsevier GmbHwJournal:6305x1877-959X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ttbdis.2016.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02224naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245016900172300001600341520111300357592002801470650001501498650001501513650001601528650001801544650001901562650003001581650001701611700002401628700002701652700002301679773009401702856008101796852000901877655001201886IND60724948120221120043712.0210124e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmotosho, Omolola E.10aProstate specific antigen and relative prostate weight data on effect of Tetracarpidium conophorum leaf extract on testosterone-induced benign prostatic hyperplasia  ap. 639-643.  aBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common urological disorder of men, characterized by prostatic enlargement and urethral obstruction. In this study, BPH was induced in experimental groups by daily subcutaneous injections of testosterone propionate (TP) for 3 weeks. Tetracarpidium conophorum was administered daily by oral gavage at a dose of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg BW of extract for three weeks, along with the TP injections and 5 mg/kg of finasteride for comparison. On day 21, the animals were sacrificed after anesthesia. Prostate were excised, weighed and used to determine relative prostate weight. Quantitative and qualitative phytochemical screening was also done and it showed the presence of flavonoids (0.370 mg/ml), tannins (0.458 mg/ml), phenols (0.508 mg/ml) and steroids (0.257 mg/ml).

Seven weeks' consumption of HFD resulted in higher food intake, dyslipidaemia, cognitive impairment and increasing hippocampal and frontal cortex oxidative stress (OS) without significant change in blood glucose and hippocampal inflammation. Microarray analysis data demonstrated that long-term potentiation (LTP) pathway was altered with down-regulation of genes against OS. Correlation analysis showed that hippocampal OS biomarkers had strong relations to Morris water maze performance. Sal B in drinking water (0.07 mg/ml) normalised the cognitive deficits through attenuating hippocampal redox status, altering LTP pathway and other biological pathways, up-regulating antioxidative genes expression. Thus, OS induced by HFD might be the initial factor that triggers cognitive impairment. Sal B was an efficient agent that exerted neuroprotective effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3ablood glucose 3acentral nervous system diseases 3acognition 3adata analysis 3adrinking water 3afood intake 3afrontal lobe 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahigh fat diet 3ahyperlipidemia 3ainflammation 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aneuroprotective effect 3aoxidative stress 3asalvianolic acid 0aSalvianolic acid B 0aHigh fat diets 0aCognition 0aOxidative stress1 aXie, Zhen-Xing1 aQiao, Yi1 aLi, Li-Rong1 aCheng, Xiang-Rong1 aDuan, Xiao-Mei1 aTang, Xue1 aShi, Yong-Hui1 aLe, Guo-Wei0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Nov., v. 11 p.278-292dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2014.10.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01650naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009700164300001800261520056100279592002800840650002300868650002300891650002300914650002400937653002900961653001500990653002201005653001801027653002401045700001501069700002101084773010401105856008201209852000901291655001201300IND60615962920221119165226.0181030e20181122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061596292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Jianjun10aPractical selective monohydrolysis of bulky symmetric diesters: Comparing with sonochemistry  ap. 6815-6820.  aThe conditions of the practical selective monohydrolysis of symmetric diesters we previously reported have been modified and applied to selective monohydrolysis of bulky symmetric diesters. While ultrasound is generally considered effective for two-phase reactions, its effect actually turned out to be rather marginal. Instead, use of a larger proportion of a polar aprotic co-solvent, DMSO, and aqueous KOH helped enhance the reaction rates and improve the yields of the half-esters. The reactions are simple, mild and practical without special devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3apotassium hydroxide 0aSelective monohydrolysis 0aHalf-ester 0aSymmetric diester 0aSonochemistry 0aPractical synthesis1 aZhao, Tian1 aNiwayama, Satomi0 tTetrahedron.g2018 Nov. 22, v. 74, no. 47 p.6815-6820dElsevier LtdwJournal:11744x0040-40207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245007500169300001400244520094600258592002801204653002401232653002701256653001901283653001701302653001401319653002301333653002101356653001901377653001701396653001901413700001801432700001701450700001901467773011601486856008601602852000901688655001201697IND60602548920221119233534.0180711e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060254892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.09.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Donggyu10aPressure effect on the release of supercooled water with dissolved air  ap. 51-60.  aIt is proposed that vapor has been elucidated to having relation to the release of supercooled water.In this study, considering that the vapor has a relation to dissolved air, a supercooling experiment is performed to test tubes of pure water with three patterns of initial dissolved oxygen (DOi = 4.1, 7.5, and 12.6 mg L⁻¹), i.e. dissolved air. The initial DO in each test tube is kept to the value as constant as possible during supercooling. And the pressure effect on supercooling release of pure water is observed by measuring supercooling degree and by visualizing bubbles enclosed to the ice after full crystallization of the pure water.From this study, it appeared that the factors such as cooling rate, initial DO and pressure of pure water are related to the release of supercooling (supercooling degree and supercooling time). Moreover, the initial DO was confirmed to the confined bubble in fully frozen ice of pure water.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSupercooling degree 0aDissolved oxygen (air) 0aPressurization 0aMicro-bubble 0aTest tube 0aSurrefroidissement 0aOxygène dissous 0apressurisation 0aMicro-bulles 0aTube à essais1 aPark, Chunwan1 aJeong, Sujin1 aKang, Chaedong0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Apr., v. 40 p.51-60dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.09.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01563naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100014300138245010600281300001800387520026700405592002800672650002300700650002300723650002900746650001400775650002600789650001200815650001600827700001900843700001800862700002800880700002500908700002000933700002600953773012800979856007301107852000901180655001201189IND60658192820221119132504.0190816e20080222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065819282DNAL7 a10.1039/b716510b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatherCurrent address: Institut für Physikalische Chemie, Universität zu Köln, Luxemburger Straße 116, 50939 Köln, Germany., Malte C.13aAn alignable fluorene thienothiophene copolymer with deep-blue electroluminescent emission at 410 nm  ap. 1079-1081.  aAn alignable, liquid-crystalline fluorene fused-ring thienothiophene copolymer has been synthesized with electroluminescence peaking at 410 nm for deep blue, polarised emission in polymer light-emitting diodes, light-emitting transistors and photonic structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3acomposite polymers 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3afluorenes 3alight emitting diodes 3aphotons 3atransistors1 aHeeney, Martin1 aZhang, Weimin1 aWhitehead, Katherine S.1 aBradley, Donal D.

As a test, this paper used correlation and regression analyses to investigate rainfall intensity as a factor affecting flood damage. For a time period of 15 years, the relationship between insurance losses caused by floods and rainfall intensity data from rain gauges was examined in two Swedish cities. Another objective was to find an approach for damage functions based on rainfall intensity as explanatory variable. Using linear regression, two approaches with considerable high degrees of explanation were found–one based on an exponential function and one on a power function. Using a lower limit for rainfall intensity, the approaches reached degrees of explanation between 30 and 78%. From this study it was concluded that rainfall intensity during the summer months and the occurrence of insurance damages per day caused by floods were correlated and further that rainfall intensity has a great potential to explain urban flood damages. In the future, additional studies are needed to validate the proposed methods and integrate other flood damage affecting factors in the approach.  aPublisher supplied data  cStiftelsen Länsförsäkringsbolagens Forskningsfond  cLänsförsäkringar insurance group 3aflood damage 3ainsurance 3arain 3arain intensity 3aregression analysis 3arisk management 3asummer1 aNyberg, Lars0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2019 Nov., v. 12, no.

K. Koch.] orchards in New Mexico. Nickel deficiency can cause a reduction in lignin formation, which could affect the risk for breakage on pecan tree shoots. Ni deficiency might furthermore disrupt ureide catabolism in pecan and, therefore, could negatively affect nitrogen (N) nutrition in the plant. The objective of this study was to identify the effects of Ni and N fertilizer applications, at two rates, on net photosynthesis (Pₙ), leaf greenness (SPAD), and branch lignin concentration in New Mexico’s nonbearing pecan trees. Sixty trees for year 2012 (Pawnee and Western cultivars) and 40 trees for year 2013 (Pawnee cultivar) were used at two New Mexico locations (Artesia and Las Cruces) to evaluate the effects of Ni and N on tree measures. Treatments were as follows: (1) High N plus Ni (+Ni); (2) Low N no Ni (−Ni); (3) High N −Ni; and (4) Low N +Ni. In 2012 and 2013, there was an increase in leaf greenness for each location and cultivar (tree group) through time (June to September). Photosynthesis measures in 2012 differed between tree group, time in the season, and N and Ni treatments. In 2013, Pₙ was influenced by tree group and time (P < 0.0001), but N and Ni interaction did not present a significant effect related to Ni benefits. Photosynthesis varied over time in 2012 and 2013, with an inconsistent pattern. In this study, Ni application at the high N rate had a negative effect on ‘Pawnee’ Pₙ early in the season at the Artesia site, but this application had a positive effect for ‘Western’ from Artesia at the low N level, also early in the season. Lignin content varied between tree groups only. The application of N and Ni did not affect lignin in pecan shoots. The results show an inconsistent pattern regarding the benefits of Ni on nonbearing pecan orchards for leaf greenness, Pₙ, and lignin content during the 2-year study. Future studies on Ni should focus on pecan trees exhibiting leaf Ni deficiency symptoms or on soils with less than 0.14 mg·kg⁻¹ of DTPA extractable Ni, as well as the long-term effect of Ni on pecan growth and development to optimize the addition of Ni into an efficient fertilization program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarya illinoinensis 3acatabolism 3acultivars 3agrowth and development 3aleaves 3alignin 3alignin content 3along term effects 3anickel 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrition 3apecans 3aphotosynthesis 3arisk 3atrees 3aNew Mexico 0aleaf chlorosis 0amicronutrient 0amouse ear 0anutrient deficiency1 aFlynn, Robert Paul1 aHeerema, R.q(Richard),1 aVanLeeuwen, Dawn0 tHortScience.g2020 Feb., v. 55, no. 2 p.231-236dAmerican Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:1941x2327-98347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.21273/HORTSCI14314-193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014800169300001600317520156700333592002801900650001501928650002301943650002501966650001601991650002002007650001902027650001402046650001002060650001902070650001702089650001502106650000902121650001902130650001402149650001402163650001802177650002002195650002202215650002402237650003602261650001502297653000802312653000702320653000802327653001102335653000902346653000702355653001602362653002702378653003002405653002402435700001802459700001602477700001902493700001202512700001902524700001702543700001702560700001702577773013502594856008702729852000902816655001202825IND60677491220221119135647.0220328e20200615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067749122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiaoying10aProtective effects of astragalus polysaccharide nanoparticles on septic cardiac dysfunction through inhibition of TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway  ap. 977-985.  aSepsis-induced myocardial dysfunction was the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients and yet there were no effective therapies. With excessive released inflammatory mediators through the TLR4-trigger NF-κB signaling pathway being implicated as key players in sepsis-induced myocardial injury, we prepared astragalus polysaccharide (APS) nanoparticles as an TLR4-responsive drug for alleviating sepsis-induced myocardial injury. Firstly, treatment with APS nanoparticles in LPS-treated H9c2 cells to evaluate the direct effect demonstrated that this drug maintained the cell viability, cell morphology and exerted anti-apoptotic effects. Additionally, animal studies using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in C57BL/6 mice revealed that APS nanoparticles were much more efficacious in attenuating sepsis-induced myocardial injury by down-regulating the bacterial loads, inhibiting serum C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBC) levels, alleviating myocardial histopathologic abnormalities, remarkably reducing the cardiac troponin I (cTnI). Moreover, APS nanoparticles significantly decreased the myocardial inflammatory cytokine expression and inhibited the activity of TLR4/NF-κB pathway. In conclusion, APS nanoparticles could protect the sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. The mechanism of the protective action of APS nanoparticles seems to involve its ability to reduce inflammatory response and to suppress TLR4/NF-κB pathway. This drug may be a potential candidate strategy for septic cardiac dysfunction treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3aC-reactive protein 3aToll-like receptor 4 3ablood serum 3acell structures 3acell viability 3acytokines 3adrugs 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3amice 3amicrobial load 3amorbidity 3amortality 3ananoparticles 3apolysaccharides 3aprotective effect 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atroponin I 0aAPS 0aCS 0aTPP 0aFE-SEM 0aFTIR 0aN% 0aAPS/DA-Chit 0aMyocardial dysfunction 0aAstragalus polysaccharide 0aTLR4/NF-κB pathway1 aRui, Shaozhen1 aChen, Chong1 aZhang, Guochao1 aLi, Zhi1 aWang, Jianghua1 aLuo, Yanping1 aZhu, Haiping1 aMa, Xingming0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 June 15, v. 153 p.977-985dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2019.10.2273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01149naa a2200205 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245006000130300001200190520054600202592002800748650001200776650000900788773012500797852000900922655001200931IND60300711920221120080916.0150703e20120713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030071192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKintisch, Eli10aEarth and Planetary Scientists Search for Common Ground  ap. 145.  aA unique 4-day meeting, which 125 researchers attended, was cosponsored by four separate NASA science divisions—Earth Science, Heliophysics, Astrophysics, and Planetary Science—a milestone for an agency infamous for bureaucratic stovepiping.

Consumers are also looking for local alternatives to conventionally produced foods. This study compares the sensory aspects of industrially processed gluten free bread and locally produced, artisanal gluten free bread. Three breads were purchased from grocery stores and three from local bakeries. Global Napping® and ultra flash profiling were used to identify the overall differences between the two different categories of gluten free breads. Partial Napping® and ultra flash profiling were also used to determine if there were any differences between flavor and texture of the breads. Twelve panelists, who regularly consume bread, evaluated all six of the bread samples. Both methods indicated that there are many differences between the industrially processed and artisanal gluten free breads. The main differences being artisanal breads were associated with a wide array of flavors and a dry texture, while the industrially processed breads were found to be bland in flavor and moist. Overall, the artisanal gluten free breads were associated with more negative characteristics than that of industrially processed breads.  aPublisher supplied data 3aflavor 3agastronomy 3agluten-free foods 3agrocery stores 3atexture 3atraditional technology 0aGluten free 0aNapping 0aBread 0aArtisanal1 aDuizer, Lisa M.1 aMcSweeney, Matthew B.0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2016 Apr., v. 3 p.38-46dElsevier LtdaAZTI-TecnaliawJournal:21450x1878-45187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2016.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015800169300001600327520102300343592002801366650001401394650002201408650002001430650001301450650000901463650001501472650001701487650001401504650001401518650001401532650002101546650002001567650001601587650001301603653002501616653002101641653000901662653002201671653000901693700001701702700001801719700002701737700002101764700002401785700002001809773010701829856008501936852000902021655001202030IND60560843120221122143811.0170110e20170102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056084312DNAL7 a10.1080/15320383.2017.12465162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlavi, Nadali10aPhytoremediation of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons From Highly Saline and Clay Soil Using Sorghum halepense (L.)

For a period of 180 days, rhizosphere microbial number, plant biomass, and residual TPHs were determined monthly. Results showed that TPH removal from soil in the rhizosphere was 13% higher than that in the control (unplanted soil). In addition, the number of heterotrophic bacteria in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soil was 7.407 and 6.629 log ₁₀CFU/g, respectively. The maximum TPH removal, microbial numbers, and plant biomass were measured in the treated soil, polluted with 0.86% (w/w) of TPH. The high clay and salinity of the experimental soil had a negative effect on the phytoremediation efficiency. Hence, it was necessary to improve the physicochemical properties of the soil to provide a good condition for plants and microbes, thereby increasing the phytoremediation efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeluropus 3aSorghum halepense 3aadverse effects 3abacteria 3aclay 3aclay soils 3ahydrocarbons 3anutrients 3apetroleum 3aphytomass 3aphytoremediation 3aplants (botany) 3arhizosphere 3asalinity 0aAeluropus littoralis 0aphytoremediation 0asoil 0aSorghum halepense 0aTPHs1 aParseh, Iman1 aAhmadi, Mehdi1 aJafarzadeh, Nematollah1 aYari, Ahmad Reza1 aChehrazi, Mehrangiz1 aChorom, Mostafa0 tSoil & sediment contamination.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 26, no. 1 p.127-140dTaylor & Francisx1549-78877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2017.12465163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245008400161300001600245520137100261592002801632650002501660650001601685650001401701650001001715650001601725650001201741650001901753651001801772700002101790700001701811700001801828700001801846700001901864700001901883773016501902856007302067852000902140655001202149IND60340779720221121025041.0150808e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034077972DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.125742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMason, Suzanna C.10aGeographical range margins of many taxonomic groups continue to shift polewards  ap. 586-597.  aMany species are extending their leading‐edge (cool) range margins polewards in response to recent climate change. In the present study, we investigated range margin changes at the northern (cool) range margins of 1573 southerly‐distributed species from 21 animal groups in Great Britain over the past four decades of climate change, updating previous work. Depending on data availability, range margin changes were examined over two time intervals during the past four decades. For four groups (birds, butterflies, macromoths, and dragonflies and damselflies), there were sufficient data available to examine range margin changes over both time intervals. We found that most taxa shifted their northern range margins polewards and this finding was not greatly influenced by changes in recorder effort. The mean northwards range margin change in the first time interval was 23 km per decade (N = 13 taxonomic groups) and, in the second interval, was 18 km per decade (N = 16 taxonomic groups) during periods when the British climate warmed by 0.21 and 0.28 °C per decade, respectively. For the four taxa examined over both intervals, there was evidence for higher rate of range margin change in the more recent time interval in the two Lepidoptera groups. Our analyses confirm a continued range margin shift polewards in a wide range of taxonomic groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnisoptera (Odonata) 3aLepidoptera 3aZygoptera 3abirds 3abutterflies 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aGreat Britain1 aPalmer, Georgina1 aFox, Richard1 aGillings, S.,1 aHill, Jane K.1 aThomas, C.

One of the largest constrains on increasing food security is endemic diseases among livestock and poultry populations. Newcastle Disease (ND) is one of these viral endemic diseases reducing food security. However, the sero- and viro-prevalence of ND has not been thoroughly studied in rural poultry in Bangladesh. Knowledge of farm management practices and their effect on ND sero and viro-prevalence is needed before interventions can occur, and efforts to improve the endemic state of ND cannot begin without a baseline study. This cross-sectional study randomly sampled 129 rural households with 245 chickens for the sero-prevalence and active infection rate of rural chickens in two selected upazilas (sub-districts) of the Chittagong district. ELISA was used for the detection of sero-prevalence, and cloacal samples were analyzed for ND presence using one-step RT-PCR. The aims of this study were to describe farmer demography, determine the ND sero-prevalence at the household and individual chicken level, estimate the proportionate ND prevalence at the individual chicken level, determine potential risk factors for ND sero-prevalence at the household level, and determine challenges farmers face with household chicken farming. The overall household level ND sero-prevalence based on ELISA was 31.8% (41/129) (95% CI: 23.9–40.6%), whereas the overall bird level ND sero-prevalence based on ELISA was 21.2% (52/245) (95% CI: 16.5–26.8%). ND prevalence based on RT-PCR was 12.5% (4/32) (95% CI: 3.5–29.0%). The odds of ND sero-positivity was significantly higher in farms belonging to Rangunia than in farms belonging to Anowara with an odds ratio (OR) of 7.8 (95% CI: 3.3–18.6%). The odds of ND sero-positivity was significantly lower in poultry house cleaning frequency of once or twice weekly compared with once daily cleaning (OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1–0.8%). High cleaning frequency may produce excessive stress on poultry predisposing them to infection. Poultry rearing is different between Anowara and Rangunia. Anowara (coastal) scavenging areas become restricted because of regular tide flow allowing small fishes and other aquatic animals to be the dominant scavengers in Anowara. The incoming tide also removes viral reservoirs such as feces and dead birds that may otherwise be readily accessed by healthy chickens.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNewcastle disease 3achickens 3acleaning 3acloaca 3across-sectional studies 3ademography 3aendemic diseases 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarm management 3afarmers 3afarms 3afeces 3afish 3afood security 3ahealth status 3ahousehold cleaning 3ahouseholds 3aodds ratio 3apoultry housing 3arearing 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3aBangladesh 0aRural poultry 0aChittagong 0aBangladesh 0aNewcastle disease 0aPrevalence1 aRahman, Md.

MGM is an individual tree-based, distance-independent growth model, designed to evaluate growth and yield implications relating to the management of white spruce, black spruce, aspen, lodgepole pine, and mixedwood stands in Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Our validation compared stand-level model predictions against re-measured data (volume, basal area, diameter at breast height (DBH), average and top height and density) from permanent sample plots using combined analysis of residual plots, bias statistics, efficiency and an innovative application of the equivalence test. For state variables, the model effectively simulated juvenile and mature stages of stand development for both pure and mixed species stands of aspen and white spruce in Alberta. MGM overestimates increment in older stands likely due to age-related pathology and weather-related stand damage. We identified underestimates of deciduous density and volume in Saskatchewan. MGM performs well for increment in postharvest stands less than 30 years of age. These results illustrate the comprehensive application of validation metrics to evaluate a complex model, and provide support for the use of MGM in management planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea glauca 3aPicea mariana 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aboreal forests 3adecision making 3agrowth models 3ajuveniles 3aplanning 3aprediction 3astand development 3astatistics 3atree and stand measurements 3aAlberta 3aBritish Columbia 3aManitoba 3aSaskatchewan1 aStadt, Kenneth J.1 aComeau, Philip G.1 aTitus, Stephen J.0 tForests.g2013 Jan. 07, v. 4, no. 1 p.1-27dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f40100013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011900173300001600292520131900308592002801627650002401655650001501679650001301694650001801707650001101725650001001736650001601746650002101762650001501783650001501798650002401813650002701837653002301864653000801887653001501895653002501910653001201935700001701947700002401964773009501988856008702083852000902170655001202179IND60605432020221120110536.0190408e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060543202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Asmari, Fahad14aThe effect of photosensitization mediated by curcumin on storage life of fresh date (Phoenix dactylifera L.) fruit  ap. 305-309.  aThe effect of photosensitization mediated by curcumin (CUR) in sanitizing the fresh date fruit surface was investigated. Approximately 3–4 μl CUR solution ranging from 1000 to 1800 μM was sprayed on the date surface, followed by irradiation using blue light at 420 nm for 10 and 15 min at light dosages of 180 J/cm2 and 270 J/cm2 respectively. After irradiation, the date was stored at 4 °C and 30 °C until fungi was visually observed. The combination of CUR and light resulted in significant (p < 0.05) extension of the shelf life and quality of fresh date. The shelf life of date fruit photosensitized by 1400 μM CUR for 10 min and stored at 30 °C lasted for 14 days in comparison to the 7 days for the control, while date stored at 4 °C lasted 98 days for the photosensitized fruit compared to the control of 28 days under the same conditions. In addition, no changes in physico-chemical characteristics were observed after treatment. The sanitization treatment of photosensitization mediated by CUR indicated a promising strategy in extending the shelf life of fresh date fruit. Clean and green technologies that are environmentally friendly like photosensitization are preferred by consumers to the synthetic chemicals used in conventional practices for sanitizing food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhoenix dactylifera 3ablue light 3acurcumin 3adates (fruit) 3afruits 3afungi 3airradiation 3aphotosensitivity 3asanitizing 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3asustainable technology 0aPhotosensitization 0aCUR 0aDate fruit 0aFungal contamination 0aStorage1 aMereddy, Ram1 aSultanbawa, Yasmina0 tFood control.g2018 Nov., v. 93 p.305-309dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245007100204300002000275520128100295592002801576650003701604650001501641650002801656650002101684650001101705650003001716650001401746650001301760650001401773650001301787700002501800700002001825700005801845700002801903773013801931856008002069852000902149655001202158IND60679457420200331000000.0191228e20191129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067945742DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b077722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuguet, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5432-246810aDFT Simulation of XPS Reveals Cu/Epoxy Polymer Interfacial Bonding  ap. 30917-30925.  aExperiments and computations are performed to assess the interfacial bonding between Cu and a poly-epoxy surface relevant to many applications. The surface of the poly-epoxy is characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy before and after ultrahigh vacuum Cu deposition. Modifications of the XPS spectra are observed, suggesting a strong interaction between specific C and O atoms of the surface with Cu. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are then performed to simulate XPS spectra and to better understand bonding. DFT computations are performed in the framework of the uGTS methodology, which takes initial and final state effects into account, and allows to calculate chemical shifts between the different C 1s and O 1s molecular orbitals with good accuracy, for the pristine surface. DFT calculations are then set to determine the preferential adsorption sites of Cu on different sites of the polymer surface. Finally, XPS simulation of the C 1s and O 1s spectra with Cu adsorbed at these sites matches very well with the experimental spectra, indicating that Cu atoms interact preferentially with hydroxyls to form Cu–O–C bonds, stabilized by a transfer of 0.5 electrons from Cu to O; hence, Cu is partially oxidized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical bonding 3acopper 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrons 3aepoxides 3aoxidation 3apolymers1 aGavrielides, Andreas1 aEsvan, Jérôme1 aMineva, Tzonka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9156-23961 aLacaze-Dufaure, Corinne0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Nov. 29, v. 123, no. 51 p.30917-30925dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b077723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005300140245006000193500002000253520125000273592002801523650002001551650002501571650002001596650002801616650001301644650002001657700002501677700001201702700002101714700002201735773013201757856007501889852000901964655001201973IND60789309420221116191954.0220819e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078930942DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.125192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSy, Bocar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7095-540910aFlood hazard assessment and the role of citizen science  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFlood hazard assessment is at the core of flood risk management. In order to develop an efficient flood hazard assessment, it is of primary importance to have a well‐defined flood scenario encompassing all processes that could occur during an event. Understanding and assessing these processes requires meteorological, topographical and land‐use data as well as historical observations. Nowadays, flood delineation is based upon hydrological and hydraulic modelling, ground data collection, and remote sensing. Despite the advantages of these tools, they also present some specific limitations, either intrinsic to the approaches or linked with constraints of the local context. With the rapid advancement of web 2.0 technologies (e.g., Flickr and Wikimapia) and the increase of the use of participatory research, citizen science has the potential to provide valuable and complementary information at all levels of flood risk management and in particular for flood hazard assessment. After reviewing the capabilities and limitations of the current tools used in flood hazard assessment, this paper demonstrates the role that citizen science can play in providing key information on factors leading to flooding and on flood hazard parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitizen science 3acooperative research 3adata collection 3ahazard characterization 3aland use 3arisk management1 aFrischknecht, Corine1 aDao, Hy1 aConsuegra, David1 aGiuliani, Gregory0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2019 Nov., v. 12, no.

The biosensor was fabricated by adsorbing the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) on graphene-Nafion modified on the surface of glassy carbon electrode via the π–π* stacking interactions. As the negative ssDNA and the steric hindrance, the electron transfer resistance of the electrodes toward the [Fe(CN)6]³⁻/⁴ redox couple was difficult, the electron transfer resistance value increased. In the measurement of HIV gene, ssDNA probe with the target DNA to form double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), the formation of helix induced dsDNA to release from the surface of the biosensor. The decrease in the electron transfer resistance was in logarithmically direct proportion to the concentration of HIV-1 gene over a range from 1.0×10⁻¹³ to 1.0×10⁻¹⁰M. The detection limit of this sensor was 2.3×10⁻¹⁴M. It was found that Nafion could not only stabilize graphene but also increase the dispersion of graphene. The results demonstrate that this graphene-Nafion biosensor possesses good selectivity, acceptable stability and reproducibility for HIV-1 gene detection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3abiosensors 3acomposite materials 3adetection limit 3aelectron transfer 3aferrocyanides 3afilms (materials) 3agenes 3aglassy carbon electrode 3agraphene 3asingle-stranded DNA 0aBiosensor 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy 0aHIV-1 gene 0aGraphene-Nafion composite film1 aWang, Yongdong1 aYang, Haiying0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 89 p.565-569dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.02.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001600295520118700311592002801498650001501526650002701541650002201568650001301590650002001603650001301623650002001636650001701656650001801673650001801691650001901709650001501728650001601743653002601759653001601785653002101801653002801822653001301850700001301863700001301876700001601889700001301905700001901918700001501937773011101952856008302063852000902146655001202155IND60558608120221120082008.0180831e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055860812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.02.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhanjun10aNitrogen-doped graphene-chitosan matrix based efficient chemiluminescent immunosensor for detection of chicken interleukin-4  ap. 558-564.  aChicken interleukin-4 (ChIL-4), which is released by activated type 2 helper (Th2) cells following their stimulation in vitro, is an important indicator for the study of cell-mediated immunity in chickens after infection or vaccination. In this work, the first ChIL-4 chemiluminescent (CL) immunosensor was developed via the immobilization of monoclonal ChIL-4 antibodies on a nitrogen-doped graphene (NG)-chitosan nanocomposite matrix. NG nanosheets were used for the first time in the CL immunoassay to provide a biocompatible microenvironment for the immobilized capture antibody. The ChIL-4 immunosensor was characterized systematically. The proposed immunosensor displayed a wide linear range from 0.05 to 70ngmL⁻¹ and a low detection limit of 0.02ngmL⁻¹ at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. Compared to traditional assay methods, this system was more flexible, simple, rapid, and sensitive. Moreover, this CL immunoassay system had an excellent detection and fabrication reproducibility, a high specificity, an acceptable accuracy, and a high stability. This work enables the specific detection of ChIL-4 and the further study of its role in the immune responses of poultry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acell-mediated immunity 3achemiluminescence 3achickens 3adetection limit 3agraphene 3aimmune response 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ainterleukin-4 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3avaccination 0aChicken interleukin-4 0aImmunoassay 0aChemiluminescent 0aNitrogen-doped graphene 0aCytokine1 aLu, Mimi1 aLi, Juan1 aTan, Zining1 aDai, Hua1 aJiao, Xin’an1 aHu, Xiaoya0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 89 p.558-564dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.02.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002000180245016200200300001800362506007600380520159300456592002802049506003702077650002402114650001602138650002002154650002102174650002202195650001702217650001802234650001602252650001502268650001802283650001402301650001702315650001302332700002502345773010802370856007502478852000902553655001202562IND60532699720221207144753.0160728e20121008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053269972DNAL7 a10.1021/bm30108852doi7 aPMC35901072pmcid7 a229635972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Arpita10aDifferential Uptake of Chemically Modified Cowpea Mosaic Virus Nanoparticles in Macrophage Subpopulations Present in Inflammatory and Tumor Microenvironments  ap. 3320-3326.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere remains a tremendous need to develop targeted therapeutics that can both image and localize the toxic effects of chemotherapeutics and antagonists on diseased tissue while reducing adverse systemic effects. These needs have fostered the development of a nanotechnology-based approach that can combine targeting and toxicity potential. In this study, CPMV nanoparticles were chemically modified with the dye Alexa Flour 488 and were also tandemly modified with PEG1000 followed by AF488; and the derivatized nanoparticles were subsequently added to macrophages stimulated with either LPS (M1) or IL-4 (M2). Previously published studies have shown that M1/M2 macrophages are both present in an inflammatory microenvironment (such as a tumor microenvironment and atherosclerosis) and play opposing yet balancing roles; M2 macrophages have a delayed and progressive onset in the tumor microenvironment (concomitant with an immunosuppression of M1 macrophages). In this study, we show higher uptake of CPMV-AF488 and CPMV-PEG-AF488 by M2 macrophages compared to M1 macrophages. M1 macrophages showed no uptake of CPMV-PEG-AF488. More specifically, M2 macrophages are known to be up-regulated in early atherosclerosis plaque. Indeed, previous work showed that M2 macrophages in plaque also correlate with CPMV internalization. These studies emphasize the potential effectiveness of CPMV as a tailored vehicle for targeting tumor macrophages involved in cancer metastasis or vascular inflammation and further highlight the potential of CPMV in targeted therapeutics against other diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCowpea mosaic virus 3aantagonists 3aatherosclerosis 3afluorescent dyes 3aimmunosuppression 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-4 3amacrophages 3ametastasis 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity1 aManchester, Marianne0 tBiomacromolecules.g2012 Oct. 08, v. 13, no. 10 p.3320-3326dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm30108853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02374naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005100147245018900198300001600387520105200403592002801455650001601483650002101499650001001520650001101530650001501541650003701556653002201593653002101615653001801636653001401654653001801668700001601686700001501702700001701717700001101734700001601745773011201761856008201873852000901955655001201964IND60544115120221118230904.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054411512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.10.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6372-038810aPersimmon tannin alleviates hepatic steatosis in L02 cells by targeting miR-122 and miR-33b and its effects closely associated with the A type ECG dimer and EGCG dimer structural units  ap. 330-341.  aOur previous study showed that persimmon tannin was the main active component being responsible for the anti-hyperlipidemic effect of persimmon extract, but the underlying molecular mechanisms were unclear.

Persimmon tannin significantly reduced L02 cellar lipid accumulation, similar effects were observed in the cells treated with its two characteristic structural subunits A-type ECG dimers and A-type EGCG dimer. Furthermore, the expression of miR-122 and miR-33b and their target genes were also suppressed by persimmon tannin, A-type ECG and A-type EGCG dimer. These results indicated that persimmon tannin improved hepatic steatosis through regulating miR-122 and miR-33b.

We present structures for the ATP-bound state of the clamp loader complex from bacteriophage T4, bound to an open clamp and primer-template DNA. The clamp loader traps a spiral conformation of the open clamp so that both the loader and the clamp match the helical symmetry of DNA. One structure reveals that ATP has been hydrolyzed in one subunit and suggests that clamp closure and ejection of the loader involves disruption of the ATP-dependent match in symmetry. The structures explain how synergy among the loader, the clamp, and DNA can trigger ATP hydrolysis and release of the closed clamp on DNA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abacteriophages 3ahydrolysis 3atraps1 aMakino, Debora L.1 aO’Donnell, Mike1 aKuriyan, John0 tScience.g2011 Dec. 23, v. 334, no. 6063 p.1675-1680dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12118843Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006000152245018000212300001600392520177900408592002802187650004302215650001602258650003202274650002002306650001802326650001802344650001902362650002402381650002702405650003102432650002302463653002702486653001402513653001802527653002202545700002402567700003202591700002902623700002002652773009502672856008702767852000902854655001202863IND60605432220221122003608.0200717e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060543222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabrador, Mirian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9123-403710aComparative evaluation of impedanciometry combined with chromogenic agars or RNA hybridization and real-time PCR methods for the detection of L. monocytogenes in dry-cured ham  ap. 108-115.  aListeria monocytogenes is an important foodborne pathogen of particular relevance in “Ready To Eat” products. Food producers require rapid methods to detect L. monocytogenes, since the reference method (ISO 11290-1) is laborious, lengthy and costly. The aim of this study was to evaluate three alternative methods to detect L. monocytogenes in dry-cured ham following the ISO 16140-2:2016 standard: (A) impedance measurement followed by plating onto chromogenic agars; (B) impedance measurement followed by RNA hybridization, and (C) real-time PCR.Inclusivity and exclusivity were evaluated. The limits of detection 50 (LOD₅₀) and the relative limits of detection (RLOD) were obtained by analysing dry-cured ham samples inoculated with L. monocytogenes at three different levels of contamination. The sensitivity study of alternative methods, as well as the relative specificity (SP), sensitivity (SE), and Kappa Cohen's index were calculated analysing 93 samples of sliced dry-cured ham. The inclusivity and exclusivity tests of three methods showed no interference in pathogen detection. LOD₅₀ were very low for the three methods evaluated (<1 cfu/25 g dry-cured ham). The RLOD values of the three alternative methods were below the acceptability limit established by ISO 16140. For methods A and C, good results were obtained in the sensitivity study, as well as in the SP and SE. However, method B showed poorer results in the sensitivity study, along with lower results for SP (99.7%) and SE (79.6%), due to the occurrence of false positives and negatives in samples with presence of other Listeria spp.Methods A and C were considered to be a thoroughly appropriate control tool for use in the meat industry to improve the detection of L. monocytogenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3acured meats 3alivestock and meat industry 3adetection limit 3afood industry 3arapid methods 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial detection 3aListeria monocytogenes 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aready-to-eat foods 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aDetection 0aRapid methods 0aRTE meat products1 aRota, María Carmen1 aPérez-Arquillué, Consuelo1 aHerrera Casado, Antonio,1 aBayarri, Susana0 tFood control.g2018 Dec., v. 94 p.108-115dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2018.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01393naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245010200156300001600258520021900274592002800493650002300521650002300544650002400567650002700591650001200618650001400630700002700644700001900671700002700690700002400717700002300741700002400764700002300788773012600811856007300937852000901010655001201019IND60658193220221119132646.0190816e20080129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065819322DNAL7 a10.1039/b716533a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLei, Shengbin10aBottom-up assembly of high density molecular nanowire cross junctions at a solid/liquid interface  ap. 703-705.  aA monoalkylated tetrathiafulvalene derivative forms multilayer structures at the solid–liquid interface, with high density of cross junctions, which are interesting for molecular electronic circuit self-assembly.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aelectronic circuits 3aliquid-solid interface 3aliquids 3ananowires1 aPuigmartí-Luis, Josep1 aMinoia, Andrea1 aVan der Auweraer, Mark1 aRovira, Concepció,1 aLazzaroni, Roberto1 aAmabilino, David B.1 aFeyter, Steven De,0 tChemical communications.g2008 Jan. 29, , no. 6 p.703-705dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b716533a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03666naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245011300209300001600322500001900338520220700357592002802564650001402592650002502606650000902631650001302640650001302653650001302666650001102679650001702690650001302707650002102720650001602741653001202757653001602769653001202785653001202797653001802809653002602827653001202853700005902865700005702924773012502981856008103106852000903187655001203196IND60727396420221121151126.0210211e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072739642DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585200002402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPhartyal, Shyam S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3266-661910aSeed germination of mudflat species responds differently to prior exposure to hypoxic (flooded) environments  ap. 268-274.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMudflats are exposed for short periods after flood water drawdown. They support fast-growing annual herbs with a ruderal strategy. To optimize their recruitment success, seeds of mudflat species germinate better under fluctuating temperatures, full illumination and aerobic environments that indicate the presence of optimal (non-flooded) conditions for plant growth and development. Here, we hypothesize that prior exposure of mudflat seeds to hypoxic (flooded) environment interferes with the germination process and results in more vigorous germination once aerobic conditions are regained. To test this hypothesis, seeds of five mudflat species were incubated in both aerobic and hypoxic environments at four (14/6, 22/14, 22/22 and 30/22°C) temperature regimes, reflecting different (seasonal) conditions when drawdowns may occur. All species responded positively to four temperature regimes; however, moderate 22/14 and 22/22°C temperatures were optimum for high percentages and rates (speed) of seed germination. Since seeds of four species germinated exclusively under aerobic conditions, they were moved from hypoxic to aerobic conditions. Prior exposure of seeds to hypoxic environment facilitated high percentages, rates and synchronization of germination of Limosella aquatica, Peplis portula and Samolus valerandi seeds compared to incubation under strict aerobic conditions. However, prior exposure to hypoxic environment induced secondary dormancy in non-dormant seeds of Hypericum humifusum but broke dormancy in Lythrum hyssopifolia seeds that otherwise required cold stratification to overcome physiological dormancy. All species that have a narrow ecological niche (strictly occurring in mudflat habitats) showed positive responses to prior exposure to hypoxic environments. In contrast, H. humifusum that has a wide ecological niche (from mudflats to moist sandy grasslands) showed a negative response. We conclude that the hypoxic environment may strongly affect seed germination behaviour once the aerobic environment is regained. The most striking effect is the acceleration of the germination process and, therefore, life cycle supporting the survival in an ephemeral habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum 3aLythrum hyssopifolia 3acold 3adormancy 3adrawdown 3alighting 3aniches 3aplant growth 3aresearch 3aseed germination 3atemperature 0aflooded 0agermination 0ahypoxia 0amudflat 0aseed dormancy 0asynchronization index 0awetland1 aRosbakh, Sergey1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4599-69431 aPoschlod, P.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4473-76560 tSeed science research.g2020 Dec., v. 30, no. 4 p.268-274dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl50007x1475-27357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585200002403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010800166300001600274520081400290592002801104653001701132653003001149653001801179653001301197653000901210653001001219653001701229653004001246653002201286653001901308653000901327653001001336700001401346700001501360773011801375856008601493852000901579655001201588IND60602549420221119234142.0180711e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060254942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.09.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, E.J.10aCondensation heat transfer and pressure drop in flattened microfin tubes having different aspect ratios  ap. 236-249.  aIn this study, condensation heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops of R-410A are obtained in flattened microfin tubes made from 7.0 mm O.D. round microfin tubes. The test range covers saturation temperature 45 °C, mass flux 100–400 kg m⁻² s⁻¹ and quality 0.2–0.8. Results show that the effect of aspect ratio on condensation heat transfer coefficient is dependent on the flow pattern. For annular flow, the heat transfer coefficient increases as aspect ratio increases. For stratified flow, however, the heat transfer coefficient decreases as aspect ratio increases. The pressure drop always increases as aspect ratio increases. Possible reasoning is provided based on the estimated flow pattern in flat microfin tubes. Comparison with existing round microfin tube correlations is made.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCondensation 0aHeat transfer coefficient 0aPressure drop 0aMicrofin 0aTube 0aR410A 0aCondensation 0aCoefficient de transfert de chaleur 0aChute de pression 0aMicro ailettes 0aTube 0aR410A1 aKim, N.H.1 aByun, H.W.0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2014 Feb., v. 38 p.236-249dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245013900172520146000311592002801771650002401799650002201823650001201845650002001857650002001877650000901897650000901906650001401915650001401929650001301943650001801956650001601974650003101990653001902021653003202040653002002072653003102092700001502123700001402138700001302152700001702165700001702182773009202199856008602291852000902377655001202386IND60705483420221121015011.0201125e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070548342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Yongqiang12aA sandwich temperature control membrane inlet mass spectrometer for dissolved gases and volatile organic compounds in aqueous solution  aA sandwich temperature control membrane inlet system based on a miniature mass spectrometer is presented that demonstrates improved analytical performance for the measurement of dissolved gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in aqueous solution. Aqueous solution is directly brought to the monolayer flat membrane interface at a constant flow rate. A heating resistor and a thermocouple are fixed on the side of the membrane and aqueous solution respectively. This new strategy allows for a temperature compensation method, affording an improvement of sensitivity and a reduction of response time compared with the conventional heating solution temperature control strategy. Furthermore, a static heating mode is applied to effectively remove the memory effect. Automatic sampling and measurement are achieved by using the membrane inlet system with silicone sheeting of 50 μm thickness. The vacuum is below 3 × 10⁻⁵ Torr, which can make the instrument work normally. A good linear response is observed for benzene in the range of 0.1 ppm–10 ppm and the detection limit is 50 ppb. The analytical capacity of this system is demonstrated by the on-line analysis of VOCs in aqueous solution, in which the dominant ions are detected rapidly. The results indicate that the sandwich temperature control membrane inlet mass spectrometer (STC-MIMS) has a potential application for on-line analyzing organic pollution in aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3aaqueous solutions 3abenzene 3adetection limit 3adissolved gases 3aheat 3aions 3apollution 3aresistors 3asilicone 3aspectrometers 3atemperature 3avolatile organic compounds 0aMembrane inlet 0aMiniature mass spectrometer 0aDissolved gases 0aVolatile organic compounds1 aLiu, Maoke1 aZhao, Bin1 aYang, Li1 aGuo, Cuilian1 aZhang, Linbo0 tTalanta.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 221 p.121464-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01905naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245009800201500002000299520074000319592002801059596011701087650001101204650001801215650001601233650001101249650002001260650001501280651001101295700002101306700002401327773013201351856007501483852000901558655001201567IND60789309620221116191823.0220819e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078930962DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.125172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Yin‐Lung1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7765-391310aFlood hazard mitigation in land subsidence prone coastal areas by optimal groundwater pumping  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aContinuing land subsidence can aggravate flood hazard and diminish the effectiveness of existing flood mitigation systems. This paper presents a study of groundwater‐ pumping management for mitigating flood hazard in a subsidence infested area in the southwest coast of Taiwan. An optimal groundwater‐pumping model is developed for preventing flood hazard from worsening and for satisfying the groundwater demand. In an area where the land is susceptible to pumping‐induced subsidence, the study shows that proper long‐term pumping strategy to manage spatial–temporal variation of future land subsidence should be an integral part of flood risk management as it can sustain the effectiveness of the flood mitigation measures.  aPublisher supplied data  aMOEAWRA1020238cWater Resources Planning Institute, Water Resources Agency, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Taiwan 3acoasts 3aflood control 3agroundwater 3amodels 3arisk management 3asubsidence 3aTaiwan1 aTsai, Tung‐Lin1 aYang, Jinn‐Chuang0 tJournal of flood risk management.g2019 Nov., v. 12, no.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibody response of M. bovis–infected deer to crude mycobacterial antigens. Deer were experimentally inoculated with M. bovis strain 1315 either by intratonsilar instillation or by exposure to M. bovis-infected (i.e., in contact) deer. To determine the time course of the response, including the effects of antigen administration for comparative cervical skin testing, serum was collected periodically and evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for immunoglobulin (i.e., IgG heavy and light chains) reactivity to mycobacterial antigens. The reactivity to M. bovis purified protein derivative (PPDb) exceeded (P < 0.05) the reactivity to M. avium PPD (PPDa) only after in vivo administration of PPDa and PPDb for comparative cervical testing of the infected deer. The mean immunoglobulin response, as measured by ELISA, of intratonsilar-inoculated deer to a proteinase K-digested whole-cell sonicate (WCS-PK) of M. bovis strain 1315 exceeded (P < 0.05) the mean of the prechallenge responses to this antigen at approximately 1 month after inoculation and throughout the remainder of the study (i.e., ∼11 months). This response also exceeded (P < 0.05) that of the uninfected deer. Although this is encouraging, further studies are necessary to validate the use of the proteinase K-digested M. bovis antigens in the antibody-based assays of tuberculosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeer 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aMycobacterium bovis 3aantigens 3aantibody detection 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aAntigens, Bacterialxanalysis 2aDeerxmicrobiology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aImmunoglobulin Gxanalysis 2aMycobacterium bovisximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aTuberculosisxveterinary1 aPalmer, Mitchell V.1 aWhipple, Diana L.0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 14, no. 6 p.470-475dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638702014006043Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/186523Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02724naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008200165300001600247520141900263592002801682650002001710650001501730650001801745650001401763650001701777650002101794650001501815650001801830650001801848650002001866650001301886653004201899653002301941653001901964653001501983653002201998700001502020700001502035700001702050773011902067856008302186852000902269655001202278IND60752540020221121024153.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075254002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tifs.2021.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Wangyan10aPlant-sourced intrinsic dietary fiber: Physical structure and health function  ap. 341-355.  aPlant-sourced intrinsic dietary fiber (PIDF), mainly composed of nondigestible polysaccharides in a cell wall form, is often existed in plant tissue particles in which the physical structure of the particle size, density and spatial organization of food component as well as the intactness and porosity of cell wall are critical to its physicochemical properties and health functions. However, there is limited information of PIDF compared to isolated and purified DF that is a chemical entity without association with the food context.The health benefit and physical structures of PIDF are emerging as a new research area in the field of DF although there is still limited information in the literature reports. In the current article, available information on the relationship between the physical structure and the physiological function as well as resulted health benefits of PIDF in a whole food context were reviewed in conjunction with food processing.The physical structure of PIDF is a critical factor modulating the intestinal digestion and bioavailability of intracellular nutrients. PIDF can exert its health function through a physical structure-specific microbial fermentation and/or microbiota-independent pathways. A holistic approach to reveal the relationship between the physical structure and health function of PIDF will shed novel insight into the designing of PIDF enriched functional foods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acell walls 3adietary fiber 3adigestion 3afermentation 3afood composition 3aintestines 3aparticle size 3aplant tissues 3apolysaccharides 3aporosity 0aPlant-sourced intrinsic dietary fiber 0aPhysical structure 0aFermentability 0aWhole food 0aHolistic approach1 aSun, Lijun1 aMiao, Ming1 aZhang, Genyi0 tTrends in food science & technology.g2021 Dec., v. 118 p.341-355dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45707x0924-22447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2021.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006800147245010000215300001600315500001900331520171900350592002802069650002502097650001802122650001502140650001402155650001302169650002202182650001302204650002102217650001702238650002302255653002702278653001702305653001702322653001702339653002402356653001702380700002002397700002102417773012502438856008102563852000902644655001202653IND60727396520221121145805.0210211e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072739652DNAL7 a10.1017/S09602585200002762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeveridge, Fernanda Caro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4891-484310aSeed enhancement technologies to improve germination and emergence of Australian native Poaceae  ap. 293-303.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUsing seeds to restore natural ecosystems has a greater chance of success if the seeds used are ready to germinate given appropriate environmental conditions. For Australian native Poaceae species, seed quality and dormancy can impose constraints on restoration success. In this study, germination biology of three Australian native Poaceae species, such as Cymbopogon refractus, Capillipedium spicigerum and Bothriochloa bladhii, was investigated. The seeds were exposed to different germination-enhancing chemicals (GECs, namely smoke water (SW), potassium nitrate (KNO₃) or a combination (SW + KNO₃)) and treated with three different seed enhancement technologies (SETs, namely seed priming, seed coating or seed cookies) then sown into two contrasting soil types (sodosol or black vertisol). Laboratory germination percentages achieved were <50% for all species, limited by dormant seeds. Incorporating GECs together with seed priming or seed coating treatment significantly increased seedling emergence rates and promoted earlier emergence as compared to the untreated control. For C. refractus and C. spicigerum, priming and/or coating with KNO₃ + SW had the highest cumulative emergence. For B. bladhii, total seedling emergence was the highest (36% in both soils) for primed seeds with KNO₃. Seedling emergence from seed cookies was low in all three species (<15%). Generally, soil type did not influence emergence rates for either GEC or SET. Understanding the environmental requirements needed for seed germination, together with an appropriate pre-treatment before sowing, can speed up seedling emergence and increase total emergence when using native Poaceae species for seed-based restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBothriochloa bladhii 3aCapillipedium 3aCymbopogon 3aVertisols 3adormancy 3apotassium nitrate 3aresearch 3aseed germination 3aseed quality 3aseedling emergence 0aseed-based restoration 0aseed coating 0aseed cookies 0aseed ecology 0aseed pre-treatments 0aseed priming1 aWilliams, Alwyn1 aAdkins, Steve W.0 tSeed science research.g2020 Dec., v. 30, no. 4 p.293-303dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl50007x1475-27357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585200002763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01435naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245012600166300001600292520037700308592002800685650000800713650001300721650002100734650001500755650001400770650001100784653001400795653001400809653001600823700002200839773015000861856007701011852000901088655001201097IND60522229520221119111844.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052222952DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-05212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitzel, Norbert W.12aA Hydrogen Bonded Aluminium Alkoxide Hydroxide Aggregate Resulting from the Exposure of Methylaluminium Dichloride to Air  ap. 489-492.  aExposure of methylaluminium dichloride to air results in the formation of a crystalline hydrolysis/ oxidation product of the composition [(MeOAlCl₂)₃][(MeOAlCl₂)₂(HOAlCl₂)], which is linked by a H···Cl hydrogen bond in the solid state.

This study aims to explore the effects of wind on DPHP measurements and to compare the performance of the ILS and ILS‐ABC models at different values of wind velocity (υ) and burial depth (d). Our study shows that the results of laboratory experiments, COMSOL simulations, and field experiments are consistent with each other. For dry sand with d ≤ 4 mm, the effects of wind is non‐negligible at υ ≥ 3.5 m s⁻¹ and the DPHP method does not provide accurate estimations whether the ILS model or the ILS‐ABC model is used. Field experiments are prone to large background temperature fluctuations, which can cause a commonly used linear detrending method to perform poorly. In general, at υ < 2.7 m s⁻¹ in field and d = 5 mm, the ILS‐ABC model provides more accurate estimations with relative errors of <15% in thermal conductivity and relative errors of <9% in heat capacity.  aPublisher supplied data  a41771257cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0800102cNational Key Research and Development Program of China 3aheat 3amodels 3asand 3asoil-atmosphere interactions 3atemperature 3athermal conductivity 3awind speed1 aLiu, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2765-05351 aHorton, Robert0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2020 Mar., v. 84, no. 2 p.414-424dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/saj2.200413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01182naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245007100159300001600230520028400246592002800530650001500558650002300573650002300596650002600619700001900645700002100664773012500685856007300810852000900883655001200892IND60658193420221119132223.0190816e20080206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065819342DNAL7 a10.1039/b716568d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPilling, Adam W.10aSite isolated base and acid catalyzed azaspirocyclization cascades  ap. 832-834.  aA one-pot, site isolated base (PS-BEMP) and acid (Si-TsOH) catalyzed cyclization cascade to azaspirocyclic molecules is reported; the reaction is simple to perform, atom efficient (water is the only byproduct) and broad in its scope to a diverse range of azaspirocyclic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical compounds 3acyclization reactions1 aBöhmer, Jutta1 aDixon, Darren J.0 tChemical communications.g2008 Feb. 6, , no. 7 p.832-834dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b716568d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015000171500001900321520108300340592002801423650002301451650001301474650002001487650002201507650001301529650002201542650001501564650001901579653002701598653002301625653003101648653001501679700002901694700001501723700001601738700001401754700001601768773010701784856008701891852000901978655001201987IND60697102920221121072731.0200628e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069710292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1235972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xuejiao10aNitrate assimilation, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium, and denitrification coexist in Pseudomonas putida Y-9 under aerobic conditions  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe specific nitrate reduction pathway in Pseudomonas putida Y-9 under aerobic conditions was studied. Strain Y-9 removed 82% of the nitrate accompanied by an accumulation of ammonium and a decrease of total nitrogen. Ammonium inhibited nitrate transformation (removal efficiency was 22.65%), illustrating that nitrate assimilation exists in strain Y-9. The detectable ammonium in the supernatant during the nitrate reduction process came from intracellular locations in strain Y-9. The nirBD that encodes nitrite reductase had an important role in strain growth and ammonium production. A ¹⁵N isotope experiment demonstrated that strain Y-9 can conduct dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) and nirBD controls this process. This further indicated that the loss of total nitrogen is due to denitrification. All results highlighted that strain Y-9 performs simultaneous nitrate assimilation, DNRA, and denitrification under aerobic conditions, and nirBD controls the assimilation and DNRA process. Thereinto, nitrate assimilation dominates the removal of nitrate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas putida 3aammonium 3adenitrification 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrite reductase 3atechnology 3atotal nitrogen 0aPseudomonas putida Y-9 0aAerobic conditions 0a15N-incubation experiments 0anirBD gene1 aWeisener, Christopher G.1 aNi, Jiupai1 aHe, Binghui1 aXie, Deti1 aLi, Zhenlun0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Sept., v. 312 p.123597-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1235973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01392naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245003100168300001400199520045800213592002800671650001900699650001900718650001200737650001500749650000700764650001100771653001200782653001300794653002300807773014400830856008300974852000901057655001201066IND60527896120221119224216.0190416e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052789612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2016.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldfarb, Will10aMaking a Balinese Meringue  ap. 12-18.  aA new concept in meringue is introduced.

Among the possible combinations tested, cinnamon/clove oil combination showed synergistic antibacterial activity against foodborne bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and synergistic antifungal activity against Aspergillus niger as well as synergistic antioxidant potential in DPPH radical scavenging model system. GC–HRMS analysis revealed that out of thirteen identified components from clove oil, eugenol was found to be the main constituent of the oil; whereas out of twenty one identified constituents from cinnamon oil, the main component was cinnamaldehyde. Cinnamon/clove oil combination did not show any cytotoxic potential at recommended dosage level (IC₅₀ > 2000 µg/ml). The results provide evidence that cinnamon/clove oil combination might indeed be used as a potential source of safe and effective novel natural antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant blend in the food and pharmaceutical industries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a combination of essential oils has been tested as natural preservatives to prevent both microbial proliferation and oxidative deterioration at sufficiently low concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aantifungal properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablack pepper 3acinnamon 3acinnamon oil 3aclove oil 3acytotoxicity 3aeugenol 3aoils1 aBhattacharya, A.1 aBag, A.1 aChattopadhyay, R.

This study aims to test the effect of licorice on pulmonary fibrosis (PF). PF was induced in mice through bleomycin instillation. One group of the mice received bleomycin (positive control), another one received phosphate-buffered saline and the other two received 300 mg/kg of the extracts for 20 days after the bleomycin instillation. Hematoxylin-eosin and Masson’s staining were used in the lung tissues. The expression of α -SMA, TGF- β 1, IL-1 β , and TNF- α were evaluated using reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. Bleomycin led to tissue-degenerative changes, collagen deposition, and overexpression of the genes in the lung tissues. In the mice receiving the aqueous extract, the weight gain was higher (p < .004), and tissue-degenerative changes (p < .001) and collagen deposition were lower than the positive control. The expressions of the genes were lower than the positive control. These results were not observed in the hydroalcoholic extract. Aqueous extract of licorice alleviated the severity of PF.  aPublisher supplied data 3acollagen 3afibrosis 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alicorice 3alungs 3amice 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweight gain 0aPulmonary fibrosis 0ableomycin 0alicorice 0acytokine 0amice1 aRezaee, Mohammad Ali1 aRezaie, Mohammad Jafar1 aMohammadi, Mehdi1 aJalīlī, ʻAlī,1 aRahmani, Mohammad Reza0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2017 Jan. 2, v. 28, no. 1 p.67-77dTaylor & Francisx1465-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2016.12032943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02565naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010900163300001600272520100900288592002801297650003401325650002001359650001601379650002501395650002301420650001201443650001601455650001701471650001501488650002201503650003201525650005801557653002501615653002501640653002101665653002701686653001801713653002001731700001701751700001801768700001401786700001501800700002001815700002101835773011201856856008201968852000902050655001202059IND60544115620221118230115.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054411562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.10.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeng, Wuyin10aAntioxidant properties of fractions isolated from blue shark (Prionace glauca) skin gelatin hydrolysates  ap. 342-351.  aAntioxidative fractions were isolated from hydrolyzed blue shark skin gelatin with Protamex, and the DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging abilities were investigated. The IC50 values of hydrolysates to scavenge DPPH and hydroxyl radical signals were 13.30 and 4.30 mg/mL, respectively. Three fractions (I, II, III) were obtained after separated by Sephadex G-15 gel filtration. The IC50 values of fraction III to scavenge DPPH and hydroxyl radical signals were 0.57 and 2.04 mg/mL, respectively, which were close to glutathione. It was found that fraction III was mainly composed of four peptides and four amino acids by RP-HPLC and ESI–MS/MS analysis, including Glu-Gly-Pro, Gly-Pro-Arg, Gly-Tyr, Gly-Phe, Leu, Arg, Tyr and Phe. The activity assessments for these components indicated that the dipeptide of Gly-Tyr and amino acid of Tyr were important for the excellent antioxidant activities. It is concluded that fraction III has a great potential as natural functional materials for supplement.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aPrionace glauca 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3agel chromatography 3agelatin 3aglutathione 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 0aGelatin hydrolysates 0aAntioxidant peptides 0aPeptide sequence 0aAmino acid composition 0aFree radicals 0aBlue shark skin1 aTang, Lanlan1 aWang, Baozhou1 aChen, Jun1 aSu, Wenjin1 aOsako, Kazufumi1 aTanaka, Munehiko0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Nov., v. 11 p.342-351dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2014.10.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010700165300001600272520162400288592002801912650001501940650002001955650002101975650001501996650002202011650001102033650001202044650000902056650001802065650001302083650001502096650003102111650001902142650001702161653001802178653001702196653002002213653002202233653001402255700001802269700001702287700002502304700002102329773011102350856008302461852000902544655001202553IND60558608520221120081934.0180831e20170315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055860852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2016.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParlak, Onur10aStructuring Au nanoparticles on two-dimensional MoS2 nanosheets for electrochemical glucose biosensors  ap. 545-550.  aTwo-dimensional (2D) bioelectronics is an emerging field of research which fuses the advantages of 2D nanomaterials with those of nanobiotechnology. Due to the various physical and chemical properties present in layered counterparts of 2D materials, including high charge density, large surface area, remarkable electron mobility, ready electron transport, sizeable band gaps and ease of hybridisation, they are set to become a versatile tool to fabricate sensitive and selective novel biodevices, which might offer an unique advantages to tackle key energy, medical and environmental issues. Current 2D bioelectronics research is focused on the design of simple-to-use and cheaper biodevices, while improving their selectivity, sensitivity and stability. However, current designs generally suffer from a lack of efficiency, relatively low sensitivity, slow electron transfer kinetics, high background charging current and low current density arising from poor mass transport. Here, we report a nanoparticle-structured MoS2 nanosheet as an ideal semiconductor interface, which is able to form a homogenous layer on the electrode surface for the assembly of gold nanoparticles. This not only enhances electrocatalytic reactions, but also provides excellent electrochemical properties such as high faradic-to-capacitive current ratios, high current density and electron mobility, and faster mass transport, due to the dominance of radial diffusion. The MoS2/Au NPs/GOx bioelectrode exhibits a linear response to glucose from 0.25 to 13.2mM, with a detection limit of 0.042µM (S/N=3) and sensitivity of 13.80µA/µM/cm².  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aglucose 3agold 3amass transfer 3ananogold 3ananosheets 3aphysicochemical properties 3asemiconductors 3asurface area 0aSelf-assembly 0a2D materials 0aMoS2 nanosheets 0aNano-biointerface 0aBiosensor1 aİncel, Anıl1 aUzun, Lokman1 aTurner, Anthony P.F.1 aTiwari, Ashutosh0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Mar. 15, v. 89 p.545-550dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2016.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245006700164300001600231520087000247592002801117650001301145650001401158650002401172650001401196650001401210650001301224650001601237653001401253653002501267653001401292700002301306700002201329773015001351856007701501852000901578655001201587IND60522229720221119111821.0160602e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052222972DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-2003-06012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKotzybaa, Gunter10aMagnetic Properties of Compounds RE2Cu2Mg (RE = Y, La, Pr, Nd)  ap. 497-500.  aThe Mo₂FeB₂ type magnesium intermetallics RE₂Cu₂Mg (RE = Y, La, Pr, Nd) were synthesized from the elements by reactions in sealed tantalum tubes in a high-frequency furnace.

However, how the interaction of wind speed, canopy type and diaspore attributes affects interception of diaspores by the plant canopy has rarely been studied. We investigated canopy interception for 29 species with different diaspore attributes, six canopy types and six wind speeds in controlled experiments in a wind tunnel. Shrub canopy interception of diaspores were controlled by wind speed and diaspore attributes, but the latter had a greater influence on canopy interception than the former. At low wind speed, diaspore wing loading had a large influence on canopy interception, whereas at high wind speed, diaspore projection area had a large influence. The chance of canopy interception at a particular wind speed was additionally affected by the type of canopy. This study increases our knowledge of the dispersal process, corrects the previous understanding of diaspore dispersal potential and improves the theoretical basis for predicting spatial pattern and dynamics of plant populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanopy 3ashrubs 3awater interception 3awind speed 3awind tunnels 0acanopy type 0adiaspore appendage type 0adiaspore morphology 0awind tunnel1 aLiu, Zhimin1 aLiu, Minghu1 aLiang, Wei1 aBaskin, Carol C.1 aBaskin, Jerry M.1 aXin, Zhiming1 aLi, Xinle1 aWang, Zhigang1 aZhou, Quanlai1 aLuo, Fengmin1 aGao, Junliang1 aNaren, Gerile0 tSeed science research.g2020 Dec., v. 30, no. 4 p.310-318dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl50007x1475-27357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09602585200004103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03209naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245015400169520186000323592002802183650002602211650003602237650001802273650002302291650001902314650000902333650002002342650001702362650001202379650002802391650001102419653003102430653002202461653001402483653000802497653002302505700001602528700002602544773012002570856008802690852000902778655001202787IND60760291720221117225730.0220124e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076029172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1061132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aLinking corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices and organizational performance in the construction industry: A resource collaboration network  aCorporate social responsibility (CSR) has been touted as an important agenda among construction practitioners. Hitherto, the nexus between CSR and organizational performance is still a lack of investigation in the CSR in construction knowledge. This study explores the capabilities of various CSR practices toward achieving productive business benefits among construction firms. Firstly, a two-stage variable formulation procedure results in a list of practices and the perceived benefits of CSR. Then, we collected data from ninety extra-grade construction firms through an online questionnaire survey and analyzed data using a two-mode social network analysis approach. The results of the centrality analysis show that, with the highest centrality scores in the network, (i) the most influential CSR practices include such as “implement safety production management system” and “constrain consumption of materials and reduce material waste”; and (ii) the top key perceived benefits of CSR include such as “local and overseas business opportunities,” “brand, image, and reputation,” and “reduction of supply risk of building materials.” The developed CSR practice-perceived benefit network presents a core-periphery structure, with 26 practices and five perceived benefits situate in the core positions and have intensive relationships. Drawing upon the integrated stakeholder theory and the contingency resource-based view of firms, the demystified novel CSR resource collaboration network enriches the theoretical discourses of CSR by recognizing stakeholder salience and the need for relationship management. Practically, the findings of this study provide a helpful reference for practitioners to collaborate corporate resources, optimize their current CSR strategies, and improve business performance for sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstruction industry 3acorporate social responsibility 3adata analysis 3amanagement systems 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3asocial networks 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3awastes 0aOrganizational performance 0aPerceived benefit 0aPractices 0aSNA 0aConstruction firms1 aOo, Bee Lan1 aLim, Benson Teck Heng0 tResources, conservation, and recycling.g2022 Apr., v. 179 p.106113-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11928x0921-34497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2021.1061133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245014600167300001600313520110300329592002801432650001201460650001801472650003101490650001201521650001401533650001501547650001601562650003601578650001101614650002001625650001601645650002101661650001701682650001601699650000901715653002501724653001601749653002101765653001801786653001401804653002501818700002801843700002301871700002801894700002101922700002201943700002201965700002201987700001802009700003202027773011202059856008202171852000902253655001202262IND60544115720221118230455.0190415e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054411572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2014.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZorrilla, Pedro10aIntestinal anti-inflammatory activity of the polyphenolic-enriched extract Amanda® in the trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid model of rat colitis  ap. 449-459.  aAlternative herbal therapy is increasingly used for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but it is essential to prove its safety and efficacy. We have assayed the anti-inflammatory effects of Amanda®, a standardized water extract of Spanish Marcona almond skin very rich in polyphenols, in the trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS) model of rat colitis. Amanda® reduced the inflamed/ulcerated colonic area and preserved the mucosal architecture. The extract decreased the inflammatory infiltrate and the myeloperoxidase activity, as well as improved the oxidative state by increasing the glutathione content. Amanda® also modulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Besides, Amanda® improved the epithelial barrier function by restoring the levels of villin and mucin MUC3. Thus, the data from this work prove that Amanda® extract possesses therapeutic activity in TNBS-induced colitis in rats, targeting different pathological factors of IBD like oxidative stress, neutrophil mucosal infiltration and loss of intestinal epithelial barrier function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmonds 3aanimal models 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acolitis 3acytokines 3aepithelium 3aglutathione 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3amucins 3amyeloperoxidase 3aneutrophils 3aoxidative stress 3aphytotherapy 3apolyphenols 3arats 0aAntioxidant activity 0aPolyphenols 0aTNBS rat colitis 0aPrunus dulcis 0aCytokines 0aEpithelial integrity1 aRodriguez-Nogales, Alba1 aAlgieri, Francesca1 aGarrido-Mesa, Natividad1 aOlivares, Monica1 aRondón, Deyanira1 aZarzuelo, Antonio1 aUtrilla, Ma Pilar1 aGalvez, Julio1 aRodriguez-Cabezas, Ma Elena0 tJournal of functional foods.g2014 Nov., v. 11 p.449-459dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2014.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245021300170500001900383520100800402592002801410650002901438650001701467650002801484650002801512650003101540650001601571650002201587650001701609650001601626650000701642650001901649650001101668650001301679650001401692653002501706653002201731653002401753700001801777700001701795700001801812700001501830700001801845700001501863700001501878773010701893856008702000852000902087655001202096IND60697103120221121054147.0200628e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069710312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1236002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tianwei10aEffects of Lactobacillus hilgardii 60TS-2, with or without homofermentative Lactobacillus plantarum B90, on the aerobic stability, fermentation quality and microbial community dynamics in sugarcane top silage  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study investigated the effects of Lactobacillus hilgardii (LH), alone or in combination with Lactobacillus plantarum (LP), on the aerobic stability, fermentation quality and dynamics of the bacterial and fungal communities of sugarcane top silage. Results demonstrated that LH and LHLP (LH combined with LP) improved the aerobic stability of sugarcane top silages. As the exposure time increased, the pH values and the contents of lactic acid, acetic acid, as well as propionic acid remained stable in silage treated with LH and LHLP. The abundance of L. hilgardii was enriched and the undesirable microorganisms, such as Acetobacter pasteurianus, Paenibacillus amylolyticus and yeasts like Kazachstania humilis, were suppressed in silages treated with LH and LHLP. In conclusion, LH-treated silage, whether with LP or not, positively impacted the fungal and bacterial microbes. This improved the quality of fermentation, the aerobic stability, and reduced aerobic spoilage in sugarcane top silage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcetobacter pasteurianus 3aKazachstania 3aLactobacillus hilgardii 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aPaenibacillus amylolyticus 3aacetic acid 3aexposure duration 3afermentation 3alactic acid 3apH 3apropionic acid 3asilage 3aspoilage 3asugarcane 0aSugarcane top silage 0aAerobic stability 0aMicrobial community1 aTeng, Kunling1 aCao, Yanhong1 aShi, Weixiong1 aXuan, Zeyi1 aZhou, Jianhui1 aZhang, Jie1 aZhong, Jin0 tBioresource technology.g2020 Sept., v. 312 p.123600-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2020.1236003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01490naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245006300173300001800236520043000254592002800684650002200712650002300734650002300757650001700780650001800797653002800815653002400843653001600867653001700883653002000900700002500920773010400945856008201049852000901131655001201140IND60615963720221119164950.0181025e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061596372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2018.09.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, Kavirayani R.10aEfficient enantiospecific synthesis of ent-conduramine F-1  ap. 6689-6693.  aAn efficient enantiospecific total synthesis of ent-conduramine F-1 (aminocyclohexenetriol) was accomplished starting from the bis-Weinreb amide of tartaric acid.

Slow ambipolar (ionic and electronic) diffusion kinetics are another disadvantage suffered by transition metal oxides. This intrinsic drawback inevitably causes a poor rate capability of transition metal oxides. SnO₂ is an attractive candidate as an anode material for next-generation LIBs due to its high theoretical capacity, low cost and improved safety. In this article, a sandwich-structured carbon nanofiber@SnO₂@carbon coating (C@SnO₂@C) nanofiber bundle was facilely prepared by using collagen fiber, a typical fibrous protein, as the biotemplate as well as the carbon source. The hierarchical architecture of the C@SnO₂@C nanofiber bundle guaranteed a good match between the electron transport kinetics and the Li⁺ diffusion kinetics, thus realizing efficient ambipolar diffusion. Another merit that originated from the configuration of the C@SnO₂@C nanofiber bundle was the unique “breath” behavior, which effectively accommodated the volume change of SnO₂ so as to ensure structural integrity with the formation of the smooth and thin solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The C@SnO₂@C nanofiber bundle showed obvious advantages both in rate capability and cycling stability as compared with those of conventional carbon/SnO₂ nanocomposites, including a C@SnO₂ nanofiber bundle and SnO₂@C nanofiber bundle. Our strategy developed here may be extended for the synthesis of other high-performance anode materials, especially for transition metal oxides that suffered from poor electrical conductivity and/or huge volumetric change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acoatings 3acollagen 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3aphysiological transport 3atin dioxide1 aLi, Jingze1 aChen, Zeui1 aLei, Lijie1 aLiao, Xuepin1 aHuang, Xin1 aShi, Bi0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Dec. 6, v. 4, no. 48 p.18783-18791dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta06622d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03216naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006100140245008400201500002000285520140000305592002801705596002301733596010701756596005001863596006501913596006401978596006502042650002302107650002002130650002202150650002002172650002202192650000902214650002002223650001602243650001602259651001102275700005502286700007002341700006302411700006802474773013202542856007502674852000902749655001202758IND60789310020221120025242.0220819e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078931002DNAL7 a10.1111/jfr3.124982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFava, Maria Clara1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8201-433910aFlood modelling using synthesised citizen science urban streamflow observations  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe increase in floods and flash floods over the last decades has motivated researchers to develop improved methodologies for flood risk prevention and warning. Flood forecasting models available today have evolved technologically but are subject to limitations due to the lack of data and limited community participation. This paper presents the Hydrological Alert Model with Participatory Basis (HAMPB) model, an approach for integrating water level data reported by citizens, which has the advantage of being inexpensive and potentially highly available, with traditional data to improve flood forecasting. The model assimilates spatiotemporal water levels measured in the field when they are available through a real‐time estimator. We added random perturbations of up to |10| and |15| cm to those data using the Monte Carlo Method to mimic the uncertainty in citizen science data collection. Applying the HAMPB model for urban nested‐scale catchments (0.11 km² ≤ Area ≤ 21.84 km²) in Brazil shows: (a) significant improvements in flood simulations when field data was assimilated even considering the volunteered data uncertainty; (b) capability to update simulations in more than one point in the semi‐distributed hydrological model by a regionalization method; and (c) flood hazard indexes and their uncertainties show better estimations using field data for updating.  aPublisher supplied data  cCAPES/PROEX PPGSHS  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior‐ Brasil (CAPES) ‐ Finance Code 001  a24/2014cCEPED/USP project “Pro‐Alerts”  aCAPES/FAPS No 16/2014cINCT‐Climate Change Project Phase 2  aCNPq 465501/2014‐1cINCT‐Climate Change Project Phase 2  aFAPESP 2014/50848‐9cINCT‐Climate Change Project Phase 2 3aMonte Carlo method 3acitizen science 3acommunity service 3adata collection 3ahydrologic models 3arisk 3arisk management 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3aBrazil1 aAbe, Narumi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2212-34421 aRestrepo‐Estrada, Camilo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7953-17681 aKimura, Bruno Y.

Micro-sized bacteria was found to be able to capture aptamers@BSA-AuNCs and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), thus promoting the proximity of aptamers@BSA-AuNCs to TMB and greatly increasing the local concentrations of the enzyme-mimetic nanoparticles and their substrate. As a result, addition of bacteria promoted the formation of blue products in the catalytic system, which was utilized to achieve bacteria detection by colorimetry. The parameters influencing the colorimetric aptasensor were optimized by an orthogonal test. Under the selected conditions, the aptasensor exhibited a wide linear response to S. typhimurium in the concentration range of 10¹–10⁶ cfu mL⁻¹ with a detection limit as low as 1 cfu mL⁻¹. The feasibility of the aptasensor was verified by successful detection of S. typhimurium in egg samples with recoveries in the range of 92.4%–110%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aaptasensors 3abacteria 3abovine serum albumin 3acatalytic activity 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aeggs 3amicrobial detection 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aoligonucleotides 0aSalmonella typhimurium 0a3,3′,5,5′ 0aTetramethylbenzidine 0aNanoenzyme 0aColorimetric aptasensor 0aEnrichment1 aGao, Ran1 aJia, Li0 tTalanta.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 221 p.121476-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245011000210300001800320520136200338592002801700650001501728650001901743650001301762650000901775650002001784650001501804650001201819650001301831650001701844650001601861650001301877650001101890650001701901650002101918650002001939651001201959700001801971773009601989856008102085852000902166655001202175IND60724949420221120051737.0210124e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072494942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2018.06.1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElgamouz, Abdelaziz1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6667-751110aDataset in the production of composite clay-zeolite membranes made from naturally occurring clay minerals  ap. 2267-2278.  aThe data presented in this article are generated as part of the research article entitled “from a naturally occurring material (clay mineral) to the production of porous ceramic membranes” (Elgamouz and Tijani, 2018) [1]. This article describe how clays as very abundant versatile materials that have many properties not available in pure materials namely, silica, alumina and zirconia can be used for the preparation of ceramic membranes (Karaborni et al., 1996; Oun et al., 2017; Hollanders et al., 2016; de Oliveira Henriques et al., 2017) [2–5]. This paper presents data obtained at different stages of the fabrication of a clay-zeolite composite ceramic membrane made from a largely available clay from the central region of Morocco (Meknes). The data include the characterization of the clay powder using XRD, FTIR, thermogravimetric (TGA and TDA) analysis of the clay powder. The data of porosity, mesoporosity, specific surface area, volumes of the pores, volumes of mesopores, diameters of the pores using mercury intrusion porosimetry and adsorption desorption of nitrogen data that was computed from BET and BJH theories of the clay supports at different firing temperatures (700, 750, 800, 850 and 900 °C).

With the aid of first principles calculations, we investigated the properties of a g-C₃N₄ monolayer with a series of nonmetal (NM) ions adsorbed on its surface. The obtained results revealed that the adsorbed solute ions can form NM–N or NM–C bonds with the g-C₃N₄ monolayer and result in bond relaxation, altering the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum synchronously. The small coverage rate of Br, Cl and I ions enhances the redox ability of g-C₃N₄ synchronously, while the adsorption of the other solute ions enhances the oxidizability and weakens the reducibility. In addition, the adsorption of solute ions can alter the active sites by impacting the distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. Therefore, we can adjust the electronic, optical performances and redox ability of a g-C₃N₄ monolayer by selecting the suitable type and quantity of solute ions, e.g., the photocatalytic efficiency of g-C₃N₄ can be enhanced by H ions plus B, N, Si, O, P and As ions with high coverage rates plus halogen ions with low coverage rates while it is suppressed by C, S, Se and Te ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3abromine 3acarbon nitride 3achlorine 3agraphene 3aiodine 3aions 3aphotocatalysis 3aselenium 3asilicon 3asolutes 3asulfur 3atellurium1 aChen, Z.

METHODS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis embedded in the population-based Rotterdam Study (n = 2632) aged 45 years. Diet was assessed at baseline (year 2006) using food frequency questionnaires. Dietary patterns were defined a priori using an existing index reflecting adherence to national dietary guidelines and a posteriori using principal component analysis. A frailty index was composed of 38 health deficits and measured at baseline and follow-up (4 years later). Linear regression analyses were performed using adherence to each of the dietary patterns as exposure and the frailty index as outcome (all in Z-scores). RESULTS: Adherence to the national dietary guidelines was associated with lower frailty at baseline (β −0.05, 95% CI −0.08, −0.02). Additionally, high adherence was associated with lower frailty scores over time (β −0.08, 95% CI −0.12, −0.04). The PCA revealed three dietary patterns that we named a “Traditional” pattern, high in legumes, eggs and savory snacks; a “Carnivore” pattern, high in meat and poultry; and a “Health Conscious” pattern, high in whole grain products, vegetables and fruit. In the cross-sectional analyses adherence to these patterns was not associated with frailty. However, adherence to the “Traditional” pattern was associated with less frailty over time (β −0.09, 95% CI −0.14, −0.05). CONCLUSION: No associations were found for adherence to a “healthy” pattern or “Carnivore” pattern. However, Even in a population that is relatively young and healthy, adherence to dietary guidelines or adherence to the Traditional pattern could help to prevent, delay or reverse frailty levels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDietary Guidelines 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3aeggs 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afruit products 3alegumes 3alongitudinal studies 3ameat 3apoultry 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3asnacks 3avegetables 3awhole grain foods1 ade Jonge, Ester A.

The Fe₃O₄@Au SP composite not only shows a better photothermal effect over Fe₃O₄ and gold nanoparticles, but possesses magnetic property and excellent ability to directly adsorb protein (antibody). Under 808 nm irradiation, photothermal images of the test strips are recorded by a portable Infrared thermal camera. A quantitative analysis is easily achieved based on the thermal changes, which are proportional to the concentrations of analytes. Under an optimal condition, a wide linear detection range from 1 pg mL⁻¹ to 1μgmL⁻¹ and a limit of detection (LOD) at 0.12 pg mL⁻¹ have been achieved with OTA as a model analytes. The practical application potential has also been validated by detection of OTA in spiked corn, peanut, and soybean extractives with overall recoveries ranging from 98.6% to 115% and coefficient of variations (CVs) between 6.06% and 12.73%. The photothermal LFIA renders a rapid, sensitive, and quantitative bio-/chemo-sensing platform with only a portable laser source and a thermal camera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3acameras 3acorn 3adetection limit 3agold 3aimmunoassays 3ainfrared radiation 3airon oxides 3airradiation 3amagnetic properties 3amodels 3ananogold 3aochratoxin A 3apeanuts 3aquantitative analysis 3asoybeans 0aLateral flow immunoassay strip 0aFe3O4@Au supraparticle (Fe3O4@Au SP) 0aPhotothermal image 0aQuantitative analysis1 aLei, Lingli1 aTian, Meiling1 aRen, Junjie1 aLü, Zhisong,1 aLiu, Yang1 aLiu, Yingshuai0 tTalanta.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 222 p.121478-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1214783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245011300177300001600290520129800306592002801604650001501632650002001647650001001667650001101677650001401688650001901702650001601721653001601737653002001753653002201773653001201795653002301807700002101830773020701851856008802058852000902146655001202155IND60752540620221121024014.0211030e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075254062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArastounia, Mostafa10aSimultaneous identification, modeling and registration refinement of poles using laser scanning point clouds  ap. 327-344.  aThe method presented herein performs the tasks of identification, modeling, and registration refinement of poles using Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. This method starts with a preliminary segmentation followed by eliminating outliers by integrating Fourier series and robust estimators. Poles’ cross sectional shapes are then identified by a customized template matching. Afterwards, points belonging to poles are extracted and the as-built model and registration-refined version of poles are generated. The algorithm was tested on five datasets including point clouds of three industrial sites, an urban environment, and a pole-like monument with very different volumes, resolutions, and configurations. The developed method works robustly despite the challenges that are often present in LiDAR data comprising outliers, non-uniform point sampling, gaps, and registration error. The obtained results indicate that 116 out of 117 poles in all five datasets were identified with no false positives at the object level.

Since there are some unceasing issues about the eco-friendliness and sustainability of energy storage, eco-friendly storage materials are always what we highly desire. While covalent organic frameworks (COFs) promise numerous benefits in gas adsorption, catalysis and optoelectronic devices, synergistic combination of effective storage and eco-friendliness using COFs as storage materials has not been well studied. Herein, we present two fully conjugated porous COFs with high capability of selective gas adsorption and large capacity for Li ion storage. In the aspect of gas selective adsorption, their selectivity ratio for H₂ and CO₂ to N₂ reached ∼15 : 1 and 7 : 1, respectively. In Li ion storage, the COFs exhibited a high capacity (∼700 mA h g⁻¹) and a stable long life (500 cycles). Such good performance confirmed the high potential of COFs to be employed for eco-friendly energy storage. Importantly, using conjugated COFs not only avoids complex synthesis of classical conjugated polymers and multilayered or doped hybrids, but also translates their superb properties including structural diversity, flexibility, and high electrochemical activity into energy storage-related applications. The present work opens up a promising route for further utilization of COFs in energy-related fields such as electrode materials, supercapacitors, and Li–gas batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3alithium batteries 3anitrogen 3apolymers1 aGao, Qiang1 aZhao, Yanli0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2016 Sept. 20, v. 4, no. 37 p.14106-14110dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ta06449c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02221naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009400168300001600262520088800278592002801166653002901194653002701223653001801250653001801268653001501286653001701301653003901318653002901357653002301386653002101409653005101430653002801481700001501509700001501524700001701539700001501556700001501571773011801586856008601704852000901790655001201799IND60602546520221119234049.0180711e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060254652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.09.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatti, J.M.10aMagnetic heat pumps – Configurable hydraulic distribution for a magnetic cooling system  ap. 165-175.  aMagnetic cooling technology has experienced significant developments over the last five years.

The basal rock of HDR reservoir in Gonghe basin is composed of granitoids. In this contribution, in order to constrain the formation mechanism of the Gonghe HDR, granitic samples from outcropping have been collected and drilling core samples data from the archives also been compiled. The studied results show that the obtained zircon U–Pb ages of 255.1 ± 1.9 Ma and 253.9 ± 2.6 Ma for granodiorite and monzogranite, respectively. All granitoids from both outcropping and drilling core have the similar rock associations and their major and trace elements possess the consistent evolved patterns, such as relative enrichment of LILEs (e.g., K, Rb), depletion of HFSEs (e.g., Nb, Ti), and negative Eu anomalies (0.32–0.66), indicating that they share the same magma sources and evolutional processes. And they have the affinity of I-type granites. They were derived from the mixture of partial melting of metabasaltic rocks in the lower crust and a small amount of mantle-derived magma and formed in a subduction-related setting relative to the southward subduction of the Zongwulong oceanic crust beneath the west Qinling terrane. The heat production values of rocks around the Gonghe basin were calculated and all basal granitic rocks ranges from 0.35 to 8.51 μW/m³, yielding an arithmetic mean value of 1.97 μW/m³, indicating that the radioactive heat generation capacity of granitoids in the Gonghe basin is slightly lower. The HDR reservoir in the Gonghe basin was probably due to an allied thermal effect of the radiogenic heat production in the thickening continental crust and the heat contributed by a deep magma chamber below the basin. The early Triassic granitoids with a higher thermal conductivity serve as the conductive medium of the geothermal heat; whilst the sedimentary rocks marked by lower thermal conductivity above the granitic batholiths act as the reservoir cap. This contribution provides a relatively rational understanding for the mechanism of the HDR reservoir in Gonghe geothermal basin from the petrological and geochemical perspectives, which is conducive to the geothermal potential assessment and estimation, and to-be implementation of the Enhanced Geothermal System demonstration project in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriassic period 3abasins 3ageochemistry 3agranodiorite 3aheat production 3asubduction 3athermal conductivity 3azircon 3aChina 0aPetrology 0aHot dry rock 0aGonghe geothermal basin1 aWu, Cailai1 aDeng, Lihuan1 aGao, Dong1 aGao, Yuanhong0 tApplied geochemistry.g2022 Jan., v. 136 p.105176-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1051763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245013200183300001600315520109900331592002801430650002301458650002701481650002501508650002101533650000901554650001501563650000801578650002101586650001001607650001901617650001601636650002001652650001701672650002501689650004401714653001601758653002101774653001901795653001801814653001301832700002801845700002701873700001801900773012101918856009002039852000902129655001202138IND50071219320221119072557.0190403e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007121932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2013.10.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAramli, Mohammad Sadegh10aEffects of short-term storage on the motility, oxidative stress, and ATP content of Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus) sperm  ap. 112-117.  aThe effective short-term storage of semen is essential when processing multiple sperm samples and when semen must be transported from collection sites to hatcheries for the fertilization of ova, or to laboratories for cryopreservation. In the present study, the spermatozoa of Persian sturgeon (Acipenser persicus) were used to evaluate the effects of short-term storage on quality parameters (the percentage of motile cells and the total period of sperm motility), oxidative stress indices, and the ATP content. Spermatozoa cells exhibited >50% motility during 6 days of storage where the average total duration of sperm motility varied from 376.42±80.86s initially to 19.28±10.96s after 6 days. No motile spermatozoa were recorded after 9 days of storage. The levels of oxidative stress indices (TBARS and CP) and antioxidant activity (SOD) increased significantly with the storage time. The ATP content also decreased significantly after 2 days of storage.

This allows obtaining insights into alternatives to exploration strategies aiming at vectoring toward undiscovered mineral deposit sites. In this regard, shaping geochemical data for better understanding of their underlying patterns and extraction of information about ore deposition-related anomalies are challenging issues. To better extraction of the information from the geochemical data, we adapted the “information value” concept to quantify the significance of geochemical anomaly classes as spatial proxies of mineral deposits. To illustrate and evaluate the procedure proposed, a dataset of porphyry-Cu exploration was used to delineate exploration targets in the Baft district, Kerman province, Iran. Through this, geochemical models of information values were created for ore deposition-related elements. Then, the geochemical models were combined to produce an information value-based multi-element geochemical signature aiming at utilizing the prediction ability of every indicator element in a single model. Through the combination, spatial patterns of geochemical signals around mineral deposits are revealed that makes it easier to explore undiscovered deposit sites. We also applied fuzzy operators, as common and alternative practices, to integrate values of the same indicator elements for comparison purpose. The results demonstrated that the model of information value-based multi-element geochemical signature is an efficient geochemical proxy, over those geochemical models generated by the application of fuzzy operators, for exploration targeting.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adescriptive statistics 3ageochemistry 3amineralization 3amodels 3aprediction 3aIran 0aInformation extraction 0aMulti-element geochemical signature 0aMineral exploration targeting 0aGeometric average integration function1 aMaghsoudi, Abbas1 aYousefi, Mahyar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8042-000X1 aMihalasky, Mark J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0082-30290 tApplied geochemistry.g2022 Jan., v. 136 p.105177-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11912x0883-29277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2021.1051773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013100168300001600299520098300315592002801298653001901326653002201345653001601367653001801383653001101401653002601412653002501438653002201463653002301485653000901508700001701517700001401534773011801548856008601666852000901752655001201761IND60602546720221119234258.0180711e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060254672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2013.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Sheng10aExperimental investigation of two-phase flow characteristics of LiBr/H2O solution through orifice plates in vacuum environment  ap. 267-274.  aA new type of multi-stage elementary unit for generating and condensing processes in absorption heat pumps was introduced. One stage of the elementary unit was built, in which the LiBr/H2O solution was concentrated by flash evaporation when flowing through an orifice plate to the generating space. Experiments were carried out to study the flow characteristics of LiBr/H2O solution through an orifice plate in generating processes. The experimental results showed that the reduction of the mass flow rate of the two-phase flow reached a maximum of 24.5%. The mass fraction of gas of the two-phase flow was proportional to its superheat. When the mass transfer pressure difference was higher than 7 kPa or the mass fraction of gas was larger than 0.70%, the flow was choked, and the flow coefficient was reduced as the mass fraction of gas increased, reaching a minimum value of 0.64.

Richness of BSC green algae and cyanobacteria was investigated at four climatically different Chilean sites (arid, semi-arid, Mediterranean, humid). Carbon (C), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), and P contents, P pools and P speciation as well as spatial P species distribution within the BSCs were investigated. Morphological identification of enrichment cultures revealed 24 green algal and 18 cyanobacterial taxa in total. Irrespective of climatic conditions, each BSC comprised 12 to 15 different phototrophic species. Thereby, green algal richness increased, while cyanobacterial richness decreased with increasing humidity/decreasing mean annual temperature (North to South). Total C, N, and S contents ranged between 6.7 and 41.1 g C kg−1, 0.6–2.8 g N kg−1 and 0.2–0.7 g S kg−1, respectively, and increased in the order crust-free soil < crust-adhering soil < BSC. The total P content in BSCs ranged from 310 to 777 mg kg−1 with lowest concentrations at the arid site and highest concentrations at the semi-arid site. Labile P was highest in BSCs from semi-arid and Mediterranean climate implying no P-shortage for BSC organisms at these sites. In BSCs of all sites, stable and non-extractable P was identified as the major P pool (sequential P fractionation) with Ca-P species dominating at all sites except for the humid site at which Al-P was the main P species as determined by P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure, XANES. P K-edge μ-XANES of BSC cross sections revealed apatite hotspots, a potential P source for BSC organisms except for the arid site, where other Ca-P species dominated. Further, elemental mapping of the arid BSC cross section showed distinct accumulation of S and chloride (Cl) containing compounds within green algae and on their outer surface, respectively, raising the question of function/origin of these compounds. In conclusion, this work expands our knowledge on the richness of phototrophic organisms in South American BSCs and characterizes their possible position in the P-cycle along a strong climatic gradient. Our findings suggest that biotic and abiotic factors shape the structure of BSCs phototrophic communities as well as P pools and species at each habitat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorophyta 3aCyanobacteria 3aMediterranean climate 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aalgae 3aapatite 3aautotrophs 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiogeography 3abiological soil crusts 3acarbon 3aclimatic factors 3afractionation 3ahabitats 3ahumidity 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asulfur 3atemperature 3aChile 0aCyanobacteria 0aGreen algae 0aRichness 0aPhosphorus 0aXANES1 aJung, Patrick1 aSamolov, Elena1 aLehnert, Lukas W.1 aBüdel, Burkhard,1 aKarsten, Ulf1 aBendix, Jörg,1 aAchilles, Sebastian1 aSchermer, Michael1 aMatus, Francisco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0534-22081 aOses, Rómulo1 aOsses, Pablo1 aMorshedizad, Mohsen1 aOehlschläger, Claudia1 aHu, Yongfeng1 aKlysubun, Wantana1 aLeinweber, Peter0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 Dec., v. 127 p.286-300dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.09.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001300142245009000155300001800245500000900263520150000272592002801772650002101800650001901821650001801840650001401858650001701872650001801889650002501907700001301932700001601945773013901961852000902100856007902109655001202188IND4392696920221119203955.0191228e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439269692DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2006.01562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, X.10aPore Shrinkage Dependency of Inorganic and Organic Soils on Wetting and Drying Cycles  ap. 1095-1104.  aepub  aCycles of wetting and drying (WD) occur naturally in soils and affect the pore structure through altered hydraulic stresses. Two organic-rich soils, a Eutric Histosol and a Histic Gleysol, and two inorganic soils, a Calcic Gleysol and a Dystric Gleysol, ranging in texture and microstructure, were investigated. Undisturbed soil samples were predried to either −100 kPa water potential by using a ceramic plate or to 30°C by using an oven and then resaturated for one or three WD cycles. In addition, different combinations defined by the intensity, frequency, and sequence of WD cycles were analyzed. Soil structure was altered significantly if the intensity of drying was severe at 30°C, while drying to −100 kPa had only a small effect. The frequency and sequence of WD cycles did not alter the structure and shrinkage behavior significantly. Compared with the initial pore volume, intense WD cycles decreased it by 23.6 to 60.1% in the two organic-rich soils, whereas it increased by 1.5 to 4.8% in the silty Calcic Gleysol and by 3.6 to 15.1% in the clayey Dystric Gleysol. Both organic-rich soils showed more shrinkage but less swelling than did the two inorganic soils. Intense WD cycles altered the water potential vs. void ratio curves of the two organic-rich soils more gradually, while steeper patterns were observed for the two inorganic soils. This study shows that the changes in soil structure and pore shrinkage depend mostly on the maximum intensity of previous WD cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil pore system 3awet-dry cycles 3amineral soils 3ashrinkage 3asoil texture 3aorganic soils 3asoil water potential1 aHorn, R.1 aSmucker, A.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2007 July, v. 71, no. 4 p.1095-1104dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2006.01563Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03090naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012400163300001800287520168700305592002801992650005302020650001102073650002502084650001702109650002802126650002102154650001002175650001602185650001802201650001102219650001402230650003602244650001402280650001902294651001802313700002302331700001902354700005602373773013702429856008102566852000902647655001202656IND60614141720221120220028.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061414172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00394-017-1519-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Kijoon10aDietary total antioxidant capacity is inversely associated with all-cause and cardiovascular disease death of US adults  ap. 2469-2476.  aPURPOSE: Although evidence strongly supports that antioxidant-rich diets reduce risk of chronic disease and mortality, findings from the previous studies on the effect of individual antioxidants on mortality have been inconsistent. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between dietary total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and all-cause and disease-specific mortality in a representative sample of the US population. METHODS: A total of 23,595 US adults aged 30 years and older in NHANES 1988–1994 and 1999–2004 were selected for this study. Dietary TAC was calculated from 1-day 24-h diet recall data at baseline and all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was assessed through December 31, 2011. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 13 years, deaths from all-cause, cancer and CVD were 7157, 1578, and 2155, respectively. Using cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models, inverse associations and linear trends were observed between dietary TAC and all-cause mortality [highest quartile (Q4) versus Q1 ref. HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.71–0.86], cancer mortality (Q4 versus Q1 ref. HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.60–0.93), and CVD mortality (Q4 versus Q1 ref. HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.69–0.99), respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and total energy intake. The inverse association and linear trend still remained between dietary TAC and all-cause mortality (Q4 versus Q1 ref. HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.71–0.87) and CVD mortality (Q4 versus Q1 ref. HR 0.74; 95% CI 0.61–0.89) when further adjusted for relevant covariates. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that antioxidant-rich diets are beneficial to reducing risk of death from all-cause and CVD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic diseases 3adeath 3adiet recall 3aenergy intake 3amodels 3amortality 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3aneoplasms 3arisk reduction 3aUnited States1 aVance, Terrence M.1 aChen, Ming-Hui1 aChun, Ock K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7391-23800 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2018 Oct., v. 57, no. 7 p.2469-2476dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949855x1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-017-1519-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01519naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006400124300001800188500001500206520061800221650001500839650001700854650001100871650000900882650001100891650001500902653002500917653001600942653002100958653001000979653002300989700001601012773007401028852000901102939003301111946001301144655001201157IND9203495720221120032035.0920602e199111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920349572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeide, B.12aA method for estimation of fractal dimension of tree crowns  ap. 1253-1265.  a2019-12-04  aA method is proposed for estimating fractal dimension of tree crowns from measurements of foliage mass and crown volume. Because fractal dimensions for each of the ten investigated species were greater than two, crown surface and volume depend on the unit of measurement. The power relationship between foliage mass and crown volume reflects self-similarity of tree crowns. In all studied cases, fractal dimensions of dominant trees were greater than those of intermediate trees of the same species. Fractal dimension can be used as an indicator of tolerance, crown class, and foliage distribution within a crown. 3aestimation 3aforest trees 3avolume 3amass 3aleaves 3adimensions 0acrown sel-similarity 0amethodology 0afractal geometry 0acrown 0atwo-surface method1 aPfeifer, P.0 tForest science.g1991 Nov., v. 37, no. 5 p.1253-1265x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03300naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011200125300001600237500002400253500001500277520186300292650002002155650002102175650001502196650001402211650001102225650001702236650001902253650002102272650001202293650001402305650002502319650002402344650001102368650001902379650001702398650001202415650001502427650001302442650001202455650001502467651001402482651002502496651002102521651001802542653001902560700001402579700002102593700002402614773011102638852000902749655001202758IND4462347120221117182701.0111129s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446234712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyan, John10aCultivation Intensity in Relation to Organic Matter and Related Properties in a Vertisol in Southern Turkey  ap. 613-623.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aAs most of the organic carbon (C) in the biosphere resides in the soil in the form of soil organic matter (SOM), tillage practices can potentially increase C losses to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, thus contributing to greenhouse gases that exacerbate climate change. In the past century, conventional tillage, involving plowing and secondary cultivation, has unwittingly decreased C stocks in arable soils in North America, Europe, and Australia. The information on the effects of tillage on soil C and related properties in the Mediterranean region is scant, with evidence of resilience being even rarer. While long-term trials that directly measure tillage effects are rare in the Mediterranean, the alternative is a retrospective based on soil management history. In this study of a Vertisol in southern Turkey, we sampled sections of a field that had been intensively cultivated for about 20 years and 40 years, as well as a section left undisturbed in native vegetation for 14 years following years of conventional tillage. The SOM and total nitrogen (N) values were inversely related to cultivation intensity or duration, while the highest values were from the uncultivated site. Labile biomass C and N values followed the same trends with cultivation, whereas available P increased with cultivation time; in contrast, the percentage of water-stable aggregates decreased with cultivation duration. The study showed that such clay soils show a high degree of resilience and can recover in a relatively short time period if left uncultivated or in fallow. While preservation or set aside of arable crop land is not a viable option for farmers, reducing tillage intensity is feasible. The study suggests that minimum tillage or no-till could promote resilience and mitigate the adverse soil effects of conventional tillage that have already occurred. 3aminimum tillage 3agreenhouse gases 3ano-tillage 3aVertisols 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3acarbon dioxide 3anitrogen content 3aplowing 3abiosphere 3aconventional tillage 3asoil organic matter 3afallow 3aclimate change 3aarable soils 3abiomass 3aclay soils 3acropland 3afarmers 3avegetation 3aAustralia 3aMediterranean region 3aTurkey (country) 3aNorth America 0aorganic matter1 aKapur, S.1 aIbrikci, Hayriye1 aSingh, M.q(Murari)0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2011 , v. 35, no. 5-6 p.613-623dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245015600171300001800327500002400345520128700369650001601656650000901672650002001681700002501701773011901726852000901845856006201854856008501916655001202001IND4462342620221117182641.0111128s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446234262DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.239.10.13252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallinckrodt, Mary Jo10aMass-to-splenic volume ratio and splenic weight as a percentage of body weight in dogs with malignant and benign splenic masses: 65 cases (2007–2008)  ap. 1325-1327.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To determine whether mass-to-splenic volume ratio or splenic weight as a percentage of body weight was significantly different between dogs with benign versus malignant splenic masses. Design—Retrospective case series. Animals—65 dogs that underwent splenectomy. Procedures—Medical records of dogs examined between October 2007 and June 2008 because of a splenic mass were reviewed. Information obtained included dog age, breed, and weight; whether hemoperitoneum was present; splenic weight and dimensions (length, width, and height) at the time of splenectomy; dimensions (length, width, and height) of the splenic mass; and histologic diagnosis. Information on survival time was recorded when available. Results—30 (46%) dogs had hemangiosarcoma, 10 (15%) had other types of malignant masses, and 25 (39%) had benign masses. Dogs with benign splenic masses had a significantly higher mean mass-to-splenic volume ratio and higher mean splenic weight as a percentage of body weight than did dogs with hemangiosarcoma.

An econometric model indicates altered livelihood patterns as an outcome of the combination of rising costs for pesticides and declining yields from disease. Reliance on pesticides and a failure to rotate crops has led to an increase in the incidence of disease-causing organisms, which has resulted in a collapse of the onion economy in the Tipajara watershed. Emigration is currently the primary strategy employed by smallholder farmers as a response to the collapsing agricultural economy. 3aagricultural economics 3acrops 3aeconometric models 3afarmers 3alivelihood 3aonions 3apesticides 3awatersheds 3aAndes region 3aBolivia1 aOrr, Blair0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2011 , v. 35, no. 5-6 p.467-492dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002300144245012100167300001800288500002400306520182800330650001502158650001002173650001102183650001302194650001002207650001402217650001602231650001202247700002202259700002002281700002102301773011802322852000902440856006202449856008402511655001202595IND4462339520221117182652.0111123s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446233952DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.239.8.11042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilcoyne, Isabelle10aPenetrating injuries to the frog (cuneus ungulae) and collateral sulci of the foot in equids: 63 cases (1998–2008)  ap. 1104-1109.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To determine the outcome of penetrating injuries to the central region of the foot in equids and identify factors that may affect treatment and outcome. Design—Retrospective case series. Animals—63 equids (61 horses, 1 pony, and 1 mule). Procedures—Records of equids incurring puncture wounds through the frog (cuneus ungulae) or collateral sulci of the foot between 1998 and 2008 were reviewed. Evaluated factors that were hypothesized to affect outcome included signalment, degree of lameness, foot affected, duration between injury and admission, and treatment. Injuries were graded from 1 (< 1 inch; involving superficial corium only) to 4 (involving a synovial structure) on the basis of severity of penetration as determined by radiographic evidence or findings on synoviocentesis at the time of admission. Results—Overall, 60% (38/63) of equids returned to soundness. Thirteen equids were euthanized on the basis of synovial structure involvement and financial constraints. Of 35 equids that were treated conservatively, which may have included undergoing a surgical procedure with the horse standing, 32 (91.4%) returned to their previous level of soundness. Fifteen equids underwent surgical treatment under general anesthesia, of which 6 (40%) became sound for intended use. Ten of 34 (29%) equids with synovial structure involvement regained soundness. Equids treated earlier after injury had a better prognosis. Equids with a hind foot injury had a more favorable outcome than those with a forefoot injury. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Results suggested that penetrating injuries located centrally in the foot of equids without involvement of a synovial structure have a favorable prognosis, especially if managed early. Penetration of a synovial structure provided a poor prognosis. 3aanesthesia 3afrogs 3ahorses 3alameness 3amules 3aprognosis 3aradiography 3asurgery1 aDechant, Julie E.1 aKass, Philip H.1 aSpier, Sharon J.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 239, no. 8 p.1104-1109x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.avma.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.239.8.11043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03060naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245007400170300001800244500002400262500001500286520178900301650002502090650001502115650000902130650001702139650001202156650001802168650003002186650002002216650001402236651001402250653000902264700002102273700002002294700001902314700003002333773011902363852000902482856006202491856008502553655001202638IND4462342420221117182644.0111128s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446234242DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.239.10.13192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNwaokorie, Eugene E.10aEpidemiology of struvite uroliths in ferrets: 272 cases (1981–2007)  ap. 1319-1324.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aObjective—To confirm that the predominant mineral type in naturally occurring uroliths in ferrets is struvite; to determine whether age, breed, sex, reproductive status, geographic location, season, and anatomic location are risk factors associated with urolith formation in ferrets; to compare features of struvite uroliths in cats with those in ferrets; and to determine whether there is a logical evidence-based rationale for clinical trials of the safety and efficacy of diet-induced dissolution of struvite uroliths in ferrets. Design—Retrospective case-control study. Animals—408 ferrets with uroliths (272 struvite uroliths) from the Minnesota Urolith Center, and 6,528 control ferrets from the Veterinary Medical Database. Procedures—Historical information was obtained about each ferret. The association between proposed risk factors and outcome (struvite urolith formation) was assessed. Results—Sterile struvite was the predominant mineral in uroliths in ferrets. Neutered male ferrets had a significantly increased risk of developing sterile struvite uroliths. A significant association was also found between increasing age and the detection of struvite uroliths. Struvite uroliths in ferrets were more likely to be retrieved from the lower urinary tract than from the upper urinary tract. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Knowledge of predominant mineral type in uroliths along with insight into etiologic, demographic, and environmental risk and protective factors for urolithiasis may facilitate development of surveillance strategies that result in earlier detection of uroliths in ferrets. Modification of risk factors, including dietary risk factors, may help to minimize urolith formation, dissolve existing uroliths, and minimize urolith recurrence. 3acase-control studies 3amonitoring 3acats 3arisk factors 3aferrets 3aurinary tract 3anutrition risk assessment 3aclinical trials 3adatabases 3aMinnesota 0arisk1 aOsborne, Carl A.1 aLulich, Jody P.1 aAlbasan, Hasan1 aLekcharoensuk, Charlempol0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 239, no. 10 p.1319-1324x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.avma.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.239.10.13193Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03559naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002000144245008000164300001800244500002400262520177800286650001902064650001302083650002602096650001002122650001002132650001302142650000902155650002802164650001702192650001602209650001102225650001402236650002602250650002202276650001602298650004202314650001902356650001502375650001602390700002202406700002102428700002402449700002302473700002202496700002602518700002102544700002602565700002602591700002702617700001802644700002202662773011802684852000902802856006202811856008402873655001202957IND4462339620221117182729.0111123s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446233962DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.239.8.11102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanse, Heidi E.10aGastric and enteric phytobezoars caused by ingestion of persimmon in equids  ap. 1110-1116.  aIncludes references  aCase Description—13 equids (10 horses, 2 donkeys, and 1 pony) were examined for signs of colic (n = 7), weight loss (6), anorexia (3), and diarrhea (2). Ten equids were evaluated in the fall (September to November). Seven equids had a history of persimmon ingestion. Clinical Findings—A diagnosis of phytobezoar caused by persimmon ingestion was made for all equids. Eight equids had gastric persimmon phytobezoars; 5 had enteric persimmon phytobezoars. Gastroscopy or gastroduodenoscopy revealed evidence of persimmon ingestion in 8 of 10 equids in which these procedures were performed. Treatment and Outcome—2 of 13 equids were euthanatized prior to treatment. Supportive care was instituted in 11 of 13 equids, including IV administration of fluids (n = 8) and treatment with antimicrobials (5), NSAIDs (5), and gastric acid suppressants (4). Persimmon phytobezoar–specific treatments included dietary modification to a pelleted feed (n = 8); oral or nasogastric administration of cola or diet cola (4), cellulase (2), or mineral oil (2); surgery (4); and intrapersimmon phytobezoar injections with acetylcysteine (1). Medical treatment in 5 of 7 equids resulted in resolution of gastric persimmon phytobezoars. Seven of 8 equids with gastric persimmon phytobezoars and 1 of 5 equids with enteric persimmon phytobezoars survived > 1 year after hospital discharge. Clinical Relevance—Historical knowledge of persimmon ingestion in equids with gastrointestinal disease warrants gastroduodenoscopy for evaluation of the presence of persimmon phytobezoars. In equids with gastric persimmon phytobezoars, medical management (including administration of cola or diet cola and dietary modification to a pelleted feed) may allow for persimmon phytobezoar dissolution. 3aacetylcysteine 3aanorexia 3aanti-infective agents 3aasses 3acolic 3adiarrhea 3adiet 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3agastric acid 3agastroscopy 3ahorses 3aingestion 3aintravenous injection 3amedical treatment 3amineral oil 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3apelleted feeds 3apersimmons 3aweight loss1 aGilliam, Lyndi L.1 aHouse, Amanda M.1 aMcKenzie, Harold C.1 aJohnson, Philip J.1 aLopes, Marco A.F.1 aCarmichael, Robert J.1 aGroover, Erin S.1 aLaCarrubba, Alison M.1 aBreshears, Melanie A.1 aBrosnahan, Margaret M.1 aFunk, Rebecca1 aHolbrook, Todd C.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 239, no. 8 p.1110-1116x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.avma.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.239.8.11103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03387naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245011900131300001600250500002400266500001500290520226700305650001702572650001702589650001402606650000902620650002502629650001102654650001002665650001202675650001402687650001802701650001102719650001302730650001002743650002202753650001602775650001102791653001902802700001902821700001802840773008602858852000902944655001202953IND4462348820221122150240.0111129s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446234882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEinhorn, Todd C.10aCrop Load Management Does Not Consistently Improve Crop Value of ‘Sweetheart’/‘Mazzard’ Sweet Cherry Trees  ap. 546-553.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe effect of crop load level on vegetative growth, fruit growth, yield, fruit quality, surface pitting, crop value and return bloom was studied over a 2-year period on 9- and 10-year-old ‘Sweetheart’/‘Mazzard’ sweet cherry (Prunus avium) trees. In early spring, whole-tree crop loads were adjusted to two different levels by removal of reproductive buds (either 50% or all but one) from spurs and compared with an unthinned control. In 2009, heavy crop loads of unthinned trees reduced fruit size by 30 days after full bloom (DAFB). At harvest, fruit diameter of thinned treatments was increased 22% and 27% compared with unthinned fruit. Fruit quality attributes [soluble solids concentration (SS), fruit firmness, and total acids (TA)] were significantly greater for thinned treatments. Thinned treatment yields were reduced 40% to 54% relative to unthinned trees, with greater percentages of fruit in large size classes. Despite significantly fewer fruit per tree, moderately thinned trees had a higher estimated crop value ($142 per tree) than unthinned trees ($125 per tree). Crop value was lowest for the heavily thinned treatment ($107 per tree), reflecting overthinning. In 2010, shoot growth was negatively related to crop load level. Fruit growth of unthinned trees was not significantly affected by higher fruit density until 89 DAFB. Yield of 2010 unthinned trees was 87% of 2009, while thinned tree yields were similar between years. Improved fruit quality and greater percentages of large fruit were observed for thinned treatments in 2010; however, crop value was highest for unthinned trees ($190 per tree), even though 18% of the fruit were too small for fresh market sale. Surface pitting was unaffected by crop load level in either year. Return bloom (flowers per reproductive bud and reproductive buds per spur) was significantly, negatively related to the prior season's crop load in 2010 and 2011. In the current sweet cherry pricing structure, higher crop value is associated with large volumes of medium-sized fruit. Thinning to manage crop load of low-medium density, productive ‘Sweetheart’/‘Mazzard’ trees will not be an annual requirement, though in heavy fruit set years crop load management will improve crop value. 3aPrunus avium 3afresh market 3aflowering 3abuds 3atotal soluble solids 3aprices 3aacids 3aflowers 3afruit set 3afruit quality 3aspring 3afirmness 3atrees 3avegetative growth 3atree yields 3ashoots 0asoluble solids1 aLaraway, Debra1 aTurner, Janet0 tHortTechnology.g2011 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.546-553wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014800126300001600274500002400290520066400314650001200978650002200990650001601012650001701028650001201045650001701057650000801074650001401082650000901096650002401105650001901129650002201148650001001170700001801180700001701198700001701215773011101232852000901343655001201352IND4462347720221122150327.0111129s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446234772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos, M.E.10aOat and Oat-Vetch as Rainfed Fodder-Cover Crops in Semiarid Environments: Effects of Fertilization and Harvest Time on Forage Yield and Quality  ap. 726-744.  aIncludes references  aWe evaluate the forage yield and quality, species composition, and carrying capacity of oats and oat-vetch as fodder-cover crops, grown in almond orchards, under mineral or organic fertilizer and three harvesting regimes (“grazing,” “hay,” and “grain plus straw”).

The almond yield was greater when the cover crop was removed early as “grazing.” Therefore, oats and oat-vetch could be used as cover crops in almond orchards if removed early by livestock grazing. 3aalmonds 3acarrying capacity 3acover crops 3aforage yield 3agrazing 3aharvest date 3ahay 3alivestock 3aoats 3aorganic fertilizers 3asemiarid zones 3aspecies diversity 3astraw1 aAltieri, M.A.1 aGarcia, P.A.1 aRobles, A.B.0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2011 , v. 35, no. 7-8 p.726-744dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245011500133300001600248500002400264520120800288650001001496650001601506650001201522650001601534650002101550650001201571650001101583650001201594650001501606650001301621650001201634650000801646650001701654650001701671650001501688650001601703650002001719650001701739650001001756651001101766700002001777700002901797700002201826700002201848700002101870773011101891852000902002655001202011IND4462348320221122120253.0111129s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446234832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltieri, Miguel A.10aEnhancing Crop Productivity via Weed Suppression in Organic No-Till Cropping Systems in Santa Catarina, Brazil  ap. 855-869.  aIncludes references  aIn Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, family farmers modified the conventional no-till system by flattening cover crop mixtures on the soil surface as a strategy to reduce soil erosion and lower fluctuations in soil moisture and temperature, improve soil quality, and enhance weed suppression and crop performance. During 2007 and 2008, we conducted three experiments aimed at understanding the processes and mechanisms at play in successful organic conservation tillage systems (OCT), especially the underpinnings of ecological weed suppression, a key advantage of OCT systems over conventional no-till systems. Our results, as well as farmers observations, suggest that cover crops can enhance weed suppression and hence crop productivity through physical interference and allelopathy and also a host of effects on soil quality, fertility, and soil moisture that we did not measure. Results from the three trials indicate that the best cover crop mixture should include a significant proportion of rye, vetch, and fodder radish as these mixtures produce large biomass, and are readily killed by rolling forming a thick mulch sufficient to provide effective weed control in the subsequent vegetable crop. 3aVicia 3aallelopathy 3abiomass 3acover crops 3acropping systems 3afarmers 3aforage 3amulches 3ano-tillage 3aradishes 3arolling 3arye 3asoil erosion 3asoil quality 3asoil water 3atemperature 3avegetable crops 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aBrazil1 aLana, Marcos A.1 aBittencourt, Henrique V.1 aKieling, Andre S.1 aComin, Jucinei J.1 aLovato, Paulo E.0 tJournal of sustainable agriculture.g2011 , v. 35, no. 7-8 p.855-869dFood Products Pressx1044-00467nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245012200170300001800292500002400310520175700334650001102091650001602102650002002118650001302138650001402151650001102165650001402176650001902190650001702209650001602226700002102242700003202263700001802295700002002313773011902333852000902452856006202461856008502523655001202608IND4462351520150420000000.0111129s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446235152DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.239.10.13342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeabaugh, Kathryn A.10aAssessment of the tissue diffusion of anesthetic agent following administration of a low palmar nerve block in horses  ap. 1334-1340.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To investigate tissue diffusion of anesthetic agent following administration of low palmar nerve blocks (LPBs) in horses. Design—Randomized clinical trial. Animals—12 adult horses. Procedures—In 9 horses, mepivacaine hydrochloride–iohexol (50:50 dilution) injections were administered bilaterally (2 or 4 mL/site) to affect the medial and lateral palmar and palmar metacarpal nerves (4 sites). Lateral radiographic views of both metacarpal regions were obtained before and at 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after block administration; proximal and distal extents of contrast medium (and presumably anesthetic agent) diffusion from palmar and palmar metacarpal injection sites were measured and summed to determine total diffusion. Methylene blue solution was injected in forelimbs of 3 other horses that were subsequently euthanized to determine the potential route of anesthetic agent diffusion to the proximal suspensory ligament region. Results—Mean extents of proximal and total contrast medium diffusion were 4.0 and 6.6 cm, respectively, for the palmar metacarpal nerves and 4.3 and 7.1 cm, respectively, for the palmar nerves. Subtle proximal diffusion secondary to lymphatic drainage was evident in 17 of the 18 limbs. Contrast medium was detected in the metacarpophalangeal joint or within the digital flexor tendon sheath in 8 and 7 limbs, respectively. In the cadaver limbs, methylene blue solution did not extend to the proximal suspensory ligament region. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—In horses, LPBs resulted in minimal proximal diffusion of anesthetic agent from the injection sites. Limbs should be aseptically prepared prior to LPB administration because inadvertent intrasynovial injection may occur. 3aadults 3aanesthetics 3aclinical trials 3adrainage 3aforelimbs 3ahorses 3aligaments 3amethylene blue 3anerve tissue 3aradiography1 aSelberg, Kurt T.1 aValdes-Martínez, Alejandro1 aRao, Sangeeta1 aBaxter, Gary M.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2011 Nov. 15, v. 239, no. 10 p.1334-1340x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.avma.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.239.10.13343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02554naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002300148245016500171300001600336500002400352520128500376650001701661650001201678650002001690650002501710650002201735650001601757650002601773650002801799650000901827650001901836650001901855650001701874651001901891700003001910773013101940852000902071856008802080655001202168IND4462351920221122120311.0111129s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446235192DNAL7 a10.1080/14735903.2011.5844732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDevitt, James E.10aCan life cycle assessment be used to evaluate plant breeding objectives to improve supply chain sustainability? A worked example using porridge oats from the UK  ap. 484-494.  aIncludes references  aThe challenge for agricultural production in the 21st century is to produce sufficient high-quality food whilst minimizing impact. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can help by identifying the parts of a supply chain with the greatest environmental impact, and to determine which technologies - for example plant breeding - may be most appropriately employed to minimize negative impacts. A `plough-to-plate' LCA of a porridge oat production chain was undertaken using data that corresponds to the inputs and outputs of an indicative supply chain. The greatest environmental impact of the porridge oats life cycle occurs in crop production and cooking. There are traits for oats that are available for manipulation by plant breeders, which can influence these areas; these include yield, nitrogen use efficiency and beta-glucan content. Therefore plant breeding may be a useful strategy for improving the sustainability of the crop. However LCA cannot be a definitive tool to guide plant breeding and therefore this approach needs to compliment others. Nevertheless this study highlights that porridge oat supply chain sustainability would benefit from an integrated effort stretching from the geneticist to consumer; a finding that is likely to be relevant to other food supply chains. 3abeta-glucans 3acooking 3acrop production 3aenvironmental impact 3afood supply chain 3ageneticists 3alife cycle assessment 3anutrient use efficiency 3aoats 3aplant breeders 3aplant breeding 3asupply chain 3aUnited Kingdom1 aMilà i Canals, Llorenç.0 tInternational journal of agricultural sustainability.g2011, v. 9, no. 4 p.484-494dChannel View publicationsx1473-59037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14735903.2011.5844733Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02743naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245016100131300001600292500002400308500001500332520150800347650001201855650002301867650002501890650001101915650001601926650002701942650001001969650001001979650002501989650001302014650002202027650001202049650002102061650001102082653001902093700003002112700002102142700002102163700003002184773008602214852000902300655001202309IND4462350420221122120328.0111129s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446235042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerkey, Tyler G.10aCrop Load Adjustment in ‘Seyval Blanc’ Winegrape: Impacts on Yield Components, Fruit Composition, Consumer Wine Preferences, and Economics of Production  ap. 593-598.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aCrop load management treatments were applied to ‘Seyval Blanc’ grapevines (Vitis hybrid) as a 2 × 2 factorial design: no shoot thinning (ST)/no cluster thinning (CL) (i.e., control), ST combined with CL (ST + CL), ST only, and CL only. All treatments reduced yield and crop load (yield/pruning weight) in 2009 and had a smaller impact in 2010 due to the carryover effect of previous year treatments on crop potential. Soluble solids were improved by up to 3.2% by the ST + CL treatment in 2009, but were not impacted by treatments in the second year when the range of yield was smaller and the ripening conditions more favorable. Rank sum analysis for the 2009 vintage indicated that wines produced from the CL treatment were preferred by the sensory panel compared with the control wine, but there were no differences in consumer preference for wines produced in the 2010 season. Grower preferred price in 2009 (required to compensate the grower for labor costs and lost yield) increased from $556/t in the control to $824/t in the CL treatment, an increase which could be justified by the demonstrated consumer preference for the CL wine. Grower preferred price was $1022/t in the ST + CL treatment in 2009, a price increase that was not justified by a demonstrated consumer preference for the wine. In 2010, grower preferred price ranged from $541/t for the control to $610/t for the ST + CL treatment, an unjustified increase based on the lack of demonstrated consumer preference for the wines. 3ahybrids 3asensory evaluation 3atotal soluble solids 3aprices 3awine grapes 3awages and remuneration 3aVitis 3awines 3aconsumer preferences 3aripening 3afruit composition 3apruning 3ayield components 3ashoots 0asoluble solids1 aMansfield, Anna Katharine1 aLerch, Steven D.1 aMeyers, James M.1 aVanden Heuvel, Justine E.0 tHortTechnology.g2011 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.593-598wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017800126300001400304520082600318650002001144650003201164650001101196650001401207650001501221650002301236650001401259650003801273651001201311653003001323700001801353700001801371773008001389852000901469939003301478946001301511655001201524IND9203486720221122065735.0920601e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920348672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, W.R.10aELISA used without host trituration to detect larvae of Phyllonorycter blancardella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) parasitized by Pholetesor ornigis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)  ap. 50-56.  aA plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the biotinavidin system was developed for identifying larvae of the spotted tentiform leafminer, Phyllonorycter blancardella (F.), parasitized by Pholetesor ornigis (Weed).

Detergents were used in the extraction buffer to prevent loss of serological activity and to reduce nonspecific reactions. The assay was accurate using fresh or frozen specimens. The correlation between parasitoid size and ELISA value was highly significant down to a parasitoid length of approximately 0.34 mm.

The guilds consist of: a natural, coevolved guild of parasites (seven species) associated with a native cecidomyiid midge, Rhopalomyia californica Felt, which develops in galls on Baccharis pilularis DC in northern California; a diverse parasite guild (12 species), believed to have been restructured by the addition of an exotic species, associated with a native diaspidid, Melanaspis obscura (Comstock) (obscure scale), on pecan in southern Texas; and a synthetic or anthropogenic guild of phytoseiid mites (four commercially available species) released against twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, on bean plants in northern California. These guilds are analyzed according to the following framework: ecological-evolutionary history, empirical patterns in space and time (e.g., spatial distribution of species per host patch), factors affecting guild structure (e.g., interspecific competition, structure of host population), ecological effect on the host population (e.g., spatial density dependence), and relationship between guild structure and ecological effect (e.g., species-dependent mortality). It is suggested that analysis of natural enemy guilds may be of value in deriving introduction strategies in both classical and augmentative biological control. The importation of Encarsia aurantii (Howard) into California for control of obscure scale is described as a case in point. Some additional implications of guild analysis for biological control are discussed. 3anatural enemies 3aintroduced species 3abiological control 3aarthropod pests 3aplant pests 3aparasites 3apredators 3ahost plants 3aCalifornia 0apredators of insect pests 0aparasites of insect pests0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1992 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.26-40x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01759naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014000126300001400266520087000280650001901150650001501169650001501184650002001199650002401219650002301243650001601266650001301282651001501295773008001310852000901390939003301399946001301432655001201445IND9203487020221122065551.0920601e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920348702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreen, J.P.10aTemperature and seasonal effects on expression of Acremonium endophyte-enhanced resistance to Schizaphis graminum (Homptera: Aphididae)  ap. 68-74.  aTemperature and seasonal changes affected endophyte concentration, peramine concentration, and antixenosis to greenbug in perennial ryegrass infected with Acremonium lolii Latch, Christensen & Samuels. Endophyte and peramine concentrations and degree of greenbug antixenosis to endophyte-infected tillers were lower at 7 and 28 degrees C compared with 14 and 21 degrees C in three genotypes of perennial ryegrass; antixenosis was related to peramine and to endophyte concentration. Genotype differences were greater than differences associated with temperature. Field data collected every 3-6 wk indicated highest endophyte concentrations in spring and fall, when mean daily temperatures averaged 15 degrees C in the previous 4 wk.

Visual counts and pheromone trap data indicated that daily peak flight occurred near 0800 hours. H. brillians adult males were most active in the early morning, with substantially fewer moths detected after midmorning. From 0600 to 1000 hours, > 90% of the moths observed in the stake count zones were males. For the remainder of the day, a greater portion of flying H. brillians moths were represented by females. Pheromone trap count curves were frequently bimodal.

Larvae stung by C. melanoscela and an unstung control group were allowed to develop on foliage from four tree species (red maple, mockernut hickory, American beech, and white oak) started on five different dates during a 16-d period after bud break. Survival of Cotesia larvae declined significantly with start date on all four species; however, white oak supported high wasp survival for most of the period. Wasp development time also increased significantly with increasing start date on each species. Stung larvae suffered significantly higher mortality from causes other than wasp emergence than did control larvae. The implications for underestimating mortality attributable to parasite attack are discussed. In particular, C. melanoscela probably causes significantly greater mortality of gypsy moth larvae than estimated from parasite emergence. 3aAcer rubrum 3aCarya tomentosa 3aFagus grandifolia 3aQuercus alba 3aLymantria dispar 3abiological development 3amortality 3aphenology 3ahost plants 3aplant pests 3aparasites 3alaboratory rearing 0aparasites of insect pests 0acotesia melanoscela1 aRaupp, M.J.1 aSadoff, C.S.1 aOdell, T.M.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g1992 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.173-177x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02065naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001500151245010200166300001600268500001500284520095600299650001701255650001701272650001801289650002701307650002101334650001801355650002201373653003001395653001301425653002801438700002001466700001701486700001501503773009401518852000901612939003301621946001301654655001201667IND9203492120221122061146.0920601e199203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920349212DNAL7 a192832132pmid7 aPMC26192342pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProt, J.C.10aUse of green manure crops in control of Hirschmanniella mucronata and H. oryzae in irrigated rice  ap. 127-132.  a2019-12-04  aFour field experiments were conducted to study the effect of Sesbania rostrata and Aeschynomene afraspera as rotational and green manure crops on the population dynamics of Hirschmanniella mucronata and H. oryzae, and subsequent rice yields. The sequential cropping of the legumes with rice controlled both nematode species. In two experiments, yield of rice was related to the nematode population densities at planting and harvesting of the second rice crop (R2 = 0.391, P less than 0.001, and R2 = 0.57, P less than 0.001), regardless of the treatments. Rice yield increases were attributed to nutritional effect of the green manure and the reduction of the nematode populations or the modification of a factor(s) linked to the nematode populations induced by their cropping. As the two leguminous crops do not generate direct return, using them to control the rice-root nematodes was not economical, despite the significant yield increase obtained. 3aOryza sativa 3aAeschynomene 3agreen manures 3aHirschmanniella oryzae 3anematode control 3acrop rotation 3aSesbania rostrata 0ahirschmanniella mucronata 0aSesbania 0aaeschynomene afrasperas1 aSoriano, I.R.S.1 aMatias, D.M.1 aSavary, S.0 tJournal of nematology.g1992 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.127-132wJournal:12353x0022-300X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02630naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002300167245010800190300001600298520145000314592002801764650003101792650002301823650001601846650001601862650003201878653001501910653002301925700002101948700002401969773009601993852000902089856011102098930003302209945001302242946001302255655001202268IND2198451220221122061115.0990430e199903  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219845122DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0518:IOPAAI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrawal, Anurag A.10aINFLUENCE OF PREY AVAILABILITY AND INDUCED HOST‐PLANT RESISTANCE ON OMNIVORY BY WESTERN FLOWER THRIPS  ap. 518-523.  aTheory predicts that the balance of nutritional needs, food availability, and the quality of particular food items are important factors in the feeding decisions of omnivorous animals. In this study we investigate factors that affect the feeding decisions of an omnivorous thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) that eats both animal prey and plant foliage. In the presence of prey (mite eggs), adult and larval thrips consumed nearly half the amount of plant tissue as did thrips without prey. We manipulated host‐plant quality by exposing plants to spider mite feeding. In the absence of prey, systemically induced plant responses following herbivory reduced the amount of feeding by thrips compared to that on uninduced control plants. In the presence of prey, induced responses caused a shift in the feeding preferences of thrips: thrips consumed half the amount of plant material and twice the number of prey on induced plants as did thrips on uninduced control plants. Our findings are relevant to understanding the complex factors that shape food‐web interactions in nature. Variation in host‐plant quality and availability of prey can exert a strong influence on the feeding preferences of omnivores. In addition, induced resistance may be a particularly useful biological‐control strategy because it reduces herbivorous pest populations directly, and indirectly by causing a shift toward predation in naturally occurring omnivores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aGossypium hirsutum 3ahost plants 3aTetranychus 3apredator-prey relationships 0aresistance 0ahost plant quality1 aKobayashi, Chris1 aThaler, Jennifer S.0 tEcology.g1999 Mar., v. 80, no. 2 p.518-523dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080%5B0518:IOPAAI%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle02496naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009800164300001600262520121500278650001501493650000801508650001401516650001701530650002001547650001201567650003301579650001401612650001401626650001301640651001501653653001901668653000801687653001701695700001601712700002001728700001401748700001701762700001901779773011801798852000901916856006901925930003301994946001102027655001202038IND4390177120221122011506.0070408e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439017712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-006-0479-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, N.

We utilize DNA sequence data from three chloroplast regions (trnL, rpoC2 and rbcL) and one nuclear region (Internal Transcribed Spacer; ITS) both singly and in combination to elucidate the relationships of the genera in the subfamily. The topology retrieved by the ITS region is not congruent with that of the plastid data, but this conflict is not strongly supported. Nine well-supported clades are retrieved by all data sets. The relationships at the base of the subfamily are clearly established, comprising a series of three clades of Merxmuellera species. The earliest diverging clade probably does not belong in Danthonioideae. The other two clades are centered in the tropical African mountains and Cape mountains respectively. A clade of predominantly North and South American Danthonia species as well as D. archboldii from New Guinea is retrieved, but the African and Asian species of Danthonia are related to African species of Merxmuellera, thus rendering Danthonia polyphyletic. The relationships of the Danthonia clade remain equivocal, as do those of the two Cortaderia clades, the Pseudopentameris and Rytidosperma clades. 3aCortaderia 3aDNA 3aDanthonia 3achloroplasts 3adata collection 3agrasses 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amountains 3apolyphyly 3atopology 3aNew Guinea 0aDanthonioideae 0aITS 0aMerxmuellera1 aGalley, C. 1 aVerboom, G.

(A. aurea, A. hookeri, A. ligtu, A. pelegrina and A. presliana) collected in Chile, karyotypes and variation of RAPD markers were investigated. Tandemly repeated DNA sequences - 5S and 18/25S rDNA genes and the sequence A001-1 (De Jeu et al. 1997) were used to characterize karyotypes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Ten somatic metaphases per population were used for measurement of chromosome length. Differences in RAPD marker bands were used for characterization of populations, creating a similarity index. FISH with all three DNA probes shows a high degree of polymorphism between and sometimes also within accessions of A. aurea, A. hookeri and A. ligtu. The number of chromosome pairs showing 5S rDNA signals is more different for the investigated species A. aurea, A. hookeri, A. ligtu, A. pelegrina and A. presliana with 5, 7, 5, 3 and 7, respectively, than the number of 18/25S rDNA signals in this succession with 7, 7, 6, 5 and 7 chromosome pairs, showing a high evolutionary dynamics within the genus. Furthermore, among the four populations of A. hookeri, accession 4181 was different in arm length of chromosome 3. RAPD markers (index of similarity) also showed a greater genetic distance of accession 4181 from the other three accessions of A. hookeri. The possible evolutionary mechanisms providing these polymorphisms were discussed. 3aAlstroemeria 3aDNA probes 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3akaryotyping 3anucleotide sequences 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aribosomal DNA 3aChile 0aAlstroemeria aurea 0aA. hookeri 0aA. ligtu 0aA. pelegrina 0aA. presliana 0akaryotype 0arepetitive DNA 0a5S rDNA 0a18/25S rDNA 0aRAPD-marker1 aSchrader, O. 1 aBudahn, H. 0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2007 Nov., v. 269, no. 1-2 p.1-14dVienna : Springer Viennax0378-26977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-007-0591-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20071104b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02773naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002100144245012200165300001600287500002400303520171900327650001902046650000902065650001402074650001302088650001402101650001802115650002102133650001902154650002302173650001202196700001902208700002102227773007002248852000902318856008402327655001202411IND4462359320221121170201.0111201s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446235932DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-09-10-01402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollak, Linda M.10aResistant Starch and Starch Thermal Characteristics in Exotic Corn Lines Grown in Temperate and Tropical Environments  ap. 435-440.  aIncludes references  aCorn as a food that is heated and cooled to allow starch retrogradation has higher levels of resistant starch (RS). Increasing the amount of RS can make corn an even healthier food and may be accomplished by breeding and selection, especially by using exotic germplasm. Sixty breeding lines of introgressed exotic germplasm backgrounds, selected for high yield, were grown in three tropical and temperate locations and analyzed for starch thermal characteristics and RS levels. Although actual values for all starch characteristics were within normal levels, most characteristics had significant genotypic effects, and all had significant location effects. Thermal properties of retrograded starch were more influenced by the environment than the thermal properties of raw starch, making retrograded starch traits more heritable than raw starch traits. This suggests that a breeding strategy based on retrograded starch traits will have a better chance of success than a breeding strategy based on raw starch traits. A significant genotype effect for RS levels indicates that genotypic selection to raise the level of RS and increase the healthful aspects of corn food should be successful. Significant location effects indicate that breeders using winter nurseries to accelerate their breeding progress need to be careful when making selections using RS data collected on seed grown in the tropics. A small but highly significant correlation between RS and some thermal characteristics, especially percentage of retrogradation, indicates that we may be able to select promising genotypes for RS selection based on our extensive database of thermal characteristics collected on a wide number of diverse corn lines. 3abreeding lines 3acorn 3adatabases 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3aintrogression 3aresistant starch 3aretrogradation 3athermal properties 3atropics1 aScott, M.

DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional study. ANIMALS 15 small-breed dogs (25 stifle joints) with grade 2 or 3 medial patellar luxation (5 dogs with unilateral luxation and 10 dogs with bilateral luxation). PROCEDURES Digital mediolateral radiographic images of each affected stifle joint were acquired with the patella in manually reduced (n = 25) and luxated (25) positions. In 2 measurement sessions separated by > 48 hours, 3 observers unaware of patella status (luxated or reduced) measured the TPA in each image twice in random order. Mixed linear modeling was performed to determine the effect of patella status on TPA measurements, and intraobserver and interobserver variation in measurements were calculated. RESULTS TPA measurements by all observers differed significantly between the first and second measurement sessions, but by a mean value of only 0.7°. A few significant differences were identified between 1 pair of observers by patella status and between patella statuses for 1 observer, but all mean differences were ≤ 1.7°. No significant difference in intraobserver variation was identified between patella statuses for any observer. Interobserver variation was not affected by patella status and measurement session. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Although some significant differences were identified in radiographic TPA measurements in dogs with medial patellar luxation, depending on whether the patella was luxated or manually reduced, these differences were so small they could be considered clinically unimportant. Consequently, we believe that in small-breed dogs with patellar luxation, patella status would be unlikely to have a clinically meaningful effect on the measured TPA. 3across-sectional studies 3adogs 3alinear models 3apatella (bones) 3aradiography 3astifle1 aNylund, Adam M.1 aMoorer, Jermiah D.1 aWills, Robert W.1 aWitsberger, Tige H.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 253, no. 6 p.746-751dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.253.6.746  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245008700170300001600257500015800273520107700431650001401508650002301522650001401545650001601559650001201575650001401587650001301601650001201614650001101626650001901637650001801656650001101674650001201685650001201697700001301709700001501722700001601737700001601753773014501769856005501914852000901969655001201978IND60612846820221121133548.0180911e20180630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061284682DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1205.782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, M.

Commercial cultivars for the production of macadamia nuts are derived from two species, M. tetraphylla and M. integrifolia. The different species of Macadamia have unique leaf and flowering patterns, due to inherent biological rhythms. Usually, M. tetraphylla has four leaves in a whorl, while the other species have three leaves per whorl. All species produce 1-2 florets at each raceme node. We identified a multi-pistillate macadamia genotype ('MPM1') with irregular leaf pattern and floral architecture. The genotype is a progeny of cultivars 'HAES 705' and 'NG18'. In this article, we described the characteristics of this plant and irregularities of its biological rhythm, including the number of leaves per whorl, ranging from 1 to 9, and variation in the number of pistils per floret. This irregular biological rhythm occurred during both vegetative and reproductive growth phases. Future molecular or epigenetic studies could determine the origin and mechanism of these unusual characteristics. 3aMacadamia 3abiological rhythms 3acultivars 3aepigenetics 3aflorets 3aflowering 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3amacadamia nuts 3amorphogenesis 3apistil 3aprogeny 3aracemes1 aNeal, J.1 aHowell, E.1 aRussell, D.1 aTopp, B.

DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. ANIMALS 15 client-owned cats with seizures that began at < 12 months of age. PROCEDURES Information on each cat was obtained from the medical records, veterinarians, and owners. Inclusion required an onset of seizures before 12 months of age and a complete medical record, including a final diagnosis. RESULTS 7 of the 15 cats had structural epilepsy, 4 had idiopathic epilepsy, and 4 had reactive seizures. Median age at seizure onset was 27 weeks (range, 0.4 to 41 weeks). Cluster seizures were reported in 6 cats, and status epilepticus was reported in 2. Age at the onset of seizures, presence of cluster seizures, and seizure semiology (ie, generalized vs focal seizures) were not significantly associated with seizure etiologic classification. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE Results suggested that cats that developed seizures at < 12 months of age were more likely to have structural epilepsy than idiopathic epilepsy or reactive seizures. Therefore, advanced diagnostic imaging is recommended in cats with juvenile-onset seizures if metabolic and toxic causes are excluded. 3acats 3acohort studies 3aepilepsy 3aetiology 3aimage analysis 3amedical records 3aseizures 3atoxicity 3aveterinarians1 aBarnes Heller, Heidi L.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2018 Sept. 15, v. 253, no. 6 p.763-767dAmerican Veterinary Medical AssociationwJournal:1913x0003-14887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.253.6.763  aDNAL 7aarticle03796naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002400167245008700191300001800278500001500296520261500311592002802926650001302954650002202967650003202989651001303021653002203034700002403056700002103080700002303101700002003124773009903144852000903243856011103252930003303363945001303396946001303409655001203422IND2203489820221121014348.0000331e199909  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220348982DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2102:FTOAAP]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWissinger, Scott A.10aFORAGING TRADE‐OFFS ALONG A PREDATOR–PERMANENCE GRADIENT IN SUBALPINE WETLANDS  ap. 2102-2116.  a2019-12-04  aWe conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to determine the direct and indirect effects of a top predator, the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum), on larvae of two species of limnephilid caddisflies (Limnephilus externus and Asynarchus nigriculus) in subalpine wetlands in central Colorado. Asynarchus larvae predominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and relatively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander‐induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator–predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density‐mediated and not trait‐mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Limnephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a trade‐off between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus. This and previous work implicate salamanders as keystone predators that exert a major influence on the composition of benthic and planktonic assemblages in subalpine wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 3awetlands 3aspecies diversity 3apredator-prey relationships 3aColorado 0acommunity ecology1 aWhiteman, Howard H.1 aSparks, Grace B.1 aRouse, Gretchen L.1 aBrown, Wendy S.0 tEcology.g1999 Sept., v. 80, no. 6 p.2102-2116dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080%5B2102:FTOAAP%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03708naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002100167245008400188300001800272520241900290592002802709650002402737650001302761650001402774650001502788650002602803650002302829651001102852651001002863700001702873700002202890700001802912700001902930700002002949700001202969700001602981773009802997852000903095856011103104930003303215945001303248946001303261655001203274IND2202920620221121014403.0000308e199912  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220292062DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2762:ENPPFM]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJenkinson, D. S.10aESTIMATING NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION FROM MEASUREMENTS MADE ON SOIL ORGANIC MATTER  ap. 2762-2773.  aA model for the turnover of organic matter in soil, ROTHC‐26.3, can be used to calculate how much organic C needs to enter a soil annually in order to maintain a specified stock of soil organic C. The annual return of organic C thus calculated, plus the amount of organic C removed annually from the site by harvesting, burning, etc., provides an estimate of the Net Primary Production (NPP) of that site, averaged over many years. The new method was used to calculate NPP for two adjacent savanna sites in the Nairobi National Park in Kenya, one grazed and one not, and for a dry Miombo woodland site in Zambia. Both the Kenyan and Zambian sites are taken to be at equilibrium, with soil organic C levels at steady state. Soils from the three sites were analyzed by layer for organic C, δ¹⁴C, δ¹³C, soil microbial biomass C, total N, pH, and clay content. Radiocarbon measurements were >100% modern in the surface layers (0–15 cm) of the Kenyan soils (both Vertisols) and in all three layers (0–15, 15–30 and 30–50 cm) of the Zambian soil (an Oxisol), presumably because of ¹⁴C coming from the testing of thermonuclear bombs. The 15–30 cm layer of the Kenyan soils dated at ∼500 yr and the 30–50 cm layer at ∼900 yr. The ¹⁴C data were consistent with the presence of a small inert fraction of organic C that accounted for an increasing proportion of total organic C with increasing soil depth. The ¹³C data indicated that the Kenyan soils had developed under C₄ vegetation, whereas the Zambian soils had developed under vegetation dominated by C₃ plants. From these results the annual input of C to soil from the ungrazed Kenyan site was calculated to be 388 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹, to the grazed site 380 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹, and to the Zambian soil 373 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹. Taking the loss of C from the Kenyan sites by burning to be 40 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹, the mean NPP for both Kenyan sites is 424 g C·m⁻²·yr⁻¹. This value for NPP is compatible with earlier estimates of NPP by botanical methods from the same site in Kenya. Wood‐taking is thought to be minimal in the protected Zambian woodland, so that here the annual input of C to the soil can be taken as the NPP without great error. This new method provides a long‐term, integrated measure of NPP that should complement and enhance productivity measurements made by harvest methods over shorter periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic matter 3asavannas 3awoodlands 3aestimation 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass production 3aZambia 3aKenya1 aMeredith, J.1 aKinyamario, J.

Landscape simulation models offer an approach to studying such systems at broad scales. Fire can be simulated spatially using mechanistic or stochastic approaches. We describe the fire module in a spatially explicit, stochastic model of forest landscape dynamics (LANDIS) that incorporates fire, windthrow, and harvest disturbance with species‐level succession. A stochastic approach is suited to forest landscape models that are designed to simulate patterns over large spatial and time domains and are not used deterministically to predict individual events. We used the model to examine how disturbance regimes and species dynamics interact across a large (500 000 ha), heterogeneous landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA, with six land types having different species environments, and fire disturbance return intervals varying from 200 to 1000 yr. The model shows that there are feedbacks over time between species, disturbance, and environment, resulting in the re‐emergence of patterns that characterized the landscape before extensive alteration. Landscape equilibrium of species composition and age‐class structure develops at three scales from the initial, disturbed landscape. Over 100–150 yr, fine‐grained successional processes cause gradual disaggregation of the initial pattern of relatively homogenous composition and age classes. Species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), largely removed from the landscape by past human activities, only slowly re‐invade. Next, patterns on the various land types diverge, driven by different disturbance regimes and dominant species. Finally, aging of the landscape causes the probabilities of larger and more severe fires to increase, and a coarse‐grained pattern develops from the disturbance patches. Influence of adjacent land types is shown as fires spread across land type boundaries, although modified in spread and severity. As found by others, altered landscapes are likely to retain their modified pattern for centuries, suggesting that nonequilibrium conditions between tree species and climate will persist under predicted rates of climate change. The results suggest that this modeling approach can be useful in examining species‐level, broad‐scale responses of heterogeneous landscapes to changes in landscape disturbance, such as modified management or land‐use scenarios, or effects of global change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecological succession 3alandscape ecology 3asimulation models 3afires 3aWisconsin 0aland types1 aMladenoff, David J.0 tEcology.g1999 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.81-99dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080%5B0081:SEASSO%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03882naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001800167245010600185300001800291520273200309592002803041650001603069650002603085650002203111650001803133650001903151650001103170650002603181651001803207700001803225773009803243852000903341856011103350930003303461945001303494946001303507655001203520IND2197765120221120202841.0990325e199812  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219776512DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1998)079[2660:HECACL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBassow, S. L.10aHOW ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AFFECT CANOPY LEAF‐LEVEL PHOTOSYNTHESIS IN FOUR DECIDUOUS TREE SPECIES  ap. 2660-2675.  aSpecies composition of temperate forests vary with successional age (i.e., years after a major disturbance) and seems likely to change in response to significant global climate change. Because photosynthesis rates in co‐occurring tree species can differ in their sensitivity to environmental conditions, these changes in species composition are likely to alter the carbon dynamics of temperate forests. To help improve our understanding of such atmosphere–biosphere interactions, we explored changes in leaf‐level photosynthesis in a 60–70 yr old temperate mixed‐deciduous forest in Petersham, Massachusetts (USA). Diurnally and seasonally varying environmental conditions differentially influenced in situ leaf‐level photosynthesis rates in the canopies of four mature temperate deciduous tree species: red oak (Quercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), white birch (Betula papyrifera), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). We measured in situ photosynthesis at two heights within the canopies (top of the canopy at ∼20 m, and in the sub‐canopy of the same individual trees at ∼14–16 m) through a diurnal time course on 7 d over two growing seasons. We simultaneously measured a suite of environmental conditions surrounding the leaf at the time of each measurement. We used path analysis to examine the influence of environmental factors on in situ photosynthesis in the tree canopies. Overall, red oak had the highest photosynthesis rates, followed by white birch, yellow birch, and red maple. There was little evidence for a substantial midday depression in photosynthesis. Instead, photosynthesis declined throughout the day, particularly after 1600. Diurnal patterns of light reaching canopy leaves, leaf and air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) contributed to diurnally varying photosynthesis rates. Large differences in these parameters through the growing season partly led to the seasonal differences observed in photosynthesis rates. Path analyses helped to identify the relative contribution of various environmental factors on photosynthesis and further revealed that species‐specific sensitivities to various environmental conditions shifted through the season. Red oak photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to air temperatures late in the season when air temperatures were low. Further, red maple photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to high VPDs through the growing season. Incorporating data on the physiological differences among tree species into forest carbon models will greatly improve our ability to predict alterations to the forest carbon budgets under various environmental scenarios such as global climate change, or with differing species composition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer rubrum 3aBetula alleghaniensis 3aBetula papyrifera 3aQuercus rubra 3aphotosynthesis 3acanopy 3aenvironmental factors 3aMassachusetts1 aBazzaz, F.

The species richness of herbs was measured in 24 small patches (0.5–3 ha) of serpentine soil and 24 equivalently spaced sets of sampling sites on four large areas (>5 km²) of serpentine soil in the North Coast Ranges of California. Patchy and continuous sites were compared with respect to local diversity (species richness within 5 × 50 m transects), regional diversity (species richness at all 24 sites combined), and among‐site differentiation (average proportion of species unshared between any one site and the other 23 sites of its kind). For all herb species together, regional diversity and average local diversity were higher on small patches, mainly because of a significantly higher number of alien species. For the subset (14%) of herb species that were endemic to serpentine, regional diversity was similar on patchy and continuous sites, but it was partitioned differently; local diversity was lower, and among‐site differentiation was higher on small patches. Herb diversity also showed significant gradients with soil calcium levels, and these effects were not independent of site type (patchy or continuous). Soil calcium was correlated positively with the number of alien species on small patches, and negatively with the number of serpentine‐endemic species on continuous sites. Also, total herb diversity was negatively correlated with elevation on continuous sites. However, patchy and continuous sites did not differ in their average calcium levels or elevation. These results agree with theory predicting that, relative to communities in widespread habitats, local communities in patchy habitats will contain more habitat generalist and fewer habitat specialist species. However, the results also suggest that the effects of habitat geometry interact with those of habitat quality in this system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aspecies diversity 3asoil chemistry 3aaltitude 3alandscape ecology 3aCalifornia 0asite factors 0aserpentine communities 0asoil calcium0 tEcology.g1999 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.70-80dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080%5B0070:LARDIA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03235naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100001800167245009500185300001600280500001500296520211700311592002802428650001502456650002502471650002202496650001502518650003202533653002602565700001902591773009602610852000902706856011102715930003302826945001302859946001302872655001202885IND2199478720221120202935.0990628e199904  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219947872DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0761:BULOPA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Benrong10aBOTTOM‐UP LIMITATION OF PREDACEOUS ARTHROPODS IN A DETRITUS‐BASED TERRESTRIAL FOOD WEB  ap. 761-772.  a2019-12-04  aKnowing how an increase in the resource base of a food web produces effects that propagate through the web is central to developing a clearer understanding of food‐web structure and dynamics.

Open 2 × 5 m plots on the floor of a deciduous forest were randomly assigned to either a Food Enhancement or Control treatment. We supplemented the resource base of the arthropod community of the leaf litter layer for 3.5 mo by periodically adding chopped mushrooms, potatoes, and instant fruit fly medium to the Food Enhancement plots. Major taxa of detritivores and fungivores increased in response to added food. Densities of springtails (Collembola) were on average 3× higher in the Food Enhancement than Control plots. Numbers of adult fungus gnats (Diptera: Sciaridae and Mycetophilidae) did not differ significantly between treatments after 6 wk but were >2× higher in Food Enhancement plots at the end of the experiment. Total Diptera were twice as abundant in Food Enhancement plots on both census dates. Arthropod groups that include a range of feeding strategies also increased. Mites (Acarina), which include detritivores, fungivores, and predators, were twice as abundant in the experimental treatment. Staphylinid and carabid beetles (Coleoptera), which are primarily predaceous but include omnivorous species, were several times more numerous in the Food Enhancement plots. Effects of increasing the resource base propagated through the food web, leading to higher densities of the major strictly predaceous arthropod taxa. Centipedes (Chilopoda), pseudoscorpions (Pseudoscorpionida), and spiders (Araneae) were ∼2× as abundant in the Food Enhancement treatment. Thus, our experiment uncovered substantial bottom‐up limitation in this detritus‐based food web, expressed as responses by predaceous arthropods at least two trophic links removed from the experimentally elevated resource.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3apredatory arthropods 3acommunity ecology 3afood chain 3apredator-prey relationships 0atrophic relationships1 aWise, David H.0 tEcology.g1999 Apr., v. 80, no. 3 p.761-772dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080%5B0761:BULOPA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03254naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002500167245008700192300001600279520219800295592002802493650002202521650001802543650001902561650002802580650002302608700002202631773009602653852000902749856011102758930003302869945001302902946001302915655001202928IND2198444820221120192623.0990429e199903  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219844482DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0455:PDDSRA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStevens, M. Henry H.10aPLANT DENSITY DETERMINES SPECIES RICHNESS ALONG AN EXPERIMENTAL FERTILITY GRADIENT  ap. 455-465.  aA number of authors have suggested that, within areas a few square meters to many square kilometers in size, species diversity appears to peak at moderate levels of productivity, and this pattern is currently unexplained. Among the best examples of this pattern have been descriptions of vegetation in which species richness declines as soil fertility increases. We tested two hypotheses that have been proposed to explain this pattern. The interspecific competitive exclusion hypothesis proposes that dominant species suppress the growth of competitively subordinate species and exclude subordinate species as fertility rises. In contrast, the assemblage‐level thinning hypothesis proposes that individuals of all species tend to become larger as fertility rises, and individuals of all species tend to exclude subordinate individuals of each species. Because total density declines, samples of finite numbers of individuals will result in fewer species by chance alone. To test these hypotheses, we established an experimental productivity gradient in a first‐year old field using four levels of slow‐release NPK fertilizer (0, 8, 16, and 32 g N/m²). At the end of the growing season, we sampled aboveground biomass and numbers of stems for each species in 72 20 × 20 cm subplots (18 reps × 4 levels), with an average sample size of 260 individual stems per plot. We observed an 80% decline in stem density with increasing fertility, and a 50% decline in species richness along this fertility gradient. A simulation of random thinning along a fertility gradient showed a nearly identical decline in species richness, supporting the assemblage‐level thinning hypothesis. We also found that responses of individual species to the soil fertility gradient showed virtually no support for interspecific competitive exclusion. The overwhelming influence of density found in this study suggests that plant species richness along many productivity gradients may be strongly influenced by total stem density, and that differences in competitive ability among species, although generally important, are not necessary to create dramatic changes in species richness along fertility gradients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aspecies diversity 3aplant density 3asoil fertility 3aAmbrosia artemisiifolia 3abiomass production1 aCarson, Walter P.0 tEcology.g1999 Mar., v. 80, no. 2 p.455-465dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080%5B0455:PDDSRA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle03267naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005700092040001800149100002100167245010000188300001600288520229000304592002802594650002202622650001402644650002202658651001002680773009602690852000902786856011102795930003302906945001302939946001302952655001202965IND2199479120221120192554.0990628e199904  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219947912DNAL7 a10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[0806:SOFTAA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Neil, Pamela10aSELECTION ON FLOWERING TIME: AN ADAPTIVE FITNESS SURFACE FOR NONEXISTENT CHARACTER COMBINATIONS  ap. 806-820.  aThe purpose of this study was to determine how natural selection might have shaped the flowering phenologies currently observed in natural populations by examining the potential mechanisms of selection and generating a hypothetical fitness surface that includes phenotype combinations that do not occur in natural populations. To this end I tagged >3500 individual flowers to track seed set on a per‐day basis, performed a hand pollination experiment, and quantified pollinator visitation throughout the flowering season in a population of Lythrum salicaria. I then used the seed production data to construct a hypothetical adaptive surface for two highly correlated characters: date of initial flowering and flowering duration. I found evidence of temporal variation in seed set that can be explained by temporal patterns of pollinator visitation. There were significant effects of date (linear and quadratic) and number of flowering stems on the number of pollinator visits per patch. A significant date × number of stems interaction indicated that the effect of number of stems was dependent on flowering date. Early in the flowering season pollinator visitation was dependent on the density of plants in flower. However, late in the season pollinators stopped visiting the patch for reasons unrelated to flowering plant density. A hand‐pollination experiment demonstrated that the paucity of pollinators late in the season resulted in late‐season pollinator limitation. Late‐season pollinator limitation could explain the shape of the fitness surface. The shape of the estimated fitness surface indicates saturating directional selection on flowering duration and a combination of directional and stabilizing selection on date of flowering initiation. The estimated fitness surface has a single peak located at the earliest date of flowering initiation and the longest flowering duration. This fitness peak is at the same point as the point of highest fitness in the actual fitness distribution. Areas of the phenotype space representing nonexistent phenotype combinations were the locations of fitness valleys on the hypothetical fitness surface. This suggests that the correlation between date of initial flowering and flowering duration is the result of past selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLythrum salicaria 3aflowering 3anatural selection 3aMaine0 tEcology.g1999 Apr., v. 80, no. 3 p.806-820dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080%5B0806:SOFTAA%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdRE1  aOther US 7aarticle02786naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245008900191300001600280500002400296520141800320650001301738650001401751650001201765650002101777650001501798650002301813650001601836650001501852650002201867650001301889650004101902650001201943650002201955650003501977650001102012650003302023650001602056700001502072700001402087700002902101773012902130852000902259856004802268655001202316IND4451574020221120182130.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445157402DNAL7 a206075302pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-010-9563-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorillo-Velarde, P.

This article investigates changes in the locomotor activity rhythms of the amphipod Gammarus aequicauda exposed to cadmium (Cd) as a model to study the effect of pollutants on an ecologically important species. Under a 12:12 h light-to-dark cycle, G. aequicauda showed a strict nocturnal rhythm, with 90.2 ± 0.4% of their total daily activity occurring during the night. Under constant darkness, circadian rhythms persisted for 10 days, with a mean periodicity of 24.32 h, thus confirming endogenous control. Exposure to sublethal concentrations of Cd (0.16, 0.20, 0.24, and 0.28 mg l⁻¹) did not change the nocturnal activity patterns of G. aequicauda, although their swimming activity during the night was significantly decreased by exposure to concentrations of 0.24 and 0.28 mg Cd l⁻¹. In conclusion, locomotor activity bioassays using the amphipod G. aequicauda appeared to be a sensitive indicator of Cd contamination, and sensitivity and tolerance to Cd in short-term bioassays may depend on the time of the day tests are carried out. These results provide further support for the idea that behavioural end points in amphipods are useful indicators of pollutant exposure and that future studies should take circadian rhythms into consideration. 3aGammarus 3abioassays 3acadmium 3acircadian rhythm 3alocomotion 3anocturnal activity 3aperiodicity 3apollutants 3asublethal effects 3aswimming 2aAmphipodaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aCadmiumxtoxicity 2aCircadian Rhythmxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aMotor Activityxdrug effects 2aPhotoperiod1 aLloret, J.1 aMarin, A.1 aSánchez-Vázquez, F.

Predicting the current and potential distributions of established invasive species is critical for evaluating management options, but methods for differentiating these distributions have received little attention. In particular, there is uncertainty among invasive species managers about the value of information from incidental sightings compared to data from designed field surveys. This study compares the two approaches, and develops a unifying framework, using the case of invasive sambar deer Cervus unicolor in Victoria, Australia. 2. We first used 391 incidental sightings of sambar deer and 12 biophysical variables to construct a presence-only habitat suitability model using Maxent. We then used that model to stratify field sampling, with proportionately greater sampling of cells with high predicted habitat suitability. Field sampling, consisting of faecal pellet surveys, sign surveys and camera trapping, was conducted in 80 4-km² grid cells. A Bayesian state-space occupancy model was used to predict probability of suitable habitat from the field data. 3. The Maxent and occupancy models predicted similar spatial distributions of habitat suitability for sambar deer in Victoria and there was a strong positive correlation between the rankings of cells by the two approaches. The congruence of the two models suggests that any spatial and detection biases in the presence-only data were relatively unimportant in our study. 4. We predicted the extent of suitable habitat from the occupancy model using a threshold that gave a false negative error rate of 0·05. The current distribution was the suitable habitat within a kernel that had a 99·5% chance of including the presence locations pooled from incidental sightings and field surveys: the potential distribution was suitable habitat outside that kernel. Several discrete areas of potential distribution were identified as priorities for surveillance monitoring with the aim of detecting and managing incursions of sambar deer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our framework enables managers to robustly estimate the current and potential distributions of established invasive species using either presence-only and/or presence-absence data. Managers can then focus control and/or containment actions within the current distribution and establish surveillance monitoring to detect incursions within the potential distribution.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adeer 3amanagers 3aRusa unicolor 3amonitoring 3atrapping 3auncertainty 3amodels 3asurveys 3ainvasive species 3ahabitats 3aprediction 3aAustralia 0aCervus unicolor1 aForsyth, David M.1 aGriffioen, Peter1 aLindeman, Michael1 aRamsey, David S.L.1 aScroggie, Michael P.1 aWoodford, Luke0 tJournal of applied ecology.g2011 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.25-34dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-89017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01911.x 7aarticle01989naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245015300174300001600327500002400343520101900367650002701386650001701413650001001430650002001440650002101460650001301481651000901494651001701503773009801520852000901618856004801627655001201675IND4445165420221120141432.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444516542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-009-9777-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdul-Wahab, Sabah Ahmed10aLevel of environmental awareness towards depletion of the ozone layer among distributors and consumers in the solvent sector: a case study from Oman  ap. 503-517.  aIncludes references  aThe main objective of this study was to assess the level of environmental awareness among ozone depleting substances (ODSs) distributors and consumers in the solvent sector in the Arabian Gulf country of Oman. The focus was on ozone depleting substances that are usually released in cleaning, formulation solvent and process agent processes (CFC-113, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, CTC-carbon tetrachloride). A comparison between importers and end-users of ODSs and the public in relation to environmental awareness regarding ozone layer depletion was carried out. The results showed that environmental knowledge about ozone layer depletion was higher among the importers and end-users of ODSs than amongst the public. Nevertheless, there were much smaller differences in environmental attitudes and behaviors between the importers and end-users of ODSs, and the public toward ozone layer depletion. This showed that the public in the case study country has a very positive attitudes and behaviors towards the environment. 3aattitudes and opinions 3acase studies 3aozone 3aozone depletion 3apublic relations 3asolvents 3aOman 3aPersian Gulf0 tClimatic change.g2010 Dec., v. 103, no. 3-4 p.503-517dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9777-x 7aarticle02459naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245014000169300001600309500002400325520141500349650002201764650002001786650001801806650001901824650003301843650001001876651001001886700001801896700002301914700001901937773010801956852000902064856004802073655001202121IND4419975420221120141400.0090501e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441997542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-009-0159-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuoka, Yoshihiro10aGenealogical analysis of subspecies divergence and spikelet-shape diversification in central Eurasian wild wheat Aegilops tauschii Coss  ap. 233-244.  aIncludes references  aThe genealogical and geographic structure of variation in spikelet morphology was analyzed for central Eurasian wild wheat Aegilops tauschii Coss. using a diverse array of 203 sample accessions that represented the entire species range. In this sample set, two subspecies were identified on the basis of sensu-stricto criteria: only the accessions having markedly moniliform spikes were assigned to Ae. tauschii Coss. subspecies strangulata (Eig) Tzvel., whereas those having mildly moniliform and cylindrical spikes to Ae. tauschii Coss. subspecies tauschii. In a graph of the first two axes from a principal component analysis based on nine spikelet traits, the plots of the two subspecies formed separate clusters, indicating that subspecies strangulata sens. str. is a practically usable taxon. Chloroplast-DNA-based genealogical analyses suggested that subspecies strangulata diverged from an ancestor that carried a specific chloroplast DNA type, whereas, after divergence, this subspecies became polyphyletic, likely through hybridization. Geographically, significant longitudinal and latitudinal clines were detected for spikelet size, with spikelets tending to be small in the eastern and southern regions. These results shed some light on the patterns of subspecies divergence and spikelet-shape diversification in the course of Ae. tauschii's long-distance dispersal from the Transcaucasus to China. 3aAegilops tauschii 3achloroplast DNA 3ahybridization 3ainflorescences 3aprincipal component analysis 3awheat 3aChina1 aNishioka, Emi1 aKawahara, Taihachi1 aTakumi, Shigeo0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2009 May, v. 279, no. 1-4 p.233-244dSpringer Viennax0378-26977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-009-0159-7 7aarticle02487naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002100142245011700163300001600280500002400296520132700320650002001647650002201667650001301689650001001702650001601712650001501728650000901743650001801752650002001770650002201790700001901812700001901831700002001850700002301870700001701893773012501910852000902035856004502044655001202089IND4450629420221120074657.0110311e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445062942DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2010004802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamlet, Colin G.10aFormation and occurrence of esters of 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol (3-CPD) in foods: What we know and what we assume  ap. 279-303.  aIncludes references  aAlthough chloropropanols have historically been associated with the savoury food ingredient hydrolyzed vegetable protein (HVP), prepared by acid hydrolysis, the discovery of significant amounts of 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol (3-CPD) ‘bound' as fatty acid esters in foodstuffs (3-CPD esters), especially in refined edible oils, is still a relatively recent discovery.

Sludge drying reed beds appear as a new and alternative technology which has low energy requirements, reduced operating and maintenance costs, and causes little environmental impact. The objective of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of three full-scale drying reed beds in terms of sludge dewatering, stabilization and hygienisation. Samples of influent sludge and sludge accumulated in the reed beds were analysed for pH, Electrical Conductivity, Total Solids (TS), Volatile Solids (VS), Chemical Oxygen Demand, Biochemical Oxygen Demand, nutrients (Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) and Total Phosphorus (TP)), heavy metals and faecal bacteria indicators (Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp.). Lixiviate samples were also collected. There was a systematic increase in the TS concentration from 1-3% in the influent to 20-30% in the beds, which fits in the range obtained with conventional dewatering technologies. Progressive organic matter removal and sludge stabilization in the beds was also observed (VS concentration decreased from 52-67% TS in the influent to 31-49% TS in the beds). Concentration of nutrients of the sludge accumulated in the beds was quite low (TKN 2-7% TS and TP 0.04-0.7% TS), and heavy metals remained below law threshold concentrations. Salmonella spp. was not detected in any of the samples, while E. coli concentration was generally lower than 460MPN/g in the sludge accumulated in the beds. The studied systems demonstrated a good efficiency for sludge dewatering and stabilization in the context of small remote wastewater treatment plants. 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental impact 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3aorganic matter 3aSalmonella 3aindicator species 3aheavy metals 3aoperating costs 3awastewater treatment 3asludge 3adewatering 3atotal solids 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenergy requirements 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3aEscherichia coli 2aBacteriaxisolation & purification 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aDesiccation 2aElectric Conductivity 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediationxmethods 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aOrganic Chemicalsxisolation & purification 2aOxygen 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPoaceaexmetabolism 2aSewagexchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aVolatilization 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Purification 3aSpain 0aSpain 0anew technology 0atechnology1 aLlorens, Esther1 aPedescoll, Anna1 aFerrer, Ivet1 aCastellnou, Roger1 aGarcía, Joan0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Sept., v. 100, no. 17 p.3882-3890dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.03.047 7aarticle03931naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245014100199300001600340500002400356506007600380520216300456506003702619650001502656650001502671650001402686650002202700650002102722650002202743650003702765650001602802650002602818650002402844650002302868650001302891650002802904650001602932650003802948650003202986650001303018650001403031650005503045650004003100700001903140700002203159700002203181773009903203852000903302856007803311655001203389IND4436281520221207130542.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443628152DNAL7 a202280892pmid7 aPMC28599102pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcq0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrew, Rose L.10aGenetic and environmental contributions to variation and population divergence in a broad-spectrum foliar defence of Eucalyptus tricarpa  ap. 707-717.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Both environmental and genetic effects contribute to phenotypic variation within and among populations. Genetic differentiation of quantitative traits among populations has been shown in many species, yet it can also be accompanied by other genetic changes, such as divergence in phenotypic plasticity and in genetic variance. Sideroxylonal (a formylated phloroglucinol compound or FPC) is an important chemical defence in eucalypts. The effect of environmental variation on its production is a critical gap in our understanding of its genetics and evolution. METHODS: The stability of genetic variation in sideroxylonal was assessed within and among populations of Eucalyptus tricarpa in three replicated provenance/progeny trials. The covariance structure of the data was also modelled to test whether genetic variances were consistent among populations and Fain's test was applied for major gene effects. KEY RESULTS: A significant genotype x environment interaction occurred at the level of population, and was related to temperature range and seasonality in source populations. Within-population genetic variation was not affected by genotype x environment effects or different sampling years. However, within-population genetic variance for sideroxylonal concentration differed significantly among source populations. Regression of family variance on family mean suggested that this trait is subject to major gene effects, which could explain the observed differences in genetic variances among populations. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of replicated common-garden experiments for understanding the genetic basis of population differences. Genotype x environment interactions are unlikely to impede evolution or responses to artificial selection on sideroxylonal, but the lack of genetic variation in some populations may be a constraint. The results are broadly consistent with localized selection on foliar defence and illustrate that differentiation in population means, whether due to selection or to drift, can be accompanied by changes in other characteristics, such as plasticity and genetic variance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEucalyptus 3acovariance 3aevolution 3agenetic stability 3agenetic variance 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3amajor genes 3aphenotypic plasticity 3aquantitative traits 3aselection response 3avariance 2aBenzofuransxmetabolism 2aEnvironment 2aEucalyptusxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aGenotype 2aPhenotype 2aPhloroglucinolxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aWallis, Ian R.1 aHarwood, Chris E.1 aFoley, William J.0 tAnnals of botany.g2010 May, v. 105, no. 5 p.707-717dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcq0343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03484naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002400156245015700180300001800337500002400355520137000379650001501749650002001764650001101784650001901795650001901814650001901833650001801852650001201870650001901882650001001901650001001911650001101921650002501932650001201957650002301969650002101992650001402013650001102027650003302038650002302071650001402094650001102108650001002119650003002129650002602159650004702185650001202232650001402244650001402258650002402272650001702296650002602313650002002339650002002359650002402379650001702403650002302420650002202443650001402465650001202479700002202491700002102513700002002534773013502554852000902689856004002698655001202738IND4459155220221120065300.0110617e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445915522DNAL7 a214802692pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.43982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayanegara, Anuraga10aNutrient and energy content, in vitro ruminal fermentation characteristics and methanogenic potential of alpine forage plant species during early summer  ap. 1863-1870.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Plants growing on alpine meadows are reported to be rich in phenols. Such compounds may affect ruminal fermentation and reduce the plants' methanogenic potential, making alpine grazing advantageous in this respect. The objective of this study was to quantify nutrients and phenols in Alpine forage grasses, herbs and trees collected over 2 years and, in a 24 h in vitro incubation, their effects on ruminal fermentation parameters. RESULTS: The highest in vitro gas production, resulting in metabolisable energy values around 10 MJ kg⁻¹, were found with Alchemilla xanthochlora and Crepis aurea (herbaceous species) and with Sambucus nigra leaves and flowers (tree species). Related to the amount of total gas production, methane formation was highest with Nardus stricta, and lowest with S. nigra and A. xanthochlora. In addition, Castanea sativa leaves led to an exceptional low methane production, but this was accompanied by severely impaired ruminal fermentation. When the data were analysed by principal component analysis, phenol concentrations were negatively related with methane proportion in total gas. CONCLUSION: Variation in methane production potential across the investigated forages was small. The two goals of limited methane production potential and high nutritive value for ruminants were met best by A. xanthochlora and S. nigra. 3aAlchemilla 3aCastanea sativa 3aCrepis 3aNardus stricta 3aSambucus nigra 3aalpine meadows 3aalpine plants 3aflowers 3aforage grasses 3agases 3aherbs 3aleaves 3ametabolizable energy 3amethane 3amethane production 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphenol 3aprincipal component analysis 3arumen fermentation 3aruminants 3asummer 3atrees 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistry. 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDigestion 2aEcosystem 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aFermentation 2aMethanexbiosynthesis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aNutritive Value 2aPhenolsxmetabolism 2aPlant Leaves 2aPoaceaexchemistry 2aRumenxmetabolism 2aRuminants 2aSeasons1 aMarquardt, Svenja1 aKreuzer, Michael1 aLeiber, Florian0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 91, no. 10 p.1863-1870dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4398 7aarticle02661naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009700127300001600224520146300240650004301703650002001746650002601766650001401792650001001806650001101816650001801827650001601845650001801861650003701879650003101916653002001947653002501967653003601992653002602028653002902054653001602083700001602099773006902115852000902184930003302193946001302226655001202239IND8904294220221120053218.0890808e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890429422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeston, L.A.10aTolerance of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) to clomazone  ap. 285-289.  aPronounced differences in the tolerance of tomatoes and bell peppers to clomazone observed in field studies were confirmed in a greenhouse experiment. In greenhouse studies, preemergence clomazone rates causing 50% visible injury on bell pepper and tomato seedlings 10 days after application were 9.4 and 0.1 kg/ha, respectively. Based on growth inhibition, bell peppers were 40-fold more tolerant of clomazone than tomatoes 20 days after clomazone application. In laboratory studies investigating the basis for differential clomazone tolerance, no differences in uptake of 14C-clomazone from nutrient solutions between tomato and bell pepper plants were observed after 24 h. Minor differences were observed in the distribution of 14C label within plants; a higher percentage of 14C was recovered in bell pepper roots than in tomato roots while the opposite was true for the shoots. Clomazone was metabolized to two products in roots of both bell peppers and tomatoes within 48 h after treatment. Tomato shoots were more active in converting clomazone to these metabolites than were tomato roots. Bell pepper roots converted more clomazone to metabolites than did tomato roots 24 h after treatment. However, by 72 h, differences in clomazone metabolite levels between species were negligible in both roots and shoots. Enzymatic and acid hydrolysis of soluble, polar clomazone metabolites indicated that these metabolites may be sugar conjugates of clomazone. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aCapsicum annuum 3apesticide application 3aseedlings 3aroots 3ashoots 3afoliar uptake 3ametabolites 3aphytotoxicity 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3agreenhouse experimentation 0aherbicide rates 0aherbicide metabolism 0aresistance to injurious factors 0aherbicide selectivity 0apreemergence application 0adimethazone1 aBarrett, M.0 tWeed science.g1989 May, v. 37, no. 3 p.285-289x0043-17457nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02053naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010900128300001600237500001500253520119300268650001501461650001601476650002001492650002101512650001801533650002001551653000901571700001501580773008901595852000901684939003301693946001301726655001201739IND8904095220221120031717.0890728e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890409522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNianogo, A.J.10aInfluence of dietary fat and protein level on milk production, milk composition and ration digestibility  ap. 129-137.  a2019-12-04  aSixteen multiparous (M) and eight primiparous (P) Holstein cows 30 to 60 days in lactation were blocked into 4 balanced groups of 6 cows based on milk yield for a 56-day study. The groups were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments to determine the effect of protein level in diets containing added lipids on intake, digestion, milk yield, milk composition and body weight changes. Treatments were: A) control plus .45 kg corn/d; B) control + .45 kg soybean meal (SBM)/d; C) control + .45 kg corn/d + 4% fat; D) control + .45 kg/day SMB plus 4% fat. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) silage provided the roughage. Dry matter intake (DMI) was not affected by fat or protein addition. However, DMI was higher for M than for P cows and silage intake was lower for cows receiving fat. Cows fed 4% fat produced more milk and tended to produce more milk fat than cows fed diets without fat. Cows fed D gained more weight than cows fed B or C. Dietary fat increased crude protein and gross energy digestibility. In this study fat did not alter DMI or milk CP concentration. Feeding dietary fat and supplemental protein together contributed to higher weight gains while maintaining production. 3adairy cows 3adietary fat 3amilk production 3afood composition 3adigestibility 3aprotein content 0adiet1 aAmos, H.E.0 tNutrition reports international.g1989 July, v. 40, no. 1 p.129-137x0029-66357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03012naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010600169300001600275500002400291520186500315650001302180650001202193650002102205650001502226650001902241650002102260650002502281650001302306650002202319650001102341650002402352650001402376651001602390651001802406651001002424700001602434773009502450852000902545856004802554655001202602IND4430170320221121141553.0091218e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443017032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-008-9209-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, Veronica10aMesozooplankton community in the Bay of Bengal (India): spatial variability during the summer monsoon  ap. 951-963.  aIncludes references  aThis study addresses the spatial variability in mesozooplankton biomass and composition in the Central and Western Bay of Bengal (India) during the summer monsoon season of 2001. Perennially warmer sea surface temperatures (>28°C), stratified top layer (sea surface salinity, 28-33 psu), high turbidity, and low nutrient concentrations due to weak/null upwelling and light limitation make the Bay of Bengal a region of low primary productivity. Despite this, mesozooplankton biomass values, i.e. 2.9-104 mg C m⁻³ in the Central Bay and 1.3-31 mg C m⁻³ in the Western Bay, observed in the mixed layer (2-51 m) during the summer monsoon were in the same range as reported from the more productive Arabian Sea. Mesozooplankton biomass was five times and density 18 times greater at stations with signatures of cold-core eddies, causing a higher spatial heterogeneity in zooplankton distribution. Among the 27 taxonomic groups recorded during the season, Copepoda was the most abundant group in all samples followed by Chaetognatha. The dominant order of Copepoda, Calanoida, was represented by 132 species in a total of 163 species recorded. Oncaea venusta was the key copepod species in the Bay. In the Central Bay, the predominant copepod species were carnivorous/omnivorous vis-a-vis mostly herbivores in the Western Bay. Pleuromamma indica increased to its maximum abundance at 18°N in the Central Bay, coinciding with the lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations. The Central Bay had higher mesozooplankton biomass, copepod species richness and diversity than in the Western Bay. Although zooplankton biomass and densities were greater at the eddy stations, correlation between zooplankton and chl a was not statistically significant. It appears that the grazer mesozooplankton rapidly utilize the enhanced phytoplankton production in cold-core eddies. 3aCopepoda 3abiomass 3adissolved oxygen 3aherbivores 3amonsoon season 3anutrient content 3aprimary productivity 3asalinity 3aspecies diversity 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3aturbidity 3aArabian Sea 3aBay of Bengal 3aIndia1 aRamaiah, N.0 tAquatic ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 43, no. 4 p.951-963dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-008-9209-4 7aarticle02916naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245012000175300001600295500002400311520174300335650002402078650001002102650001402112650002002126650001502146650001302161650002102174650001202195650002302207650001002230650001202240650001302252650001202265650001902277650000902296700002402305773009202329852000902421856007602430655001202506IND4390459720221121073225.0070416s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439045972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01350.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, Valerie S.10aSex Allocation in Response to Maternal Condition: Different Tactics of Care-Giving by Male and Female Zebra Finches  ap. 511-520.  aIncludes references  aWhile behavioral ecologists have studied sex allocation for 30 yr, almost nothing is known about the roles of male vs. female parents in making secondary allocation decisions in species with bi-parental care. To investigate possible sex differences in tactics in zebra finches, we manipulated the condition of one cohort of females by trimming their flight feathers; a second cohort of females and all males were left intact. Focal observations of feeding behavior revealed that manipulated females did not reduce their feeding time, but rather focused their efforts on rearing sons, while control females allocated effort to rearing daughters. Males mated to manipulated females tended to focus effort to daughters, while control males showed no consistent response. Manipulated females experienced a lower reproductive rate, primarily because of a low daughter rate, relative to control females. Manipulated females also laid smaller clutches and had longer inter-clutch intervals, which suggest that their ability to metabolize and allocate essential proteins from pectoral muscle mass during the egg-laying period was impaired. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that parents of both sexes make active sex allocation decisions when the physiological condition of one parent is manipulated; males do not simply adopt female allocation patterns, but make complementary adjustments. Our results have implications for interpretation of handicapping studies that seek to understand the dynamics of inter-sexual negotiations of care-giving. Investigation of sex differences in sex allocation tactics in species with limited dietary protein, such as granivorous birds, is a potentially important direction for future research. 3aTaeniopygia guttata 3abirds 3adaughters 3adietary protein 3aecologists 3afeathers 3afeeding behavior 3afemales 3agender differences 3amales 3aparents 3aproteins 3arearing 3asex allocation 3asons1 aBurley, Nancy Tyler0 tEthology.g2007 May, v. 113, no. 5 p.511-520dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1439-03107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01350.x3electronic resource 7aarticle02217naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245019900168300001600367520069500383650002401078650001101102650002601113650002201139650001601161650001501177650001301192650002101205650002701226650002001253700002001273700002001293700002301313700001901336700002801355700002101383700002401404700003001428700002501458700002301483773010301506852000901609856008501618930003301703946001101736655001201747IND4426162120221121073251.0090918e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442616212DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-009-1223-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDjabarouti, Sarah 10aMeasurement of Total and Unbound Mycophenolic Acid and Its Glucuronide by LC Coupled with MS.

Spiked pork muscle samples at 5, 20, 50 μg kg⁻¹ were extracted with petroleum spirit-diethyl ether (1:1, v/v). Fat was eliminated by liquid-liquid partition between acetonitrile and petroleum spirit. An immunoaffinity column (IAC) was used for further cleanup. The IAC column was prepared by coupling the polyclonal antibodies to the protein A sepharose gel and the resulting affinity gel columns were sufficiently stable for multiple reuse. Target compounds were adsorbed at pH 7.4 and after extensive washing, eluted with 3 mL methanol. Recoveries of the six pyrethroids were typically >70%. The detection limit was 2 μg kg⁻¹ for λ-cyhalothrin and α-cypermethrin and 5 μg kg⁻¹ for cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, fenpropathrin and tau-fluvalinate. Repeat analyses of pork muscle samples showed good repeatability.

Their perceptions of the care they received were measured at baseline and 6 and 12 months by the Primary Care Assessment Tool (PCAT), the Diabetes-Specific Locus of Control (DLC) survey, and the Trust in Physician Scale (TPS). Results Compared to patients in usual care, group visit patients' PCAT scores were higher in the domains of ongoing care (P = .001), community orientation (P < .0001), and cultural competence (P =.022). In addition, group patients had higher scores for the Powerful-Other Health Professional subscale of the DLC survey (P = .010). Conclusions Patients assigned to group visits had generally more positive perceptions about their care in the areas of ongoing care, community orientation of care, and cultural competence of care than did those in usual care. The perception that one's health professional is powerful, however, has been associated with a reluctance of patients to make medication changes on their own in previous studies. These findings suggest the need for modification in the way that group visits are conducted to empower and activate patients while still delivering continuous, culturally competent, and community-oriented care. 3adrug therapy 3ahealth care workers 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3asurveys 2aAdult 2aAmbulatory Care 2aDelivery of Health Care 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xeconomicsxnursingxtherapy. 2aFemale 2aGroup Processes 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMedically Uninsured 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhysicians, Family 2aSocioeconomic Factors 0aSouth Carolina1 aYeager, Derik Edward1 aHuang, Peng1 aMagruder, Kathryn Marley0 tdiabetes educator.g2007 Mar., v. 33, no. 2 p.309-314dAmerican Association of Diabetes EducatorswJournal:jnl42983x0145-72177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/01457217072992663Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://tde.sagepub.com/archive/3electronic resource 7aarticle03364naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245014200171300001600313500002400329520184700353650001202200650001202212650001002224650002202234650001902256650001602275650001402291650001602305650002502321650001502346650001802361650002302379650000902402650002302411650001502434700001302449700001302462700001702475700001602492700001302508700001902521700001602540700001902556700001502575700001602590700001702606773011002623852000902733856009202742655001202834IND4390401720080301000000.0070416s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439040172DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7348.2007.00116.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasadesús, J.10aUsing vegetation indices derived from conventional digital cameras as selection criteria for wheat breeding in water-limited environments  ap. 227-236.  aIncludes references  aThe ability to assess green biomass is of particular interest in a number of wheat breeding environments. However, the measurement of this and similar traits is either tedious and time-consuming or requires the use of expensive, sophisticated equipment, such as field-based spectroradiometers to measure vegetation indices (VIs). Here, conventional digital cameras are proposed as affordable and easy-to-use tools for gathering field data in wheat breeding programmes. Using appropriate software, a large set of images can be automatically processed to calculate a number of VIs, based on the performance of simple colour operations on each picture. The purpose of this study was to identify a set of picture-derived vegetation indices (picVIs) and to evaluate their performance in durum wheat trials growing under rainfed and supplementary irrigation conditions. Here, zenithal pictures of each plot were obtained roughly 2 weeks after anthesis, and the picVIs that were calculated were compared with the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), an index derived from spectroradiometrical measurements, and with the grain yield (GY) from the same plots. The picVIs that performed best were the Hue, CIE-Lab a* and CIE-Luv u* components of the average colour of each picture, the relative green area (GA) and the 'greener area', similar to GA but excluding the more yellowish-green pixels. Our results showed a high correlation between all these picVIs and the NDVI. Moreover, in rainfed conditions, each picVI provided an estimation of GY similar to or slightly better than that provided by the NDVI. However, in irrigated conditions during anthesis, neither these picVIs nor the NDVI provided a good estimation of GY, apparently because of the saturation of the VI response in conditions of complete soil cover and high plant density. 3abiomass 3acameras 3acolor 3acomputer software 3adigital images 3adurum wheat 3aflowering 3agrain yield 3airrigated conditions 3airrigation 3aplant density 3aselection criteria 3asoil 3aspectroradiometers 3avegetation1 aKaya, Y.1 aBort, J.1 aNachit, M.M.1 aAraus, J.L.1 aAmor, S.1 aFerrazzano, G.1 aMaalouf, F.1 aMaccaferri, M.1 aMartos, V.1 aOuabbou, H.1 aVillegas, D.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2007 Apr., v. 150, no. 2 p.227-236dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2007.00116.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02730naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009400127300001800221500001500239520161600254650001101870650001101881650001001892650002801902650001801930650001901948650003701967650002102004650002602025650003002051650000902081651001702090653001502107700001902122700001902141700001202160773006802172852000902240930003302249945001302282946001302295655001202308IND2334458920221121035353.0031106e200307  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233445892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAngadi, S.V.10aYield adjustment by canola grown at different plant populations under semiarid conditions  ap. 1358-1366.  a2019-12-04  aEstablishing a good canola (rapeseed; Brassica napus L.) stand is difficult in the semiarid prairie region of Canada where low temperature, water stress, and soil crusting could result in poor seed bed conditions. A field study was conducted from 1999 to 2001 at Swift Current, SK, Canada, to determine the effect of a range of uniform (5 to 80 plants m(-2)) and nonuniform (seedlings from 1-m lengths from two adjoining rows were removed and retained alternatively; 10 to 40 plants m(-2)) plant populations on yield and yield components of canola. Canola adjusted seed yield across a wide range of plant populations, although it did not compensate completely for the decreasing populations. Environmental conditions played a significant role in the expression of plasticity of canola. For example, in 2000, with slightly above-normal growing season precipitation, canola maintained similar yield levels across a wide range of populations (20 to 80 plants m(-2)), while in 2001, with well below normal precipitation, seed yield declined as populations dropped below 40 plants m(-2). Reducing plant population by half from 80 to 40 plants m(-2) did not reduce seed yield when the reduced plant population was uniformly distributed, but reduced yield when the population was nonuniformly distributed. The primary response of canola to lower plant population was increased pods per plant through increased branching and increased pod retention at each node. The number of pods formed on primary and secondary branches increased as population decreased. Seeds per pod and seed weight were stable across populations. 3aweight 3acanola 3aseeds 3adry matter accumulation 3aplant density 3asemiarid zones 3agenotype-environment interaction 3ayield components 3afield experimentation 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3apods 3aSaskatchewan 0acrop yield1 aCutforth, H.W.1 aMcConkey, B.G.1 aGan, Y.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 4 p.1358-1366x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03278naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010600125300001800231500001500249520193000264650001402194650001402208650001902222650001602241650001602257650001002273650002102283650001202304650001502316650001302331650001402344650003702358650001502395650002302410650002602433650003602459650001602495650002302511651000902534653001002543653002202553653001502575700001502590700001902605773006802624852000902692930003302701945001302734946001302747655001202760IND2334456420221121035342.0031106e200307  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233445642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeis, S.J.10aSeed source effect on field emergence of soybean lines with reduced phytate and raffinose saccharides  ap. 1336-1339.  a2019-12-04  aSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] lines homozygous for the mips allele (mips lines) have reduced phytate P and raffinose saccharides in the protein meal. Less phytate is desirable for reducing the P content of manure from nonruminant animals and less raffinose saccharides increases the amount of metabolizable energy available to them. Field trials indicated that seedling emergence percentage of mips lines was less for seed produced in a subtropical environment than a temperate environment. The objective of this study was to determine if field emergence of mips lines is influenced by the environment used for seed production. Seed of six mips lines and four commercial cultivars (Mips lines) produced in four temperate and 12 subtropical environments during 2 yr was evaluated for field emergence percentage, seed viability percentage, and germination percentage in warm germination, cold vigor, and accelerated aging tests. The field emergence percentage of mips lines was significantly less than Mips lines for all seed sources. The mips lines had a mean field emergence of 63% for temperate sources and 8% for subtropical sources while Mips lines had a mean field emergence of 77% for temperate sources and 83% for subtropical sources. The mean seed viability percentage for the mips lines based on the tetrazolium test of 88% for temperate sources and 70% for subtropical sources accounted for only part of the differences in field emergence. Differences in field emergence between the mips and Mips lines were not consistently predicted by the warm germination and cold vigor tests for temperate sources. The accelerated aging test effectively differentiated the field emergence potential of the mips and Mips lines for all seed sources. Seed source should be a consideration when evaluating the field emergence of mips lines in a breeding program or for obtaining acceptable plant populations in commercial fields. 3aviability 3acultivars 3aplant breeding 3aGlycine max 3aphytic acid 3aseeds 3aseed germination 3atropics 3asubtropics 3asoybeans 3araffinose 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aprovenance 3aseedling emergence 3afield experimentation 3achemical constituents of plants 3atemperature 3aselection criteria 3aIowa 0alines 0aaccelerated aging 0asenescence1 aFehr, W.R.1 aSchnebly, S.R.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 4 p.1336-1339x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01442naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001400115245005900129300001400188300002800202520071000230650001900940650001200959650001900971650002100990651001801011773006001029852000901089939003301098945000801131946001301139655001201152991620066020742620221121025840.0870501s1983    xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870008332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakuc, D.10aEmployment characteristics of mothers during pregnancy  ap. 25-31.  ap. 25-31. ill., charts.  aData gleaned from the 1980 US National Natality Survey were used to assess the work experience of pregnant women.

The objective of this research was to examine the effects of B fertilization on clipping yield, shoot production, and turf color in a creeping bentgrass {Agrostis palustris Huds. [= A. stolonifera var. palustris (Huds.) Farw.]} putting green. Both greenhouse and field studies were conducted, with B added at rates of 0, 1, 2, and 3 mg kg-1 B in the greenhouse study, and rates of 0, 1.1, 2.2, and 4.4 kg B ha-1 in the field study. Bentgrass in the greenhouse study was grown in a sand and peat mix, while bentgrass in the field study was grown on a native soil (loamy sand) putting green. Studied bentgrass cultivars were Penn A2, Penn G1, Penn G6, SR1020, Dominant, L-93, Crenshaw, and Penncross. In the greenhouse study, dry weight of bentgrass shoots increased as B rate increased. In the field study, in one year of two, B uptake by bentgrass increased as B rate increased. Dry weight of clippings, thatch depth, shoot density, and turf color were unaffected by B fertilization, indicating that B fertilization in the loamy sand soil was not needed. Increases in shoot dry weight observed in the greenhouse study suggest that further study of B fertilization of bentgrass in sand-based greens might be warranted. 3asandy soils 3alawns and turf 3aplant density 3afield experimentation 3aAgrostis stolonifera var. palustris 3ashoots 3anutrient uptake 3adry matter accumulation 3aturf grasses 3achemical concentration 3acultivars 3agreenhouse soils 3aboron 3aboron fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3apeat soils 3acolor 3athatch 3asandy loam soils 3aAlabama 0afertilizer application0 tCrop science.g2004 , v. 44, no. 1 p.204-208x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20040629b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/06/29  aOther US 7aarticle03424naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001700161245010900178300001600287500001500303520200600318650003002324650001702354650001402371650002402385650002402409650000902433650001002442650002002452650001902472650001902491650000802510650002202518650002202540650001702562650001502579650001702594650002002611651001202631653001302643653002602656653002202682700001702704700001502721773006602736852000902802930003302811945002502844946001302869655001202882IND4362542620221121014842.0040517e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436254262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aThomas, J.B.10aComparison of different sources of vector resistance for controlling wheat streak mosaic in winter wheat  ap. 125-130.  a2019-12-04  aWheat streak mosaic (WSM) is a serious viral disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that is vectored by the wheat curl mite (Aceria tosichella Keifer). Deployment of wheat cultivars with vector resistance is a possible method for WSM control. This 3-yr (1996-1997/1998-1999) field study compared by means of a split-plot design the effect of different sources of mite-resistance backcrossed into a common winter wheat genetic background on both the spread of WSM and on the resulting yield losses. The various lines were first seeded early (in July) in blocks of spaced plots to provide different disease source or spreader treatments as main plots. The same winter wheat lines were then seeded in mid-September into the spaces between the spreaders as subplot treatments to mimic the crop. Main-plot (spreader) treatments included the mite-susceptible winter wheat cultivars CDC Kestrel or Norstar, two mite-resistant backcross lines of Norstar with resistance from Thinopyrum ponticum (Podpera) Liu & Wang (Nst*5/Cmc2) and Triticum tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. (Nst*5/Cmc1) plus oat (Avena sativa L.) as a nonhost. The two mite-resistant winter wheat lines, plus another mite-resistant backcross line with resistance from rye (Secale cereale L.) (Nst*5/1RS-1BL) and Norstar were also used as subplot treatments. The presence of vector resistance in the spreader treatments reduced the intensity of disease symptoms in the spreader rows themselves and increased their grain yield. In 2 of 3 yr, these yield differences were dramatic. Resistance in the spreader also reduced the secondary spread of WSM into the adjacent winter wheat subplots with conventional planting dates. During severe outbreaks of WSM, (1996-1997 and 1997-1998), Nst*5/Cmc2 was more effective with a lower frequency of severely infected plants and smaller yield losses than Nst*5/Cmc1 or Nst*5/1RS-1BL. In conclusion, control of WSM through vector resistance requires an effective resistance gene in both the spreader and the crop. 3aWheat streak mosaic virus 3abackcrossing 3acultivars 3aThinopyrum ponticum 3atranslocation lines 3aoats 3amites 3adisease control 3ainsect vectors 3aSecale cereale 3arye 3aTriticum aestivum 3aAceria tosichella 3aAvena sativa 3acrop yield 3awinter wheat 3apest resistance 3aAlberta 0asymptoms 0abiological resistance 0aTriticum tauschii1 aConner, R.L.1 aGraf, R.J.0 tCrop science.g2004 , v. 44, no. 1 p.125-130x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20111207b20120106c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/06/28  aOther US 7aarticle03694naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002100161245012600182300001600308500001500324520184700339650002202186650002002208650002002228650001102248650001502259650001302274650001002287650002102297650001002318650001402328650001102342650001302353650001602366650001902382650001102401650002402412650002602436650001402462650001602476650002002492650002802512650001802540650003802558650002202596650002102618650002002639650001602659650002102675651001202696653002802708653001902736653001502755653002102770653001802791700002302809700001802832773006602850852000902916930003302925945002502958946001302983655001202996IND4362542820221121014820.0040517e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436254282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Heynh. phytochrome B (phyB) have been reported to exhibit a substantially modified plant architecture, increased photosynthetic performance, reduced photoinhibition, delayed leaf senescence, and increased tuber yield. A greenhouse and a growth chamber experiment were conducted at Braunschweig, Germany, to elucidate the crop physiological basis for the yield differences between moderately phyB-overexpressing transgenic (Dara-5) and wild-type potato plants. In the greenhouse experiment, Dara-5 leaves showed a 23% greater leaf carbon exchange rate (CER) at light saturation, 32% greater leaf conductance, and 21% longer green leaf area duration (GLAD) than the wild-type plants. The transgenic plants partitioned a considerably greater portion of their biomass to stems and roots, but tuber and total biomass yield did not significantly differ among genotypes. The leaves and stems of the transgenic plants had lower starch and soluble sugar concentrations but consistently higher N concentration than those of the nontransgenic plants. Light response curves showed increasing CER superiority of Dara-5 leaves with increasing photosynthetic photon flux (PPF), suggesting higher productivity of the transgenic plants in high-radiation environments. Therefore, the two genotypes were compared in growth chambers at low, medium, and high light levels of 300, 600, and 900 micromol m-2 s-1 PPF. Leaf CER of the transgenic plants reached 123, 115, and 120% of the wild-type plants at low, medium, and high PPF, but only at low PPF did the transgenic plants produce significantly greater (+8%) tuber yield than the nontransgenic plants. It is supposed that enhanced C loss from respiration is responsible for the lack of consistent transgenic yield superiority. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aphotoinhibition 3alight intensity 3atubers 3acrop yield 3apotatoes 3aroots 3anitrogen content 3astems 3aphenology 3astarch 3agenotype 3aphytochrome 3awild relatives 3aleaves 3agene overexpression 3anet assimilation rate 3aleaf area 3aphotoperiod 3aenzyme activity 3adry matter partitioning 3asugar content 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atransgenic plants 3aagronomic traits 3aprotein content 3achlorophyll 3aleaf conductance 3aGermany 0acarbohydrate metabolism 0aphotosynthesis 0asenescence 0aplant physiology 0aplant anatomy1 aMenge-Hartmann, U.1 aOldenburg, E.0 tCrop science.g2004 , v. 44, no. 1 p.131-143x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20040628b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/06/28  aOther US 7aarticle02918naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245013800177300001400315500001500329520168400344650001802028650002202046650002702068650001402095650001702109650003102126650001302157650001202170650001502182650002702197653002502224653004302249700001902292700002902311773006402340852000902404930003302413945002502446946001302471655001202484IND4362541320221121014921.0040517e200401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436254132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVelasco, L.10aUse of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy for selecting for high stearic acid concentration in single husked achenes of sunflower  ap. 93-97.  a2019-12-04  aHalf-seed analysis by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) allows a nondestructive evaluation of the fatty acid composition of oilseeds, since in most cases the analyzed portion is representative of the whole seed. However, the sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) mutant CAS-14 exhibits a high stearic acid concentration nonuniformly expressed along the longitudinal axis of the seed. No analytical technique is available for nondestructive selection at the single seed level in this mutant. The objective of the present research was to study the potential of near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) for analyzing the fatty acid composition of single husked achenes of sunflower and to evaluate its performance in a selection program for high stearic concentration in materials derived from CAS-14. A calibration set containing 2510 single husked achenes from a broad spectrum of breeding materials was developed. Reliable equations were developed for stearic acid, with r2 = 0.80 and ratio of the standard error of cross validation (SECV) to the standard deviation (SD) of 0.45, oleic acid (r2 = 0.89, SECV/SD = 0.34), and linoleic acid (r2 = 0.91, SECV/SD = 0.30). The calibration equations were applied to the analysis of 8109 husked achenes within a selection program for high stearic acid concentration, 503 of them being further analyzed by GLC to monitor the performance of NIRS. The results revealed a close relationship between NIRS and GLC data, with r2 of 0.83 for stearic acid, 0.92 for oleic acid, and 0.93 for linoleic acid concentration. It was concluded that NIRS can be used reliably for nondestructive selection for these major fatty acids at a single-seed level. 3alinoleic acid 3aHelianthus annuus 3afatty acid composition 3aequations 3astearic acid 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aoilseeds 3amutants 3aoleic acid 3anondestructive methods 0achemical composition 0anear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy1 aPerez-Vich, B.1 aFernandez-Martinez, J.M.0 tCrop science.g2004 , v. 44, no. 1 p.93-97x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20040628b00000000c00000000  aINDdGAYe2004/06/28  aOther US 7aarticle02886naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245007000160300001800230520152400248650002601772650001701798650001301815650002601828650002101854650001101875650001101886650001401897650002701911650002001938650001001958650001801968650001701986651001302003651001102016651000902027653001802036653001702054653001902071700001902090700001802109700001902127700001402146700001802160700001802178773006802196852000902264930003302273945002502306946001302331655001202344IND4364282520221121004443.0040907e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436428252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aFrank, K.W.10aNitrogen rate and mowing height effects on turf-type buffalograss  ap. 1615-1621.  aBuffalograss [Buchloe dactyloides (Nutt.) Engelm.] is a turfgrass species with reduced irrigation and fertilization requirements, relative to traditional turfgrasses. Interest in reducing the amount of chemicals and water applied to turfgrass has resulted in increased efforts to improve buffalograss as a turfgrass. As interest in using the new turf-type buffalograss cultivars has increased, the need for nitrogen rate and mowing height recommendations supported by research have become necessary. 'Cody', 'Texoka', '378', and 'NE 91-118' buffalograss cultivars were planted at sites located in Nebraska, Kansas, and Utah to determine nitrogen rate and mowing height effects on buffalograss quality, color, density, and clipping yield. There were significant cultivar x nitrogen rate interactions at all sites for quality, color, and density. Regardless of cultivar, nitrogen rate x year interactions at all sites revealed that the 98 kg N ha(-1) rate sustained quality, color, and density over the 3-yr evaluation period, while lower nitrogen rates had decreased quality, color, and density. The 195 kg N ha(-1) rate improved quality over the 3-yr period but also had the highest clipping yields. Regardless of the cultivar selected, the data support the general mowing height recommendation for turf-type buffalograss of 5.0 to 7.5 cm. For golf course fairways maintained at a mowing height of 2.5 cm, the vegetatively established cultivars (NE 91-118 and 378) are the best choice to achieve high turfgrass quality. 3aBouteloua dactyloides 3aturf grasses 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aapplication rate 3amowing 3aheight 3acultivars 3afertilizer application 3aturf management 3acolor 3aplant density 3agolf courses 3aNebraska 3aKansas 3aUtah 0amowing height 0aturf quality 0aclipping yield1 aGaussoin, R.E.1 aRiordan, T.P.1 aShearman, R.C.1 aFry, J.D.1 aMiltner, E.D.1 aJohnson, P.G.0 tCrop science.g2004 , v. 44, no. 5 p.1615-1621x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20050716b20050802c00000000  aINDd2CTe2005/01/07  aOther US 7aarticle03608naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002400156245010700180300001600287500002400303520175900327650001902086650001702105650002002122650001202142650001202154650001202166650002202178650002302200650002102223650004302244650001302287650001402300650001402314650001002328650002602338650006002364650006002424650005102484650001102535650002402546650001402570651001002584700002202594700002102616700002102637700002202658700002102680700001902701700002202720700002402742700002102766700001902787773010202806852000902908856007702917655001202994IND4390053920221120221257.0070402s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439005392DNAL7 a173925532pmid7 a10.2337/dc06-16962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuzzetti, Raffaella10aHigh Titer of Autoantibodies to GAD Identifies a Specific Phenotype of Adult-Onset Autoimmune Diabetes  ap. 932-938.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--The aim of the present study was to define heterogeneity of adult-onset autoimmune diabetes based on characterization of GAD antibodies (GADAs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Patients enrolled in a nationwide survey, the Non Insulin Requiring Autoimmune Diabetes (NIRAD) Study, have been screened for GADAs and IA-2 antibodies (IA-2As) and further characterized for GADA titer, antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and HLA DRB1-DQB1 polymorphisms. RESULTS:--Of 4,250 consecutive type 2 diabetic patients, 4.5% had either GADAs and/or IA-2As. Patients with autoimmune diabetes showed a clinical phenotype significantly different from that of type 2 diabetes, including higher fasting glucose and A1C, lower BMI and uric acid, lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components, and higher frequency of TPO antibodies. More interestingly, analysis of GADA titers showed a bimodal distribution that identified two subgroups of patients with high (>32 GADA arbitrary units) and low (<=32 GADA arbitrary units) GADA titers. Compared with those with low GADA titers, patients with high GADA titers had more prominent traits of insulin deficiency and a profile of more severe autoimmunity resulting in higher A1C, lower BMI, a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components (P < 0.02 for all), a higher prevalence of IA-2As, TPO antibodies (P < 0.003 for both), and DRB1*03-DQB1*0201 (50 vs. 26.8%, P = 0.001), and a decreasing frequency of DQB1*0602 and DRB1*0403 (from type 2 to low and to high GADA titer autoimmune diabetes; P < 0.001 for trend for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS:--GADA titers identify two subgroups of patients with adult-onset autoimmune diabetes having distinct clinical, autoimmune, and genetic features. 3aautoantibodies 3aautoimmunity 3abody mass index 3afasting 3aglucose 3ainsulin 3aiodide peroxidase 3ametabolic syndrome 3anational surveys 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aphenotype 3auric acid 2aAdult 2aAutoantibodiesxblood 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xbloodxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGlutamate Decarboxylasexgeneticsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aInsulinxdeficiency 2aPhenotype 0aItaly1 aDi Pietro, Sergio1 aGiaccari, Andrea1 aPetrone, Antonio1 aLocatelli, Mattia1 aSuraci, Concetta1 aCapizzi, Marco1 aArpi, Maria Luisa1 aBazzigaluppi, Elena1 aDotta, Francesco1 aBosi, Emanuele0 tDiabetes care.g2007 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.932-938dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-16963Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03662naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002700156245012400183300001600307500002400323520189300347650002302240650001802263650001202281650001302293650001302306650001202319650001202331650001202343650001602355650001702371650002302388650001802411650001302429650001402442650000902456650002302465650004502488650002002533650001602553650003502569650002402604650001102628650001102639650004002650650002402690650002402714650000902738650002102747650002802768700002102796700001902817700002402836773010202860852000902962856007702971655001203048IND4390054620221120213213.0070402s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439005462DNAL7 a172770402pmid7 a10.2337/dc06-19942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPittas, Anastassios G.14aThe Effects of Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation on Blood Glucose and Markers of Inflammation in Nondiabetic Adults  ap. 980-986.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--We sought to compare the effects of combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation versus placebo on blood glucose and markers of inflammation in nondiabetic adults aged >=65 years. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--A total of 314 Caucasian adults without diabetes received either 500 mg calcium citrate and 700 IU vitamin D₃ or placebos daily for 3 years in a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial designed for bone-related outcomes. In a post hoc analysis, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin sensitivity (estimated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), plasma C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6, were measured at baseline and 3 years. RESULTS:--The effects of combined calcium-vitamin D supplementation on 3-year change in FPG depended on baseline FPG (P = 0.02 for interaction). Therefore, we conducted analyses separately in participants with normal fasting glucose (NFG) (FPG <5.6 mmol/l, n = 222) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (FPG 5.6-6.9 mmol/l, n = 92) at baseline. Among participants with IFG at baseline, those who took combined calcium-vitamin D supplements had a lower rise in FPG at 3 years compared with those on placebo (0.02 mmol/l [0.4 mg/dl] vs. 0.34 mmol/l [6.1 mg/dl], respectively, P = 0.042) and a lower increase in HOMA-IR (0.05 vs. 0.91, P = 0.031). In the NFG subgroup, there was no difference in the change in FPG or HOMA-IR between the two treatment arms. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 between the two treatment arms in either subgroup. CONCLUSIONS:--In healthy, older adults with IFG, supplementation with calcium and vitamin D may attenuate increases in glycemia and insulin resistance that occur over time. However, our findings should be considered hypothesis generating and need to be confirmed in randomized trials specifically designed for the outcomes of interest. 3aC-reactive protein 3ablood glucose 3acalcium 3acitrates 3adiabetes 3aelderly 3afasting 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3ainterleukin-6 3aplacebos 3avitamin D 2aAged 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weight 2aCalcium, Dietaryxpharmacology 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHyperglycemiaxprevention & control 2aInflammationxblood 2aInsulinxphysiology 2aMale 2aReference Values 2aVitamin Dxpharmacology1 aHarris, Susan S.1 aStark, Paul C.1 aDawson-Hughes, Bess0 tDiabetes care.g2007 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.980-986dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-19943Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03292naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002100155245013100176300001800307500002400325520109900349650001401448650001501462650001601477650001901493650001401512650001501526650001601541650001201557650002401569650001801593650001201611650000901623650001301632650001201645650001401657650001201671650002401683650003301707650004001740650003301780650002801813650001101841650001601852650003001868650002501898650002401923650002601947650000901973650000901982650002401991650003702015650003702052650003202089650003302121650001202154650000902166650002502175650002602200650002602226650003702252650002802289700001802317700001802335700002702353773010602380852000902486856003902495655001202534IND4439535320221120213108.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443953532DNAL7 a199604252pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.30672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, Arif-ullah10aAntispasmodic, bronchodilator and blood pressure lowering properties of Hypericum oblongifolium - possible mechanism of action  ap. 1027-1032.  aIncludes references  aThe crude extract of Hypericum oblongifolium (Ho.Cr), which tested positive for flavonoids, saponins and tannins caused concentration-dependent (0.1-1.0 mg/mL) relaxation of spontaneous and high K⁺ (80 mM)-induced contractions in isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suggesting a Ca⁺⁺ antagonistic effect, which was confirmed when pretreatment of the tissue with Ho.Cr produced a rightward shift in the Ca⁺⁺ concentration-response curves, like that caused by verapamil. Ho.Cr relaxed carbachol (1 μM) and high K⁺-induced contractions in guinea pig tracheal preparations. It caused a dose-dependent (3-100 mg/kg) fall in arterial blood pressure of rats under anesthesia. In isolated guinea pig atria, Ho.Cr caused inhibition of both atrial force and rate of spontaneous contractions. When tested in rabbit aortic rings, Ho.Cr exhibited a vasodilator effect against phenylephrine (1 μM) and high K⁺-induced contractions.

However, few data are available concerning the long-term prognostic value of elevated fasting glucose during the acute phase of infarction. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We prospectively studied the relationship between fasting glucose and long-term mortality in patients with AMI. Fasting glucose was determined after an >=8 h fast within 24 h of admission. The median duration of follow-up was 24 months (range 6-48). All multivariable Cox models were adjusted for the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score. RESULTS:--In nondiabetic patients (n = 1,101), compared with patients with normal fasting glucose (<100 mg/dl), the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality progressively increased with higher tertiles of elevated fasting glucose (first tertile 1.5 [95% CI 0.8-2.9], P = 0.19; second tertile 3.2 [1.9-5.5], P < 0.0001; third tertile 5.7 [3.5-9.3], P < 0.0001). The c statistic of the model containing the GRACE risk score increased when fasting glucose data were added (0.8 ± 0.02-0.85 ± 0.02, P = 0.004). Fasting glucose remained an independent predictor of mortality after further adjustment for ejection fraction. Elevated fasting glucose did not predict mortality in patients with diabetes (n = 462). CONCLUSIONS:--Fasting glucose is a simple robust tool for predicting long-term mortality in nondiabetic patients with AMI. Fasting glucose provides incremental prognostic information when added to the GRACE risk score and left ventricular ejection fraction. Fasting glucose is not a useful prognostic marker in patients with diabetes. 3ablood glucose 3adiabetes 3afasting 3aglucose 3ainfarction 3amodels 3amortality 3amyocardial infarction 3apatients 3aprediction 3aprognosis 3arisk 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxbloodxmortality. 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMyocardial Infarctionxbloodxmortality. 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aProspective Studies 2aRetrospective Studies 2aSurvival Analysis 2aSystole 2aTime Factors 2aVentricular Dysfunction, Leftxblood 2aVentricular Function, Left 0aIsrael1 aHammerman, Haim1 aKapeliovich, Michael R.1 aSuleiman, Abeer1 aAgmon, Yoram1 aBeyar, Rafael1 aMarkiewicz, Walter1 aSuleiman, Mahmoud0 tDiabetes care.g2007 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.960-966dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-17353Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01703naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245007600168300001800244500002400262520088900286650001701175650001301192650001601205650001401221700002201235773010801257852000901365856005101374655001201425IND4411174420221120202002.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441117442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2008.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartig, Florian14aThe time horizon and its role in multiple species conservation planning  ap. 2625-2631.  aIncludes references  aSurvival probability within a certain time horizon T is a common measure of population viability. The choice of T implicitly involves a time preference, similar to economic discounting: conservation success is evaluated at the time horizon T, while all effects that occur later than T are not considered. Despite the obvious relevance of the time horizon, ecological studies seldom analyze its impact on the evaluation of conservation options. In this paper, we show that, while the choice of T does not change the ranking of conservation options for single species under stationary conditions, it may substantially change conservation decisions for multiple species. We conclude that it is of crucial importance to investigate the sensitivity of model results to the choice of the time horizon or other measures of time preference when prioritizing biodiversity conservation efforts. 3abiodiversity 3aplanning 3aprobability 3aviability1 aDrechsler, Martin0 tBiological conservation.g2008 Oct., v. 141, no. 10 p.2625-2631dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2008.07.028 7aarticle03652naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001800183245017000201300001600371500002400387506007600411520133000487506003701817650002501854650001001879650003001889650000901919650002201928650001201950650001401962650001701976650001001993650002102003650002002024650004902044650004802093650002502141650003702166650005302203650001302256650002802269650002202297650005502319650002602374650003902400650004402439650003702483650005602520700001902576700002402595700002202619700002002641700002002661700002102681700002302702700002602725773010602751852000902857856008202866856003002948655001202978IND4390062220221207102207.0070402e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439006222DNAL7 a172935682pmid7 aPMC18673212pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.106.0459972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuji, Kentaro10aArabidopsis Vacuolar Sorting Mutants (green fluorescent seed) Can Be Identified Efficiently by Secretion of Vacuole-Targeted Green Fluorescent Protein in Their Seeds  ap. 597-609.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTwo Arabidopsis thaliana genes have been shown to function in vacuolar sorting of seed storage proteins: a vacuolar sorting receptor, VSR1/ATELP1, and a retromer component, MAIGO1 (MAG1)/VPS29. Here, we show an efficient and simple method for isolating vacuolar sorting mutants of ARABIDOPSIS: The method was based on two findings in this study. First, VSR1 functioned as a sorting receptor for β-conglycinin by recognizing the vacuolar targeting signal. Second, when green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion with the signal (GFP-CT24) was expressed in vsr1, mag1/vps29, and wild-type seeds, both vsr1and mag1/vps29 gave strongly fluorescent seeds but the wild type did not, suggesting that a defect in vacuolar sorting provided fluorescent seeds by the secretion of GFP-CT24 out of the cells. We mutagenized transformant seeds expressing GFP-CT24. From ~3,000,000 lines of M2 seeds, we obtained >100 fluorescent seeds and designated them green fluorescent seed (gfs) mutants. We report 10 gfs mutants, all of which caused missorting of storage proteins. We mapped gfs1 to VSR1, gfs2 to KAM2/GRV2, gfs10 to the At4g35870 gene encoding a novel membrane protein, and the others to different loci. This method should provide valuable insights into the complex molecular mechanisms underlying vacuolar sorting of storage proteins.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aloci 3amembrane proteins 3amutants 3asecretion 3aseed storage 3aseeds 3astorage proteins 2aAntigens, Plant 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aGlobulinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxsecretion. 2aMutation 2aProtein Sorting Signals 2aProtein Transport 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeed Storage Proteins 2aSeedsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSoybean Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aVacuolesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aVesicular Transport Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aShimada, Tomoo1 aTakahashi, Hideyuki1 aTamura, Kentarō.1 aKoumoto, Yasuko1 aUtsumi, Shigeru1 aNishizawa, Keito1 aMaruyama, Nobuyuki1 aHara-Nishimura, Ikuko0 tplant cell.g2007 Feb., v. 19, no. 2 p.597-609dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.0459973Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantcell.org/ 7aarticle03932naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245014900177300001600326500002400342500001500366520177000381650002302151650000802174650002802182650001502210650001002225650002202235650001702257650002302274650002402297650001802321650001702339650001202356650004302368650001202411650001702423650001402440650001502454650001002469650000902479650002302488650003502511650002502546650001902571650005202590650001102642650001102653650001402664650003902678650002502717650000902742650001602751650003202767650001702799650002402816651002702840653000902867700001802876700001702894700002302911700002102934700002102955700002202976773010202998852000903100856007703109655001203186IND4390052620221120182323.0070402s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439005262DNAL7 a173925462pmid7 a10.2337/dc06-16932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorand, Barbara10aSex Differences in the Prediction of Type 2 Diabetes by Inflammatory Markers: Results from the MONICA/KORA Augsburg case-cohort study, 1984-2002  ap. 854-860.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aOBJECTIVE:--Although sex differences have been reported for associations between obesity and inflammation, the question of whether there is an effect modification by sex in the association between inflammation and type 2 diabetes has not been investigated in detail. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare associations of markers of inflammation with type 2 diabetes risk between men and women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Following a case-cohort design, cases of incident type 2 diabetes were identified from 7,936 subjects aged 35-74 years at baseline who participated in the population-based Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease (MONICA)/Cooperative Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) studies conducted between 1984 and 2002. Concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 were measured in 527 cases of incident type 2 diabetes (305 men and 222 women) and 1,698 noncases (889 men and 809 women). RESULTS:--After adjustment for age and survey and lifestyle factors including smoking, alcohol intake, and physical activity, elevated concentrations of CRP showed a considerably stronger association with risk of type 2 diabetes in women (hazard ratio comparing tertile extremes 7.60 [95% CI 4.43-13.04]) than in men (1.84 [1.27-2.67]). The P value for the sex interaction was <0.001. Further adjustment for metabolic risk factors considerably attenuated these associations, and they became nonsignificant in men but remained significant in women. IL-6 was also more strongly associated with type 2 diabetes in women, but there was no significant sex interaction. CONCLUSIONS:--Our data suggest that inflammatory processes may be of particular importance in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes in women. 3aC-reactive protein 3amen 3acardiovascular diseases 3amonitoring 3awomen 3aphysical activity 3ainflammation 3agender differences 3aalcoholic beverages 3ainterleukin-6 3arisk factors 3asurveys 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 3apathogenesis 3alifestyle 3aprediction 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxepidemiology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aInflammationxbloodxepidemiology. 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Characteristics 0aGermanyxepidemiology. 0arisk1 aBaumert, Jens1 aKolb, Hubert1 aMeisinger, Christa1 aChambless, Lloyd1 aKoenig, Wolfgang1 aHerder, Christian0 tDiabetes care.g2007 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.854-860dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-16933Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04044naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011100182300001600293520156200309650002201871650002401893650003801917650002201955650003001977650003502007650002702042650001002069650001202079650001302091650001102104650001102115650000902126650001702135650001602152650001502168650000902183650001002192650002502202650001002227650001402237650001402251650002402265650001202289650001102301650001202312650000902324650001202333650002202345650002702367650002902394650002302423650002702446650002202473650002702495650001302522650002202535650004102557650002402598650002102622650005402643651001102697653001902708653001602727653001202743700002102755700002102776700002302797700002102820700002002841700002602861700001902887773013402906852000903040856008503049930003303134946001103167655001203178IND4426206220221120142128.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442620622DNAL7 a188435462pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0540-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUysal, Kazim 14aThe comparison of heavy metal accumulation ratios of some fish species in Enne Dame Lake (Kütahya/Turkey)  ap. 355-362.  aThe metal accumulation levels for muscle, skin, gill, liver and intestine tissues of some Cyprinidae species (Carassius carassius, Condrostoma nasus, Leuciscus cephalus and Alburnus alburnus) in Enne Dame Lake (Kütahya/Turkey), which is mostly fed by hot spring waters, were investigated. Analyses were performed for copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), magnesium (Mg), nickel (Ni), chrome (Cr) and boron (B) using inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), and cadmium (Cd) using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) utilizing microwave digestion techniques. The concentrations of the heavy metals found in the fish varied in the follow ing ranges: Cu: < DL-7.04, Zn: 6.96-357.25, Mn: < DL-20.70, Ni: < DL-6.21, Fe: 9.62-2500.33, Cr: < DL-1.74, Co: < DL-0.54, Cd: 0.01-0.27 and Mg: 197.44-904.90 mg/kg wet weight. While B had the second highest concentration in the water of the lake, it was not encountered in any tissue of the investigated species. In all tissues and the species, While the bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of Mn, Zn, Fe and Cu were remarkably high, the BAFs of Mg, Cr, Co, and B were also fairly low or none. Although the heavy metal accumulation levels for the muscle were generally lower than other tissues, there were some exceptions. Cd level in the muscle of C. carassius was higher than the permissible limit stated by Turkish legislation, FAO and WHO. The mean metal amounts for all the investigated tissues and species are statistically compared and discussed in this study. 3aAlburnus alburnus 3aCarassius carassius 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aSqualius cephalus 3aWorld Health Organization 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3abioaccumulation factor 3aboron 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3acopper 3afish 3aheavy metals 3ahot springs 3aintestines 3airon 3alakes 3alaws and regulations 3aliver 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amicrowave treatment 3amuscles 3anickel 3atissues 3azinc 2aAnimals 2aCarpsxmetabolism 2aCyprinidaexmetabolism 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFood Contamination 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aGillsxmetabolism 2aIntestinesxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aSkinxmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism. 0aTurkey 0aEnne Dame Lake 0aHeavy metal 0aICP-OES1 aKöse, Esengül 1 aBülbül, Metin 1 aDönmez, Muhammet 1 aErdoğan, Yunus 1 aKoyun, Mustafa 1 aÖmeroğlu, Çiğdem 1 aÖzmal, Ferda 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2009 Oct., v. 157, no. 1-4 p.355-362dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0540-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03241naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245017400184300001600358520125600374650003001630650001901660650001601679650003001695650001701725650001701742650002201759650002201781650001501803650001301818650001901831650002101850650001301871650001801884650002901902650004601931650002701977650003402004650003102038650002802069650002302097650004102120650005902161651001302220651001302233653002502246653002902271653005802300700002102358773013402379852000902513856008502522930003302607946001102640655001202651IND4426206120221120142033.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442620612DNAL7 a188502922pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0539-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKausar, Rubina 10aDetermination of toxic inorganic elements pollution in ground waters of Kahuta Industrial Triangle Islamabad, Pakistan using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry  ap. 347-354.  aThe present study deals with the ground water quality assessment in Kahuta Industrial Triangle Islamabad, Pakistan. The objective of the study was to assess ground water quality against the drinking water standards for various toxic inorganic elements. Representative groundwater samples were collected and analyzed in the Water Quality Laboratory of Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) at Islamabad, Pakistan. The samples were run on ICP-MS (Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), which has the capability to separate and quantify 70 elements at a time. One of the finding of study is that ICP-MS is a very good tool to analyze broad range of toxic inorganic elements to the level of parts per billion (ppb). World Health Organization drinking water standards shows that these toxic inorganic elements such as heavy metals even at this concentration level (ppb) are injurious to human health. This analysis indicated pollution of various toxic elements including Selenium. Vertical leachate through industrial waste septic tanks is identified as major cause of groundwater pollution in the Industrial Triangle. Monitoring of the septic tanks and groundwater quality in study area is suggested along with remedial measures. 3aWorld Health Organization 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3aindustrial wastes 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aselenium 3aseptic systems 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 3awater quality 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediation 2aFresh Waterxchemistry 2aInorganic Chemicalsxanalysis 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMetals, Heavyxanalysis 2aSeleniumxanalysis 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 3aPakistan 0aPakistan 0aGround water quality 0aInorganic toxic elements 0aICP-MS (Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry)1 aAhmad, Zulfiqar 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2009 Oct., v. 157, no. 1-4 p.347-354dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0539-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090918b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02722naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245020100170300001600371520115200387650003001539650001701569650002701586650002101613650002101634650001901655650001301674650001401687650001501701650002301716650001101739650001301750650001101763650002001774650001801794650001101812651001001823653003301833653001001866653001601876653000801892653000801900653000701908700001701915773013401932852000902066856008502075930003302160946001102193655001202204IND4426205020221120131438.0090918e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442620502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0530-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, A.

Sequences of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit of the rRNA gene showed that the yeast belongs to the Scheffersomyces clade and that it is related to Candida lignicola and Candida coipomoensis. The new species was isolated from rotting wood of three different localities and a wood-boring insect suggesting that these substrates are its ecological niche. This new yeast species is able to assimilate cellobiose and other compounds related to rotting wood. Strong fermentation of cellobiose in Durham tubes was observed for the strains of this new yeast. The new species produced an intracellular β-glucosidase responsible for cellobiose hydrolysis. The novel species, Candida queiroziae sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these isolates. The type strain of C. queiroziae is UFMG-CLM 5.1T (=CBS 11853T = NRRL Y-48722T). 3aCandida 3aScheffersomyces 3acellobiose 3afermentation 3aforest ecosystems 3agenes 3ahydrolysis 3ainsects 3anew species 3aniches 3arain forests 3aribosomal RNA 3awood 3ayeasts 2aCandidaxenzymologyxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCellobiosexmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTrees 2abeta-Glucosidasexmetabolism 3aBrazil 0aNew yeast species 0aCandida queiroziae 0aCellobiose-fermenting yeast 0aRotting wood 0aAtlantic Rain Forest1 aCadete, Raquel M.1 aBadotti, Fernanda1 aMouro, Adriane1 aWallheim, Daniela O.1 aGomes, Fátima C.

Digital image analysis may be an improved, objective method to quantify turf color. Studies were conducted to determine if digital image analysis with SigmaScan software (SPSS, Chicago, IL) was capable of: (i) accurately determining the hue, saturation, and brightness (HSB) levels of Munsell Plant Tissue color chips, (ii) quantifying visual color differences among zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) and creeping bentgrass [Agrostis palustris Huds. [= A. stolonifera var. palustris (Huds.) Farw.]] plots receiving various N treatments, and (iii) quantifying genetic color differences among bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) cultivars. Digital images of turf plots were analyzed with SigmaScan software to determine average HSB levels for each image. A dark green color index (DGCI) was created from HSB values for direct comparison with visual ratings. Digital image analysis accurately quantified the HSB levels (r2 = 0.99, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively) of Munsell color chips corresponding to turf colors. Significant HSB differences were present among N treatments in creeping bentgrass, while only significant hue differences existed in zoysiagrass. Significant hue and saturation differences were present among bermudagrass cultivars. There was strong agreement between DGCI values and visual ratings. The relative variances of the HSB and DGCI were significantly less than the variance associated with multiple raters. This evaluation technique may facilitate objective comparisons of turf color across researchers, locations, and years when images are collected under equal lighting conditions (i.e., the use of an artificial light source at night or in an enclosed system). 3aZoysia japonica 3aAgrostis stolonifera var. palustris 3aCynodon 3aturf grasses 3acolor 3adigital images 3aimage analysis 3acultivars 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer application 3aapplication rate 3asoil fertility 3anutrient availability 3acameras 3acomputer analysis 0adigital cameras1 aRichardson, M.D.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 3 p.943-951x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03069naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009500162300001600257500002400273500001500297520190500312650001902217650001802236650001902254650002002273650002102293650000902314650002502323650001202348651001002360653001602370653001602386653002302402700001502425700001902440700001202459773009302471852000902564856008602573655001202659IND4391030920221120074544.0070506s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439103092DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-006-0197-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajeevan, M.10aNew statistical models for long-range forecasting of southwest monsoon rainfall over India  ap. 813-828.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been issuing long-range forecasts (LRF) based on statistical methods for the southwest monsoon rainfall over India (ISMR) for more than 100 years. Many statistical and dynamical models including the operational models of IMD failed to predict the recent deficient monsoon years of 2002 and 2004. In this paper, we report the improved results of new experimental statistical models developed for LRF of southwest monsoon seasonal (June-September) rainfall. These models were developed to facilitate the IMD's present two-stage operational forecast strategy. Models based on the ensemble multiple linear regression (EMR) and projection pursuit regression (PPR) techniques were developed to forecast the ISMR. These models used new methods of predictor selection and model development. After carrying out a detailed analysis of various global climate data sets; two predictor sets, each consisting of six predictors were selected. Our model performance was evaluated for the period from 1981 to 2004 by sliding the model training period with a window length of 23 years. The new models showed better performance in their hindcast, compared to the model based on climatology. The Heidke scores for the three category forecasts during the verification period by the first stage models based on EMR and PPR methods were 0.5 and 0.44, respectively, and those of June models were 0.63 and 0.38, respectively. Root mean square error of these models during the verification period (1981-2004) varied between 4.56 and 6.75% from long period average (LPA) as against 10.0% from the LPA of the model based on climatology alone. These models were able to provide correct forecasts of the recent two deficient monsoon rainfall events (2002 and 2004). The experimental forecasts for the 2005 southwest monsoon season based on these models were also found to be accurate. 3adynamic models 3alinear models 3amonsoon season 3adata collection 3amodel validation 3arain 3astatistical analysis 3aclimate 3aIndia 0amethodology 0anew methods 0astatistical models1 aPai, D.

This ultimately results in a loss of fixed N to the atmosphere. It is often assumed that this volatilization loss of N with frequent fire will result in a reduction of plant-available N and total system N. By changing the amount of woody biomass fire may, however, also have indirect effects on N and C dynamics. Here we consider the effects of 50 years of frequent fire on total soil N and soil organic C (SOC) and total soil N in a mesic savanna in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. We also determine how changes in woody biomass may affect total soil N and SOC. We measured soil and fine root N and C concentrations as well as total soil N and SOC pools in four burning treatments, including fire exclusion, of a long-term fire experiment. Our results show that regardless of soil depth, fire treatment had no significant effect on total soil N and SOC. Our results also show that under trees total soil N and SOC concentrations of the surface soil increase, and pools of N and SOC increase to a depth of 7 cm. However, the extent to which soil N and C dynamics differed under canopies and away from canopies was dependent on fire treatment. Our results show that the effect of fire on soil N and C is mediated both through the indirect effect of changes in woody cover and the direct effects of fire (volatilization losses of nutrients). We suggest that woody thickening in this mesic savanna will have pronounced effects on long-term N and C dynamics. 3anational parks 3along term experiments 3anitrogen content 3asoil organic carbon 3anitrogen 3along term effects 3avolatilization 3afires 3asoil depth 3abiofuels 3asavannas 3abiomass 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aEcosystem 2aFires 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Isotopes 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 2aTime Factors 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aVolatilization 2aWoodxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 3aSouth Africa 0aSouth Africa 0acarbon1 aBond, William J.1 aFebruary, Edmund C.0 tOecologia.g2010 Apr., v. 162, no. 4 p.1027-1034dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1490-y 7aarticle02481naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006400123300001800187520108800205650002201293650001701315650002201332650002501354650001501379650002601394650001601420650001801436650002601454650002401480700001501504700001601519700001501535700001301550700001901563700001401582700001201596700001101608700001801619700001701637700001501654700001701669700001801686700001801704700001601722700001701738700001801755700001801773773006801791852000901859930003301868945001301901946001301914655001201927IND2334417720221120064534.0031016e200305  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233441772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, H.10aField efficacy assessment of transgenic Roundup Ready wheat  ap. 1072-1075.  aHerbicide tolerant crops provide farmers access to a new weed control option of nonselective herbicide such as Roundup1. A wheat transgenic event 33391 was produced via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of a donor cultivar Bobwhite wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and was identified as a commercial candidate to develop Roundup Ready wheat2. The objective of this study was to assess field efficacy of the transgenic event in spring wheat production regions in North America. Transgenic event 33391 was tested in field trials at 14 locations in 1999, 13 locations in 2000, and 14 locations in 2001. All trials were split-plot designs with multiple rates of Roundup treatment. No vegetative or reproductive damage was observed with the application of 4 L ha(-1) Roundup at the 3- to 5-leaf stages. No yield reduction was observed with Roundup treatment. The transgenic event with or without Roundup application yielded as high as the nontransgenic Bobwhite. These results indicate that the wheat transgenic event 33391 has at least 2x tolerance to the nonselective herbicide Roundup. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aspring wheat 3atransgenic plants 3aherbicide resistance 3aglyphosate 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aphytotoxicity 3apesticide application 3anontarget organisms1 aBerg, J.D.1 aBlank, S.E.1 aChay, C.A.1 aChen, G.1 aEskelsen, S.R.1 aFry, J.E.1 aHoi, S.1 aHu, T.1 aIsakson, P.J.1 aLawton, M.B.1 aMetz, S.G.1 aRempel, C.B.1 aRyerson, D.K.1 aSansone, A.P.1 aShook, A.L.1 aStarke, R.J.1 aTichota, J.M.1 aValenti, S.A.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 3 p.1072-1075x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02851naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245012600131300001600257500001500273520141900288650001401707650002401721650002801745650001801773650002101791650001401812650002201826650002501848650002001873650001401893650001401907650001201921650002001933650002501953650003101978650001002009650000902019650001602028653002802044653001002072653001902082700001502101700001902116700001602135700001802151773008402169852000902253930003302262945001302295946001302308655001202321IND2334429520221120064630.0031017e200303  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233442952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCunningham, S.M.10aRaffinose and stachyose accumulation, galactinol synthase expression, and winter injury of contrasting alfalfa germplasms  ap. 562-570.  a2019-12-04  aLarge differences in winter hardiness exist among alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cultivars, but the physiological and molecular bases for these differences are not understood. Our objective was to determine how raffinose family oligosaccharide (RFO) accumulation and steady state mRNA levels for galactinol synthase (GaS) in roots relate to genetic variation in alfalfa winter survival. A GaS cDNA was isolated that possesses over 70% identity with GaS clones from other plant species. Induction of GaS transcripts in crowns of winter hardy alfalfa cultivars occurred within 8 h of exposure to 2 degrees C, and was intensified by exposing plants to -2 degrees C for 2 wk. Galactinol synthase transcripts increased in November in crown and root tissues of winter hardy alfalfa plants. This increase was accompanied by large increases in root RFO concentrations between October and December. A close positive association between RFO accumulation in roots in December and genetic differences in winter survival was observed in these alfalfa populations. Although roots and crowns of nondormant alfalfa cultivars accumulated both GaS transcripts and RFO, accumulation was delayed until December and these cultivars did not survive winter. Understanding the mechanisms regulating GaS gene expression and subsequent RFO accumulation in roots and crowns provides opportunity to genetically improve alfalfa winter hardiness. 3agermplasm 3ahexosyltransferases 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3amessenger RNA 3awinter hardiness 3acultivars 3acomplementary DNA 3acarbohydrate content 3aMedicago sativa 3araffinose 3astachyose 3aalfalfa 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3agene expression regulation 3aroots 3acold 3acold injury 0amolecular sequence data 0acrown 0acold tolerance1 aNadeau, P.1 aCastonguay, Y.1 aLaberge, S.1 aVolenec, J.J.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 2 p.562-570wJournal:jnl44570x1435-06537nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03058naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245011600122300001600238500001500254520175700269650002802026650002502054650001402079650002702093650001102120650004302131650002302174650001402197650003002211650001002241650002202251650002702273650002302300650002302323650002202346650001902368650002002387653002002407700001202427700001502439773006602454852000902520930003302529945001302562946001302575655001202588IND2334426820221120053208.0031017e200303  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233442682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBai, G.10aGenetic relationships among head blight resistant cultivars of wheat assessed on the basis of molecular markers  ap. 498-507.  a2019-12-04  aWheat head blight (Fusarium graminearum Schwab) can dramatically reduce grain yield and quality. Breeding for resistance is an effective measure of disease control. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars with various levels of Type II resistance have been reported worldwide; however, the genetic relationships among the cultivars with different origins are not well characterized. Sixty-five wheat cultivars from eight countries varying in head blight resistance levels were evaluated for Type II resistance and for genetic diversity on the basis of 322 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and 19 simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker alleles. Cluster analysis using AFLP and SSR markers indicated that two Japanese landraces and most of the cultivars that relate to 'Ning 7840' carry the Ning 7840 marker alleles that are tightly linked to the major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 3BS. However, banding patterns of the markers linked to the major QTL in Ning 7840 were different from most of the Chinese landraces and those that originated from countries other than China and Japan. DNA fingerprinting data suggested that Chinese landrace Taiwan Wheat may be the donor of the QTL on chromosome 3BS. Combining the major QTL from Ning 7840 and other sources may facilitate pyramiding of different QTL. Cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis (PCA) based on AFLPs and SSRs provided the best estimate of genetic relationships among wheat accessions studied. The result indicates that U.S. cultivars are more closely related to cultivars from Europe and Argentina than cultivars from Asia; therefore, integrating head blight resistance QTL from Asian sources into US wheat may increase the genetic diversity in U.S. wheat. 3aquantitative trait loci 3aFusarium graminearum 3acultivars 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ablight 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic resistance 3alandraces 3afungal diseases of plants 3awheat 3aTriticum aestivum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3aDNA fingerprinting 3agenetic variation 3abreeding lines 3agenetic markers 0aGibberella zeae1 aGuo, P.1 aKolb, F.L.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 2 p.498-507x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02472naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245021300175300001600388500002400404500001500428520106100443650002701504650001701531650001601548650001301564650001501577650001701592650002401609650002201633650001601655650001201671651001001683653002001693653001301713653000901726653000901735653001401744653001601758653001701774700002001791773010201811852000901913856009201922655001202014IND4390201220221120033550.0070408s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439020122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01337.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYAMAMOTO, Masayuki10aDaily rations and food availability of Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, small flounder Tarphops oligolepis and sand goby Favonigobius gymnauchen at a sandy beach in the central Seto Inland Sea, Japan  ap. 314-323.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aTo estimate the daily rations of Paralichthys olivaceus, Tarphops oligolepis and Favonigobius gymnauchen and to clarify diel variation in food availability to them, diel sampling was conducted over a 24-h period at a sandy beach in the Seto Inland Sea, Japan. The mean total length and body weight (BW) of P. olivaceus, T. oligolepis and F. gymnauchen were 32.6 mm (0.35 g), 23.7 mm (0.13 g) and 50.2 mm (1.03 g), respectively.

Mysids were more abundant in the near-bottom layer during the day than at night, but the opposite was true for crangonids. 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aFavonigobius 3abody weight 3aflounder 3aOligolepis 3aMalacostraca 3aconfidence interval 3afood availability 3abody length 3astomach 3aJapan 0aSeto Inland Sea 0aflatfish 0aprey 0agoby 0aMysidacea 0asandy beach 0adaily ration1 aTOMINAGA, Osamu0 tFisheries science.g2007 Apr., v. 73, no. 2 p.314-323dBlackwell Publishing Asiax0919-92687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2007.01337.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02337naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003200152245012100184300001600305500002400321520110200345650001701447650001201464650001001476650001601486650003601502650001201538650001301550650002001563650002501583650001101608650001301619650001101632700002101643700003101664700002401695700002201719773010101741852000901842856007601851655001201927IND4390211520221120033439.0070408s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439021152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2006.00202.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Mirabal, H.

DPS is very toxic to yeasts, impairing growth at low micromolar concentrations. The genes TRX2 (thioredoxin), SOD1 (superoxide dismutase), GSH1 (γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase) and, particularly, GLR1 (glutathione reductase) are required for survival on DPS. DPS is uniquely thiol-specific, and we found that the cellular mechanisms for DPS detoxification differ substantially from that of the commonly used thiol oxidant diamide. In contrast to this oxidant, the full antioxidant pools of glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin are required for resistance to DPS. We found that DPS-sensitive mutants display increases in the disulfide form of GSH (GSSG) during DPS exposure that roughly correlate with their more oxidizing GSH redox potential in the cytosol and their degree of DPS sensitivity. DPS seems to induce a specific disulfide stress, where an increase in the cytoplasmic/nuclear GSSG/GSH ratio results in putative DPS target(s) becoming sensitive to DPS. 3aantioxidants 3acytosol 3agenes 3aglutathione 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3amutants 3aoxidants 3aredox potential 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiols 3atoxicity 3ayeasts1 aThorsen, Michael1 aKielland-Brandt, Morten C.1 aToledano, Michel B.1 aWinther, Jakob R.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2007 May, v. 7, no. 3 p.391-403dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2006.00202.x3electronic resource 7aarticle01636naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245007200172300001600244500002400260520059600284650001200880650001200892650001500904650001000919650003300929650001600962650001800978650001600996650001101012700002701023700001801050700002001068773010101088852000901189856007601198655001201274IND4390212720221120033505.0070408s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439021272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2007.00208.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPéter, Gábor.10aOgataea thermophila sp. nov., the teleomorph of Candida thermophila  ap. 494-496.  aIncludes references  aAscospore formation was observed in the type strain of Candida thermophila Shin K-S, Shin YK, Yoon and Park on some yeast sporulation media.

They were morphologically, physiologically and phylogenetically identical and produced one to four spherical ascospores per ascus. Phylogenetic analysis using the D1/D2 variable domain of the large-subunit rRNA gene indicated that the closest relative of these strains is Debaryomyces etchellsii (2.6% divergence). Other species related to these strains are D. mycophilus (5.1% divergence) and species of the D. hansenii cluster (4.9-5.6% divergence). The novel species differs by 20 and 15 physiological tests from D. etchellsii and D. mycophilus, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region also indicated that strains of the new species are related to D. etchellsii (7.7% divergence), followed by species of the D. hansenii cluster (9-10% divergence). In the small-subunit rRNA gene sequences, they differed from D. etchellsii by seven substitutions and one insertion or deletion of a base in a sequence (indel) and from D. mycophilus by 17 substitutions and 1 indel. The physiological, biochemical and molecular data suggest that these strains belong to a novel species, for which we propose the name Debaryomyces singareniensis sp. nov. The type strain of AP19T (=MTCC 7061T=CBS 10405T).

Dough rheological characteristics showed that water absorption, stability, index quality, resistance to deformation increased with the amount of added fiber, whereas degree of softening and extensibility decreased in all levels of fiber. Bread evaluation revealed that DFFC addition caused an increase of bread yield especially for the highest levels, a change of crumb color and an insignificant decrease of bread volume. Breads are subjected to sensory evaluation for odor, taste, crumb color, crumb smoothness and overall acceptability. Significant differences were not found (P > 0.05) between scores for all sensory parameters. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Consumption of dietary fiber offers health benefits including protection against cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other degenerative diseases. However, fiber intake is commonly lower than recommended. In consequence, the application of fiber in food production should be desirable. This work intended to add value to the second-grade dates (with a hard texture) from the potential Tunisian cultivars “Deglet Nour,” which has a very good sensory quality and a high commercial value. This by-product could be regarded as an important source of dietary fiber with interesting functional properties and many beneficial effects on human health. Then, date flesh fiber concentrate could be used in value-added applications such as bread making. 3abread dough 3abreads 3abyproducts 3acardioprotective effect 3acardiovascular diseases 3acolor 3adietary fiber 3aextensibility 3afood production 3afunctional properties 3ahuman health 3arheological properties 3asensory evaluation 3asensory properties 3atexture 3avalue added1 aMASMOUDI, MANEL1 aBESBES, SOUHAIL1 aATTIA, HAMADI1 aDEROANNE, CLAUDE1 aBLECKER, CHRISTOPHE0 tJournal of texture studies.g2011 Aug., v. 42, no. 4 p.300-308dBlackwell Publishing Incx0022-49017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4603.2010.00278.x 7aarticle01894naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013200129300001600261500001500277520082300292650001401115650001801129650002701147650002301174650002201197650002201219650002301241650001001264653001301274653002801287653002501315700001601340700001801356773006601374852000901440930003301449945001301482946001301495655001201508IND2332932920221123041715.0030605e200301  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233293292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpielmeyer, W.10aIdentification and validation of markers linked to broad-spectrum stem rust resistance gene Sr2 in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 333-336.  a2019-12-04  aStem rust resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) conferred by the Sr2 gene has remained effective against Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E.

A genetic and physical interval for the Sr2 gene was determined on the short arm of chromosome 3B of wheat. Flanking microsatellite markers were identified and one tightly linked marker (gwm533) was shown to be associated with presence of Sr2. This marker was validated in a wide range of germplasm and can now be implemented in marker-assisted breeding to facilitate selection for this durable, broad-spectrum but difficult to score rust resistance gene. 3agermplasm 3arust diseases 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic resistance 3aPuccinia graminis 3aTriticum aestivum 3adisease resistance 3agenes 0asymptoms 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aSharp, P.J.1 aLagudah, E.S.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 1 p.333-336x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20030801b20030801c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02436naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006000127300001800187520149100205650002201696650001301718650002601731650001401757650003001771650001401801650003101815650000901846650001301855651001101868700001501879700001501894700001701909773006801926852000901994930003302003945001302036946001302049655001202062IND2333768620221123041839.0030728e200207  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233376862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Gouis, J.10aDiallel analysis of winter wheat at two nitrogen levels  ap. 1129-1134.  aPrice reduction and environmental concerns advocate a lower use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer on the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop. It is a common hypothesis that hybrids would be more valuable in stressed environments such as limited fertilizer conditions. The objective of this study was to assess heterosis and combining ability at two N levels. Seven winter wheat cultivars were used to produce a 7 x 7 diallel cross without the reciprocals. The 21 F1 hybrids and parental lines were tested in replicated plots over 2 yr without N fertilizer (N0) or with 150 kg N ha(-1) (N+). The diallel analysis was conducted according to Griffing with year, genotype, and treatment as fixed effects. Mid-parent heterosis for grain yield was + 12.2%** at N0 and +8.9%** at N+ in 1997 and +1.7%(ns) at N0 and -0.4%(ns) at N+ in 1998. This was directly related to high mid-parent heterosis for aboveground dry weight in 1997 (+11.2%** at N0 and +10.9%** at N+) and low heterosis in 1998 (+1.2%(ns) at N0 and +0.0%(ns) at N+). General (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability effects were always significant. The GCA/SCA ratio ranged from 3.6 to 14.8. The GCA x N level interaction was generally significant indicating different parental contributions at low or high N levels. The SCA x N level interaction was never significant. There was a tendency toward higher GCA/SCA ratio at N0 than at N+. The choice of parents will be dependent upon the N level under which the new hybrids will be grown. 3aTriticum aestivum 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aheterosis 3ageneral combining ability 3acultivars 3aspecific combining ability 3aurea 3anitrates 3aFrance1 aBeghin, D.1 aHeumez, E.1 aPluchard, P.0 tCrop science.g2002 , v. 42, no. 4 p.1129-1134x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03150naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013300126300001800259520191100277650002302188650002802211650002402239650000902263650002302272650002302295650002302318650002602341650001402367650002602381650004502407650003702452651001002489700001702499700001402516700001602530700001502546700001902561773006802580852000902648930003302657945001302690946001302703655001202716IND2333777620221123031407.0030729e200207  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233377762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, E.S.10aMapping quantitative trait loci for resistance to downy mildew in pearl millet: field and glasshouse screens detect the same QTL  ap. 1316-1323.  aDowny mildew, caused by the pathogen Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schrot, can cause devastating yield losses in pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.]. Breeding for resistance to downy mildew is facilitated by an artificial glasshouse screening method that can be used worldwide. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping was used to determine whether resistance QTLs identified under field conditions in India were also detected in glasshouse screens carried out in India and the UK. Quantitative trait loci were mapped using 114 individual pearl millet progeny derived from a resistant x susceptible cross: molecular marker mapping was carried out in an F2 population with restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), and disease incidence was assessed on F4 families. Composite interval mapping (CIM) was used to detect associations between F4 family means and marker genotypes. Despite key environmental and methodological differences between the disease screens, the same two QTLs were detected in each screening environment. One QTL had a major effect and explained up to 60% of the phenotypic variation, while the other had a minor effect and explained up to 16% of the phenotypic variation. Two additional QTLs were also consistently detected across screens by examining pair-wise marker interactions. Multiple-trait interval mapping detected all of the QTLs that had been detected in individual screens, including the QTLs that had only been detected by examining pair-wise marker interactions, demonstrating its increased power over single trait mapping. Quantitative trait locus x environment interactions were significant at each QTL due to differences in the magnitude, rather than direction, of QTL effects. The differences in magnitude appeared to be a consequence of the degree of normality of the disease distribution, rather than any differences between screening methods. 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aSclerospora graminicola 3aquantitative traits 3aloci 3achromosome mapping 3adisease resistance 3agenetic resistance 3afield experimentation 3adetection 3agreenhouse production 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agenotype-environment interaction 3aIndia1 aBreese, W.A.1 aLiu, C.J.1 aSingh, S.D.1 aShaw, D.S.1 aWitcombe, J.R.0 tCrop science.g2002 , v. 42, no. 4 p.1316-1323x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02486naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245006900128300001800197520154400215650001301759650001001772650001301782650001701795650002601812650002601838650001401864650001401878651001401892700001601906700001701922700001901939700001801958773006801976852000902044930003302053945001302086946001302099655001202112IND2333769220221123011343.0030728e200207  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233376922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndrade, F.H.10aKernel number prediction in maize under nitrogen or water stress  ap. 1173-1179.  aFinal kernel number in maize (Zea mays L.) is closely associated with the physiological condition of the crop during the critical period bracketing silking. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a common underlying relationship between kernel number per plant (KNP) and plant growth rate (PGR) during that critical period when plant growth varies because of different abiotic stresses. A relationship between KNP and PGR obtained from a previous study of variation in plant density and incident radiation was used as reference. KNP and PGR were measured in experiments in which incident radiation per plant, nitrogen (N), and water availabilities were the experimental sources of variation. The equation fitted to the data obtained at different radiation levels explained 72% of the variation in the data obtained at different levels of N or water availability. Moreover, different models for each set of data did not provide a significantly better fit than a single model for the two sets of data combined. A common relationship between KNP and PGR was also obtained when N supply and water availability were variable. The relationship between KNP and PGR obtained for treatments in which PGR was varied through plant density and shading also could predict KNP for conditions in which PGR was affected by water and/or N deficiencies. The PGR during the critical period of kernel set is a good predictor of the capacity of the maize plant to set kernels under a wide range of environmental and management practices. 3aZea mays 3aseeds 3anitrogen 3awater stress 3anutrient availability 3anutrient deficiencies 3aflowering 3aequations 3aArgentina1 aEcharte, L.1 aRizzalli, R.1 aMaggiora, A.D.1 aCasanovas, M.0 tCrop science.g2002 , v. 42, no. 4 p.1173-1179x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02881naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008200127300001800209500001500227520177600242650001902018650001702037650001702054650001702071650001402088650002002102650002202122650001502144650001802159650001102177650001102188650002002199651001302219653002002232700002402252700001802276700001702294773006802311852000902379930003302388945001302421946001302434655001202447IND2333769020221123011059.0030728e200207  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233376902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansen, J.L.10aComparison of potato leafhopper-resistant and susceptible alfalfa in New York  ap. 1155-1163.  a2019-12-04  aPotato leafhopper [PLH; Empoasca fabae (Harris)] is the most damaging pest of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) in midwestern and eastern states. Our objective was to compare alfalfa populations with glandular-hairs (PLH-resistant) and susceptible populations for forage yield and quality, PLH damage, and PLH nymph and adult populations. Potato leafhopper-resistant and susceptible alfalfa populations were planted in New York (NY) plot trials in 1997, 1998, and 1999, and compared seeding year through second production year. When PLH populations exceeded the action threshold for NY, PLH-resistant populations had lower PLH damage scores (2.3 vs. 3.7), fewer number of nymphs per 10 stems (3.5 vs. 6.2), and fewer adult PLHs per five sweeps (9.1 vs. 18.1) than susceptible populations. However, PLH-resistant populations yielded more than susceptible populations only in one of four trials. Irrespective of PLH damage level, PLH-resistant populations had higher crude protein (CP) concentration (203 vs. 194 g kg(-1)) and matured earlier than susceptible populations. Seeding year trials were severely damaged by PLH. The following year at first harvest, PLH-resistant populations yielded more than susceptible populations (0.24 Mg ha(-1) more in 1997 trial, and 0.61 Mg ha(-1) more in 1999 trial), even though PLHs were not causing economic damage. Resistant populations that were not treated with insecticide averaged lower total season yields than insecticide-treated, PLH-susceptible populations (0.29 Mg ha(-1) less in seeding year, 0.95 Mg ha(-1) less in production yrs). Potato leafhopper-resistant populations provide benefits to growers such as higher CP concentration and less hopperburn, but do not provide complete protection against yield loss from PLH damage. 3aEmpoasca fabae 3acrop quality 3ainsect pests 3aplant glands 3atrichomes 3aMedicago sativa 3aearly development 3acrop yield 3acrude protein 3anymphs 3alarvae 3apest resistance 3aNew York 0aprotein content1 aMiller-Garvin, J.E.1 aWaldron, J.K.1 aViands, D.R.0 tCrop science.g2002 , v. 42, no. 4 p.1155-1163x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02633naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007100127300001600198520163200214650001301846650000901859650001701868650001901885650001201904650003101916650003001947650001601977650001601993650003602009650001602045700001402061700001802075700002002093773006602113852000902179930003302188945001302221946001302234655001202247IND2334414420221123011130.0031016e200305  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233441442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEgesel, C.O.10aCombining ability of maize inbreds for carotenoids and tocopherols  ap. 818-823.  aCarotenoids (provitamin A) and tocopherols (vitamin E) are lipid soluble antioxidants associated with decreased risk of several degenerative diseases. Both vitamins occur naturally in corn (Zea mays L.) grain. Corn grain is a major component in diets of humans and animals, and may have added value with increased levels of carotenoids and tocopherols. To estimate genetic variation among a group of inbreds and their breeding potential, we estimated combining abilities of four carotenoids and two tocopherols in a diallel of 45 corn hybrids. Ten inbreds were chosen that varied in endosperm color (yellow to orange), tocopherol levels and oil content. Plants were grown for two years (1998, 1999) at Urbana, IL, in an RCB design with three replications. High pressure liquid chromatography was used to assay for four carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, and beta-carotene) and two tocopherols (alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol). Good agreement between year means for the six compounds was observed indicating minor environmental effects. Diallel analyses indicated, between 72 to 87% of the total sums of squares for hybrids for the six compounds was attributable to GCA effects. Significant SCA effects were found for several crosses. Estimates of GCA effects indicated A619 had high values for lutein, beta-cryptoxanthin, and total carotenoids. Inbred R84 was a poor genotype for xanthophyll pigments but a significant contributor for beta-carotene and gamma-tocopherol, and total tocopherol. These genetic stocks indicate corn hybrids can be developed with higher levels of provitamin A and vitamin E. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3ainbred lines 3aplant breeding 3ahybrids 3aspecific combining ability 3ageneral combining ability 3acarotenoids 3atocopherols 3achemical constituents of plants 3agrain yield1 aWong, JC.1 aLambert, R.J.1 aRocheford, T.R.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 3 p.818-823x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02214naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010100127300001600228520130000244650001001544650001301554650000901567650001901576650002801595650002301623650001501646650002201661650001201683700001801695700001701713773006601730852000901796930003301805945001301838946001301851655001201864IND2334414620221123011148.0031016e200305  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233441462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJansen, R.C.10aMapping quantitative trait loci in plant breeding populations: use of parental haplotype sharing  ap. 829-834.  aApplied breeding programs evaluate large numbers of progeny derived from multiple related crosses for a wide range of agronomic traits and for tens to hundreds of molecular markers. This study was conducted to determine how these phenotypic and genetic data could be used for routinely mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs). With dense maps, haplotype sharing of parents in a certain region is a good indicator for QTL-allele sharing, albeit not 100% perfect. With this in mind, an approximate and simple method has been developed where ancestral genome blocks in the parents of the crosses can be identified via haplotype analysis and where the effect of a putative QTL is then modeled and estimated per ancestral genome block. A simulation of an early-generation maize breeding scheme demonstrates the potential of the present approach for QTL detection in existing breeding programs. With this new QTL mapping strategy, the power, precision, and accuracy associated with large numbers of progeny may be attained, inferences about QTLs can be drawn across the breeding program rather than being limited to the sample of progeny from a single cross, and results may be much more valuable for marker-assisted breeding because the QTLs apply to agronomically challenging situations in the field. 3acrops 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aplant breeding 3aquantitative trait loci 3achromosome mapping 3ahaplotypes 3asimulation models 3aparents1 aJannink, J.L.1 aBeavis, W.D.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 3 p.829-834x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02572naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008600127300001600213500001500229520146800244650001501712650001901727650001401746650001401760650001401774650002301788650001301811650001701824650001601841650001201857650003701869650001101906651001001917653003101927653001401958653001501972700001701987773006602004852000902070930003302079945001302112946001302125655001202138IND2334413820221123002648.0031015e200305  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233441382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPresterl, T.10aExploiting heterosis in pearl millet for population breeding in arid environments  ap. 767-776.  a2019-12-04  aIn the desert region of Rajasthan, India, farmers mainly grow pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] landraces. The adoption of modern cultivars is generally low because of their poor adaptation to extreme drought stress. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of six elite breeding populations and three landraces and to determine the heterotic pattern among the 36 diallel crosses of those populations. Field experiments were conducted in eight environments in India. Mean grain yields (GYs) in the three environments with favorable growing conditions were double to threefold those in the three arid environments. The elite populations generally showed higher GY than the landraces; stover yield (SY) was similar in both population types. The landraces flowered earlier, had a higher tillering potential, and smaller seeds. Mean level of midparent heterosis was generally low, ranging from 0.85% for time to flowering (TF) to 6.57% for SY. For GY, expression of heterosis for individual population crosses was between -14 and +30% under drought stress, and between -9 and +17% in the favorable environments. For SY, mean heterosis was always positive and higher than for GY. The elite x landrace population crosses with high mean GY and high levels of heterosis under drought stress could be beneficial to widen the germplasm base and to combine the high yield potential of elite materials with the good adaptation of the landraces. 3aarid zones 3aplant breeding 3aflowering 3alandraces 3atillering 3aPennisetum glaucum 3acrossing 3awater stress 3agrain yield 3adrought 3agenotype-environment interaction 3astover 3aIndia 0aelite breeding populations 0avarieties 0acrop yield1 aWeltzien, E.0 tCrop science.g2003 , v. 43, no. 3 p.767-776x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03325naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001300154245007700167300001600244500015200260520168600412650001502098650001802113650001702131650002102148650001302169650001302182650001502195650001402210650001002224650002302234650002402257650000902281650001202290650002202302650002102324650002702345650002302372650002302395650001202418650001402430650001002444650001502454650001202469651001002481700001902491700001802510700001802528700001602546773014502562856005502707852000902762655001202771IND60569747220221123002559.0170608e20170331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056974722DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1155.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuta, C.13aAn efficient in vitro propagation for faba bean (Vicia faba L.) ecotypes  ap. 107-112.  aPaper presented at the VI International Symposium on Production and Establishment of Micropropagated Plants held April 19-24, 2015, San Remo, Italy  aFaba bean (Vicia faba L.) is one of the most important pulses in the world. Due to the releasing of phenolic compounds and the difficulty of in vitro rooting, the in vitro culture technique appears not completely suitable for this crop. The main aim of this research was to improve in vitro propagation of faba bean, both to multiply Apulia autochthonous ecotypes and to allow the maintenance of biological diversity of V. faba var. major germplasm. Seeds of five Apulia faba bean ecotypes (“Tommasone”, “Battaglini”, “Carpino”, “San Donato”, “Zollino”), were surface sterilized with 0.1% HgCl2 solution (w/v) for 10 min, rinsed with sterile distilled water, and then aseptically inoculated in the glass jars on sandy substrate watered to saturation using Murashige and Skoog (MS) nutrient solution. Shoot tips and cotyledonary nodes were excised from the aseptic seedlings and explants were cultured on MS medium supplemented with two concentrations (0.5 or 1 mg L-1) of 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) or kinetin (N6-furfuryladenine) (Kin), 30 mg L-1 Fe-EDTA and 20 g L-1 sucrose. The greatest shoot number per shoot was successfully obtained on MS medium enriched with 1 mg L-1 BAP while the longest shoots were obtained from the MS medium containing 0.5 mg L-1 BAP, without callus formation. The shoots were transferred on MS media containing 1.0 mg L-1 of either indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) or naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) for root induction. A good rooting response was observed with all the treatments for all tested faba bean ecotypes. This study developed an effective and reproducible protocol for micropropagation of faba bean. 3aVicia faba 3abenzyladenine 3abiodiversity 3acallus formation 3aecotypes 3aexplants 3afaba beans 3agermplasm 3aglass 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3ajars 3akinetin 3amercuric chloride 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3anutrient solutions 3aphenolic compounds 3arooting 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoot tips 3asucrose 3aItaly1 aCampanelli, A.1 aTagarelli, A.1 aDe Mastro, G.1 aVancini, C.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Mar. 31, , no. 1155 p.107-112dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1155.14  aDNAL 7aarticle01868naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245016800165300001600333500002400349520074000373650000901113650001001122650001301132650002301145650001701168650001801185650001701203650001501220650001601235650001801251700001501269700001301284773010701297852000901404856009301413655001201506IND4391002820221122231940.0070506s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439100282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4573.2007.00073.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLI, C.B.10aComparisons of meat quality characteristics and intramuscular connective tissue between beef longissimus dorsi and semitendinosus muscles from chinese yellow bulls  ap. 143-161.  aIncludes references  aThis study was designed to compare meat quality characteristics and the traits of intramuscular connective tissue (IMCT) of beef longissimus dorsi (LD) and semitendinosus (ST) muscles at 4 and 21 days postmortem.

Both the natures of IMCT (insoluble collagen, perimysial thickness) and the status of muscle fiber were contributors to the tenderness of different muscles from the same carcass. 3abeef 3abulls 3acollagen 3alongissimus muscle 3ameat quality 3amuscle fibers 3ashear stress 3asolubility 3atemperature 3awater content1 aZHOU, G.H.1 aXU, X.L.0 tJournal of muscle foods.g2007 Apr., v. 18, no. 2 p.143-161dBlackwell Publishing Incx1046-07567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4573.2007.00073.x3Available from publisher's Web site. 7aarticle02481naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002300160245009000183300001600273500002400289520094200313650002101255650001901276650001001295650001001305650001301315650001201328650001801340650002101358650002701379650002201406650001501428650001401443650001201457650002301469650002601492650001401518650002101532650002701553651001101580700002401591700001901615700003201634700002401666773010701690852000901797856008101806856007601887655001201963IND4390980620221122231912.0070506s2007    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439098062DNAL7 a173956012pmid7 a10.1093/jhered/esm0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTejedor, M.

A set of 31 chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar) from Cyprus and 33 red-legged partridges (A. rufa) from one Spanish farm were also studied to provide suitable populations for comparison. Factorial correspondence analysis on microsatellite genotypes supported a clear distinction of birds from Cyprus, whereas partridges from Majorca and the Spanish farm overlapped in a wide area. The existence of A. chukar mitochondrial DNA in 16 individuals from Majorca indicated introgression into their maternal lineage even if their phenotypes were not different from A. rufa. Bayesian inference based on microsatellite analysis indicated a noticeable degree of genetic proximity to A. chukar only for one of these hybrids. 3aAlectoris chukar 3aAlectoris rufa 3afarms 3agenes 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3amaternal lineage 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3apartridges 3aphenotype 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Mitochondrial 2aGalliformesxgenetics 2aGene Flow 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 3aCyprus1 aMonteagudo, Luis V.1 aMautner, Selma1 aHadjisterkotis, Eleftherios1 aArruga, M.

Additionally, the resistance to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of indigenous fungi that mainly occupy creosote-treated wood was evaluated. We isolated fungi from the surface and inner area of crosstie wastes and identified them using a combination of traditional methods and molecular techniques. Overall, 179 isolates including 47 different species were isolated from 240 sampling sites. The identified fungal species included 23 ascomycetes, 19 basidiomycetes, and 5 zygomycetes. Three species, Alternaria alternata, Irpex lacteus, and Rhizomucor variabilis, were the most frequently isolated ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, and zygomycetes, respectively. The results of this study showed that there was a large difference in the fungal diversity between the surface and the inner area. Additionally, zygomycetes and ascomycetes were found to have a greater tolerance to PAHs than basidiomycetes. However, two basidiomycetes, Heterobasidion annosum and Schizophyllum commune, showed very high resistance to PAHs, even in response to the highest concentration (1,000 ppm), which indicates that these species may play a role in the degradation of PAHs. 3awastes 3aRhizomucor 3aSchizophyllum commune 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3awood 3aHeterobasidion annosum 3aIrpex lacteus 3aAlternaria alternata 3afungi 2aAntifungal Agentsxtoxicity 2aBiodiversity 2aCluster Analysis 2aCreosote 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFungixclassificationxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aGenes, rRNA 2aIndustrial Waste 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPolycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbonsxtoxicity. 2aRNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 28Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aWoodxmicrobiology 3aKorean Peninsula 0aKorea 0aAscomycota1 aLee, Hwanhwi1 aChoi, Yong-Seok1 aKim, Gyu-Hyeok1 aHuh, Na-Yoon1 aLee, Sangjoon1 aLim, Young Woon1 aLee, Sung-Suk1 aKim, Jae Jin.0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2010 May, v. 97, no. 4 p.377-387dSpringer Netherlandsx0003-60727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-010-9416-6 7aarticle04294naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245009300191300001800284500002400302520228300326650001602609650001602625650000802641650001402649650002202663650001902685650001702704650000902721650001502730650001202745650001002757650001302767650001002780650001902790650001102809650001402820650001302834650001202847650001102859650001102870650001202881650000902893650000902902650001402911650003302925650001102958650000902969650002702978650001303005650002303018651003803041653001203079653002803091653002103119653001503140653002303155700002003178700001903198700001403217700002303231700002103254700001803275700002103293700001803314700001703332773011103349852000903460856005503469655001203524IND4411563520221122221349.0081017e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441156352DNAL7 a186572092pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01445.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Dijk, Jiska10aDiet shift of a facultative scavenger, the wolverine, following recolonization of wolves  ap. 1183-1190.  aIncludes references  a1. Wolves Canis lupus L. recolonized the boreal forests in the southern part of the Scandinavian peninsula during the late 1990s, but so far there has been little attention to its effect on ecosystem functioning. Wolf predation increases the availability of carcasses of large prey, especially moose Alces alces L., which may lead in turn to a diet switch in facultative scavengers such as the wolverine Gulo gulo L. 2. Using 459 wolverine scats collected during winter-spring 2001-04 for DNA identity and dietary contents, we compared diet inside and outside wolf territories while controlling for potential confounding factors, such as prey density. We tested the hypothesis that wolverine diet shifted towards moose in the presence of wolves, while taking into account possible sexual segregation between the sexes. Occurrence of reindeer, moose and small prey was modelled against explanatory covariates using logistic mixed-effects models. Furthermore, we compared diet composition and breadth among habitats and sexes. 3. Occurrence of reindeer, moose and small prey in the diet varied with prey availability and habitat. As expected, diet contained more moose and less reindeer and small prey in the presence of wolves. Their diet in tundra consisted of 40% reindeer Rangifer tarandus L., 39% moose and 9% rodents. In forest with wolf, their diet shifted to 76% moose, 18% reindeer and 5% rodents; compared to 42% moose, 32% reindeer and 15% rodents in forest without wolf. This diet switch could not be explained by higher moose density in wolf territories. Female diet consisted of more small prey than for males, but there was a tendency for females to use the highly available moose carrion opportunistically and to hunt less on small prey within wolf territories. 4. Our study highlights how wolves increase scavenging opportunities for wolverines, and how sexual differences in diet may also apply to large scavengers. Due to their more restricted home range, female wolverines are forced to rely more on hunting small prey. The relatively high occurrence of wolf kills, however, forms an important food source to wolverines in this area. The recolonization of wolves may therefore have contributed to the consequent recolonization of wolverines into the same area. 3aAlces alces 3aCanis lupus 3aDNA 3aGulo gulo 3aRangifer tarandus 3aboreal forests 3adead animals 3adiet 3aecosystems 3afemales 3afoods 3ahabitats 3amales 3ameat carcasses 3amodels 3apredation 3areindeer 3arodents 3atundra 3awolves 2aAnimals 2aDeer 2aDiet 2aEcosystem 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMustelidaexphysiology 2aRodentia 2aWolvesxphysiology 0aScandinavian and Nordic Countries 0ahunting 0aintraguild interactions 0alarge carnivores 0ascavenging 0asexual segregation1 aGustavsen, Line1 aMysterud, Atle1 aMay, Roel1 aFlagstad, Øystein1 aBrøseth, Henrik1 aAndersen, Roy1 aAndersen, Reidar1 aSteen, Harald1 aLanda, Arild0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2008 Nov., v. 77, no. 6 p.1183-1190dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01445.x 7aarticle03585naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002000181245007600201300001800277500002400295506007600319520132500395506003701720650001301757650002601770650002201796650001201818650001501830650002601845650002401871650002101895650001501916650001001931650001001941650002601951650001401977650004501991650001802036650001302054650002302067650001102090650001602101650001102117650006602128650003802194650001802232650005202250650001202302650001402314650002102328650001402349650004602363650002902409650003402438650001202472650002302484651001202507700002002519700001702539700003602556773013402592852000902726856008002735856004802815655001202863IND4383695520221207124330.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438369552DNAL7 a169571822pmid7 aPMC15636412pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.02773-052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoss, Joseph A.10aStability and Change in Estuarine Biofilm Bacterial Community Diversity  ap. 5679-5688.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBiofouling communities contribute significantly to aquatic ecosystem productivity and biogeochemical cycling. Our knowledge of the distribution, composition, and activities of these microbially dominated communities is limited compared to other components of estuarine ecosystems. This study investigated the temporal stability and change of the dominant phylogenetic groups of the domain Bacteria in estuarine biofilm communities. Glass slides were deployed monthly over 1 year for 7-day incubations during peak tidal periods in East Sabine Bay, Fla. Community profiling was achieved by using 16S rRNA genes and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16S rRNA genes in combination with ribotyping, cloning, and sequencing to evaluate diversity and to identify dominant microorganisms. Bacterial community profiles from biofilms grown near the benthos showed distinct periods of constancy within winter and summer sampling periods. Similar periods of stability were also seen in T-RFLP patterns from floating biofilms. Alternating dominance of phylogenetic groups between seasons appeared to be associated with seasonal changes in temperature, nutrient availability, and light. The community structure appeared to be stable during these periods despite changes in salinity and in dissolved oxygen.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abenthic organisms 3abiofilm 3abiofouling 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acommunity structure 3adissolved oxygen 3aecosystems 3agenes 3aglass 3anutrient availability 3aphylogeny 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aBase Sequence 2aBiofilmsxclassificationxgrowth & development. 2aBiomass 2aEcosystem 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSeasons 2aWater Microbiology 0aFlorida1 aNocker, Andreas1 aLepo, Joe E.1 aSnyder, Richard A.,d1910-1992.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.5679-5688dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02773-053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle02451naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002400155245008300179300001800262500002400280500001500304520081700319650003101136650001801167650003101185650002301216650002101239650002601260650002601286650007001312650002001382650005601402650001101458650003201469650006901501650002401570650003001594650003301624650002101657653001701678700001701695700002501712700002601737700002601763773010801789852000901897856003901906655001201945IND4425416920221122181204.0090829e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442541692DNAL7 a191732812pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.26392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhary, M.

In an animal study, more than 25kGy of γ-irradiation was necessary to eliminate C. parvum infectivity from mice. In contrast, Cryptosporidium muris (murine Cryptosporidium), which lives in stomach epithelium, lost its infectivity in mice with 1kGy of γ-irradiation. Recently, it was found that thioredoxin peroxidase was highly expressed in C. parvum oocysts irradiated with high doses of γ-irradiation. Therefore we hypothesize that antioxidant activity of the thioredoxin peroxidase is involved in the radioresistance of C. parvum. To verify this, thioredoxin peroxidases of C. parvum (CpTPx) and C. muris (CmTPx) were expressed in Escherichia coli cells, and their antioxidant activities were compared. Both CpTPx and CmTPx belong to the 2-Cys family of peroxiredoxins. Hydrogen peroxide consumption was approximately 2- to 12-fold greater in recombinant CpTPx (rCpTPx) than in recombinant CmTPx (rCmTPx) in the presence of 0.2mM dithioerythritol or glutathione (GSH), respectively. The peroxidase activity of rCpTPx was highly enhanced by GSH, but that of rCmTPx was not. The minimum dose of rCpTPx required to protect supercoiled plasmid DNA from damage by metal-catalyzed oxidation was only 12% of that required with rCmTPx. The results showed that rCpTPx has more powerful antioxidant activity than rCmTPx. Further investigations on the role of CpTPx in the radioresistance of C. parvum are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptosporidium muris 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aEscherichia coli 3aantioxidant activity 3adisinfectants 3aenvironmental factors 3aepithelium 3agamma radiation 3aglutathione 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amice 3aoocysts 3aoxidation 3aparasitology 3apathogenicity 3aperoxidase 3aperoxiredoxin 3aplasmids 3aradiation resistance 3astomach1 aPark, Woo-Yoon1 aYu, Jae-Ran0 tExperimental parasitology.g2012 July, v. 131, no. 3 p.333-338dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2012.04.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012000169520143100289592002801720650004401748650002201792650001501814650001501829650001201844650001501856650000901871650001501880650001201895650001301907650002201920650001301942650002001955650001101975650000701986650001601993650002302009653002102032653002102053653002302074653001302097653002602110700002002136700002702156700002002183700002002203700002402223700002902247700002502276773011302301856008602414852000902500655001202509IND60734091820221122204113.0210806e20210620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073409182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1269242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aĐolić, Maja10aClosing the loop: As(V) adsorption onto goethite impregnated coal-combustion fly ash as integral building materials  aFly and bottom ash(es) are the most abundant generated by-products of coal combustion in thermal power plants. This investigation offers a sustainable solution of a double and circular use of industrial waste material in civil engineering practices; i.e., fly ash (FA) as an eco-efficiently, low-cost material for As(V) adsorption, as well as an additive in building materials. A goethite impregnated sample (FAG) was synthesized and optimized using the column precipitation procedure, then thoroughly, structurally and morphologically characterized using liquid nitrogen porosimetry (BET), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Mössbauer spectroscopy (MS) techniques. The data from the equilibrium adsorption were fitted by linear and non-linear isotherm models; the optimal capacity of FAG/As(V) removal was calculated from the Langmuir model at 31.742 mg g⁻¹ for 45 °C. The kinetics of adsorption process has shown the pseudo-second-order kinetic model (PSO). The Weber-Morris model was applied to determine the intra-particle diffusion as a limiting step of reaction. The low pH dependant FAG leaching confirmed the efficient use of non-hazardous waste material in arsenic removal; furthermore, it also validated the new added value of the used/spent adsorbent as an adhesive in building materials possessing advanced mechanical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3abottom ash 3acoal 3acombustion 3afly ash 3agoethite 3aindustrial wastes 3akinetics 3aliquid nitrogen 3amodels 3apH 3aporosimetry 3asorption isotherms 0aFly ash/Goethite 0aArsenate removal 0aWaste minimization 0aLeaching 0aConstruction material1 aKaranac, Milica1 aRadovanović, Dragana,1 aUmićević, Ana1 aKapidžić, Ana1 aVeličković, Zlate1 aMarinković, Aleksandar,1 aKamberović, Željko0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 June 20, v. 303 p.126924-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1269243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245011900210300002000329506007600349520136600425592002801791506003701819650001801856650001801874650002501892650001801917650002301935650001301958650002401971650001701995650002002012650002202032650003502054650001502089650001102104650002902115650000902144653001702153653000802170653003002178700002402208700002302232700002302255700002202278700002102300700002002321773017502341856007902516852000902595655001202604IND60172305420221207075935.0150602e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017230542DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12093721092doi7 aPMC34795882pmcid7 a229881042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalsh, Elizabeth R.10aDual signaling by innate and adaptive immune receptors is required for TLR7-induced B-cell–mediated autoimmunity  ap. 16276-16281.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aToll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7) has been linked to systemic lupus disease incidence in humans and mice, but how TLR7 potentiates autoimmunity is unclear. We used a Tlr7 transgenic (tg) mouse model to investigate the cellular and molecular events required to induce spontaneous autoimmunity through increased TLR7 activity. We determined that Tlr7 exerts B-cell–intrinsic effects in promoting spontaneous germinal center (GC) and plasmablast B-cell development, and that these B-cell subsets are dependent on T-cell–derived signals through CD40L and SLAM-associated protein (SAP), but not IL-17. Antigen specificity also factored into TLR7-induced disease, as both a restricted T cell receptor (TCR) specificity and MHC haplotype H2 ᵏ/ᵏ protected Tlr7 tg mice from spontaneous lymphocyte activation and autoantibody production. Inflammatory myeloid cell expansion and autoimmunity did not develop in Tlr7 tgIgH ⁻/⁻ mice, suggesting either that spontaneous TLR7 activation does not occur in dendritic cells, or, if it does occur, cannot drive these events in the absence of B-cell aid. These data indicate that autoimmune disease in Tlr7 tg mice is contingent upon B cells receiving stimulation both through innate pathways and T-cell–derived signals and suggest a codependent relationship between B cells and T cells in the development of autoimmunity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToll-like receptor 7 3aanimal models 3aantibody formation 3aantigens 3aautoimmune diseases 3aautoimmunity 3adendritic cells 3adisease incidence 3agenetically modified organisms 3ahaplotypes 3ahumans 3alymphocyte proliferation 3amice 0ainflammation 0aSLE 0aT follicular helper cells1 aPisitkun, Prapaporn1 aVoynova, Elisaveta1 aDeane, Jonathan A.1 aScott, Bethany L.1 aCaspi, Rachel R.1 aBolland, Silvia0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 2, v. 109, no. 40 p.16276-16281dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12093721093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02090naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006100173300001800234500001900252520100400271592002801275650001601303650001701319650001801336650001001354651000901364651001801373653002101391653001101412653003301423653001801456653002401474773013601498856008501634852000901719655001201728IND60708568620221120164605.0200827e20201020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070856862DNAL7 a10.1080/21683565.2020.17523502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarwood, Jonathan10a‘Whatever happened to the Mexican Green Revolution?’  ap. 1243-1252.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReferences to ‘the Green Revolution’ in the development literature over the last decade or two are nearly always selective. The revolution is seen as having taken place from the 1960 s in Asia; almost no one refers to the green revolution programs in Latin America during the 1940 s and ‘50 s. Remarkably, this silence extends even to the Rockefeller Foundation’s Mexican Agricultural Program whose importance – not least for the subsequent programs in Asia – was widely recognized by the 1960 s. It is unlikely that the development community is ignorant of the Green Revolution’s history. Instead I argue that the Mexican program has been conveniently forgotten because, despite its very substantial impact upon wheat production, it failed utterly to alleviate rural poverty and malnutrition. For those who regard a ‘new Green Revolution’ as the only viable way to secure future food supplies, therefore, the Mexican episode is an embarrassment which is best left unmentioned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3amalnutrition 3arural poverty 3awheat 3aAsia 3aLatin America 0aGreen revolution 0aMexico 0aMexican Agricultural Program 0afood security 0apeasant agriculture0 tAgroecology and sustainable food systems.g2020 Oct. 20, v. 44, no. 9 p.1243-1252dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12333x2168-35737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21683565.2020.17523503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005600152245012100208520124100329592002801570650001501598650001101613650001701624650002001641650001001661650001401671650000901685650001401694650003601708650001501744650001301759650002001772651001001792653002401802653001801826653002401844653002101868653001901889700001301908700001301921700001301934700001901947700001501966700001901981700001602000700001602016700006102032773009602093856008702189852000902276655001202285IND60656168320221122072108.0200228e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065616832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1068072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xunfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7306-619910aPredictive geographical authentication of green tea with protected designation of origin using a random forest model  aReliable origin authentication methods are critical for protecting high-value food products with designated geographical origins. A total of 623 tea samples were collected from important green tea production regions around China from 2012 to 2016. A Random Forest model (RF) with 19 input predictors (e.g., δ¹³C, ²⁴Mg, ⁸⁵Rb, and ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁷Pb) was developed. Our RF model not only discriminated Westlake Xihu Longjing green tea (XHLJ) from other regions with an accuracy of 97.6%, but also correctly identified green tea from surrounding regions with an accuracy of 97.9%. The geographical discrimination of tea subsequently harvested in the following years also showed good reliability. Predictive accuracies were higher than 91%. ⁸⁵Rb, ²⁴Mg, δ¹³C and ³⁹K were the most important geographical proxies for determining geographical origin of tea with a relative contribution of 20.6%, 12.5%, 12.1% and 7.4%, respectively.

Protein ubiquitination can then be detected using a fluorescence microscope. The ubiquitination of a protein can be determined based on a fluorescence signal. To validate the reliability of this procedure, Gap1p, a protein known to be ubiquitinated, was used as a positive control. A triple mutant of Gap1p, Gap1pᴷ⁹ᴿ,ᴷ¹⁶ᴿ,ᴷ⁷⁶ᴿ, which did not contain any ubiquitination site, was used as a negative control. pUbDetec16-GAP1 and pUbDetec16-GAP1ᴷ⁹ᴿ,ᴷ¹⁶ᴿ,ᴷ⁷⁶ᴿ were constructed and transferred into the Δura3 auxotrophic S. cerevisiae strain CEN.PK2-1D. Transformants of pUbDetec16-GAP1 emitted fluorescence, while the pUbDetec16-GAP1ᴷ⁹ᴿ,ᴷ¹⁶ᴿ,ᴷ⁷⁶ᴿ transformants did not. The ubiquitination of Gap1p and Gap1pᴷ⁹ᴿ, ᴷ¹⁶ᴿ, ᴷ⁷⁶ᴿ was further verified using classical SDS–PAGE analysis. This procedure significantly simplifies manipulation involving ubiquitination detection using the BiFC approach, particularly on a large scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amutants 3aplasmids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aubiquitination1 aZhao, Xinrui1 aLiu, Long1 aDu, Guocheng1 aZhou, Jingwen1 aChen, Jian0 tJournal of microbiological methods.g2013 July, v. 94, no. 1 p.25-29dElsevier B.V.x0167-70127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mimet.2013.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245015300180300001800333520109000351592002801441650001501469650001601484650002201500650001901522650001601541650001101557650001401568650001201582650001601594650005301610650002101663650003201684650002901716650003101745650003601776650005901812650002801871700001601899700001401915700001401929773009901943856004802042852000902090655001202099IND4469609920221119145603.0121003e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446960992DNAL7 a219871032pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-011-2664-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudiño, B.10aDifferences in the in vitro susceptibility to resveratrol and other chemical compounds among several Philasterides dicentrarchi isolates from turbot  ap. 1573-1578.  aPhilasterides dicentrarchi is a histophagous scuticociliate that causes important losses in aquaculture. Several strains that differ in morphological, genetic and serological characteristics and virulence have been isolated from outbreaks of turbot scuticociliatosis. In the present study, seven isolates of the ciliate were exposed in vitro to formalin, hydrogen peroxide and resveratrol (a phytoalexin produced by plants) in order to evaluate the susceptibility of the isolates to the different compounds. The LD50 values for the three compounds tested varied widely among the isolates. The LD100 values were similar among isolates for formalin (25–30 ppm) and resveratrol (60–70 ppm) but were very different for hydrogen peroxide (25–>80 ppm). The results indicate that there are many physiological differences among isolates and even among specimens of the same isolates, which must be taken into account in designing control programmes. The naturally occurring resveratrol may be a good alternative to other compounds for reducing the amounts of viable ciliates in water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCiliophora 3aaquaculture 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alethal dose 50 3aresveratrol 3aturbot 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aCiliophora Infectionsxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aCross Protection 2aFish Diseasesxdrug therapy 2aFlatfishesxparasitology 2aFormaldehydexpharmacology 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aOligohymenophoreaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aStilbenesxpharmacology1 aPata, M.

Although some studies have been done in other species, there is a lack of information about the oxidative/antioxidant status in the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica) affected by sarcoptic mange. To clarify this fact, albumin, catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), glutathione reductase (GR), reduced glutathione (GSH): oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and total oxidant status (TOS) concentrations were measured in peripheral blood of ibexes experimentally infested with Sarcoptes scabiei (n=25), as well as in the healthy control group (n=14). During the course of the experiment, the infected ibexes were visually assigned to four categories according to the percentage of skin surface affected by mites. In the infested ibexes, the levels of albumin, PON-1, CAT, SOD, GSH-Px and GSH:GSSG ratio showed a significant (p<0.01) decrease with disease progression. With respect to the control group, this decrease was significantly (p<0.001) lower in the more severe clinical stages. No significant changes were observed in GR activity during disease or with respect to the control group. Conversely, the concentrations of TOS and TBARS increased with lesion severity, and with respect to the control group, this increase was significant (p<0.01) in the more advanced stages of the infection. Additionally, to explore the possible effects of sex, age, haplotype, mange status, and days post infection (dpi) on each of the OS biomarkers, generalized additive mixed models were applied. According to our results, the mange status and dpi explained the highest percentages in the observed changes in the biomarkers analyzed, whereas the haplotype only influenced the observed variability of albumin and TOS. The contribution of sex and age was not significant in any of the OS biomarkers. From the present study, it may be concluded that sarcoptic mange infestation increases OS and decreases antioxidant status in ibex. This imbalance may contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCapra 3aSarcoptes scabiei 3aalbumins 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3acatalase 3adisease course 3aglutathione 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3ahaplotypes 3amites 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apathogenesis 3ascabies 3asuperoxide dismutase 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 0aOxidant/antioxidant status 0aOxidative stress 0aCapra pyrenaica 0aIbex 0aSarcoptes scabiei 0aMange1 aPérez, Jesús M.1 aLópez-Olvera, Jorge R.1 aRáez-Bravo, Arián1 aCano-Manuel, Francisco J.1 aFandos, Paulino1 aSoriguer, Ramón C.1 aGranados, José Enrique1 aRomero, Diego0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 242 p.63-70dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2017.05.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02162naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245012300162300001600285520120200301592002801503653002101531653002101552653001301573653001701586653001301603653001401616700002301630773012101653856007701774852000901851655001201860IND60130048320221117233537.0151126e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013004832DNAL7 a10.3356/JRR-08-47.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantolo, Gary M.10aNest Box and Site Use by, and Selenium Concentrations in, American Kestrels at Kesterson Reservoir, Central California  ap. 315-324.  aDuring 1997 and 1998, we studied American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) using nest boxes at Kesterson Reservoir (Merced County, central California), a site with elevated soil selenium concentrations. We radiotagged male kestrels to determine their foraging ranges. Nest-box use was lower than expected; eleven nest boxes at Kesterson were used during the two years (16%% and 20%% occupancy) and five offsite nest boxes were used (60 and 40%% occupancy). Kestrel pairs in 60%% and 67%% of onsite nest boxes that were used successfully fledged chicks in 1997 and 1998, respectively; pairs in offsite nest boxes had 100%% (1997) and 50%% (1998) success. Concentrations of Se in blood and eggs of kestrels at Kesterson were similar to concentrations in offsite kestrels. We analyzed 31 pellets and we used previously measured selenium concentrations in prey items from Kesterson to estimate dietary Se exposure of 8.1 µµg Se/g for kestrels at Kesterson. We estimated that radiotagged male kestrels foraged onsite 58%% of the time in 1997 and 53%% of the time in 1998 and that they foraged from 0 to 3.4 km (maximum foraging distances observed: 0.5––3.4 km) from the nest box during foraging bouts.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAmerican Kestrel 0aFalco sparverius 0anest box 0areproduction 0aselenium 0atelemetry1 aYamamoto, Julie T.0 tJournal of raptor research.g2009 Dec., v. 43, no. 4 p.315-324dThe Raptor Research Foundation, Incx0892-10167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3356%2FJRR-08-47.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012400164300001600288520157000304592002801874650002101902650001401923650001201937650001401949650002401963650001601987650003502003650001002038650001202048650002202060650005202082650002402134650001702158650003802175653000802213653001502221653001102236653001202247653001102259653000902270653001302279653002302292653001702315653001402332653002402346653001202370653005202382700001702434700001202451700001602463700001902479700001602498700001402514700001802528773013202546856008402678852000902762655001202771IND60605061720221120200052.0180720e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060506172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2015.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xin10aMicroRNA-101 protects cardiac fibroblasts from hypoxia-induced apoptosis via inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway  ap. 155-164.  aCardiac fibroblasts (CFs) are the most numerous cells in the heart and are recognized primarily for their ability to maintain both the structural integrity and the physiological functions of the heart. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway is reportedly involved in the modulation of CF functions, including apoptosis. Recent studies have indicated that microRNA-101 (miR-101) attenuates the TGF-β signaling pathway, either by inhibiting the expression of TGFβ1 or by targeting transforming growth factor-β receptor type I (TGFβRI). The present study aimed to determine whether miR-101 protects CFs from hypoxia-induced apoptosis and to investigate the mechanisms underlying its protective effects. The CCK-8 test, electron microscopy and TUNEL assay results demonstrated that miR-101a/b significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced CF apoptosis. The results of Western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence assays indicated that miR-101a dramatically inhibited the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of both TGFβRI and p-Smad 3 but not TGFβ1 in CFs. Additionally, miR-101a significantly reversed the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of Bax and Caspase-3, the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and the activation of Caspase-3 in CFs. Moreover, miR-101a markedly inhibited the intracellular Ca²⁺ ([Ca²⁺]i) overload caused by hypoxia. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-101a protects CFs against hypoxia-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway, which may be a potential therapeutic target for heart injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acaspase-3 3aelectron microscopy 3afibroblasts 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aheart 3ahypoxia 3aprotective effect 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta 1 0aCFs 0amiR, miRNA 0aTGF-β 0aTGFβRI 0aα-SMA 0aSmad 0a3′-UTR 0aintracellular Ca2+ 0aMicroRNA-101 0aApoptosis 0aCardiac fibroblasts 0aHypoxia 0aTransforming growth factor β signaling pathway1 aWang, Kejing1 aHu, Fen1 aQian, Cheng1 aGuan, Hongquan1 aFeng, Kaige1 aZhou, You1 aChen, Zhijian0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2015 Aug., v. 65 p.155-164dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2015.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245016700168300001600335520145600351592002801807650002601835650002101861650001501882650001301897650002001910650001101930650001701941650001401958650002201972650000901994650002402003650003202027653006902059653003302128653004002161653002302201653001002224700002002234700001702254700001502271700001802286700001402304700001502318700001402333773013202347856008402479852000902563655001202572IND60605061820221120212006.0180720e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060506182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2015.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Xiao-Ting10aInositol-requiring protein 1 – X-box-binding protein 1 pathway promotes epithelial–mesenchymal transition via mediating snail expression in pulmonary fibrosis  ap. 230-238.  aEpithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex biological program during which cells loss epithelial phenotype and acquire mesenchymal features. EMT is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of various fibrotic diseases including pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Recent studies suggest that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is associated with EMT in the progression of PF. However, the exact mechanism is unclear. Here, we developed a PF model with bleomycin (BLM) administration in rats and conducted several simulation experiments in alveolar epithelial cell (AECs) RLE-6TN to unravel the role of inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1) – X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) signal pathway in ER stress-induced EMT in PF. First, we observed that ER stress was occurred in type II AECs accompanied by EMT in BLM-induced PF. Then we explored the role of IRE1-XBP1-snail pathway in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/tunicamycin (TM)-induced EMT. When TGF-β1/TM was treated on AECs, IRE1 and XBP1 were overexpressed, meanwhile, snail expression was upregulated accompanied with EMT. However, when IRE1 or XBP1 was knockdown, TGF-β1/TM-induced EMT were blocked while the expression of snail was inhibited. Then we silenced snail and found that TGF-β1/TM-induced EMT were also suppressed, but it had no effect on the up-regulated expression of IRE1 and XBP1. Thus, we concluded that IRE1-XBP1 pathway promotes EMT via mediating snail expression in PF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afibrosis 3agene expression 3amodels 3apathogenesis 3aphenotype 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3asignal transduction 3atransforming growth factors 0aInositol-requiring protein 1 – X-box-binding protein 1 pathway 0aEndoplasmic reticulum stress 0aEpithelial–mesenchymal transition 0aPulmonary fibrosis 0aSnail1 aZhou, Wen-Cheng1 aCui, Wen-Hui1 aLi, De-Lin1 aLi, Liu-Cheng1 aXu, Liang1 aZhao, Ping1 aGao, Jian0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2015 Aug., v. 65 p.230-238dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2015.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01335naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245008300165300001800248520036400266592002800630650001500658650002900673650002200702700001800724700002300742700005800765773013400823856007900957852000901036655001201045IND60743258620221119074620.0210707e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074325862DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c010312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Song-Ning10aCopper-Catalyzed Coupling of Amines with Carbazates: An Approach to Carbamates  ap. 9067-9075.  aA new approach for the preparation of carbamates via the copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction of amines with alkoxycarbonyl radicals generated from carbazates is described.

The protective effect of cryptotanshinone, a natural compound from Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, on UC was investigated both in vivo and in vitro models. UC model was established by dextran sulfate sodium administration in drinking water and cryptotanshinone was orally administrated. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without cryptotanshinone pretreatment. The body weights and disease activity index (DAI) were recorded. The pathological alterations were evaluated by H&E staining. The levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokines in colon tissues and cell culture medium were determined with enzyme‐linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The protein expression was detected by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results showed that cryptotanshinone significantly increased the body weight and colon length, reduced the score of DAI, and improved pathological changes. Furthermore, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase‐2, receptor‐interacting protein kinase 3, NF‐κB p65 and the secretion of tumor necrosis factor‐α, IL‐6 in colon tissues and LPS‐stimulated cells were significantly inhibited by cryptotanshinone. Besides, cryptotanshinone significantly inhibited LPS‐triggered toll‐like receptor 4 luciferase reporter activity with an IC₅₀ at 7.2 μM. In conclusion, cryptotanshinone ameliorated experimental UC possibly by inhibiting intestinal inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data  a81774200cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2019LK008cProjects within the budget of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine  a78/2016/A2cThe Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR  a175/2017/A3cThe Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aWestern blotting 3aassays 3abody weight 3acell culture 3acells 3acolon 3aculture media 3adextran sulfate 3adrinking water 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aincidence 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alength 3alipopolysaccharides 3aluciferase 3amice 3amodels 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aphytotherapy 3apretreatment 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aprotective effect 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein synthesis 3aresearch 3asecretion 3asorbents 3astaining 3atissues 3aulcerative colitis1 aZeng, Xi1 aZhao, Wenwen1 aHan, Zhiwu1 aWang, Ying1 aHan, Yantao1 aPei, Lixia1 aChen, Xiuping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2675-76450 tPhytotherapy research.g2020 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.2639-2648dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.66933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01208naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245020500169300001200374500002200386520007400408592002800482650001400510650001400524650001700538650001100555650001900566650001900585650001500604700002300619700003600642773010200678856008100780852000900861655001200870IND60584426820221119092339.0171109e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058442682DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-017-3246-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuapet, Pimchanok10aCorrection to: Photosynthetic activity and photoprotection in green and red leaves of the seagrasses, Halophila ovalis and Cymodocea rotundata: implications for the photoprotective role of anthocyanin  ap. 212.  aPublished Erratum  aCorrection to: Mar Biol (2017) 164:182 DOI 10.1007/s00227-017-3215-9.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymodocea 3aHalophila 3aanthocyanins 3aleaves 3aphotostability 3aphotosynthesis 3aseagrasses1 aMakkliang, Fonthip1 aThammakhet-Buranachai, Chongdee0 tMarine biology.g2017 Nov., v. 164, no. 11 p.212-212dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-017-3246-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02378naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245009700165300001300262520132300275592002801598650001501626650001801641650001101659650001101670650001501681650001401696650001601710650001701726700001501743700001801758700001801776700001901794773011001813856008401923852000902007655001202016IND4457012720221119033310.0141110e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445701272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2010.12.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJónsson, R.10aOestrus detection in dairy cows from activity and lying data using on-line individual models  ap. 6-15.  aAutomated monitoring and detection of oestrus in dairy cows is attractive for reasons of economy in dairy farming. While high performance detection has been shown possible using high-priced progesterone measurements, detection results were less reliable when only low-cost sensor data were available. Aiming at improving detection scheme reliability with the use of low-cost sensor data, this study combines information from step count and leg tilt sensors. Introducing a lying balance for the individual animal, a novel change detection scheme is derived from observed distributions of the step count data and the lying balance. Detection and hypothesis testing are based on generalised likelihood ratio optimisation combined with time-wise joint probability windowing based on the duration of oestrus and oestrus intervals. It is shown to be essential that cow-specific parameters and test statistics are derived on-line from data to cope with behaviours of individuals. Performance is validated on 18 sequences of data where definite proof of prior oestrus was available in form of subsequent pregnancy. These data were extracted from data sequences from 44 dairy cows over an 8 months period. The results show sensitivity 88.9% and error rate 5.9.%, which is very satisfactory when only cheap sensor data are used.  aPublisher supplied data 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3aestrus 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apregnancy 3aprobability 3aprogesterone1 aBlanke, M.1 aPoulsen, N.K.1 aCaponetti, F.1 aHøjsgaard, S.0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2011 Mar., v. 76, no. 1 p.6-15dElsevier B.V.x0168-16997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2010.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245019900169300001800368520105700386592002801443650002901471650001801500650001801518650001601536650002501552650002001577650001201597650002301609650001701632650001501649650001901664650001101683650002101694650001101715700002301726700002001749773012701769856008101896852000901977655001201986IND60486072020221119100046.0160218e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048607202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00253-015-7173-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnrean, Pornkamol10aSystematic optimization of fed-batch simultaneous saccharification and fermentation at high-solid loading based on enzymatic hydrolysis and dynamic metabolic modeling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 2459-2470.  aAn integrative simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) modeling is a useful guiding tool for rapid process optimization to meet the techno-economic requirement of industrial-scale lignocellulosic ethanol production. In this work, we have developed the SSF model composing of a metabolic network of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell associated with fermentation kinetics and enzyme hydrolysis model to quantitatively capture dynamic responses of yeast cell growth and fermentation during SSF. By using model-based design of feeding profiles for substrate and yeast cell in the fed-batch SSF process, an efficient ethanol production with high titer of up to 65 g/L and high yield of 85 % of theoretical yield was accomplished. The ethanol titer and productivity was increased by 47 and 41 %, correspondingly, in optimized fed-batch SSF as compared to batch process. The developed integrative SSF model is, therefore, considered as a promising approach for systematic design of economical and sustainable SSF bioprocessing of lignocellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abatch systems 3abioprocessing 3acell growth 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme kinetics 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3asaccharification 3ayeasts1 aKhajeeram, Sutamat1 aLaoteng, Kobkul0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2016 Mar., v. 100, no. 5 p.2459-2470dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-015-7173-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02913naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245012300166300001600289500002000305520185600325592002802181650002002209650001402229650002902243650001502272650001602287650000902303700002102312700002402333700002602357773011002383856007302493852000902566655001202575IND60587411020221122003621.0180102e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058741102DNAL7 a10.1002/zoo.213682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlligood, Christina A.10aApplying behavior‐analytic methodology to the science and practice of environmental enrichment in zoos and aquariums  ap. 175-185.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEnvironmental enrichment in zoos and aquariums is often evaluated at two overlapping levels: published research and day‐to‐day institutional record keeping. Several authors have discussed ongoing challenges with small sample sizes in between‐groups zoological research and have cautioned against the inappropriate use of inferential statistics (Shepherdson, , International Zoo Yearbook, 38, 118–124; Shepherdson, Lewis, Carlstead, Bauman, & Perrin, Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 147, 298–277; Swaisgood, , Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 102, 139–162; Swaisgood & Shepherdson, , Zoo Biology, 24, 499–518). Multi‐institutional studies are the typically‐prescribed solution, but these are expensive and difficult to carry out. Kuhar (Zoo Biology, 25, 339–352) provided a reminder that inferential statistics are only necessary when one wishes to draw general conclusions at the population level. Because welfare is assessed at the level of the individual animal, we argue that evaluations of enrichment efficacy are often instances in which inferential statistics may be neither necessary nor appropriate. In recent years, there have been calls for the application of behavior‐analytic techniques to zoo animal behavior management, including environmental enrichment (e.g., Bloomsmith, Marr, & Maple, , Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 102, 205–222; Tarou & Bashaw, , Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 102, 189–204). Single‐subject (also called single‐case, or small‐n) designs provide a means of designing evaluations of enrichment efficacy based on an individual's behavior. We discuss how these designs might apply to research and practice goals at zoos and aquariums, contrast them with standard practices in the field, and give examples of how each could be successfully applied in a zoo or aquarium setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal behavior 3aaquariums 3aenvironmental enrichment 3astatistics 3azoo animals 3azoos1 aDorey, Nicole R.1 aMehrkam, Lindsay R.1 aLeighty, Katherine A.0 tZoo biology.g2017 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.175-185dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34050x0733-31887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/zoo.213683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245006800161300001800229520148600247592002801733650001201761650003001773650001601803650002301819650001101842650002201853650002001875650001201895650001301907700006201920773013401982856007902116852000902195655001202204IND60743258720221119074626.0210707e20210614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074325872DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c010322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Li-Juan10aElectrostatic Switching of Stereoselectivity in Aldol Reactions  ap. 9076-9083.  aDensity functional theory (DFT) has been employed in predicting the enantioselectivity of the aldol reaction between acetone and p-nitrobenzaldehyde catalyzed by proline and its derivatives Me₂bdc-Pro (bdc = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and Me₂bpdc-Pro (bpdc = 4,4′-biphenyldicarboxylate). For each catalyst, our computationally predicted values at the M062X/6-31+G(d) level of theory with the SMD solvent model are in excellent agreement with experimental results reported in the literature. Electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (viz., SO₃–, NMe₂, SO₃H, and NMe₃⁺) were installed at the C4 position of the proline-based catalysts to study the impact of electrostatic effects on stereoselectivity. The electron-donating groups decrease and even invert the enantioselectivity, while the electron-withdrawing ones increase it. Enantiomeric excesses in the range of 49–71 and 59–68% are predicted for Me₂bdc-Pro and Me₂bpdc-Pro catalysts with the electron-withdrawing SO₃H and NMe₃⁺ installed respectively, values much higher than those of the corresponding unmodified catalysts. More interestingly, enantiomeric excesses decrease and, in the case of SO₃–, are even inverted in favor of the other enantiomer when the electron-donating groups are installed. These results highlight the importance of electrostatic effects, and polar effects more generally, in optimal organocatalyst design for stereoselective C–C bond-forming reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3adensity functional theory 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselectivity 3amodels 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganocatalysts 3aproline 3asolvents1 aCoote, Michelle L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0828-70530 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2021 June 14, v. 86, no. 13 p.9076-9083dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c010323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006900169300001800238520168000256592002801936650001401964650001301978650001801991650002002009650001502029650001702044650001802061650001302079653002702092653001702119653001302136653001802149653002302167653002102190653002002211700005702231700002202288700002102310700005802331773014402389856008602533852000902619655001202628IND60769580720220314000000.0220307e20220224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076958072DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c075822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkur, Aysu C.10aSuccinic Acid Based Particles as Carriers of Volatile Substances  ap. 2914-2920.  aVolatile substances are in high demand, especially in cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. To prolong their shelf-life and prevent their degradation if exposed to air, these volatile substances are often encapsulated. Most frequently, matrix materials are composed of high-molecular-weight polymers because some of them can efficiently retain volatiles and meet the safety requirements these applications impose. However, these substances must be processed at high concentrations, resulting in viscous solutions that are difficult to spray or emulsify. To address this shortcoming, we employed a low-molecular-weight substance, succinic acid, as a matrix material to encapsulate a model volatile, vanillin. To facilitate the encapsulation of low-molecular-weight substances, such as volatiles, we produce these particles through surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based microfluidic spray-drying. This technique forms drops with diameters as small as 1–10 μm that dry within a few hundred ms. Thereby, we can kinetically arrest or even suppress phase separations. We demonstrate that vanillin is most efficiently encapsulated and retained over a prolonged time if succinic acid is formulated from solutions initially containing succinic acid concentrations exceeding 10% of its saturation concentration. If appropriately formulated, these succinic acid based particles retain volatiles longer than the much more commonly employed high-molecular-weight dextrin. These results open up a new avenue to encapsulate volatiles in low-molecular-weight compounds that pack more densely than high-molecular-weight counterparts and therefore can retain volatiles for a prolonged time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3adextrins 3aencapsulation 3agreen chemistry 3ashelf life 3aspray drying 3asuccinic acid 3avanillin 0avolatile encapsulation 0aspray-drying 0acapsules 0amicrofluidics 0acontrolled release 0arelease kinetics 0acrystallization1 aErni, Philipp1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4241-08981 aOuali, Lahoussine1 aBenczedi, Daniel1 aAmstad, Esther1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9491-10100 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 Feb. 24, v. 10, no. 9 p.2914-2920dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c075823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001900150245010500169300001600274520121200290592002801502650001101530650000901541650002001550650002701570650001201597650001901609650001201628650001001640650001501650650001301665650002501678650001101703650000901714650002401723650001101747650001501758651002201773700002001795773010101815856008601916961001302002852000902015655001202024IND4472230520221119033445.0141111e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447223052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitford, W.G.10aEffects of simulated storm sizes and nitrogen on three Chihuahuan Desert perennial herbs and a grass  ap. 861-864.  aEstablishment and growth of three perennial herbs and a small tussock grass were studied in an experiment that provided simulated rainfall of 6Â mmÂ weekâ»Â¹ or 25Â mm once per month and nitrogen fertilization in combination with the different simulated rainfall regimes.

In this work, the hydrophobic mechanism of 3-hexyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione (HATT) on chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) was first investigated by in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle and flotation tests. In situ AFM imaging elucidated that HATT might aggregate on chalcopyrite surface to form self-assembled monolayers. In situ SECM images confirmed the weakened tip current of chalcopyrite region after HATT adsorption. On the self-assembly layers, HATT bound overwhelmingly with copper atoms to form a five-membered-ring Cu(I)-HATT surface complex, accompanying with the reduction of cupric to cuprous. HATT anchored on chalcopyrite surfaces through its exocyclic S and N atoms of 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione group and left its hexyl group towards aqueous solutions, resulting in an enhanced surface hydrophobicity to improve the flotation recovery of copper minerals. This fundamental understanding inspired by in situ approaches will promote the innovation and development of novel flotation surfactants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic force microscopy 3acontact angle 3acopper 3aelectrochemistry 3aengineering 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3amass spectrometry 3aminerals 3asurfactants 0a3-Hexyl-4-amino-1,2,4-triazole-5-thione 0aSelf-assembly 0aChalcopyrite 0ain situ AFM 0ain situ SECM 0aToF-SIMS 0aXPS1 aXiao, Jingjing1 aLiu, Jun1 aQu, Xiaoyan1 aLiu, Qin1 aZeng, Hongbo1 aYang, Xianglin1 aXie, Lei1 aZhong, Hong1 aLiu, Qingxia1 aXu, Zhenghe0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Dec. 20, v. 511 p.285-293dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.10.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011100169300001600280520106200296592002801358650001301386650002301399650001501422650001201437650001501449650001501464650001501479650002201494650001401516650000901530650001101539650002301550650001801573650001201591650001601603650001801619651001101637653001601648653002501664653002001689653001201709653001101721700002301732773012001755856008501875852000901960655001201969IND60535478020221119203651.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053547802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapafotiou, E.10aEcological Rainwater Management in Urban Areas. Preliminary Considerations for the City of Corinth, Greece  ap. 383-391.  aEcological rainwater management methods in urban areas can contribute to: 1) reduction of total rain water runoff and of its peak, 2) storage of rainwater, in order to cover low quality water demand, such as park irrigation, 3) local aquifer replenishment, 4) reduction of property damage and activity disruption, which is due to insufficient sewer networks, 5) improvement of rain runoff quality through pollutant retention, filtration, decomposition, plant uptake, etc. 6) mitigation of pollution of runoff receiving water bodies and 7) upgrading of urban and suburban landscape. In this paper emphasis is placed on rain gardens. Their main features are outlined, criteria for selection of construction sites (such as rain water collection efficiency, landscape improvement and cost) are discussed and certain suitable public or municipal sites in the city of Corinth, Greece, are briefly described. Examples include a degraded street area, a traffic island, a school area, preexisting flower beds, a suburban railway station and abandoned railway tracks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abioretention areas 3afiltration 3aflowers 3airrigation 3alandscapes 3apollutants 3apollution control 3arailroads 3arain 3arunoff 3aselection criteria 3asurface water 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3awater quality 3aGreece 0arain garden 0asustainable drainage 0aurban landscape 0aCorinth 0aGreece1 aKatsifarakis, K.L.0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 4 p.383-391dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02297naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245006400177300001800241520099600259592002801255650001501283650001901298650000901317650001001326650001201336650002201348650001101370650001701381650001201398650001401410650001401424650001401438700002301452700002501475700002201500700002301522700002101545700002101566700002001587700002101607700002501628773008301653856008201736852000901818655001201827IND60092645820221117015944.0141103e20120831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009264582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenthilan, Pingkalai R.10aDrosophila Auditory Organ Genes and Genetic Hearing Defects  ap. 1042-1054.  aThe Drosophila auditory organ shares equivalent transduction mechanisms with vertebrate hair cells, and both are specified by atonal family genes. Using a whole-organ knockout strategy based on atonal, we have identified 274 Drosophila auditory organ genes. Only four of these genes had previously been associated with fly hearing, yet one in five of the genes that we identified has a human cognate that is implicated in hearing disorders. Mutant analysis of 42 genes shows that more than half of them contribute to auditory organ function, with phenotypes including hearing loss, auditory hypersusceptibility, and ringing ears. We not only discover ion channels and motors important for hearing, but also show that auditory stimulus processing involves chemoreceptor proteins as well as phototransducer components. Our findings demonstrate mechanosensory roles for ionotropic receptors and visual rhodopsins and indicate that different sensory modalities utilize common signaling cascades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3achemoreceptors 3aears 3agenes 3ahearing 3ahearing disorders 3ahumans 3aion channels 3amutants 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3arhodopsin1 aPiepenbrock, David1 aOvezmyradov, Guvanch1 aNadrowski, Björn1 aBechstedt, Susanne1 aPauls, Stephanie1 aWinkler, Margret1 aMöbius, Wiebke1 aHoward, Jonathon1 aGöpfert, Martin C.0 tCell.g2012 Aug. 31, v. 150, no. 5 p.1042-1054dElsevier Inc.x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.06.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04062naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245012000173300001800293520185200311592002802163650002002191650001702211650001702228650001502245650001502260650002202275650002202297650002002319650001002339650001302349650001902362650005202381650000902433650001402442650002002456650001802476650003002494650002302524650004802547650001702595650004202612650001602654650003502670650005802705650003402763650002202797650005502819650004002874650006102914650002902975650001703004650002803021700001703049700002303066700002103089700001803110700002303128700002303151773011503174856007803289852000903367655001203376IND4470012820221119035348.0120501e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447001282DNAL7 a222138132pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/err4352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKyndt, Tina10aTranscriptome analysis of rice mature root tissue and root tips in early development by massive parallel sequencing  ap. 2141-2157.  aDespite the major physiological dissimilarities between mature root regions and their tips, differences in their gene expression profiles remain largely unexplored. In this research, the transcriptome of rice (Oryza sativa L. subsp. japonica) mature root tissue and root tips was monitored using mRNA-Seq at two time points. Almost 50 million 76 bp reads were mapped onto the rice genome sequence, expression patterns for different tissues and time points were investigated, and at least 1106 novel transcriptionally active regions (nTARs) expressed in rice root tissue were detected. More than 30 000 genes were found to be expressed in rice roots, among which were 1761 root-enriched and 306 tip-enriched transcripts. Mature root tissue appears to respond more strongly to external stimuli than tips, showing a higher expression of, for instance, auxin-responsive and abscisic acid-responsive genes, as well as the phenylpropanoid pathway and photosynthesis upon light. The root tip-enriched transcripts are mainly involved in mitochondrial electron transport, organelle development, secondary metabolism, DNA replication and metabolism, translation, and cellular component organization. During root maturation, genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis and modification, response to oxidative stress, and secondary metabolism were activated. For some nTARs, a potential role in root development can be put forward based on homology to genes involved in CLAVATA signalling, cell cycle regulators, and hormone signalling. A subset of differentially expressed genes and novel transcripts was confirmed using (quantitative) reverse transcription-PCR. These results uncover previously unrecognized tissue-specific expression profiles and provide an interesting starting point to study the different regulation of transcribed regions of these tissues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA replication 3aOryza sativa 3abiosynthesis 3acell cycle 3acell walls 3aearly development 3aelectron transfer 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahormones 3aphotosynthesis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3aroot tips 3astress response 3atranscriptome 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Library 2aHigh-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing 2aHydroponics 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aMeristemxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aOrgan Specificity 2aOryzaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aTime Factors 2aTranscriptomexgenetics1 aDenil, Simon1 aHaegeman, Annelies1 aTrooskens, Geert1 aDe Meyer, Tim1 aVan Criekinge, Wim1 aGheysen, Godelieve0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2012 Mar., v. 63, no. 5 p.2141-2157dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/err4353Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02243naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012700164300001400291520090200305592002801207650003101235650001901266650001001285650001901295650001301314650001501327650001701342650002301359653001001382653000901392653001101401653000901412653003501421653004301456700001701499700001901516700001201535700001501547700001101562773013101573856008401704852000901788655001201797IND60605062020221119230903.0180720e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060506202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2015.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiong10aGata4, Tbx5 and Baf60c induce differentiation of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells into beating cardiomyocytes  ap. 30-36.  aThe adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) are extensively utilized in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and cell therapy. ADMSCs can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, and it has been shown that over-expression of a cocktail of factors can induce ectopic heart formation and program cardiogenesis in ESCs. However, which genes are responsible for differentiation of ADMSCs into beating cardiomyocyte-like cells remains unknown. In this study we have shown that the combination of Gata4, Tbx5 and Baf60c is sufficient for inducing ADMSCs to form cardiomyocytes. It also appears that, while Gata4 and Baf60c are key inducers of myocardial differentiation, Tbx5 is essential for the ability of cardiac cells to contract. These findings provide additional experimental references for myocardial tissue engineering in the emerging field of cell-based therapy of heart diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGATA transcription factors 3acardiomyocytes 3agenes 3aheart diseases 3amedicine 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atissue engineering 0aGata4 0aTbx5 0aBaf60c 0acTnT 0aCardiomyocytes differentiation 0aAdipose derived mesenchymal stem cells1 aGuo, Zhi-Kun1 aChang, Yu-Qiao1 aYu, Xia1 aLi, Ci-Xia1 aLi, He0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2015 Sept., v. 66 p.30-36dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2015.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245006100198300001200259500002000271520136400291592002801655596009301683650001701776650002001793650001101813650001101824650003501835700001901870700002001889700002301909700002201932773012501954856007402079852000902153655001202162IND60787655520221120213403.0220809e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078765552DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.1046242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFowler, Heather1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6012-669810aPet owners’ perceptions of veterinary safety practices  ap. 594.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVeterinary workers must care for their animal patients while simultaneously protecting their own health and safety. This process can be complicated by the presence and perception of pet owners who may not agree with a given tactic used to protect veterinary workers from injury. We conducted focus groups of pet owners in the Seattle area during November 2016 to gain a deeper understanding of their perceptions relating to veterinary worker safety practices. Focus group interviews were recorded and transcribed and study themes identified and summarised. Twenty pet owners participated in three focus groups. Study themes arising from the focus group discussions could be categorised into human, animal, behavioural and environmental domains as outlined in a One Health Occupational Safety and Health (OHOSH) model. Communication was a recurring study theme identified, suggesting that lacking or impaired veterinary personnel‐client communication plays a key role in the safe delivery of veterinary services and can negatively impact the use of safety practices among veterinary personnel. Our study suggests that it is important for veterinary personnel to communicate to clients the reasons for policies related to worker safety. Such communication can help engage the veterinary client in order to effectively avoid situations that precipitate injury.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences of the National Institutes of Health 3afocus groups 3ahuman resources 3ahumans 3amodels 3aoccupational health and safety1 aIrimia, Bianca1 aRamirez, Vickie1 aMeischke, Hendrika1 aRabinowitz, Peter0 tVeterinary record.g2018 Nov., v. 183, no. 19 p.594-594dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.1046243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245016900168300001600337520153000353592002801883650001001911650002101921650001501942650001601957650001201973650002601985650002102011650003302032650002002065650002002085653002402105653002002129653003002149653003302179653002302212700001802235700001802253700002002271773010602291856008702397852000902484655001202493IND60557277820221122101115.0180830e20161220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055727782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.10.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Junxia10aFouling behaviors correlating to water characteristics during the ultrafiltration of micro-polluted water with and without the addition of powdered activated carbon  ap. 320-328.  aThe aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of powdered activated carbon (PAC) pretreatment on the fouling behavior of an ultrafiltration (UF) membrane during micro-polluted water treatment. The results of this study demonstrated that PAC had a positive influence on fouling mitigation. Specifically, PAC-pretreated water had lower fouling resistances (FRs) and fouling indexes (FIs) than raw water. Liquid chromatography combined with peak-fitting analyses of raw water with and without PAC pretreatment suggested that PAC adsorption was much effective in reducing the contents of the low molecular weight acids and building blocks (LMWA&BB) and the humic substance (HS) fractions in raw water. Principal component analysis (PCA) was also used to identify the fouling behaviors associated with the characteristics of the water samples. Significant correlations (r²) of LMWA&BB with hydraulic reversible resistance (Rre), hydraulic irreversible resistance (Rir), total fouling index (TFI) and the hydraulically irreversible index (HIFI) were found (0.7534, 0.8430, 0.6297 and 0.7015, respectively), indicating that LMWA&BB contributed more significantly than biopolymers(BP) and HS to membrane fouling. The likely mechanism by which the PAC alleviated fouling was the reduction of the LMWA&BB fraction’s presence at the membrane surface and pores. These results suggest that the application of the PAC pretreatment preceding passage through the UF membrane is a promising approach for membrane fouling mitigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3abiopolymers 3afouling 3aliquid chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aprincipal component analysis 3aultrafiltration 3awater treatment 0aFouling resistances 0aFouling indexes 0aPowdered activated carbon 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aFouling mitigation1 aWang, Zhihong1 aDong, Bingzhi1 aZhao, Dongsheng0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Dec. 20, v. 511 p.320-328dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.10.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002400163245011600187300001600303520146000319592002801779650002101807650002701828650002401855650002601879650002001905650001801925650000901943650002001952650001601972650001901988650001902007650002302026650001702049650003102066650002202097650001302119650007002132650003202202651002102234700001902255700002002274773008902294856008002383852000902463655001202472IND4468988420221121023530.0141111e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446898842DNAL7 a223653502pmid7 a10.1016/j.fm.2011.12.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKovačević, Jovana10aOccurrence and characterization of Listeria spp. in ready-to-eat retail foods from Vancouver, British Columbia  ap. 372-378.  aThe occurrence of Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in retail RTE meat and fish products in Vancouver, British Columbia (B.C.) was investigated. To assess potential consumer health risk, recovered L. monocytogenes isolates were subjected to genotypic and phenotypic characterization. Conventional methods were used to recover Listeria spp. from deli meat (n = 40) and fish (n = 40) samples collected from 17 stores. Listeria spp. were recovered only from fish samples (20%); 5% harboured Listeria innocua, 5% had L. monocytogenes and 10% contained Listeria welshimeri. L. monocytogenes isolates serotyped as 1/2a and 1/2b, possessed dissimilar PFGE patterns, and had full-length InlA. Three 1/2a clonal isolates encoded the 50 kb genomic island, LGI1. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling showed all Listeria spp. possessed resistance to cefoxitin and nalidixic acid. L. monocytogenes were resistant to clindamycin, two were resistant to streptomycin, and one to amikacin. Reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin was seen in all L. monocytogenes, L. innocua and three L. welshimeri isolates. Reduced susceptibility to amikacin and chloramphenicol was also observed in one L. monocytogenes and three L. welshimeri isolates, respectively. Recovery of L. monocytogenes in fish samples possessing AMR, full-length InlA, LGI1, and serotypes frequently associated with listeriosis suggest B.C. consumers are exposed to high-risk strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria innocua 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aListeria welshimeri 3aantibiotic resistance 3achloramphenicol 3aciprofloxacin 3afish 3agenomic islands 3alisteriosis 3aluncheon meats 3analidixic acid 3aready-to-eat foods 3astreptomycin 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aFood Microbiology 2aGenotype 2aListeriaxclassificationxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 3aBritish Columbia1 aMesak, Lili R.1 aAllen, Kevin J.0 tFood microbiology.g2012 June, v. 30, no. 2 p.372-378dElsevier Ltdx0740-00207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2011.12.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245011700171300001600288520106500304592002801369650001601397650002401413650001301437650002301450650001201473650001601485650001901501650001301520650001401533653002201547653001001569653002501579653001401604653001801618653002301636700001401659700001801673700001801691700001901709700001901728700001501747773010601762856008701868852000901955655001201964IND60557277920221122101053.0180830e20170105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055727792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Caizhen14aThe effect of acrylamides copolymers on the stability and rheological properties of yellow iron oxide dispersion  ap. 136-145.  aIt is still a challenge to disperse yellow iron oxides in organic media due to their susceptible aggregation, which limits their application in ceramic material area. In order to achieve colloidal stabilization in organic liquid, yellow iron oxides were dispersed in ethanol with p[methyl methacrylate-r-butyl methacrylate-r-N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) methacrylamide] random copolymers (PMBAs) based on amino groups as anchoring groups and alkyl as solvent chains by reversible-addition fragmentation chain-transfer radical (RAFT) polymerization. The effect of PMBAs on viscosity, rheological properties and dispersion stability was investigated.In the presence of PMBAs, yellow iron oxide dispersion performed excellent colloidal stability and low viscosity with high solid loadings. Furthermore, it is suggested that PMBAs have outstanding dispersion ability, retarding yellow iron oxides aggregating and keeping it stable for more than 60days at ambient temperature. This study reveals that PMBAs might find promising application in material dispersion area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aambient temperature 3aceramics 3acomposite polymers 3aethanol 3airon oxides 3apolymerization 3asolvents 3aviscosity 0aYellow iron oxide 0aPMBAs 0aRheological property 0aStability 0aLow viscosity 0aDispersion ability1 aWang, Bin1 aChen, Jianjun1 aHuang, Yuewen1 aFang, Tianyong1 aWang, Yingying1 aLiao, Bing0 tColloids and surfaces.g2017 Jan. 05, v. 513 p.136-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.10.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001700138245009700155300001800252500001400270500002000284520126900304592002801573596005401601596010101655596005401756596005901810596006201869596006201931650001401993650001502007650003402022650002802056650001402084650001402098650001502112650001602127650001002143650001302153650001302166650002102179650001302200650001702213650002802230650001302258700001702271700001302288700001702301700005602318700001402374773012502388856007202513852000902585655001202594IND60714414720221119012821.0201024e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071441472DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.67192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Chunyang10aNatural product corynoline suppresses melanoma cell growth through inducing oxidative stress  ap. 2766-2777.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNatural product corynoline is a unique isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from traditional Chinese medicine Corydalis bungeana Turcz, whereas its anticancer properties have not been investigated. In this study, we found that corynoline potently impairs the growth of melanoma cells, B16F10, and A375 in a concentration‐dependent manner. Treatment of melanoma cells with corynoline results in G2 cell arrest accompanied by reduced cdc2 activation. Furthermore, corynoline triggers apoptosis of melanoma cells, which is associated with increased expression of Bax and cleaved caspase‐3. Mechanistic study indicates that corynoline strongly induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent DNA damage as evidenced by γ‐H2AX accumulation. Notably, the effect of corynoline on melanoma cell cycle and apoptosis is abolished by a ROS scavenger N‐acetyl cysteine (NAC), indicating a ROS‐dependent mechanism. Finally, corynoline significantly inhibits in vivo B16F10 melanoma tumor growth accompanied by reduced expression of Ki‐67 in tumor tissue. Taken together, our data suggest that corynoline suppresses melanoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo by inducing oxidative stress and represents a potential therapeutic agent for melanoma patients.  aPublisher supplied data  a011cECNU Multifunctional Platform for Innovation  a2017‐01‐07‐00‐05‐E00011cInnovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission  a2018YFA0507001cNational Key R&D Program of China  a81972828cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a18431900500cShanghai Committee of Science and Technology  a19ZR1473500cShanghai Committee of Science and Technology 3aCorydalis 3aDNA damage 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aantineoplastic activity 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3acells 3acysteine 3amelanoma 3aoxidative stress 3apatients 3aphytotherapy 3areactive oxygen species 3aresearch1 aLi, Xiaolong1 aChen, Si1 aLiu, Mingyao1 aLu, Weiqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1349-65971 aYe, Xiyun0 tPhytotherapy research.g2020 Oct., v. 34, no. 10 p.2766-2777dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl47440x0951-418X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.67193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011000172300001600282520097600298592002801274650002001302650001101322650001901333650001001352650000801362650001101370651001101381653002901392653001801421653002101439653001201460700001701472700002301489773012001512856008501632852000901717655001201726IND60535478320221119203024.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053547832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMilanovic, Mladen10aAnalysis of Extreme Climatic Indices in the Area of Nis and Belgrade for the Period between 1974 and 2003  ap. 408-415.  aExtreme climatic events are the most important elements of climate changes, which directly affect the nature and society. In the recent years, the plethora of extreme climatic indices have been developed for the different parameters, in order to analyze and monitor the extreme climate changes. This paper presents the analysis of maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax, Tmin) and precipitation using the eight extreme climatic indices in the city of Nis and Belgrade (Serbia) for the period 1974-2003. The selected indices are: frost days (FD), summer days (SU), ice days (ID), max TX (TXx), max TN (TNx), max 1-day precipitation (Rx1day), consecutive dry days (CDD) and consecutive wet days (CWD). The results show that there are no significant changes in the FD and ID indices, and there are also no changes in the indices CDD and CWD in Nis. The SU, Rx1day, TXx and TNx were increased in each of the observed cities. CDD and CWD were slight decreased in Belgrade.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3acities 3aclimate change 3afrost 3aice 3asummer 3aSerbia 0aExtreme climatic indices 0aprecipitation 0aair temperatures 0aSerbia.1 aGocic, Milan1 aTrajkovic, Slavisa0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 4 p.408-415dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02586naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009100166300001200257520148900269592002801758650001901786650002201805650001401827650002301841650001901864650001301883650001201896650001201908650001601920650002301936651001501959700002301974700002301997773010202020856008102122852000902203655001202212IND60584427220221119092037.0171109e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058442722DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-017-3249-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrelkov, Petr10aTemporal change of the Baltic Sea–North Sea blue mussel hybrid zone over two decades  ap. 214.  aIn a temporal comparison over 18 years, we documented changes in the position and structure of the North European blue mussel hybrid zone in the Öresund strait, between Mytilus edulis of the marine Kattegat and Mytilus trossulus of the brackish Baltic Sea. In 1987 the midpoint of the 140-km wide multilocus allozyme cline in shallow-water populations was estimated to be located half-way along the strait. In 2005, it was shifted 25 km towards the Baltic end of the Öresund, and was located near the fixed link (bridge) that was built across the strait meanwhile in the 1990s. The cline also appeared to have become narrower and the extent of hybridity among individuals decreased. Factors that theoretically can control the position and shape of a clinal hybrid zone involve environmental gradients between habitats that differentially favor the two hybridizing taxa, or barriers to geographical dispersal of the organism. We consider two alternative hypotheses to explain the movement of the mussel hybrid zone. (1) Environmental change related to climate warming: the more stenothermal M. trossulus was pushed out from the Öresund towards the cool Baltic by elevated temperatures. (2) Change of dispersal dynamics: the construction of the fixed link locally affected mussel dispersion which attracted the zone. We raise the question whether similar changes have taken place also in the other euryhaline taxa where genetic clines between Baltic vs. Kattegat populations occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3aMytilus trossulus 3aallozymes 3aeuryhaline species 3aglobal warming 3ahabitats 3ahybrids 3amussels 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3aBaltic Sea1 aKatolikova, Marina1 aVäinölä, Risto,0 tMarine biology.g2017 Nov., v. 164, no. 11 p.214-214dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-017-3249-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245020400155300001600359500002000375520167700395592002802072650002002100650001202120650002002132650002602152650002402178650001802202650001402220650001002234650001202244650002102256650001602277650001502293650001602308650001502324650001402339650002402353650001702377650002002394650002002414700002302434700001902457700001902476773011002495856007302605852000902678655001202687IND60587411720221122025320.0180102e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058741172DNAL7 a10.1002/zoo.213582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCurry, Erin10aIntegrating trans‐abdominal ultrasonography with fecal steroid metabolite monitoring to accurately diagnose pregnancy and predict the timing of parturition in the red panda (Ailurus fulgens styani)  ap. 193-200.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRed pandas (Ailurus fulgens styani) exhibit a variable gestation length and may experience a pseudopregnancy indistinguishable from true pregnancy; therefore, it is not possible to deduce an individual's true pregnancy status and parturition date based on breeding dates or fecal progesterone excretion patterns alone. The goal of this study was to evaluate the use of transabdominal ultrasonography for pregnancy diagnosis in red pandas. Two to three females were monitored over 4 consecutive years, generating a total of seven profiles (four pregnancies, two pseudopregnancies, and one lost pregnancy). Fecal samples were collected and assayed for progesterone (P4) and estrogen conjugate (EC) to characterize patterns associated with breeding activity and parturition events. Animals were trained for voluntary transabdominal ultrasound and examinations were performed weekly. Breeding behaviors and fecal EC data suggest that the estrus cycle of this species is 11–12 days in length. Fecal steroid metabolite analyses also revealed that neither P4 nor EC concentrations were suitable indicators of pregnancy in this species; however, a secondary increase in P4 occurred 69–71 days prior to parturition in all pregnant females, presumably coinciding with embryo implantation. Using ultrasonography, embryos were detected as early as 62 days post‐breeding/50 days pre‐partum and serial measurements of uterine lumen diameter were documented throughout four pregnancies. Advances in reproductive diagnostics, such as the implementation of ultrasonography, may facilitate improved husbandry of pregnant females and allow for the accurate prediction of parturition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAilurus fulgens 3aanimals 3abreeding season 3adiagnostic techniques 3aembryo implantation 3aestrous cycle 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afemales 3agestation period 3ametabolites 3amonitoring 3aparturition 3aprediction 3apregnancy 3apregnancy diagnosis 3aprogesterone 3apseudopregnancy 3aultrasonography1 aBrowning, Lissa J.1 aReinhart, Paul1 aRoth, Terri L.0 tZoo biology.g2017 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.193-200dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl34050x0733-31887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/zoo.213583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04120naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245016600176300001400342520209800356592002802454650001402482650001002496650001102506650001302517650002002530650001402550650000902564650002302573650001002596650001402606650001302620650002602633650001302659650001902672650001602691650003302707650001502740650001402755650002002769650001102789650001502800651001102815653002802826653002602854653001702880653001402897653001302911653002302924700003402947700003802981700002003019700002703039700002503066700001803091700002803109700003103137700003403168700002903202700002403231773008503255856008503340852000903425655001203434IND60625528520221119223110.0210105e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062552852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2018.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahoo, Prafulla Kumar10aStatistical analysis of lake sediment geochemical data for understanding surface geological factors and processes: An example from Amazonian upland lakes, Brazil  ap. 47-62.  aStatistical evaluation applied to geochemical data of upland lake sediments and their catchment basins rocks from Serra dos Carajás was used to identify geochemical signatures associated with underlying processes, sediment provenances, and source-sink relationship. The lakes are Violão, Amendoim and Três Irmãs - TI1, TI2 and TI3. A centred log-ratio transformation (clr) was used prior to multivariate analyses in order to eliminate closure issues in compositional data. Due to the similarity between δ¹⁵N values and organic sources (mainly from C3 plants), the three lakes were clustered together. Violão Lake receives largest organic contribution from autochthonous sources, such as siliceous sponge spicules and algae, except for it shallower portion (WNW extension), which is more similar to TI2, having low δ¹⁵N values that are similar to the isotopic signature of upland swamps. The upper continental crust (UCC) normalization pattern shows that sediments are mainly enriched in Fe, P and Se, which is closely related to the catchment lithology. The distribution of elements in TI2 is significantly different from the other lakes, because it is dominated by organic carbon, while the other lakes are a mix of detritus and organic carbon. Factor Analysis (FA) using clr-transformed data distinguishes several geochemical assemblages in the sediments, with the major detritic groups being similar to catchment basin laterites: the Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Y-HREEs group corresponds to resistant minerals which remained stable during lateritization; the LREEs group reflects mobilization and reprecipitation by REE bearing minerals; and the Al-V-Cr-Sc association reflects metavolcanic rock. The Fe-P-Mo-As-Zn cluster in the sediments is attributed to Fe-oxyhydroxide precipitation, while TOC-SO₃-Hg-Se group is controlled by organic matter. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further indicates that detritic lake sediments are not directly derived from the parent rocks, but from weathered crusts, mainly ferruginous laterites and soils, which is consistent with their elements ratios.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC3 plants 3aalgae 3abasins 3adetritus 3afactor analysis 3ahighlands 3airon 3airon oxyhydroxides 3alakes 3alaterites 3aminerals 3amultivariate analysis 3anitrogen 3aorganic carbon 3aparent rock 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprovenance 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3aswamps 3awatersheds 3aBrazil 0aMultivariate statistics 0aGeochemical processes 0aUpland lakes 0aSediments 0aAmazonia 0aSerra dos Carajás1 aGuimarães, José Tasso Felix1 aSouza-Filho, Pedro Walfir Martins1 aPowell, Mike A.1 ada Silva, Marcio Sousa1 aMoraes, Aline Mamede1 aAlves, Ronnie1 aLeite, Alessandro Sabá1 aJúnior, Wilson Nascimento1 aRodrigues, Tarcísio Magevski1 aCosta, Vladimir Eliodoro1 aDall'Agnol, Roberto0 tCatena.g2019 Apr., v. 175 p.47-62dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245011600167300001800283520205500301592002802356650004402384650002202428650001402450650002202464650002002486650002002506650002102526650001902547650001702566650001302583650002402596650003202620653002702652653003402679653002702713653002902740653001602769700001402785700001402799700001702813700005602830773014402886856008603030852000903116655001203125IND60769581520221120022752.0220307e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076958152DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c080922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Mengfan10aConfined Crystallization in the Self-Assembled Nanostructures of Cellulose Nanocrystals and Polyethylene Glycol  ap. 3007-3015.  aThin layers of semicrystallized polymers covered on nanoparticles significantly influence the multiple properties of their nanocomposites because of the confined crystallization of polymers. Cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) nanorods have a hydroxy-rich surface that favors the hydrogen-bonding interaction with polymers and a twisted nanostructure, which can construct a chiral nematic liquid-crystal phase scaffold for the filling of polymers. All these make CNCs’ self-assembled nanostructure a unique confined condition for polymers. Understanding the crystallization of polymers in the coassembled CNC/polymer composites presents a challenge in this regard. In this study, we focus on the confinement crystallization in the coassembled composites of CNCs and poly(ethylene glycol)(PEG). The composition-dependent changes in composite morphology and crystallization have been extensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, synchrotronic powder X-ray diffraction, synchrotronic grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. At low PEG content (10 wt.%), strong confinement has been identified, showing an extremely low crystallinity with tiny PEG crystallites. As the PEG reached 30 wt.%, the PEG (120) plane with the flat-on orientation of the crystal lamella appeared. As the PEG content increased continuously (40 wt.% to 50 wt.%), the intensity of the (120) plane of the PEG crystal became larger, accompanied by an increasing flat-on orientation degree. When the PEG weight percentage was up to 60 wt.%, the crystals grew randomly, losing their preferential orientation. The free growth of PEG crystals also induced a significantly decreased orientation degree of CNCs. The CNC/PEG system presents a mutual influence from two components, which enriches our understanding of the coassembly and confined crystallization of polymer composites. It will benefit the further modulation of CNC-based nanocomposites, both in their structures and properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen bonding 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3ananorods 3apolyethylene glycol 3awide-angle X-ray scattering 0acellulose nanocrystals 0aself-assembled nanostructures 0apolymer nanocomposites 0aconfined crystallization 0aorientation1 aGu, Zehao1 aFeng, Kai1 aGao, Yunlong1 aJin, Zhaoxia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6108-06360 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 Feb. 21, v. 10, no. 9 p.3007-3015dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c080923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245007500164300001400239520110000253592002801353653001901381653003401400653002601434653002201460653001401482653000901496653001301505653001301518653002101531773011901552856007701671852000901748655001201757IND60130049720221117233547.0151126e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013004972DNAL7 a10.3356/JRR-09-44.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimmons, Robert E.14aThe Nest, Eggs, and Diet of the Papuan Harrier from Eastern New Guinea  ap. 12-18.  aThe Papuan Harrier (Circus spilonotus spilothorax), currently classified as a subspecies of the Eastern Marsh-Harrier (C. spilonotus), is endemic to the island of New Guinea and may be in need of conservation attention because of threats from grassland burning. I here detail the discovery of the first known nests in lowland Papua New Guinea and provide egg dimensions and prey data. Both nests were initiated in early April, in damp rank grassland, and contained three small chicks in mid-May. The only egg measurements, combined with one previously published record, suggest large egg volume and concomitant large female body size (estimated to be ca. 890 g). At this size, this may be the world's largest harrier. Fire destroyed both nests within 5 wk of their discovery. An atypically slow foraging style and a preponderance of game birds and large rats (Rattus spp.) in the pellets and prey remains are consistent with large body size. Further studies of the bird's ecology and breeding are needed for a comprehensive understanding of its conservation status and threats to its population.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPapuan Harrier 0aCircus spilonotus spilothorax 0aEastern Marsh-Harrier 0aCircus spilonotus 0abody size 0adiet 0aegg size 0aforaging 0aPapua New Guinea0 tJournal of raptor research.g2010 Mar., v. 44, no. 1 p.12-18dThe Raptor Research Foundation, Incx0892-10167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3356%2FJRR-09-44.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01658naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009700168300001600265520071300281592002800994650002101022650001401043650001001057650001601067650001201083650001801095650001201113700002101125773010801146856008101254852000901335655001201344IND60584427720221119091926.0171024e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058442772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-017-0736-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUsami, Toshiyuki10aPathogenicity of Plectosphaerella species on lettuce and susceptibility of lettuce cultivars  ap. 366-372.  aPlectosphaerella rot affects hydroponically grown lettuce, especially those grown using deep flow technique. Plectosphaerella species such as P. pauciseptata and P. cucumerina are reported as causal agents of this disease. However, the relation between fungal lineage and pathogenicity on lettuce has been unclear. From inoculation tests, we discovered that various lineages of Plectosphaerella can infect lettuce tissues. Even strains isolated from non-lettuce plants were pathogenic on lettuce. Furthermore, various lettuce cultivars were equally susceptible to a particular strain. These results indicate that strains from a wide lineage of Plectosphaerella can be pathogenic on various lettuce cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlectosphaerella 3acultivars 3afungi 3ahydroponics 3alettuce 3apathogenicity 3atissues1 aKatagiri, Haruna0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2017 Nov., v. 83, no. 6 p.366-372dSpringer Japanx1345-26307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-017-0736-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02232naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245018300166300001400349520062400363592002800987650002501015650002101040650001201061650001001073650001201083650001101095650001401106650002301120653001501143653002101158653002501179653001501204653002101219653002201240700002201262700001601284700001701300700001801317700006101335700001601396700001801412700001801430700002001448700001801468700002101486773011601507856008201623852000901705655001201714IND60597121920221122022445.0190613e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059712192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jip.2018.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZúbrik, Milan10aPhytophagous larvae occurring in Central and Southeastern European oak forests as a potential host of Entomophaga maimaiga (Entomophthorales: Entomophthoraceae) – A field study  ap. 52-54.  aWe evaluated the presence and impact of Entomophaga maimaiga on both target and non-target phytophagous larvae.

Here, graph theory-based approaches were applied to the headpiece of integrins, adhesion cell-surface receptors that transmit signals across the plasma membranes.Protein Structure Network (PSN) analysis incorporating dynamic information either from molecular dynamics simulations or from Elastic Network Models was applied to the β3 domains from integrins αVβ3 and αIIbβ3 in their apo and ligand-bound states.Closed and open states of the β headpiece are characterized by distinct allosteric communication pathways involving highly conserved amino acids at the two different α/β interfaces in the βI domain, the closed state being prompted to the closed-to-open transition. In the closed state, pure antagonism is associated with the establishment of communication pathways that start from the ligand, pass through the β1/α3,α4 interface, and end up in the hybrid domain by involving the Y110-Q82 link, which is weakened in the agonist-bound states.Allosteric communication in integrins relies on highly conserved and functionally relevant amino acid residues. The αβα-sandwich architecture of integrin βI domain dictates the structural communication between ligand binding site and hybrid domain. Differently from agonists, pure antagonists are directly involved in allosteric communication pathways and exert long-distance strengthening of the βI/hybrid interface. Release of the structure network in the ligand binding site is associated with the close-to-open transition accompanying the activation process.The study strengthens the power of graph-based analyses to decipher allosteric communication intrinsic to protein folds and modified by functionally different ligands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aagonists 3aamino acids 3aantagonism 3aantagonists 3abinding sites 3aintegrins 3aligands 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3areceptors 0aProtein Structure Network analysis 0aElastic Network Model 0aMolecular modeling 0aStructural communication1 aGhitti, Michela1 aMusco, Giovanna1 aFanelli, Francesca0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 Sept., v. 1861, no. 9 p.2367-2381dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.05.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001800186245015700204300001600361506007600377520146400453592002801917506003701945650001101982650001501993650002002008650002102028650001902049650002402068650001202092650001702104650001302121650001502134650001402149650001702163650002102180650001302201650001702214650001602231650000902247650002202256650001002278650004402288650002302332650001902355650001102374650002202385650004802407650001102455650001402466650002502480650004202505650000902547650002102556650003002577650001502607650003202622650003302654651002502687700002202712700001302734700002502747700001902772700002202791700002202813700002002835773008002855856008102935852000903016655001203025IND4470978220221207055058.0141112e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447097822DNAL7 a223250352pmid7 aPMC33778232pmcid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2011.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Cindy N.10aCirculating selenium and carboxymethyl-lysine, an advanced glycation endproduct, are independent predictors of anemia in older community-dwelling adults  ap. 762-766.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To assess whether selenium and carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), two biomarkers of oxidative stress, are independent predictors of anemia in older community-dwelling adults. METHODS: Plasma levels of selenium, CML, folate, vitamin B12, and testosterone and markers of iron status and inflammation were measured at baseline in 1036 adults at least 65 y old in the Invecchiare in Chianti Study, a population-based cohort study of aging in Tuscany, Italy, and examined in relation to prevalent anemia and incident anemia over 6 y of follow-up. RESULTS: At enrollment, 11.6% of participants were anemic. Of 472 participants who were non-anemic at enrollment, 72 (15.3%) developed anemia within 6 y of follow-up. At enrollment, plasma CML in the highest quartile (>425 ng/mL) and plasma selenium in the lowest quartile (<66.6 μg/L) predicted incident anemia (hazard ratio 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.07–2.59, P = 0.02; hazard ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.01–2.38, P = 0.05, respectively) in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model that adjusted for age, education, body mass index, cognition, inflammation, red blood cell distribution width, ferritin, vitamin B12, testosterone, and chronic diseases. CONCLUSION: Elevated plasma CML and low plasma selenium are long-term independent predictors of anemia in older community-dwelling adults. These findings support the idea that oxidative stress contributes to the development of anemia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanemia 3abiomarkers 3abody mass index 3achronic diseases 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3aelderly 3aerythrocytes 3aferritin 3afolic acid 3aglycation 3ainflammation 3aoxidative stress 3aselenium 3atestosterone 3avitamin B12 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAging 2aAnemiaxbloodxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCohort Studies 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGlycosylation End Products, Advancedxblood 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aLysinexanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aMale 2aOxidative Stress 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPrevalence 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aSeleniumxbloodxdeficiency. 0aItalyxepidemiology.1 aSemba, Richard D.1 aSun, Kai1 aBandinelli, Stefania1 aVaradhan, Ravi1 aPatel, Kushang V.1 aGuralnik, Jack M.1 aFerrucci, Luigi0 tNutrition.g2012 , v. 28, no. 7-8 p.762-766dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2011.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012000187300001500307520109700322592002801419650001301447650003101460650002201491650000901513650001501522650000901537650001201546650002001558650001901578650001901597650002101616650001801637650001801655650001801673650000901691650001301700650001701713650002501730650003201755650002601787650001201813650004601825650003101871650003201902650005601934650004101990650002802031650002802059650000902087650000902096650001702105650003602122650001802158650001202176700001902188700002002207700002002227700002102247700002002268700001902288773011102307856008102418852000902499655001202508IND50059294920221119034932.0141111e20121031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005929492DNAL7 a229644692pmid7 a10.1016/j.jep.2012.08.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSung, Yoon-Young10aInhibitory effects of Drynaria fortunei extract on house dust mite antigen-induced atopic dermatitis in NC/Nga mice  ap. 94-100.  aETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Drynaria fortunei (Kunze) J. Sm has been widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of inflammation, hyperlipidemia, arteriosclerosis, rheumatism, and bone healing. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of a 70% ethanol extract of Drynaria fortunei (DFE). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of topically applied DFE on house dust mite Dermatophargoides farinae-induced atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. RESULTS: Treatment of NC/Nga mice with DFE reduced the dermatitis score, ear thickness, and serum levels of IgE, IgG1, and IL-6. Histopathological analyses of ear and skin lesions showed inhibition of the thickening of the epidermis and reduced epidermal/dermal infiltration of inflammatory cells. In ear lesions, mRNA expression levels of IL-4, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α were reduced by DFE treatment. CONCLUSIONS: DFE inhibited the development of dermatitis-like skin lesions in NC/Nga mice. These results suggest that DFE may be a therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrynaria 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aatopic dermatitis 3adust 3adust mites 3aears 3aethanol 3agene expression 3ahistopathology 3ahyperlipidemia 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainterleukin-4 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anecrosis 3askin lesions 3atraditional medicine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAllergensximmunology 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aAntigens, Dermatophagoides 2aCytokinesxbloodxgenetics. 2aDermatitis, Atopicxbloodxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aDermatophagoides farinaeximmunology 2aImmunoglobulin Exblood 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aMale 2aMice 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxtherapeutic use 2aPolypodiaceae 2aRhizome1 aKim, Dong-Seon1 aYang, Won-Kyung1 aNho, Kyoung Jin1 aSeo, Hyeong Seok1 aKim, Young Sang1 aKim, Ho Kyoung0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2012 Oct. 31, v. 144, no. 1 p.94-100dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2012.08.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02695naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245008800207300001600295520132700311592002801638650001201666650001901678650001601697650002201713650001101735650002901746650000901775650001501784650001201799650001101811650002101822650001201843650001501855653001801870653001601888653002101904653002901925653001101954700002501965700002001990700003102010773009002041856008502131852000902216655001202225IND60625528920221119223055.0190325e20190201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062552892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.11.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandberg, Eli1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2371-516X10aEnergy system impacts of grid tariff structures for flexible power-to-district heat  ap. 772-781.  aFlexible use of electricity in district heating has a large potential to integrate an increasing share of renewable energy at a promising benefit-to-cost ratio. The structure of electricity grid tariffs may, however, be a barrier to large-scale implementation. This study analyses how different electricity grid tariff structures affect flexible use of electricity in future Nordic district heating. The energy market model Balmorel is applied for the analysis. The results show that the structure of grid tariffs significantly influence the use of electricity in district heating. Load demand tariffs based on maximum monthly load demand hamper flexible use of electricity in district heating. Going from a high energy charge with no load demand tariff structure to a low energy charge with time-of-use load demand tariff structure increases the power-to-heat share by 60%, increases the wind power generation by 4%, and reduces the CO2 emissions by 7%. A favourable tariff structure can thus encourage more investment in renewable power. This is, however, at the expense of investment in and use of combined heat and power. High electricity prices hamper extensive deployment of flexible electric boilers. With increasing electricity prices, the power-to-heat share will increasingly consist of less flexible heat pumps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboilers 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aelectricity costs 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aheat 3aheat pumps 3amarkets 3amodels 3apower generation 3atariffs 3awind power 0aPower-to-heat 0aFlexibility 0aDistrict heating 0aElectricity grid tariffs 0aNordic1 aKirkerud, Jon Gustav1 aTrømborg, Erik1 aBolkesjø, Torjus Folsland0 tEnergy.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 168 p.772-781dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.11.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03355naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010700174300001600281520184700297592002802144650001902172650000902191650002802200650002602228650001902254650001202273650001102285650001602296650001602312650001002328650002302338650001102361650001602372650002502388650001302413653002302426653001902449653003302468653002002501653003502521653002802556653001702584700001802601700001602619773012002635856008502755852000902840655001202849IND60535479020221119202914.0190416s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053547902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiopa-Tsakalidi, A.10aResponse of Zucchini to the Electrical Conductivity of the Nutrient Solution in Hydroponic Cultivation  ap. 459-462.  aThe effect of two levels of electrical conductivity (EC) at 2.2 dS/m-1 and 4.4 dS/m-1 in two nutrient solutions was studied in a hydroponic culture of zucchini Cucurbita pepo var. Abodanza, during the growing period in a heated glasshouse. The experimental premises consisted of 8 double sloping benches (10x 0.4 x 0.6 m), which were by two equipped for the collection of the runoff with a calibrated 100 L tank. The system of the water fertilization was fully automated and the hydroponic system was renewed every 1 hour daily. In order to study the impact of the EC over the hydroponic cultivation of zucchini, two interventions were conducted with a fully randomized design of 14 replicates. The environmental parameters controlled with sensors during the hydroponic cultivation had the following values: Temperature: (08:00) 19.6 oC, (14:00h) 27 oC. The assessment of the impact of the EC during the growing period in hydroponic cultivation was conducted every second day from the 33th day after the zucchinis were transplanted into the hydroponic system and until and until 68th day after transplanting.The weight of the fresh and dry fruit of the fruit's stalk did not statistically differ in the hydroponic sub-layer in any treatment. The mean value of the total soluble solid components of the fruits is significantly different in the two conductivity levels, that is in the conductivity of 2.2 dS/m-1 it was 5.19 0Brix and in 4.4 dS/m-1 it was 5.48 0Brix. The female flowers were fewer than the male flower. The number of male and female flowers of the zucchini in both conductivity levels was 7,52(male) and 4,01(female) in 2.2 dS/m and 7,50 (male) and 4,30 (female) in 4.4 dS/m EC, respectively. The length and the diameters of the zucchini fruits and of fruits stalk did not differ in the two the levels of electrical conductivity  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucurbita pepo 3abrix 3aelectrical conductivity 3aenvironmental factors 3afemale flowers 3afemales 3afruits 3agreenhouses 3ahydroponics 3amales 3anutrient solutions 3arunoff 3atemperature 3atotal soluble solids 3azucchini 0ahydroponic culture 0aCucurbita pepo 0aelectrical conductivity (EC) 0aweight of fruit 0atotal soluble solid components 0amale and female flowers 0afruits stalk1 aBarouchas, P.1 aSalahas, G.0 tAgriculture and Agricultural Science Procedia.g2015, v. 4 p.459-462dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23292x2210-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008000164300001600244520178400260592002802044650001902072650002202091650002302113650002002136650001202156650001502168650001502183650001602198650002002214650001002234650001202244650001002256650001902266650001202285650001502297650005202312650001302364650001902377650001602396651001302412653002002425653001502445653001702460653001802477653001002495653001902505653002302524700002202547700001802569700002202587700002102609700001902630700002102649700002102670773015402691856007602845852000902921655001202930IND60129030320221121051141.0151124e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012903032DNAL7 a10.2987/12-6318R.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLampman, Richard L.10aWest Nile Virus Infection Rates and Avian Serology in East-Central Illinois  ap. 108-122.  aUnderstanding the geographic role of different species of mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts in West Nile virus (WNV) transmission cycles can facilitate the development and implementation of targeted surveillance and control measures. This study examined the relationship between WNV-antibody rates in birds and mosquito infection rates and bloodfeeding patterns in east-central Illinois. The earliest detection of WNV-RNA by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction TaqMan was from Culex restuans; however, amplification typically coincided with an increase in abundance of Cx. pipiens. Trap type influenced annual estimates of infection rates in Culex species, as well as estimation of blood meal source. Bird species with the highest WNV-antibody rates (i.e., Mourning Doves [Zenaida macroura], Northern Cardinals [Cardinalis cardinalis], American Robins [Turdus migratorius], and House Sparrows [Passer domesticus]) were also the common species found in Culex blood meals. Although antibody rates were not directly proportional to estimated avian abundance, the apparent availability of mammal species did influence proportion of mammal to bird blood meals. Antibody prevalence in the American Robin was lower than expected based on the strong attraction of Culex to American Robins for blood meals. Age-related differences in serology were evident, antibody rates increased in older groups of robins and sparrows, whereas 1st-year hatch and older adults of Mourning Doves and Northern Cardinals had equally high rates of antibody-positive serum samples. The vector and host interactions observed in east-central Illinois (Champaign County), an urban area surrounded by agriculture, are compared to studies in the densely population areas of southern Cook County.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCulex restuans 3aPasser domesticus 3aTurdus migratorius 3aWest Nile virus 3aZenaida 3aantibodies 3ablood meal 3ablood serum 3acontrol methods 3adoves 3aelderly 3ahosts 3ainsect vectors 3amammals 3amonitoring 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserology 3aseroprevalence 3aurban areas 3aIllinois 0aWest Nile virus 0ablood meal 0aseropositive 0aantibody rate 0aCulex 0aAmerican Robin 0aTurdus migratorius1 aKrasavin, Nina M.1 aWard, Mike P.1 aBeveroth, Tara A.1 aLankau, Emily W.1 aAlto, Barry W.1 aMuturi, Ephantus1 aNovak, Robert J.0 tJournal of the American Mosquito Control Association.g2013 June, v. 29, no. 2 p.108-122dAmerican Mosquito Control Association, Incx8756-971X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2987%2F12-6318R.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245015000157300001200307500002000319520095800339592002801297650001101325650002801336650002401364700001501388700002601403700002101429773012501450856007401575852000901649655001201658IND60787656320221120213616.0220809e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078765632DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.1047422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdery, Elsa G10aComparison of standard single‐bite with multiple‐bite biopsy forceps for collection of gastrointestinal biopsies in dogs: a prospective study  ap. 624.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aVarious types of endoscopic biopsy forceps have been investigated in dogs. The Multibite (MB) are multiple‐bite forceps that collect up to four tissue specimens in a single pass through the endoscope, reducing procedure time. The authors prospectively investigated its clinical utility by comparing procedure times and diagnostic quality of samples obtained with the MB to that of biopsies performed with a single‐bite forceps (SB), in 21 dogs with gastrointestinal disorders. When comparing the depth, crush artefacts and diagnostic adequacy of the gastric and duodenal biopsies, there was no significant difference between the MB and SB forceps. The procedure time was significantly longer with the MB. There was no learning curve effect, and there were no reported adverse events. This study failed to demonstrate any significant clinical advantage associated with the use of the Multibite forceps over that of conventional disposable SB forceps.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopsy 3agastrointestinal system 3aprospective studies1 aScase, Tim1 aKisielewicz, Caroline1 aDhumeaux, Marc P0 tVeterinary record.g2018 Nov., v. 183, no. 20 p.624-624dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.1047423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001200138245017800150300001600328500001900344500002000363520137600383592002801759596005901787596005901846596007001905650002401975650001001999650004602009650002602055650001502081650001902096650001502115650000902130700001802139700005102157773012202208856007202330852000902402655001202411IND60714415420221119004848.0201024e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071441542DNAL7 a10.1002/pca.29372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Lin10aInvestigating distributions and changes of alkaloids in living Catharanthus roseus under low‐phosphorus stress using wooden‐tip electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry  ap. 739-746.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aINTRODUCTION: Vinca alkaloids are important sources for producing anticancer drugs from Catharanthus roseus. The phosphorus of soil is one of crucial factors for planting C. roseus. OBJECTIVES: We aim to develop an in vivo sampling technique coupled with direct mass spectrometry with wooden tip for investigating distributions and changes of alkaloids in flowers, leaves, stems, veins and roots of living C. roseus under low‐phosphorus stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Living C. roseus were prepared under low‐phosphorus stress (n = 10) and control conditions (n = 10). Wooden‐tip electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry and conventional liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry were applied to analyse living C. roseus and extracts of C. roseus, respectively. RESULTS: Distributions and changes of serpentine, vindoline, catharanthine, and anhydrovinblastine in living C. roseus under low‐phosphorus stress and control conditions were successfully obtained. CONCLUSION: Compared to control soil conditions, low‐phosphorus soil was found to induce C. roseus to generate more serpentine but less catharanthine and vindoline in leaves, veins, stems and roots, and to generate more anhydrovinblastine in flowers, leaves, stems and roots. Overall, our results showed a simple, rapid, and effective method for in vivo sampling and direct analysis of living plants.  aPublisher supplied data  a21804053cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41827804cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a21618341cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aCatharanthus roseus 3aVinca 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3aphosphorus 3aphytochemicals 3aserpentine 3asoil1 aYao, Ya‐Nan1 aHu, Bin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8294-15380 tPhytochemical analysis.g2020 Nov., v. 31, no. 6 p.739-746dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58272x0958-03447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.29373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01986naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245007500161300001600236520107700252592002801329653001101357653001201368653001201380653001401392653001401406653001201420653001201432700002101444773012101465856007701586852000901663655001201672IND60130050220221117233312.0151126e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013005022DNAL7 a10.3356/JRR-09-49.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgada, Darcy L.10aDecline of Raptors over a Three-Year Period in Laikipia, Central Kenya  ap. 129-135.  aRaptors were monitored monthly over a three-year period in a protected area in central Kenya. The number of raptors declined more than 40%% per year. Scavenging birds accounted for most of the decline; sightings decreased by 70%% during our surveys, although these declines were not statistically significant. During the time of the study, the overall populations of large wild herbivores showed little change, whereas domestic herbivores, particularly sheep and goats, increased markedly, suggesting that food limitation was not the cause of the vulture declines at the study site. Possible causes of raptor decline include the consumption of poisoned baits, which are placed by pastoralists to kill large predators that attack livestock. Scavenging birds provide one of the most important yet underappreciated ecosystem services of any avian group. The rapid decline of scavenging birds, especially vultures, in central Kenya warrants additional population monitoring to understand whether declines are local or regional, and to elucidate causes of population decreases.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAfrica 0adecline 0aFuradan 0alivestock 0apoisoning 0araptors 0avulture1 aKeesing, Felicia0 tJournal of raptor research.g2010 June, v. 44, no. 2 p.129-135dThe Raptor Research Foundation, Incx0892-10167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3356%2FJRR-09-49.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245016200178300001800340520169600358592002802054650001202082650002802094650001802122650002102140650002002161650002302181650002002204650002102224650001202245650001402257650002102271653002702292653003102319653003802350653002902388653002202417653002702439700002702466700005902493700006102552700006202613773014402675856008602819852000902905655001202914IND60769582120221120021636.0220307e20220221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076958212DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c086752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarooq, Muhammad Qamar10aCharacterizing the Solvation Characteristics of Deep Eutectic Solvents Composed of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients as a Hydrogen Bond Donor and/or Acceptor  ap. 3066-3078.  aThe formation of eutectic mixtures from active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) has emerged as an effective technique to develop liquid pharmaceutical formulations. API-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) enhance the water solubility of APIs and avoid their recrystallization. The physicochemical properties of API DESs can be easily modulated by judicious selection of a hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA) or hydrogen-bond donor (HBD) excipient that is mixed with the API. Solvation properties of API DESs can help in understanding the role of ionic and nonionic excipients toward the overall solvation interactions of these DESs. In this study, the solvation characteristics of three subclasses of API DESs containing API HBAs, API HBDs, or API HBAs and API HBDs are investigated. Inverse gas chromatography is employed to study solute–solvent interactions of a variety of probe molecules for 20 different API DESs. Among the API DESs composed of API HBAs and carboxylic acid- or diol-based HBDs, DESs containing diol-based HBDs exhibited stronger dipolar, hydrogen-bond basicity, and hydrogen-bond acidity interactions compared to carboxylic acid-based HBDs. No significant differences were observed in the solvation properties of DESs composed of API HBAs and API HBDs. API DESs composed of the choline chloride HBA and API HBDs exhibited stronger hydrogen-bond acidity and dipolarity and weaker dispersive-type interactions among the DESs evaluated in this study. An in-depth evaluation of solvation properties for these DESs is important to completely exploit their potential in separation science as well as the fields of biomaterial science, pharmaceutical chemistry, and biotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3abiocompatible materials 3abiotechnology 3acholine chloride 3acrystallization 3agas chromatography 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen bonding 3aliquids 3asolvation 3awater solubility 0asolvation interactions 0ainverse gas chromatography 0aactive pharmaceutical ingredients 0aliquid drug formulations 0aeutectic mixtures 0adeep eutectic solvents1 aAbbasi, Nabeel Mujtaba1 aSmith, Emily A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7438-78081 aPetrich, Jacob W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9527-68321 aAnderson, Jared L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6915-87520 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 Feb. 21, v. 10, no. 9 p.3066-3078dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c086753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245012300205300002000328506007600348520099700424592002801421506003701449650003201486650001201518650001201530650001401542650002001556650002001576650001601596653002201612653002301634653003701657653001101694653004601705700002501751773017501776856007901951852000902030655001202039IND60172301520221207060955.0150602e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017230152DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12028181092doi7 aPMC34796142pmcid7 a229914742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwapna, Immani10aInterplay between electrical activity and bone morphogenetic protein signaling regulates spinal neuron differentiation  ap. 16336-16341.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA gradient of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) along the dorsoventral axis of the spinal cord is necessary for the specification of dorsal neurons. Concurrently, a gradient of calcium-mediated electrical activity is present in the developing spinal cord but in an opposing ventrodorsal direction. Whether BMPs and electrical activity interact in embryonic spinal neurons remains unknown. We show that BMP decreases electrical activity by enhancing p38 MAPK-mediated negative modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels. In turn, electrical activity affects the phosphorylation status and nuclear level of activated Smads, the canonical components of BMP signaling. This interaction between calcium spike activity and BMP signaling regulates the specification of the dorsal commissural spinal neuron phenotype. The present study identifies an unexpected interplay between BMPs and electrical activity that is critical for decoding the morphogen gradient during spinal neuron differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abone morphogenetic proteins 3acalcium 3aneurons 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3asodium channels 3aspinal cord 0acalcium signaling 0aspinal interneuron 0amitogen-activated protein kinase 0anoggin 0aactivity-dependent neuronal specification1 aBorodinsky, Laura N.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 2, v. 109, no. 40 p.16336-16341dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12028181093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01474naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245010800156300002000264520042800284592002800712650001400740650002800754650001200782650001700794650002000811700001500831700001400846700001800860700001600878700002300894773013600917856007401053852000901127655001201136IND60661033620221122164029.0190827e20150716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066103362DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc04513d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlinger, M.10aUV photoexcitation of a dissolved metalloid Ge₉ cluster compound and its extensive ultrafast response  ap. 12278-12281.  aFemtosecond pump–probe absorption spectroscopy in tetrahydrofuran solution has been used to investigate the dynamics of a metalloid cluster compound {Ge₉[Si(SiMe₃)₃]₃}⁻1.

The snails were dissected after 1, 2 and 3weeks of infection to collect the hemolymph. The infection by A. cantonensis induced severe changes in the host snail’s metabolism, triggering physiological mechanisms to minimize the deleterious effects caused by the larvae. There was a significant decrease in the concentration of total proteins in the infected snails, which occurred gradually as the infection advanced. This change was accompanied by an increase in the concentrations of urea and a decrease in the levels of uric acid in the hemolymph, suggesting that in this model the infection induces proteolysis and inversion of the excretion pattern of the infected snails. Besides this, variations in the activities of the aminotransferases were observed, with significantly higher levels in the infected groups than in the control group. These results indicate an increase in the protein metabolism of the infected snails, since there was an increase in nitrogen catabolites such as urea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBiomphalaria glabrata 3aMetastrongylidae 3aParastrongylus cantonensis 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3aexcretion 3ahemolymph 3aintermediate hosts 3alarvae 3ametabolites 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aparasitology 3aprotein metabolism 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3asnails 3aurea 3auric acid1 aTunholi, Victor Menezes1 aPinheiro, Jairo1 aThiengo, Silvana Carvalho0 tExperimental parasitology.g2012 June, v. 131, no. 2 p.143-147dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2012.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007800165520161200243592002801855650002101883650001901904650001701923650001801940650001401958650002701972650001501999650001902014650002502033650001202058650001902070650001902089650002102108650001302129650001302142650002002155650002002175650002102195650001302216650003602229653001702265653001302282653002202295653001402317653001102331653000902342653000902351653000802360653001102368653000702379700001902386700001702405700001502422700001702437700001602454700001702470700001402487700001802501700001802519700001602537700001602553700005602569773009402625856008502719852000902804655001202813IND60656164920221122053634.0200210e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065616492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1530652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Peili10aArnicolide D exerts anti-melanoma effects and inhibits the NF-κB pathway  aMelanoma is a lethal cancer. NF-κB has been validated as a molecular target for melanoma treatment. Current therapies for melanoma have limitations. Novel targeted therapeutics are needed. Arnicolide D (Ar-D), a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the dried whole plant of Centipeda minima (L.) A. Br. et Aschers., has been reported to inhibit NF-κB activity in colorectal cancer cells.To investigate the anti-melanoma effects of Ar-D in vitro and in vivo; and to determine whether Ar-D inhibits the NF-κB pathway in melanoma cells.A B16F10 allograft mouse model and two melanoma cell lines (A375 and B16F10) were used to investigate the anti-melanoma effects of Ar-D in vivo and in vitro. Dacarbazine was used as a positive control. Cell viability was assessed by MTT and crystal violet staining assays. Cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Protein levels were determined by Immunoblotting.In vivo assays showed that the average tumor weight in Ar-D-treated group (4 mg/kg, i.p, 15 days) was reduced by 53.7%, when compared with the control group. In vitro studies demonstrated that Ar-D reduced cell viability, induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, elevated levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins p53 and p21, and lowered levels of G2/M checkpoint proteins Cdc2 and Cyclin B1 in melanoma cells. Mechanistically, Ar-D inhibited the activity of IKKα/β, the degradation of IκBα, and the phosphorylation and expression of NF-κB p65 in melanoma cells.Ar-D has anti-melanoma effects, and inhibition of the IKK/IκBα/NF-κB p65 pathway is involved in the effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCentipeda minima 3aIKappaB kinase 3aallografting 3aanimal models 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle checkpoints 3acell lines 3acell viability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acyclins 3aflow cytometry 3agentian violet 3ain vitro studies 3alactones 3amelanoma 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein content 3asesquiterpenoids 3astaining 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aArnicolide D 0aMelanoma 0aCell cycle arrest 0aApoptosis 0aNF-κB 0aAr-D 0aDTIC 0aIKK 0aNF-κB 0aPI1 aZheng, Zhongyu1 aFu, Xiuqiong1 aLi, Junkui1 aYin, Chengle1 aChou, Jiyao1 aWang, Yaping1 aLiu, Yuxi1 aChen, Yingjie1 aBai, Jingxuan1 aWu, Jiaying1 aChen, Sibao1 aYu, Zhi-Ling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2979-96080 tPhytomedicine.g2019 Nov., v. 64 p.153065-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2019.1530653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02139naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010600171300001800277500001900295520094200314592002801256650001901284650001801303650001401321650002001335650002001355650001301375650001501388650006201403650002601465653002701491653002401518773014001542856008601682852000901768655001201777IND60708565320221119022932.0200907e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070856532DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2020.17688232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKojima, Takaaki10aUltra-high-throughput analysis of functional biomolecules using in vitro selection and bioinformatics  ap. 1767-1774.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFunctional analysis of biomolecules, including nucleic acids and proteins, is important for understanding biological mechanisms in living cells such as gene expression and metabolism.

One of these systems, the Bead Display system, utilizes emulsion technology and is a powerful tool for rapidly screening functional nucleic acids or proteins in vitro. Furthermore, an analytical pipeline that consists of genomic systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (gSELEX)-Seq, gene expression analysis, and bioinformatics was shown to be a robust platform for comprehensively identifying genes regulated by a transcription factor.

The results from the pyrolysis tests demonstrated that CO and CO2 are the main produced gases during the pyrolysis of the finer fraction of landfill waste. This might be caused by the accumulation of degraded organic materials. The oil products from the pyrolysis of landfill waste were dominated by the derivative products of plastics such as styrene, toluene, and ethylbenzene. The chars obtained from the pyrolysis process were gasified under steam and steam/air atmospheres at temperatures between 800 and 900 °C by using thermogravimetry. The results from the gasification tests demonstrated that the char reactivity was mainly affected by the amount ratio between catalytic elements (K, Ca, Na, Mg, and Fe) over the inhibitor elements (Si, Al, and Cl), as well as the ash amount in the char. The results showed that char from the fine fraction of landfill waste has a higher reactivity than the RDF fraction, due to the high content of catalytic metal elements. These results suggest the use of a smaller sieve opening size for landfill waste separation processes may produce waste fuels with a high reactivity during gasification. Further, based on the thermogravimetric data, the kinetic parameters of landfill waste char gasification were calculated to have activation energies ranging from 54 to 128 kJ/mol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aair 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalytic activity 3aethylbenzene 3agasification 3airon 3alandfills 3amagnesium 3aoils 3aplastics 3apotassium 3apyrolysis 3arefuse derived fuels 3asilicon 3asodium 3asteam 3astyrene 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atoluene 3awaste management 3awastes 0aSteam gasification 0aRDF 0aMunicipal solid waste 0aThermogravimetry analysis 0aLandfill mining1 aGarcía López, Cristina1 aPretz, Thomas1 aYang, Weihong1 aJönsson, Pär Göran0 tWaste management.g2019 Sept., v. 97 p.149-163dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03505naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017800171520173800349592002802087650001702115650001902132650000902151650002002160650001302180650001502193650001102208650001302219650001302232650000902245650001502254650001302269650002202282650001402304650001502318650001802333650001102351650001202362650001702374650001102391653000902402653001002411653001002421653000702431653000702438653000802445653000902453653000902462653001602471653002402487700002102511700002202532700001702554700001902571700002002590700001902610700001802629773011202647856008702759852000902846655001202855IND60759522820221119082533.0220110e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075952282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2021.1043482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrado, Alberto10aWarmer winters are associated with lower levels of the cryoprotectant glycerol, a slower decrease in vitellogenin expression and reduced virus infections in winter honeybees  aWithin the context of climate change, winter temperatures at high latitudes are predicted to rise faster than summer temperatures. This phenomenon is expected to negatively affect the diapause performance and survival of insects, since they largely rely on low temperatures to lower their metabolism and preserve energy. However, some insects like honeybees, remain relatively active during the winter and elevate their metabolic rate to produce endothermic heat when temperatures drop. Warming winters are thus expected to improve overwintering performance of honeybees. In order to verify this hypothesis, for two consecutive years, we exposed honeybee colonies to either a mild or cold winter. We then monitored the influence of wintering conditions on several parameters of honeybee overwintering physiology, such as levels of the cryoprotectant glycerol, expression levels of immune and antioxidant genes, and genes encoding multifunctional proteins, including vitellogenin, which promotes bee longevity. Winter conditions had no effect on the expression of antioxidant genes, and genes related to immunity were not consistently affected. However, mild winters were consistently associated with a lower investment in glycerol synthesis and a higher expression of fat body genes, especially apidaecin and vitellogenin. Finally, while we found that viral loads generally decreased through the winter, this trend was more pronounced under mild winter conditions. In conclusion, and without considering how warming temperatures might affect other aspects of honeybee biology before overwintering, our data suggest that warming temperatures will likely benefit honeybee vitality by notably reducing their viral loads over the winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aclimate change 3acold 3acryoprotectants 3adiapause 3aendothermy 3aenergy 3afat body 3aglycerol 3aheat 3ahoney bees 3aimmunity 3ainsect physiology 3alongevity 3ametabolism 3aoverwintering 3asummer 3aviruses 3avitellogenin 3awinter 0aIPCC 0aG6PDH 0aNADPH 0aMW 0aCW 0aDWV 0aABPV 0aBQCV 0aTemperature 0aDeformed wing virus1 aBrunet, Jean-Luc1 aPeruzzi, Mathilde1 aBonnet, Marc1 aBordier, Celia1 aCrauser, Didier1 aLe Conte, Yves1 aAlaux, Cedric0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2022 Jan., v. 136 p.104348-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2021.1043483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01859naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245006400173300001800237500001900255520059900274592002800873650002300901650001800924650001200942650001700954650001500971650001600986650002201002650002001024650001901044653003101063653002501094653003101119700001901150700002201169700002301191773014001214856008601354852000901440655001201449IND60708565520221119023054.0200907e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070856552DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2020.17694652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasimbula, Rishni10aMetabolism of airborne methyl salicylate in adjacent plants  ap. 1780-1787.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSalicylic acid (SA) and methyl salicylate (MeSA) are synthesized in many plants and are crucial components that establish their disease responses.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) knockout mice showed increased energy expenditure, whereas mice with adipose-specific VDR over-expression showed decreased energy expenditure. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), now known to be present in adult humans, functions in non-shivering thermogenesis by uncoupling ATP synthesis from respiration and plays an important role in energy expenditure. However, the effects of 1,25(OH)₂D₃/VDR on brown adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial respiration have not been reported. METHODS: mRNA expression of VDR and the metabolizing enzymes 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) and 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) were examined in BAT of mice models of obesity and during brown adipocyte differentiation. The effects of 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and VDR over-expression on brown adipocyte differentiation and functional outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: No significant changes in mRNA of VDR and CYP27B1 were noted in both diet-induced obese (DIO) and ob/ob mice, whereas uncoupling protein 1 mRNA was downregulated in BAT of ob/ob, but not DIO mice when compared to the controls. In contrast, mRNA of VDR, CYP24A1, and CYP27B1 were downregulated during brown adipocyte differentiation in vitro. 1,25(OH)₂D₃ dose-dependently suppressed brown adipocyte differentiation, accompanied by suppressed isoproterenol-stimulated oxygen consumption rates (OCR), maximal OCR and OCR from proton leak. Consistently, over-expression of VDR also suppressed brown adipocyte differentiation. Further, both 1,25(OH)₂D₃ and VDR over-expression suppressed PPARγ transactivation in brown preadipocytes. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the suppressive effects of 1,25(OH)₂D₃/VDR signaling on brown adipocyte differentiation and mitochondrial respiration. The role of 1,25(OH)₂D₃/VDR system in regulating BAT development and function in obesity warrant further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aadipocytes 3aadults 3aanimal models 3abrown adipose tissue 3aenergy expenditure 3aenzymes 3agene overexpression 3aheat production 3ahumans 3aknockout mutants 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aobesity 3aoxygen consumption 3atranscriptional activation 3avitamin D1 aBae, Jiyoung1 aEsposito, Debora1 aKomarnytsky, Slavko1 aHu, Pan1 aChen, Jiangang1 aZhao, Ling0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2015 Sept., v. 54, no. 6 p.1001-1012dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-014-0778-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245012700176300001600303520129900319592002801618650001901646650001101665650002501676650001801701650000901719650001001728650003101738650002801769650001001797650001001807650001101817650002301828650001101851650002801862650001701890650001301907650001001920650001001930700002801940700002301968700002601991700002302017700002402040700002902064700002302093700002402116700002202140700002402162773009902186856008502285852000902370655001202379IND60080855820221119113420.0140812e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008085582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2012.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilveira, Roberta X.10aAction of sisal (Agave sisalana, Perrine) extract in the in vitro development of sheep and goat gastrointestinal nematodes  ap. 162-168.  aActive compounds from Agave sisalana with antiparasitic action against gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) could be an alternative to diversify the range of parasite management methods in the livestock sector. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro action of A. sisalana extract on the development of sheep and goat GINs. The extract, obtained from shredded sisal leaves, was utilized at various concentrations in the egg hatch test (EHT), larval development test (LDT), larval feeding inhibition test (LFIT) and adult motility test (AMT). The LC₅₀ and LC₉₅ in the EHT were 6.90 and 24.79mg/mL, in the LDT were 0.041 and 0.067mg/mL and in the LFIT were 0.053 and 0.24mg/mL, respectively, showing a dose-dependent relationship. The development and feeding inhibition on L₁ were both 100% at a dose of 0.12mg/mL. In the AMT there was 100% inhibition at 75mg/mL after 24h of exposure. The extract of A. sisalana therefore demonstrated significant action on L₁ at 0.12mg/mL. So, if part of the A. sisalana extract passes through the animal’s gastrointestinal system, this material can have a significant effect on the parasites in the feces. This is an interesting approach because it can drastically reduce the pasture contamination as well as the infection of herds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave sisalana 3aadults 3aantiparasitic agents 3adose response 3aeggs 3afeces 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3agastrointestinal system 3agoats 3aherds 3alarvae 3alarval development 3aleaves 3alethal concentration 50 3aparasitology 3apastures 3asheep 3asisal1 aChagas, Ana Carolina S.1 aBotura, Mariana B.1 aBatatinha, Maria J.M.1 aKatiki, Luciana M.1 aCarvalho, Camila O.1 aBevilaqua, Cláudia M.L.1 aBranco, Alexsandro1 aMachado, Elane A.A.1 aBorges, Simone L.1 aAlmeida, Maria A.O.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2012 June, v. 131, no. 2 p.162-168dElsevier Inc.x0014-48947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2012.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03012naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245012400166300002000290520138200310592002801692650001601720650001601736650002001752650001501772650001601787650001001803650001901813650001401832650001501846650001501861650003401876650001401910650004301924650001301967650001301980650001301993650001102006651002202017700002102039700002902060700002402089700002502113700002702138700002302165700002002188700002502208700002002233773012702253856008102380852000902461655001202470IND60536247220221118224551.0160806e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053624722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b032982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPenna, Antonella14aThe sxt Gene and Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning Toxins as Markers for the Monitoring of Toxic Alexandrium Species Blooms  ap. 14230-14238.  aParalytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a serious human illness caused by the ingestion of seafood contaminated with saxitoxin and its derivatives (STXs). These toxins are produced by some species of marine dinoflagellates within the genus Alexandrium. In the Mediterranean Sea, toxic Alexandrium spp. blooms, especially of A. minutum, are frequent and intense with negative impact to coastal ecosystem, aquaculture practices and other economic activities. We conducted a large scale study on the sxt gene and toxin distribution and content in toxic dinoflagellate A. minutum of the Mediterranean Sea using both quantitative PCR (qPCR) and HILIC-HRMS techniques. We developed a new qPCR assay for the estimation of the sxtA1 gene copy number in seawater samples during a bloom event in Syracuse Bay (Mediterranean Sea) with an analytical sensitivity of 2.0 × 10° sxtA1 gene copy number per reaction. The linear correlation between sxtA1 gene copy number and microalgal abundance and between the sxtA1 gene and STX content allowed us to rapidly determine the STX-producing cell concentrations of two Alexandrium species in environmental samples. In these samples, the amount of sxtA1 gene was in the range of 1.38 × 10⁵ – 2.55 × 10⁸ copies/L and the STX concentrations ranged from 41–201 nmol/L. This study described a potential PSP scenario in the Mediterranean Sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium 3aaquaculture 3adetection limit 3aecosystems 3agene dosage 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3aingestion 3amicroalgae 3amonitoring 3aparalytic shellfish poisoning 3apoisoning 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseafoods 3aseawater 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3aMediterranean Sea1 aPerini, Federico1 aDell’Aversano, Carmela1 aCapellacci, Samuela1 aTartaglione, Luciana1 aGiacobbe, Maria Grazia1 aCasabianca, Silvia1 aFraga, Santiago1 aCiminiello, Patrizia1 aScardi, Michele0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 49, no. 24 p.14230-14238dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b032983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02931naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245008500179300001400264520152000278592002801798650001901826650002201845650001101867650002201878650001801900650001501918650001001933650001301943650001501956650001201971650001101983650001801994650001802012650001502030650001302045650002302058650001602081653001502097653001802112653001702130653002202147653002402169653001902193700001702212773010002229856008702329852000902416655001202425IND60584204120221120200808.0171024e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058420412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolsteijn, Freija van10aMinimizing food waste by improving storage conditions in household refrigeration  ap. 25-31.  aA considerable amount of food is discarded by households in the EU. Many publications addressing the issue thus far, propose changes of consumer behaviour as the solution to fighting food waste. This article explores the possible contribution of technology, in particular, improvements in storage conditions in household refrigerators towards combating food waste. An optimized refrigerator design better serving its purpose of food preservation can theoretically reduce food waste due to quality loss and spoilage. In the current market, the functionality of refrigeration appliances is only indirectly determined by the quality of food preservation. Actual demand is driven by habits, available physical space, perception of size needed, price and –identified as a main driver in several market surveys– the EU’s energy label rating. As a result, 85% of consumers choose an appliance that, apart from the freezer compartment, only has one compartment for perishable fresh food (typically at 4°C). This article argues that the 4°C is a compromise: The real optimal preservation temperature, depending on the type and condition of the fresh food products, lies between −1°C and +17°C. At those optimal temperatures the ‘shelf life’ can be increased by a factor of two to three and thus the chance of food spoilage can be significantly reduced. Subsequently, the article tries to quantify the EU-wide potential impact of optimised household refrigeration, as much as current data availability allows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aconsumer behavior 3aenergy 3afood preservation 3afood spoilage 3afood waste 3afoods 3afreezers 3ahouseholds 3amarkets 3aprices 3arefrigeration 3arefrigerators 3ashelf life 3aspoilage 3astorage conditions 3atemperature 0aFood waste 0aRefrigeration 0aFood storage 0aFood preservation 0aResource efficiency 0aSustainability1 aKemna, René0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2018 Jan., v. 128 p.25-31dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01925naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007100169300001600240520081100256592002801067650001401095650002201109650002401131650001301155653000801168653000801176653000801184653000801192653001801200653002301218653001901241653003401260653003301294700001901327773009801346856008601444852000901530655001201539IND60644916520221120160857.0190628e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064491652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2019.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Zhenhua10aResponsive affirmative action in school choice: A comparison study  ap. 140-145.  aThis note provides a comparison study on responsiveness of two extensively used mechanisms to affirmative action in school choice. For priority-based affirmative action, we show that, if a stronger priority-based affirmative action favors minority students by giving full priority to the minority, then such a policy makes each minority student weakly better off under the student-proposing deferred acceptance (henceforth, DA) mechanism. However, the top trading cycles (henceforth, TTC) mechanism does not satisfy this property. Under the DA mechanism, if the original problem gives full priority to the minority, then the assignment of minority students does not change when the problem moves to a higher level of affirmative action. On the contrary, this property does not hold under the TTC mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomics 3aissues and policy 3aminorities (people) 3astudents 0aC78 0aD61 0aD71 0aD78 0aSchool choice 0aAffirmative action 0aResponsiveness 0aDeferred acceptance mechanism 0aTop trading cycles mechanism1 aTian, Guoqiang0 tEconomics letters.g2019 Aug., v. 181 p.140-145dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2019.05.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02290naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002800149245008500177300001600262520069000278592002800968650001700996650003001013650002701043650001801070650001001088650001901098650001301117650002301130650001201153650003001165653001601195653001701211653002801228653002101256653002301277700002601300700002601326700002201352700003101374700004001405700003701445700002901482700002501511700002201536773013401558856008301692852000901775655001201784IND60125166120221116163113.0151102e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012516612DNAL7 a10.1637/10855-043014-Case.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuimarães, Marta Brito10aClostridium perfringens Type A Enteritis in Blue and Yellow Macaw (Ara ararauna)  ap. 650-653.  aThis study describes an outbreak of necrotic enteritis caused by Clostridium perfringens type A in captive macaws (Ara ararauna).

Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOₓ demonstrates that NOₓ conversions in CuMn₂O₄ with (111) plane (CuMn₂O₄-C) and in CuMn₂O₄-C with (311) plane (CuMn₂O₄-T) are more than 90% at 200 and 300 °C, respectively, which are superior to those in CoMn₂O₄-C and CoMn₂O₄-T. CuMn₂O₄-C and CoMn₂O₄-C exhibit higher absorption amounts of NH₃/NO and more oxygen vacancies than CuMn₂O₄-T and CoMn₂O₄-T, respectively. In addition, CuMn₂O₄-C displays high catalytic activity and good stability in NH₃-SCR in the presence of 100 ppm of SO₂ and 10 vol % H₂O. In situ diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results indicate the coexistence of Eley–Rideal and Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanisms in CuMn₂O₄-C, and the Eley–Rideal mechanism is predominant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acatalytic activity 3achemical precipitation 3acobalt 3acopper 3aheat treatment 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3astructure-activity relationships 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature1 aLan, Zhixin1 aZhang, Kai1 aChen, Jianjun1 aJiang, Lilong1 aWang, Ruihu0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2017 Feb. 16, v. 121, no. 6 p.3339-3349dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.6b104463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013000169300001800299500001900317520156200336536008501898592002801983596002702011650002502038650002502063650002102088650003302109650001702142650001802159650001502177650002602192650002202218650002202240650002302262650002302285650001902308650002602327653000902353653002402362653002802386700002502414700002102439700002002460700001802480700002102498773014002519856008602659852000902745655001202754IND60708565820221119023246.0200907e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070856582DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2020.17711692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgawa, Takuya10aLysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8 displays substrate promiscuity  ap. 1831-1838.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aLysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase is a phospholipid biosynthetic enzyme that introduces a fatty acyl group into the sn-2 position of phospholipids. Its substrate selectivity is physiologically important in defining the physicochemical properties of lipid membranes and modulating membrane protein function. However, it remains unclear how these enzymes recognize various fatty acids. Successful purification of bacterial lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferases (PlsCs) was recently reported and has paved a path for the detailed analysis of their reaction mechanisms. Here, we purified and characterized PlsC from the thermophilic bacterium Thermus thermophilus HB8. This integral membrane protein remained active even after solubilization and purification and showed reactivity toward saturated, unsaturated, and methyl-branched fatty acids, although branched-chain acyl groups are the major constituent of phospholipids of this bacterium. Multiple sequence alignment revealed the N-terminal end of the enzyme to be shorter than that of PlsCs with defined substrate selectivity, suggesting that the shortened N-terminus confers substrate promiscuity.

Model Results of Chemical Fate Processes  ap. 14092-14100.  aWe present results from a chemical fate model quantifying incorporation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the Silvretta glacier, a temperate Alpine glacier located in Switzerland. Temperate glaciers, in contrast to cold glaciers, are glaciers where melt processes are prevalent. Incorporation of PCBs into cold glaciers has been quantified in previous studies. However, the fate of PCBs in temperate glaciers has never been investigated. In the model, we include melt processes, inducing elution of water-soluble substances and, conversely, enrichment of particles and particle-bound chemicals. The model is validated by comparing modeled and measured PCB concentrations in an ice core collected in the Silvretta accumulation area. We quantify PCB incorporation between 1900 and 2010, and discuss the fate of six PCB congeners. PCB concentrations in the ice core peak in the period of high PCB emissions, as well as in years with strong melt. While for lower-chlorinated PCB congeners revolatilization is important, for higher-chlorinated congeners, the main processes are storage in glacier ice and removal by particle runoff. This study gives insight into PCB fate and dynamics and reveals the effect of snow accumulation and melt processes on the fate of semivolatile organic chemicals in a temperate Alpine glacier.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3aemissions 3aenvironmental fate 3aexposure models 3aglaciers 3aice 3amelting 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3arunoff 3asnow 3avolatile organic compounds 3aSwitzerland1 aBogdal, Christian1 aPavlova, Pavlina A.1 aSchwikowski, Margit1 aLüthi, Martin P.1 aScheringer, Martin1 aSchmid, Peter1 aHungerbühler, Konrad0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 49, no. 24 p.14092-14100dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b033043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01784naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006900155300002000224520068200244592002800926650001000954650002300964650002300987650001901010650002401029650003301053650002301086650002201109700002001131700001901151700001601170700001601186773013701202856007401339852000901413655001201422IND60661034320221122222943.0190827e20150924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066103432DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc04536c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChalon, S.10aPET tracers for imaging brain α7 nicotinic receptors: an update  ap. 14826-14831.  aPositron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging of brain targets is a powerful tool to diagnose, follow up, and develop treatments and personalized medicine for a number of acute and chronic brain disorders.

In this study plastic waste is upcycled into 3-D printing filament with a recyclebot, which is an open source waste plastic extruder. The recyclebot is combined with an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer, to enable post-consumer ABS plastic filament from computer waste to be further upcycled into valuable consumer products pre-designed in the digital commons. The total electrical energy consumption for the combined process is monitored and an economic evaluation is completed. The coupled distributed recycling and manufacturing method for complex products reduces embodied energy by half, while reducing the cost of consumer products to pennies. This economic benefit provides an incentive for consumers to both home recycle and home manufacture, which tightens the loop on the circular economy by eliminating waste associated from transportation and retail. It is clear from the results that waste plastic can be significantly upcycled at the individual level using this commons-based approach. This tightening of the loop of the circular economy benefits the environment and sustainability as well as the economic stability of consumers/prosumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic evaluation 3aelectric power 3aelectronic wastes 3aembodied energy 3afinancial economics 3amanufacturing 3aplastics 3arecycling 3asustainable development 3atransportation 0aCircular economy 0aDistributed recycling 0aDistributed manufacturing 0aEnergy conservation 0aPolymer recycling 0aSustainable development1 aPearce, Joshua,0 tResources, Conservation & Recycling.g2018 Jan., v. 128 p.48-58dElsevier B.V.x0921-34497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2017.09.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245013200208300002000340506007600360520178600436592002802222506003702250650002202287650001402309650001302323650001502336650001002351650001102361650001602372650001002388650001102398650000902409650000702418650001402425650001702439650001402456650002502470650001202495650001602507650001802523700002202541700002302563700002102586700002302607773017502630856007902805852000902884655001202893IND60172302620221207060817.0150602e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017230262DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12055891092doi7 aPMC34796172pmcid7 a229881182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahamed, Deeqa A.10aCD73-generated adenosine facilitates Toxoplasma gondii differentiation to long-lived tissue cysts in the central nervous system  ap. 16312-16317.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aToxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen that traffics to the central nervous system (CNS) following invasion of its host. In the CNS, T. gondii undergoes transformation from a rapidly dividing tachyzoite to a long-lived, slow-dividing bradyzoite contained within cysts. The role of extracellular adenosine in T. gondii pathogenesis has not been previously investigated. T. gondii uses host purines such as adenosine for its energy needs, as it is unable to make its own. Here, we show that CD73 ⁻/⁻ mice, which lack the ability to generate extracellular adenosine, are protected from T. gondii chronic infection, with significantly fewer cysts and reduced susceptibility to reactivation of infection in the CNS independent of host effector function. Parasite dissemination to the brain was unimpaired in CD73 ⁻/⁻ hosts, suggesting that the reduced cyst number is due to impaired parasite differentiation in the CNS. Confirming this, T. gondii tachyzoites formed fewer cysts following alkaline pH stress in astrocytes isolated from CD73 ⁻/⁻ mice compared with wild type, and in fibroblasts treated with a CD73 inhibitor. Cyst formation was rescued in CD73 ⁻/⁻ astrocytes supplemented with adenosine, but not with adenosine receptor agonist 5′- N -ethylcarboxamidoadenosine. Furthermore, mice lacking adenosine receptors had no defect in cyst formation. Based on these findings, we conclude that CD73 expression promotes Toxoplasma bradyzoite differentiation and cyst formation by a mechanism dependent on the generation of adenosine, but independent of adenosine receptor signaling. Overall, these findings suggest that modulators of extracellular adenosine may be used to develop therapies aimed at defending against human toxoplasmosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aadenosine 3aagonists 3aastrocytes 3abrain 3aenergy 3afibroblasts 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amice 3apH 3aparasites 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apurinergic receptors 3apurines 3atachyzoites 3atoxoplasmosis1 aMills, Jeffrey H.1 aEgan, Charlotte E.1 aDenkers, Eric Y.1 aBynoe, Margaret S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 2, v. 109, no. 40 p.16312-16317dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12055891093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001200152245009700164520134700261592002801608650001301636650001501649650001501664650002101679650001401700650002001714650002401734650000901758650000901767650001601776650000901792650001401801650002201815650001201837650001501849650001301864650001501877650001001892653001401902653001801916653001801934653001201952653002201964700005601986700001702042700001602059773009702075856008702172852000902259655001202268IND60734089520221122105721.0220606e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073408952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1081432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xia10aMulticolorimetric sensing of histamine in fishes based on enzymatic etching of gold nanorods  aHistamine determination is of great significance for fish safety, quality and trade. In this work, we developed a novel multicolorimetric biosensor for the simple and rapid visual detection of histamine in fishes. With the help of iodide and molybdate, the hydrogen peroxide generated by the enzymatic reaction of histamine and diamine oxidase enzyme effectively etched the gold nanorods (AuNRs). This etching reaction caused a blueshift of the longitudinal peak of the nanorods, accompanied by an obvious multicolor change from blue-green to purple and red, which could be easily observed by the naked eye. After the optimization of reaction conditions, the linear range of the standard curve obtained from the longitudinal peak blueshift distance of the AuNRs was determined to be 20–100 μM. Attentively, the interference from other analytes is negligible, especially diamines such as putrescine and cadaverine. Furthermore, one can easily distinguish with the naked eye whether the histamine content measured in a fish sample exceeds the limit value of 50 mg/kg using the proposed method. The method is simple and fast, with high specificity and accuracy, and can be successfully applied to determine the histamine content in real fish samples, indicating the potential of its application in the on-site detection of various analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccuracy 3abiosensors 3acadaverine 3achemical species 3adetection 3adiamine oxidase 3aenzymatic reactions 3aeyes 3afish 3afood safety 3agold 3ahistamine 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aiodides 3amolybdates 3ananorods 3aputrescine 3atrade 0aHistamine 0aDiamine oxide 0aGold nanorods 0aEtching 0aMulticolorimetric1 aWu, Xiaotian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2551-14321 aDing, Yuting1 aZhou, Xuxia0 tFood control.g2021 Sept., v. 127 p.108143-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2021.1081433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03360naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245012400198300001600322500002000338520166000358592002802018596005302046596002202099596006202121596005702183596004902240650002102289650002202310650001202332650001402344650004102358650002102399650001702420650001202437650001002449650001802459650003102477650001102508651001102519700002002530700002502550700002202575700002502597700002002622773013002642856007302772852000902845655001202854IND60647156620221122060157.0190617e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064715662DNAL7 a10.1111/jen.126332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiabate, Seydou1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6658-154710aBehavioural response of alate Aphis craccivora Koch (Homoptera: Aphididae) to volatiles from different cowpea cultivars  ap. 659-669.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe cowpea aphid, Aphis craccivora, is a major insect pest of cowpea in Africa. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) mediate plant–arthropod interactions that could be used in the management of insect pests. In this study, we established the VOC profile involved in the interaction between A. craccivora and four cowpea cultivars, namely Ex‐Luanda, Katumani 80, Machakos 66 and Ken Kunde 1. Behavioural assays were conducted to study host preference and gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for chemical analysis of volatiles. In preference assays, alate A. craccivora had no significant preference for any of the four cowpea cultivars tested. However, in the olfactometer assays, the aphids showed a significant preference for odours from cultivar Ex‐Luanda compared to Katumani 80. Machakos 66 and Ken Kunde 1 elicited neutral responses. In pairwise comparisons, alate A. craccivora did not distinguish between odours of respective cowpea cultivars. GC/MS analysis identified 23 compounds in the volatiles of the four cowpea cultivars. Not all compounds were detected in all cowpea cultivars, and the detected compounds amounts varied in each cultivar. Of these, only four compounds (hexanal, (E)‐2‐hexenal, 1‐octen‐3‐ol and p‐xylene) were emitted in significantly different quantities in the four cultivars. A blend of hexanal and (E)‐2‐hexenal added to cowpea cultivar Ex‐Luanda decreased its attractiveness to A. craccivora compared to the control. Our findings showed differential attractiveness of VOCs of cowpea cultivars to A. craccivora, suggesting that VOCs could be used in the management of A. craccivora.  aPublisher supplied data  a91602505cDeutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst  cKenyan Government  cFederal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development  cSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency  cSwiss Agency for Development and Cooperation 3aAphis craccivora 3achemical analysis 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahost preferences 3ainsect pests 3aoctenol 3aodors 3aolfactometers 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene 3aAfrica1 aDeletre, Emilie1 aMurungi, Lucy Kananu1 aFiaboe, Komi K.M.1 aWesonga, J.q(John),1 aMartin, Thibaud0 tJournal of applied entomology.g2019 July, v. 143, no. 6 p.659-669dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57792x0931-20487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jen.126333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245011200210300002000322506007600342520124800418592002801666506003701694650003201731650001501763650001301778650001001791650001701801650001801818650002601836653002301862653002001885653001301905700002401918700002301942700002201965700001701987700001802004700002202022700002502044700002202069700002302091773017502114856007902289852000902368655001202377IND60172302820221207060942.0150602e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017230282DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12058381092doi7 aPMC34796122pmcid7 a229881162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Moustaine, Driss10aDistinct roles of metabotropic glutamate receptor dimerization in agonist activation and G-protein coupling  ap. 16342-16347.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe eight metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are key modulators of synaptic transmission and are considered promising targets for the treatment of various brain disorders. Whereas glutamate acts at a large extracellular domain, allosteric modulators have been identified that bind to the seven transmembrane domain (7TM) of these dimeric G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We show here that the dimeric organization of mGluRs is required for the modulation of active and inactive states of the 7TM by agonists, but is not necessary for G-protein activation. Monomeric mGlu2, either as an isolated 7TM or in full-length, purified and reconstituted into nanodiscs, couples to G proteins upon direct activation by a positive allosteric modulator. However, only a reconstituted full-length dimeric mGlu2 activates G protein upon glutamate binding, suggesting that dimerization is required for glutamate induced activation. These data show that, even for such well characterized GPCR dimers like mGluR2, a single 7TM is sufficient for G-protein coupling. Despite this observation, the necessity of dimeric architecture for signaling induced by the endogenous ligand glutamate confirms that the central core of signaling complex is dimeric.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aG-proteins 3aagonists 3abrain 3adimerization 3aglutamic acid 3asynaptic transmission 0atime-resolved FRET 0aoligomerization 0aSNAP-tag1 aGranier, Sébastien1 aDoumazane, Etienne1 aScholler, Pauline1 aRahmeh, Rita1 aBron, Patrick1 aMouillac, Bernard1 aBanères, Jean-Louis1 aRondard, Philippe1 aPin, Jean-Philippe0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 2, v. 109, no. 40 p.16342-16347dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12058381093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245016200181300001800343520099000361592002801351650001101379650002601390650001301416650001401429650001801443650001301461650005201474650001201526650001501538650001801553650001301571650001101584650002101595650006101616650006901677650004101746650007801787650001401865651000901879700001801888700002001906700003101926700002401957773009901981856004802080852000902128655001202137IND4473633220221119145604.0121003e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447363322DNAL7 a226535382pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-012-1353-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFraga, Jorge10aSpecies typing of Cuban Trichomonas vaginalis virus by RT-PCR, and association of TVV-2 with high parasite adhesion levels and high pathogenicity in patients  ap. 1789-1795.  aThe viral infection of the parasite with T. vaginalis virus (TVV) may have important implications for trichomonal virulence.

The strains infected with TVV showing highest adhesion level in comparison to not infected strains, with high statistical significance. The strains infected only with TVV-2 showing highest adhesion level in comparison to strains infected with TVV-1, with high statistical significance. The parasites classified as mild symptomatic are infected only with TVV-1, however the severe only with TVV-2.

In Experiment 1, three groups of 2-wk-old turkey poults, including a negative control group, were used. In groups 1 and 2, 13 poults in each group were challenged with either serotype 1 (STC) or serotype 2 (OH) strains using an inoculum of 10⁴ 50% embryo infectious dose (EID₅₀)/0.2 ml/bird. Thymus, bursa, spleen, kidney, lungs, liver, pancreas, caecum, and breast and thigh muscles were sampled at predetermined intervals. The bursal tissues from birds inoculated with either serotype were reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT-PCR) positive up to 21 days postinoculation (DPI). In both groups virus isolation from bursas was possible up to 14 DPI. Except for the bursas and spleens in birds inoculated with serotype 1 and bursas in birds inoculated with serotype 2, all other tissues were RT-PCR negative. In Experiment 2, five groups of turkey poults were used. At 4 wk of age, group 1 was challenged with a serotype 1 STC strain and group 2 with serotype 2 OH strain using an inoculum size of 10² EID₅₀/0.2 ml for both serotypes. Groups 3 and 4 were vaccinated at 2 wk of age using an inactivated serotype 1 IBDV vaccine. At 2 wk postvaccination, groups 3 and 4 were challenged with STC and OH strains respectively. From group 1, bursal, spleen, and liver tissues were RT-PCR positive up to 14 DPI; breast muscle and kidney tissues were positive up to 7 DPI; and lungs and pancreatic tissues were positive up to 3 DPI. From group 2, bursal tissues were RT-PCR positive up to 14 DPI and lung tissues up to 3 DPI. All of the tissue samples collected from groups 3, 4, and 5 were RT-PCR negative. Virus could not be isolated from RT-PCR positive bursal homogenate. In this work, it was confirmed that the virus persisted in the bursa longer than in any other tissues. The difference in the results between Experiments 1 and 2 could be due to the age of poults at vaccination and the higher inoculum size used in Experiment 1. This study indicates that turkeys are more resistant to IBDV as compared to chickens. Viruses of serotypes 1 and 2 infect turkeys and persist in bursal tissue for 14 days and RNA was detected up to 21 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfectious bursal disease virus 3aRNA 3abreast muscle 3acecum 3achickens 3ainoculum 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3apancreas 3apoultry diseases 3apoults 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3aspleen 3atissue distribution 3aturkeys 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aIBDV 0apersistence and tissues distributions in turkeys1 aMurgia, Maria V.1 aSaif, Yehia M.0 tAvian diseases.g2015 Mar., v. 59, no. 1 p.153-156dAmerican Association of Avian PathologistswJournal:jnl45496x1938-43517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1637/10717-111213-ResNote3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245016800179300001400347520164700361592002802008650001102036650001802047650001602065650001902081650001602100650002002116650001802136650002702154650001002181650003302191650002202224650001402246650001402260650001702274650002702291650002002318653001002338653002602348653002102374653001902395653002202414653002902436700002302465700002602488700002902514700002202543700002702565700002802592700002402620700002102644773010602665856009002771852000902861655001202870IND60584204820221120190501.0201125e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058420482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2017.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Flores, N.M.14aThe key role of targeted betacarotene supplementation on endocrine and reproductive outcomes in goats: Follicular development, ovulation rate and the GH-IGF-1 axis  ap. 29-33.  aThe possible effects of betacarotene (BC) supplementation on the secretion pattern of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and their possible relationship with total ovarian activity (TOA), was evaluated in adult goats during the breeding season. In October, goats [n=22, 3.5y. old, 7/8 Sannen-Alpine] were randomly assigned to: a) Betacarotene group [BC, n=10; 45.9±1.97kg live weight (LW), 3.04±0.08 units, body condition score (BCS), supplemented with 50mg of BC goat day⁻¹], and b) Control group [CONT, n=12; 46.2±2.04kg LW, 3.0±0.08 units, BCS]. An ultrasonographic scan was performed to evaluate corpus luteum number (OR) and antral follicle number (AF); TOA=OR+AF. Average LW and BCS did not differ (p>0.05) during the experimental period, yet BC-goats reflected an increased OR (3.4±0.2 vs. 2.8±0.2), AF (5.0±0.6 vs. 3.4±0.6) and TOA (8.4±0.5 vs. 6.2±0.6). Regarding the endocrine profile, the lowest (p<0.05) serum GH average concentrations (10.0 vs. 14.3±1.0ngmL⁻¹; p=0.01) and GH-AUC (3670.4 vs. 5235.7±369.8 units; p=0.01), were observed in the BC-supplemented group. Neither serum IGF-1 concentrations (254.6±28.9ngmL⁻¹ p>0.05) nor GH-PULSE (1.4±0.5 pulses 6h⁻¹ p>0.05) differed between treatments. We document a potential role of BC as modulator of somatotrophic function, decreasing mean serum concentration and the area under the curve of GH, while also noting a positive action upon ovarian function with increases in ovulation rate and antral follicular development; such outcomes may embrace not only physiologic significance but also potential translational applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abeta-carotene 3ablood serum 3abody condition 3abody weight 3abreeding season 3acorpus luteum 3afollicular development 3agoats 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aovarian follicles 3aovulation 3asecretion 3asomatotropin 3atranslation (genetics) 3aultrasonography 0aGoats 0aReproductive outcomes 0aOvarian activity 0aOvulation rate 0aSomatotropic axis 0aTargeted supplementation1 aMeza-Herrera, C.A.1 aGalán-Soldevilla, C.1 aBautista-Rodriguez, D.A.1 aVeliz-Deras, F.G.1 aArellano-Rodriguez, G.1 ala Peña, C.

The best enzyme recovery from solid mass was obtained when extracted with tap water. Among the tested various nitrogen sources, 1 % ammonium sulphate followed by 2 % Bacto liver, 2 % ammonium sulphate and 1 % Bacto casaminoacid served as the best inorganic and organic nitrogen sources for α-amylase and protease production, respectively.

Although accord exists on the importance of L235 in IgG1 and some hydrophobic contacts for complex stabilization, discord exists regarding the existence of stabilizing glycoprotein contacts between glycans of IgG1 and a conserved FG-loop (¹⁷¹MGKHRY¹⁷⁶) of FcγRIa. Complexes formed from the FcγRIa receptor and IgG1s containing biantennary glycans with N-acetylglucosamine, galactose, and α2,6-N-acetylneuraminic terminations were measured by hydrogen–deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), classified for dissimilarity with Welch’s ANOVA and Games-Howell post hoc procedures, and modeled with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For each glycoform of the IgG1—FcγRIa complex peptic peptides of Fab, Fc and FcγRIa report distinct H/D exchange rates. MD simulations corroborate the differences in the peptide deuterium content through calculation of the percent of time that transient glycan-peptide bonds exist. These results indicate that stability of IgG1—FcγRIa complexes correlate with the presence of intermolecular glycoprotein interactions between the IgG1 glycans and the ¹⁷³KHR¹⁷⁵ motif within the FG-loop of FcγRIa. The results also indicate that intramolecular glycan-protein bonds stabilize the Fc region in isolated and complexed IgG1. Moreover, HDX-MS data evince that the Fab domain has glycan-protein binding contacts within the IgG1—FcγRI complex.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aN-acetylglucosamine 3aantigen-antibody complex 3adeuterium 3agalactose 3aglycoproteins 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular biology 3amolecular dynamics 3apeptides 3apolysaccharides 0aglycosylation 0aimmune receptor 0amembrane protein structure 0amonoclonal antibody 0asimilarity1 aBergonzo, Christina1 aScott, Kerry1 aKarageorgos, Ioannis L.1 aGallagher, Elyssia S.1 aTayi, Venkata S.1 aButler, Michael1 aHudgens, Jeffrey W.0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 434, no. 2 p.167391-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1673913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03991naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245008400209300001600293520192600309592002802235650001402263650001902277650001402296650001702310650001702327650001902344650001102363650002202374650002102396650001902417650001002436650001302446653001402459653001902473653003402492653001702526653002902543653004102572653000902613653000802622653000702630653000802637653000702645653001102652653000902663653001002672653000902682653000802691653000802699653000902707653000802716653000902724653000802733653001002741653000902751653001002760700001602770700002102786700002702807700001702834700002602851700001902877700001802896700002302914700001902937700002102956700002302977773011403000856008603114852000903200655001203209IND60591750520221119070358.0200503e20180410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059175052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWenande, Emily1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5928-504210aLaser-assisted delivery of synergistic combination chemotherapy in in vivo skin  ap. 242-253.  aThe effectiveness of topical drugs for treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer is greatly reduced by insufficient penetration to deep skin layers. Ablative fractional lasers (AFLs) are known to enhance topical drug uptake by generating narrow microchannels through the skin, but information on AFL-drug delivery in in vivo conditions is limited. In this study, we examined pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and toxicity of two synergistic chemotherapy agents, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), following AFL-assisted delivery alone or in combination in in vivo porcine skin. Detected at 0–120 h using mass spectrometry techniques, we demonstrated that fractional CO₂ laser pretreatment (196 microchannels/cm², 852 μm ablation depth) leads to rapid drug uptake in 1500 μm deep skin layers, with a sixfold enhancement in peak cisplatin concentrations versus non-laser-treated controls (5 h, P = 0.005). Similarly, maximum 5-FU deposition was measured within an hour of AFL-delivery, and exceeded peak deposition in non-laser-exposed skin that had undergone topical drug exposure for 5 days. Overall, this accelerated and deeper cutaneous drug uptake resulted in significantly increased inflammatory and histopathological effects. Based on clinical scores and transepidermal water loss measurement, AFL intensified local toxic responses to drugs delivered alone and in combination, while systemic drug exposure remained undetectable. Quantitative histopathologic analyses correspondingly revealed significantly reduced epidermal proliferation and greater cellular apoptosis after AFL-drug delivery; particularly after combined cisplatin + 5-FU exposure. In sum, by overcoming the primary limitation of topical drug penetration and providing accelerated, enhanced and deeper delivery, AFL-assisted combination chemotherapy may represent a promising treatment strategy for non-melanoma skin cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acarbon dioxide 3acisplatin 3adrug therapy 3afluorouracil 3ahistopathology 3alasers 3amass spectrometry 3apharmacokinetics 3askin neoplasms 3aswine 3atoxicity 0aCisplatin 0a5-Fluorouracil 0aFractional ablative CO2 laser 0aIn vivo skin 0aNon-melanoma skin cancer 0aTopical laser-assisted drug delivery 0a5-FU 0aAFL 0aAI 0aBCC 0aCZ 0aICP-MS 0aLADD 0aLC-MS 0aLSRs 0aMAZ 0aMTZ 0aNMSC 0appb 0asBCC 0aSCC 0aSCCis 0aTEWL 0aTUNEL1 aTam, Joshua1 aBhayana, Brijesh1 aSchlosser, Steven Kyle1 aIshak, Emily1 aFarinelli, William A.1 aChlopik, Agata1 aHoang, Mai P.1 aPinkhasov, Omar R.1 aCaravan, Peter1 aRox Anderson, R.1 aHaedersdal, Merete0 tJournal of controlled release.g2018 Apr. 10, v. 275 p.242-253dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.02.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245017000163520149200333592002801825650000801853650001501861650002301876650002001899650002101919650001501940650001901955650002201974650000901996650000902005650001902014650001302033650001802046650001702064650000802081653003502089653002702124653003102151653002302182653001302205700001602218700001602234700001202250700001602262700001802278700001702296700001802313700001602331700001602347773011202363856008302475852000902558655001202567IND60656166320221120182856.0200103e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065616632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1115602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Renyue10aTarget-inspired Pb2+-dependent DNAzyme for ultrasensitive electrochemical sensor based on MoS2-AuPt nanocomposites and hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme as signal amplifier  aIn this work, a novel Pb²⁺ electrochemical DNAzyme sensor was developed for ultrasensitive detection of lead ions (Pb²⁺) in water environment by coupling with the MoS₂–AuPt nanomaterials and hemin/G-quadruplex DNAzyme, which acting as the electrocatalytic signal tag. Streptavidin (SA) modified tin dioxide-functionalized reduced graphene oxide (rGO-SnO₂) /gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) served as a sensor platform for enhancing conductivity and immobilizing more Pb²⁺-specific DNAzyme. In the presence of Pb²⁺, the Pb²⁺-dependent DNAzyme specifically reacted with Pb²⁺, cleaving the substrate strand (SS) into two free fragment and releasing the biotin-modified enzyme strand (Bio-ES) on the electrode. Connecting MoS₂–AuPt nanocomposites labeled with G-rich DNA (G-DNA) strand and exposure of Bio-ES through the Helper DNA, as well as adding hemin to form a hemin/G-quadruplex, the biosensor achieved signal amplification. Chronoamperometry was used to record the current signal, which was primarily derived from the cocatalysis reduction of H₂O₂ by MoS₂–AuPt nanocomposites and the hemin/G-quadruplex. Under optimal conditions, the designed biosensor exhibited sensitive detection of Pb²⁺ from 0.1 pg mL⁻¹ to 1000 ng mL⁻¹, with a lower detection limit of 38 fg mL⁻¹ (based on 3σ). This proposed biosensor is ultrasensitive and specific, representing a potential application for the detection of Pb²⁺ in a water environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3acatalytic activity 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aions 3alead 3ananocomposites 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3astreptavidin 3atin 0aElectrochemical DNAzyme sensor 0aPb2+-dependent DNAzyme 0aMoS2–AuPt nanocomposites 0aHemin/G-quadruplex 0arGO-SnO21 aNiu, Wuceng1 aChen, Shuai1 aXu, Wei1 aJi, Xingduo1 aYuan, Lingyue1 aZhao, Hangyu1 aGeng, Minghao1 aQiu, Jingfu1 aLi, Chaorui0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 144 p.111560-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1115603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008200170300001800252500001900270520044300289536042200732592002801154596007701182596003001259596001801289650002601307650001501333650001801348650001101366650002101377650001201398650001101410653001601421653002001437653001401457653002801471653002001499700001901519700002201538700002201560773014001582856008601722852000901808655001201817IND60708566720221119023250.0200907e20200901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070856672DNAL7 a10.1080/09168451.2020.17737572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIijima, Masumi10aEnhanced sugar chain detection by oriented immobilization of Fc-fused lectins  ap. 1775-1779.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report a novel scaffold for clustering and oriented immobilization of human IgG1 Fc-fused lectins on biosensors without chemical modifications.

Among Darwin’s finches, ground finches (Geospiza spp.) have beaks that represent scaling variations of the same shape, which are generated by alterations in the signaling pathways that regulate growth of the two skeletal components of the beak: the prenasal cartilage (pnc) and the premaxillary bone (pmx). Whether this developmental mechanism is responsible for variation within groups of other closely related bird species, however, has remained unknown. Here, we report that the Caribbean bullfinches (Loxigilla spp.), which are closely related to Darwin’s finches, have independently evolved beaks of a novel shape, different from Geospiza , but also varying from each other only in scaling. However, despite sharing the same beak shape, the signaling pathways and tissues patterning Loxigilla beaks differ among the three species. In Loxigilla noctis , as in Geospiza , the pnc develops first, shaped by Bmp4 and CaM signaling, followed by the development of the pmx, regulated by TGFβIIr , β-catenin , and Dkk3 signaling. In contrast, beak morphogenesis in Loxigilla violacea and Loxigilla portoricensis is generated almost exclusively by the pmx through a mechanism in which Ihh and Bmp4 synergize to promote expansion of bone tissue. Together, our results demonstrate high flexibility in the relationship between morphology and underlying developmental causes, where different developmental programs can generate identical shapes, and similar developmental programs can pattern different shapes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFringillidae 3abeak 3abirds 3abones 3acartilage 3amorphogenesis 3asignal transduction 3aCaribbean 0aconvergent evolution 0acraniofacial 0amorphogenesis1 aCampàs, Otger,1 aFritz, Joerg A.1 aBurns, Kevin J.1 aWeeks, Olivia G.1 aBrenner, M.

Despite nearly 40 years of research, KRAS remains largely undruggable, in part due to an incomplete understanding of its biology. Recently, KRAS dimerization was discovered to play an important role in its signalling function. The KRAS D154Q mutant was described as a dimer-deficient variant that can be used to study the effect of dimerization in KRAS oncogenicity. However, we show here that KRAS D154Q homo- and heterodimerized with KRAS WT using three separate protein–protein interaction assays, and that oncogenic KRAS dimerization was not negatively impacted by the presence of a secondary D154Q mutation. In conclusion, we advise caution in using this variant to study the purpose of dimerization in KRAS oncogenic behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarcinogenicity 3adimerization 3ahumans 3amolecular biology 3amutants 3amutation 3aoncogenes 3aprotein-protein interactions 0aKRAS 0adimerization 0aMaMTH 0aSIMPL 0aco-immunoprecipitation 0aOncogenic signalling 0aCancer therapeutics1 aStuart, Sarah1 aLyakisheva, Anna1 aYao, Zhong1 aPathmanathan, Shivanthy1 aOhh, Michael1 aStagljar, Igor0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2022 Jan. 30, v. 434, no. 2 p.167392-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1673923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03408naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245013000172520203100302592002802333650001202361650001502373650001602388650002302404650001802427650001902445650001902464650000702483650002102490650001702511650001302528650002202541650001602563650002102579653003902600653001802639653002402657653001902681653002602700700001902726700001502745773009102760856009002851852000902941655001202950IND60750176820221119053807.0211123e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075017682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1322122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hailong10aEffects of additive dosage and coagulation bath pH on amphoteric fluorocarbon special surfactant (FS-50) blend PVDF membranes  aAmphiphilic copolymers containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks represented by surfactants have proven to be more effective for modifying membranes than hydrophilic copolymers. However, studies on the effects of additive and coagulation bath pH on the morphology and properties of surfactant-modified membranes have rarely been reported. Hence, this study aims to investigate the effects of the additive dosage and the coagulation bath pH on the mechanisms of phase inversion and performance improvement of amphoteric fluorocarbon special surfactant (FS-50) blended PVDF membranes. It was observed that the pure water flux increased from 114.68 LMH/bar of the original membrane M0 to 205.02 LMH/bar of the blend membrane M1, and then to 615.88 LMH/bar of the coagulation-bath-regulated membrane MPH9 with a high BSA rejection rate of 90.86%, showing a two-stage jump. The addition of FS-50 promoted the instantaneous phase inversion of the membrane, allowing the blend membrane to exhibit a higher proportion of pore characteristics and stronger permeability. After that, the mechanisms of the membrane phase inversion process affected by the coagulation bath pH were interpreted according to the pH-response characteristics of FS-50 in terms of charge repulsion effect and compressed double-electron layer effect. Furthermore, the cross-sectional morphology and the surface structure of the membrane prepared in acidic and alkaline coagulation baths were significantly affected by the pH of the coagulation bath, exhibiting different features. For one, the porosity of the membranes gradually decreased as the acidity and alkalinity of the coagulation bath increased, and the membrane MPH9 exhibited both maximum surface and overall porosity. For another, the coagulation bath pH did not negatively affect the contact angle, surface roughness and tensile strength of the membranes. Overall, adjusting the dosage of FS-50 and the pH of the coagulation bath is a promising approach to greatly enhance membrane performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aalkalinity 3acoagulation 3acomposite polymers 3acontact angle 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3apH 3aperfluorocarbons 3apermeability 3aporosity 3asurface roughness 3asurfactants 3atensile strength 0aAmphoteric fluorocarbon surfactant 0aPVDF membrane 0aCoagulation bath pH 0aPore structure 0aMembrane permeability1 aLiao, Xiangjun1 aRen, Yuxia0 tChemosphere.g2022 Jan., v. 287 p.132212-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.1322123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03594naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245013700190300001600327520175500343592002802098650002002126650001602146650001702162650002602179650001202205650001702217650000902234650001302243650001502256650001602271650000702287650002002294650001202314650001602326650003002342650005602372650004802428650004902476650003302525650006002558650001302618650001502631650001702646650003102663650001002694650006202704650006202766650001702828700002702845773008702872856004802959852000903007655001203016IND4487489720221116215819.0120727e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448748972DNAL7 a211038972pmid7 a10.1007/s00709-010-0241-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDodonova, Svetlana O.10aCyclosis-related asymmetry of chloroplast–plasma membrane interactions at the margins of illuminated area in Chara corallina cells  ap. 737-749.  aCytoplasmic streaming in plant cells is an effective means of intracellular transport. The cycling of ions and metabolites between the cytosol and chloroplasts in illuminated cell regions may alter the cytoplasm composition, while directional flow of this modified cytoplasm may affect the plasma membrane and chloroplast activities in cell regions residing downstream of the illumination area. The impact of local illumination is predicted to be asymmetric because the cell regions located downstream and upstream in the cytoplasmic flow with respect to illumination area would be exposed to flowing cytoplasm whose solute composition was influenced by photosynthetic or dark metabolism. This hypothesis was checked by measuring H+-transporting activity of plasmalemma and chlorophyll fluorescence of chloroplasts in shaded regions of Chara corallina internodal cells near opposite borders of illuminated region (white light, beam width 2 mm). Both the apoplastic pH and chlorophyll fluorescence, recorded in shade regions at equal distances from illuminated area, exhibited asymmetric light-on responses depending on orientation of cytoplasmic streaming at the light–shade boundary. In the region where the cytoplasm flowed from illuminated area to the measurement area, the alkaline zone (a zone with high plasma membrane conductance) was formed within 4-min illumination, whereas no alkaline zone was observed in the area where cytoplasm approached the boundary from darkened regions. The results emphasize significance of cyclosis in lateral distribution of a functionally active intermediate capable of affecting the membrane transport across the plasmalemma, the functional activity of chloroplasts, and pattern formation in the plant cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChara corallina 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3acytoplasmic streaming 3acytosol 3afluorescence 3aions 3alighting 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3apH 3aplasma membrane 3asolutes 3awhite light 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCharaxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aChlorophyllxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aChloroplastsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aCytochalasin Bxpharmacology 2aCytoplasmic Streamingxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aDarkness 2aElectrodes 2aFluorescence 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLight 2aPlant Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPlant Stemsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aTime Factors1 aBulychev, Alexander A.0 tProtoplasma.g2011 Oct., v. 248, no. 4 p.737-749dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-010-0241-6  aDNAL 7aarticle04018naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005300139245012400192300001600316500002000332520164300352592002801995596011202023596005502135596005902190596005902249596009802308650002602406650002102432650002002453650002302473650001502496650003802511650002102549650001902570650001602589650003102605650001002636650001702646650002102663650001902684650001502703650001902718650001302737650001302750650001902763650001702782650004302799650005202842650001402894650001302908650003202921700001202953700001702965700001702982700001902999700001503018700001603033700001803049700001903067700002003086773013203106856007303238852000903311655001203320IND60647157120221122142755.0190617e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064715712DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.134382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Zhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3924-189110aMicroRNA‐145 regulates immune cytokines via targeting FSCN1 in Staphylococcus aureus‐induced mastitis in dairy cows  ap. 882-891.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDairy cow mastitis is a detrimental factor in milk quality and food safety. Mastitis generally refers to inflammation caused by infection by pathogenic microorganisms. Our studies in recent years have revealed the role of miRNA regulation in Staphylococcus aureus‐induced mastitis. In the present study, we overexpressed and suppressed miR‐145 to investigate the function of miR‐145 in Mac‐T cells. Flow cytometry, ELISA and EdU staining were used to detect changes in the secretion of several Mac‐T cytokines and in cell proliferation. We found that overexpression of miR‐145 in Mac‐T cells significantly reduced the secretion of IL‐12 and TNF‐α, but increased the secretion of IFN‐γ; the proliferation of bovine mammary epithelial cells was also inhibited. Using quantitative real‐time PCR (qRT‐PCR), Western blotting and luciferase multiplex verification techniques, we found that miR‐145 targeted and regulated FSCN1. Knock‐down of FSCN1 significantly increased the secretion of IL‐12, while the secretion of TNF‐α was significantly downregulated in Mac‐T cells. Upon S. aureus infection of mammary gland tissue, the body initiated inflammatory responses; Bta‐miR‐145 expression was downregulated, which reduced the inhibitory effect on the FSCN1 gene; and upregulation of FSCN1 expression promoted mammary epithelial cell proliferation to allow the recovery of damaged tissue. The results of the present study will aid in understanding the immune mechanism opposing S. aureus infection in dairy cows and will provide a laboratory research basis for the prevention and treatment of mastitis.  aPublisher supplied data  aCX (17) 1005cAgricultural Science and Technology Independent Innovation Project of Jiangsu Province, China  a2017M621841cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation  a31872324cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31802035cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a17KJB230005cNatural Science Foundation of the Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aWestern blotting 3acattle diseases 3acell proliferation 3adairy cows 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aepithelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3afood safety 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-12 3aluciferase 3amammary glands 3amastitis 3amicroRNA 3amicroorganisms 3amilk quality 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecretion 3astaining 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aXu, Xin1 aTan, Taoling1 aChen, Daijie1 aLiang, Huanjie1 aSun, Kaidi1 aLi, Mingxun1 aZhang, Huimin1 aMao, Yongjiang1 aYang, Zhangping0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2019 June, v. 54, no. 6 p.882-891dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.134383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245023600162520150400398592002801902653002901930653001301959653001601972653001701988653001802005700001702023700001302040700001602053700001202069700001602081700001302097700001802110773010202128856008302230852000902313655001202322IND60656166520221120193747.0190809e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065616652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1115622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Lei10aConstruction of well-ordered electrochemiluminescence sensing interface using peptide-based specific antibody immobilizer and N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) functionalized ferritin as signal indicator for procalcitonin analysis  aWith the aim of providing a powerful analytical tool for early diagnostics of procalcitonin (PCT), an ultrasensitive electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor was developed based on a 3D well-ordered sensing interface and biocompatible signal indicator. Polyaniline nanorod arrays grafted reduced graphene oxide (PANI NRs/rGO) was hybridized with gold nanoparticles (PANI NRs/rGO-Au) as sensing substrate. To improve the specificity, HWRGWVC heptapeptide (HWR) as specific capture-antibody (Ab1) immobilizer was introduced to construct a PANI NRs/rGO-Au-HWR sensing interface. Due to their synergistic effect, the proposed interface improved the incubation efficiency of antibody on substrate with faster electron-transfer for remarkable ECL enhancement. Then, ferritin (Ft) with superiority of biocompatibility was utilized to crosslink with ECL luminophore of N-(aminobutyl)-N-(ethylisoluminol) (ABEI-Ft) as signal indicator. ABEI-Ft exhibited high ECL efficiency and could capture detection-antibody (Ab2) via amine reaction. Due to the enzyme-mimic property of ferric nanocore inside of Ft, abundant reactive oxygen species (ROSs) were produced in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, which further enhanced the ECL signals. On the basis, a novel biosensor was developed using PANI NRs/rGO-Au-HWR as specific sensing interface and ABEI-Ft as signal label, which performed sensitive response to PCT concentration with a wide linear range of 100 fg/mL- 50 ng/mL and a detection limit of 54 fg/mL.  aPublisher supplied data 0aElectrochemiluminescence 0aFerritin 0aPolyaniline 0aHeptapeptide 0aProcalcitonin1 aXue, Jingwei1 aJia, Yue1 aZhang, Yong1 aWu, Dan1 aMa, Hongmin1 aWei, Qin1 aJu, Huangxian0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 142dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1115623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04071naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009200167300001600259500001500275520210700290592002802397650002002425650001102445650001602456650001702472650001202489650002202501650001002523650002202533650002402555650001902579650000902598653003402607653002902641653001702670653001502687653001302702653001602715700006002731700002002791700001802811700002002829700001902849700001802868700002702886700001702913700003202930700002402962700002702986700002703013700002103040700002203061700002403083700002403107700001903131700006303150773011403213856008503327852000903412655001203421IND60591750720221119070602.0180321e20180428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059175072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Zhigao10aPEG-PGA enveloped octaarginine-peptide nanocomplexes: An oral peptide delivery strategy  ap. 125-139.  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this work was the development of a new drug nanocarrier intended to overcome the barriers associated to the oral modality of administration and to assess its value for the systemic or local delivery of peptides. The nanocarrier was rationally designed taking into account the nature of the intestinal barriers and was loaded with insulin, which was selected as a model peptide. The nanocarrier consisted of a complex between insulin and a hydrophobically-modified cell penetrating peptide (CPP), enveloped by a protecting polymer. The selected CPP was octaarginine (r8), chemically conjugated with cholesterol (Chol) or lauric acid (C12), whereas the protecting polymer was poly (glutamic acid)-poly (ethylene glycol) (PGA-PEG). This enveloping material was intended to preserve the stability of the nanocomplex in the intestinal medium and facilitate its diffusion across the intestinal mucus. The enveloped nanocomplexes (ENCPs) exhibited a number of key features, namely (i) a unimodal size distribution with a mean size of 200 nm and a neutral zeta potential, (ii) the capacity to associate insulin (~100% association efficiency) and protect it from degradation in simulated intestinal fluids, (iii) the ability to diffuse through intestinal mucus and, most importantly, (iv) the capacity to interact with the Caco-2 model epithelium, resulting in a massive insulin cell uptake (47.59 ± 5.79%). This enhanced accumulation of insulin at the epithelial level was not translated into an enhanced insulin transport. In fact, only 2% of insulin was transported across the monolayer, and this was correlated with a moderate response of insulin following oral administration to healthy rats. Despite of this, the accumulation of the insulin-loaded nanocarriers in the intestinal mucosa could be verified in vivo upon their labeling with ⁹⁹ᵐTc. Overall, these data underline the capacity of the nanocarriers to overcome substantial barriers associated to the oral modality of administration and to facilitate the accumulation of the associated peptide at the intestinal level.  aPublisher supplied data 3adodecanoic acid 3amodels 3acholesterol 3ananocarriers 3ainsulin 3aintestinal mucosa 3amucus 3apolyglutamic acid 3aoral administration 3azeta potential 3arats 0aOral peptide/protein delivery 0aCell penetrating peptide 0aOctaarginine 0aPEGylation 0apolymers 0aNanocomplex1 aSamaridou, Eleni1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9804-48691 aJaumain, Emilie1 aCoëne, Julie1 aUllio, Gabriela1 aShrestha, Neha1 aGarcia, Josep1 aDurán-Lobato, Matilde1 aTovar, Sulay1 aSantander-Ortega, Manuel J.1 aLozano, M.

METHODS: We conducted a nationwide consumer survey to assess the consumption habits of fish and rapeseed oil and their determining factors in 985 mother–child dyads in Germany. RESULTS: One-fourth of infants ate fish as often as recommended, i.e. at least once per week. Half of the mothers stated that they mainly used rapeseed oil for self-prepared and/or commercial vegetable–potato–meat meals. In contrast, mothers more frequently met recommendations for fish consumption (41 %), but used rapeseed oil (34 %) less often for their own nutrition. Maternal eating behaviour was the most important predictor for both of these n-3 PUFA rich foods in infants’ nutrition. In contrast to infants’ fish consumption, rapeseed oil intake in infancy was found to be influenced by some further factors, i.e. mothers’ social class and omega-3 knowledge, which were also key determinants of mothers’ own fish and rapeseed oil consumption. CONCLUSION: To promote fish with complementary feeding, programs should focus on families whose mothers rarely eat fish. Nutritional campaigns to improve omega-3 knowledge—especially focusing on lower social classes—could be effective in increasing rapeseed oil consumption, although these programs should be combined with environmental improvements as it has been already started through the use of rapeseed oil in commercial baby jars.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomplementary foods 3aconsumer surveys 3aeating habits 3afish 3afish consumption 3ainfancy 3ainfant feeding 3ainfants 3amothers 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arapeseed oil 3asocioeconomic status 3aGermany1 aMesch, Christina M.1 aKersting, Mathilde1 aLibuda, Lars0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2015 Oct., v. 54, no. 7 p.1069-1080dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1436-62077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-014-0784-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245007100210300002000281506007600301520179000377592002802167506003702195650002302232650001002255650002602265650001202291650001502303650002502318650001702343650000902360700002402369700001902393700002502412700002102437700002102458700002202479700002102501700002502522700001402547773017502561856007902736852000902815655001202824IND60172303320221207060921.0150602e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017230332DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.12063031092doi7 aPMC34796002pmcid7 a230124122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinters, Bradley D.10aCannabinoid receptor 1-expressing neurons in the nucleus accumbens  ap. E2717-E2725.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEndocannabinoid signaling critically regulates emotional and motivational states via activation of cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) in the brain. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) functions to gate emotional and motivational responses. Although expression of CB1 in the NAc is low, manipulation of CB1 signaling within the NAc triggers robust emotional/motivational alterations related to drug addiction and other psychiatric disorders, and these effects cannot be exclusively attributed to CB1 located at afferents to the NAc. Rather, CB1-expressing neurons in the NAc, although sparse, appear to be critical for emotional and motivational responses. However, the cellular properties of these neurons remain largely unknown. Here, we generated a knock-in mouse line in which CB1-expressing neurons expressed the fluorescent protein td-Tomato (tdT). Using these mice, we demonstrated that tdT-positive neurons within the NAc were exclusively fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs). These FSIs were electrically coupled with each other, and thus may help synchronize populations/ensembles of NAc neurons. CB1-expressing FSIs also form GABAergic synapses on adjacent medium spiny neurons (MSNs), providing feed-forward inhibition of NAc output. Furthermore, the membrane excitability of tdT-positive FSIs in the NAc was up-regulated after withdrawal from cocaine exposure, an effect that might increase FSI-to-MSN inhibition. Taken together with our previous findings that the membrane excitability of NAc MSNs is decreased during cocaine withdrawal, the present findings suggest that the basal functional output of the NAc is inhibited during cocaine withdrawal by multiple mechanisms. As such, CB1-expressing FSIs are targeted by cocaine exposure to influence the overall functional output of the NAc.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abehavior disorders 3abrain 3acannabinoid receptors 3acocaine 3adrug abuse 3afluorescent proteins 3ainterneurons 3amice1 aKrüger, Juliane M.1 aHuang, Xiaojie1 aGallaher, Zachary R.1 aIshikawa, Masago1 aCzaja, Krzysztof1 aKrueger, James M.1 aHuang, Yanhua H.1 aSchlüter, Oliver M.1 aDong, Yan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Oct. 2, v. 109, no. 40 p.E2717-E2725dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.12063031093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245015600166300002000322520134200342592002801684650001701712650002601729650002001755650001201775650002001787650001501807650001301822650001301835650001901848650001801867650000701885650002101892650002201913650002301935650002701958650002201985650001602007650001502023651001902038700001602057773012702073856008102200852000902281655001202290IND60536248220221118224629.0160806e20151215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053624822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b035132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSgouridis, Fotis10aRelative Magnitude and Controls of in Situ N2 and N2O Fluxes due to Denitrification in Natural and Seminatural Terrestrial Ecosystems Using 15N Tracers  ap. 14110-14119.  aDenitrification is the most uncertain component of the nitrogen (N) cycle, hampering our ability to assess its contribution to reactive N (Nr) removal. This uncertainty emanates from the difficulty in measuring in situ soil N₂ production and from the high spatiotemporal variability of the process itself. In situ denitrification was measured monthly between April 2013 and October 2014 in natural (organic and forest) and seminatural ecosystems (semi-improved and improved grasslands) in two UK catchments. Using the ¹⁵N-gas flux method with low additions of ¹⁵NO₃– tracer, a minimum detectable flux rate of 4 μg N m–² h–¹ and 0.2 ng N m–² h–¹ for N₂ and N₂O, respectively, was achieved. Denitrification rates were lower in organic and forest (8 and 10 kg N ha–¹ y–¹, respectively) than in semi-improved and improved grassland soils (13 and 25 kg N ha–¹ y–¹, respectively). The ratio of N₂O/N₂ + N₂O was low and ranged from <1% to 7% across the sites. Variation in denitrification was driven by differences in soil respiration, nitrate, C:N ratio, bulk density, moisture, and pH across the sites. Overall, the contribution of denitrification to Nr removal in natural ecosystems was ∼50% of the annual atmospheric Nr deposition, making these ecosystems vulnerable to chronic N saturation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3adenitrification 3aforests 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3anitrous oxide 3apH 3asoil respiration 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atracer techniques 3auncertainty 3awatersheds 3aUnited Kingdom1 aUllah, Sami0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Dec. 15, v. 49, no. 24 p.14110-14119dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b035133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245012700167300001400294520129100308592002801599653002101627653002201648653002001670653002201690653002201712653002301734653002101757653001301778653001001791700002501801700001901826700002401845700002101869773011901890856007702009852000902086655001202095IND60130046020221117233644.0151126e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013004602DNAL7 a10.3356/JRR-07-63.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aActkinson, Michael A.10aComparison of the Breeding Biology of Sympatric Red-Tailed Hawks, White-Tailed Hawks, and Crested Caracaras in South Texas  ap. 50-56.  aWe compared the breeding biology of sympatric nesting Red-tailed Hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), White-tailed Hawks (Buteo albicaudatus), and Crested Caracaras (Caracara cheriway) in south Texas during 2003 and 2004. We monitored 46 breeding attempts by Red-tailed Hawks, 56 by White-tailed Hawks, and 27 by Crested Caracaras. Observed nesting success was similar for Red-tailed Hawks (62%%) and Crested Caracaras (61%%), but lower for White-tailed Hawks (51%%). Daily survival rates (0.99) were the same for all three species. Red-tailed Hawks and White-tailed Hawks both fledged 1.13 young per nesting pair and Crested Caracaras fledged 1.39 young per nesting pair. All three species nested earlier in 2004 than in 2003; in addition, the overall nesting density of these three species almost doubled from 2003 (1.45 pairs/km²) to 2004 (2.71 pairs/km²). Estimated productivity of all three species was within the ranges reported from other studies. Given extensive and progressive habitat alteration in some areas of south Texas, and the limited distributions of White-tailed Hawks and Crested Caracaras, the presence of large ranches managed for free-range cattle production and hunting leases likely provides important habitat and may be key areas for conservation of these two species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrested Caracara 0aCaracara cheriway 0aRed-tailed Hawk 0aButeo jamaicensis 0aWhite-tailed Hawk 0aButeo albicaudatus 0abreeding biology 0asympatry 0aTexas1 aKuvlesky, William P.1 aBoal, Clint W.1 aBrennan, Leonard A.1 aHernandez, Fidel0 tJournal of raptor research.g2009 Mar., v. 43, no. 1 p.50-56dThe Raptor Research Foundation, Incx0892-10167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3356%2FJRR-07-63.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001500188245011400203300001100317506007600328520106400404592002801468506003701496650002501533650002901558650002201587650001501609650002301624650002201647650002301669650002801692650002301720650001701743650000701760650002101767650001101788650001801799650001601817650001401833700002001847700001701867700001501884700002301899700002701922773009201949856008102041852000902122655001202131IND60486070320221207071842.0160623e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048607032DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0385-y2doi7 aPMC47542952pmcid7 a283301392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDas, Arpan10aProduction of bioethanol as useful biofuel through the bioconversion of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes)  ap. 70.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWater hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) represents a promising candidate for fuel ethanol production in tropical countries because of their high availability and high biomass yield. Bioconversion of such biomass to bioethanol could be wisely managed through proper technological approach. In this work, pretreatment of water hyacinth (10 %, w/v) with dilute sulfuric acid (2 %, v/v) at high temperature and pressure was integrated in the simulation and economic assessment of the process for further enzymatic saccharification was studied. The maximum sugar yield (425.6 mg/g) through enzymatic saccharification was greatly influenced by the solid content (5 %), cellulase load (30 FPU), incubation time (24 h), temperature (50 °C), and pH (5.5) of the saccharifying medium. Central composite design optimized an ethanol production of 13.6 mg/ml though a mixed fermentation by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MTCC 173) and Zymomonas mobilis (MTCC 2428). Thus the experiment imparts an economic value to water hyacinths that are cleared from choking waterways.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEichhornia crassipes 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aZymomonas mobilis 3abioethanol 3abiomass production 3abiotransformation 3aeconomic valuation 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3apH 3asaccharification 3asugars 3asulfuric acid 3atemperature 3awaterways1 aGhosh, Priyanka1 aPaul, Tanmay1 aGhosh, Uma1 aPati, Bikas Ranjan1 aMondal, Keshab Chandra0 t3 Biotech.g2016 June, v. 6, no. 1 p.70-70dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-016-0385-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02441naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245016600181300001600347520101100363592002801374650001201402650001501414650002501429650002601454650002201480650001501502650001201517650001501529650002701544650001301571653001501584653001601599653001301615653003801628653003501666653001801701700002801719700002701747700002601774773009901800856008701899852000901986655001201995IND60625526320221121035044.0210114e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062552632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlcántara-Durán, Jaime10aUse of a modified QuEChERS method for the determination of mycotoxin residues in edible nuts by nano flow liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry  ap. 144-149.  aA nanoflow liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry method for the quantification of mycotoxins in nuts has been developed. Two strategies based on QuEChERS methodology were evaluated. Thus, EMR-lipid was compared with a conventional mixture of PSA and C18 dispersive solid phase extraction sorbents which have been commonly used in this type of matrices as sample clean-up. The results showed that the use of EMR-lipid reduced more effectively matrix components, achieving a negligible matrix effect for all mycotoxins studied in peanut, pistachio and almond. The proposed method was validated in line with SANTE guidelines using EMR-Lipid as dispersive solid phase extraction sorbent. The lowest concentration level were between 0.05 and 5 μg kg⁻¹, being lower than the maximum levels established by the current legislation. Recovery rates ranged from 75% to 98% was obtained in all sample studied, achieving also satisfactory precision with RSD values lower than 19% in all cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalmonds 3aguidelines 3alaws and regulations 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amycotoxins 3apeanuts 3apistachios 3asolid phase extraction 3asorbents 0aMycotoxins 0aEdible nuts 0aQuEChERS 0aHigh resolution mass spectrometry 0aNanoflow liquid chromatography 0aMatrix effect1 aMoreno-González, David1 aGarcía-Reyes, Juan F.1 aMolina-Díaz, Antonio0 tFood chemistry.g2019 May 01, v. 279 p.144-149dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.1493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03916naa a2200829 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002600191245008500217300001400302506007600316520147800392592002801870506003701898650002701935650002101962650001401983650001501997650001902012650001402031650001402045650001402059650002102073650001902094650002002113650001002133650001902143650002202162650001902184650001402203650001402217650001702231650003702248650001402285650002002299650001402319650002702333650001702360651001302377651000902390651001302399651001202412653002702424653001602451653001602467653001902483653001402502653004102516653001802557653001602575653002102591653001602612700002102628700002202649700002202671700002502693700002002718700002302738700002602761700002302787700001902810700002202829773013002851856008402981852000903065655001203074IND60605060120221207135349.0180720e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060506012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2015.05.0142doi7 aPMC45082342pmcid7 a260072342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatchimakul, Pitchaya10aApoptosis of cholangiocytes modulated by thioredoxin of carcinogenic liver fluke  ap. 72-80.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChronic infection with the food-borne liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, frequently induces cancer of the bile ducts, cholangiocarcinoma. Opisthorchiasis is endemic in Thailand, Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam, where eating undercooked freshwater fish carrying the juvenile stage of this pathogen leads to human infection. Because inhibition of apoptosis facilitates carcinogenesis, this study investigated modulation by thioredoxin from O. viverrini of apoptosis of bile duct epithelial cells, cholangiocytes. Cells of a cholangiocyte line were incubated with the parasite enzyme after which they were exposed hydrogen peroxide. Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis was monitored using flow cytometry, growth in real time and imaging of living cells using laser confocal microscopy. Immunolocalization revealed liver fluke thioredoxin within cholangiocytes. Cells exposed to thioredoxin downregulated apoptotic genes in the mitogen activated protein kinases pathway and upregulated anti-apoptosis-related genes including apoptosis signaling kinase 1, caspase 9, caspase 8, caspase 3, survivin and others. Western blots of immunoprecipitates of cell lysates revealed binding of thioredoxin to apoptosis signaling kinase 1. Together the findings indicated that thioredoxin from O. viverrini inhibited oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of bile duct epithelial cells, which supports a role for this liver fluke oxidoreductase in opisthorchiasis-induced cholangiocarcinogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOpisthorchis viverrini 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3abile ducts 3acarcinogenesis 3acaspase-3 3acaspase-8 3acaspase-9 3aepithelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3afreshwater fish 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aimage analysis 3aingestion 3ajuveniles 3aliver flukes 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aneoplasms 3aopisthorchiasis 3apathogens 3apro-apoptotic proteins 3athioredoxins 3aCambodia 3aLaos 3aThailand 3aVietnam 0aOpisthorchis viverrini 0aLiver fluke 0aThioredoxin 0aCarcinogenesis 0aApoptosis 0aApoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 0aCholangiocyte 0axCELLigence 0aOxidative stress 0aGene arrays1 aRinaldi, Gabriel1 aSuttiprapa, Sutas1 aMann, Victoria H.1 aPopratiloff, Anastas1 aLaha, Thewarach1 aPimenta, Rafael N.1 aCochran, Christina J.1 aKaewkes, Sasithorn1 aSripa, Banchob1 aBrindley, Paul J.0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2015 Aug., v. 65 p.72-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2015.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245006100180300001600241520216500257592002802422650001002450650001402460650001802474650001602492653001202508653001102520653002902531653002102560700001802581773010802599856008802707852000902795655001202804IND60571001020221120151457.0190401e20170910xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057100102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTjørve, Kathleen M.C.12aA proposed family of Unified models for sigmoidal growth  ap. 117-127.  aThe four-parameter Unified Richards model has been applied to the growth of different animal taxa. Traditionally researchers of animal growth have favoured three-parameter models such as the logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy models. However, the growth-rate parameters of the traditional versions of these models are incomparable, and model forms returning starting points for the curves are not available. Therefore, we have reviewed and developed the family of Unified growth models (U-models), including U-versions of the logistic, Gompertz, and von Bertalanffy models, which each have an inflection placement at a fixed percentage of the upper asymptote. Consequently, in order to accommodate for those who prefer a three-parameter model, we also deduce (show) how to derive from the U-Richards a new, generic, three-parameter U-models with any predetermined inflection placement. This means an indefinite number of U-models, which will cover inflection placements at any percentage of the upper asymptote. All U-models have been re-parameterized to exhibit a unified set of parameters, which measure the same thing cross all family members, hence these models are termed the Unified family (or simply U-family). We also discuss how to interpret parameter values and whether to restrain the asymptote to a fixed value. All U-family models can be fitted to data in either of two forms: the first where one of the parameters represents the time of inflection, and the second with a parameter representing the starting value (intersection with the x-axis). Each parameter in these models only affects a single curve-shape characteristic. We show, also by fitting the models to bird growth data, how only a complete U-Richards family of models and accompanying parameter-translation equations will guarantee that we will be able to choose a model that returns realistic values and provides a consistent interpretation of growth data. There should be no enticement to choose other tools for analysing sigmoidal growth. Traditional versions of the Gompertz, logistic, von Bertalanffy or Richard’s models found in the literature have various shortcomings.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aequations 3agrowth models 3aresearchers 0aU-model 0aGrowth 0aParameter interpretation 0aRe-parameterised1 aTjørve, Even0 tEcological modelling.g2017 Sept. 10, v. 359 p.117-127dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2017.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02269naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012000165300001600285520117400301592002801475650003701503650001501540650001801555650001801573650001501591650001501606650001601621650001901637700002101656773017501677856008201852852000901934655001201943IND60769578920221122190649.0220307e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076957892DNAL7 a10.1007/s12257-021-0123-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Da-Yeon10aTwo-component Adsorption Characteristics of Paclitaxel and 10-deacetylpaclitaxel from Taxus chinensis onto Sylopute  ap. 145-155.  aA batch experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of 10-deacetylpaclitaxel (10-DAP) on the adsorption characteristics of paclitaxel in a two-component adsorption of paclitaxel and 10-DAP by varying the concentration of 10-DAP (1,000–3,000 ppm) and adsorption temperature (298–318 K). The maximum adsorbed amount and adsorption rate constant of paclitaxel decreased by 10.1–21.3% and 5.5–28.6% at 298 K, 6.0–20.4% and 5.8–28.4% at 308 K, and 6.2–17.7% and 7.5–29.0% at 318 K, respectively, compared with the single-component adsorption of paclitaxel (control). These results show that the decrease rate was higher as the concentration of 10-DAP increased. In addition, as the concentration of 10-DAP increased, the adsorption rate constant decreased at all the adsorption temperatures, indicating that 10-DAP inhibited the adsorption of paclitaxel. The intraparticle diffusion rates decreased by 2.6–6.6% (10-DAP 1,000 ppm), 3.6–8.2% (10-DAP 2,000 ppm), and 8.0–10.0% (10-DAP 3,000 ppm) compared with the control.

Particle size varied from 126 to 130nm (laser diffraction) and from 114 to 125nm (z-average diameter by dynamic light scattering). The pH values ranged from 4.15 to 4.57 and zeta potential inverted from −15 (LNC) to +23mV (LNC-CS) and from −13 (DAP-LNC) to +21mV (DAP-LNC-CS). Transmission electron microscopy analysis evidenced four layers of micellar structures coating LNC, constituting a hydrophilic corona. For the first time, a sequence of spherical to cylindrical micellar transformation was observed at the nanocapsule corona. Biological assays demonstrated that DAP-LNC, LNC-CS and DAP-LNC-CS act as growth inhibitors of five clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, which exhibited multidrug-resistance to ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, gentamicin, oxacillin and penicillin G, and six strains of three filamentous fungi species: Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. The nanoencapsulation of dapsone improved the inhibitory activity of the drug in both assays. In addition, the presence of chitosan in the formulations provided a better performance of the formulation in the case of S. aureus, while the influence of the nanoencapsulated drug was more pronounced in the antifungal activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus flavus 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aAspergillus niger 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantifungal properties 3abenzylpenicillin 3abioassays 3achitosan 3aciprofloxacin 3aclindamycin 3acoatings 3adapsone 3adrugs 3aerythromycin 3afungi 3agentamicin 3agrowth retardation 3ahydrophilicity 3alight scattering 3amultiple drug resistance 3ananocapsules 3aoxacillin 3apH 3aparticle size 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential 0aLipid-core nanocapsule 0aChitosan 0aDapsone 0aStaphylococcus aureus 0aAspergillus ssp. 0aTransmission electron microscopy1 aMarchi, João G.1 aBergamo, Vanessa Z.1 aFuentefria, Alexandre M.1 aLavayen, Vladimir1 aGuterres, Silvia S.1 aPohlmann, Adriana R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5222-18070 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Dec. 20, v. 511 p.153-161dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2016.09.0863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245009200158300001200250500002000262520130900282592002801591596003601619650001001655650002201665650001301687650002401700651001001724700002901734700002101763700002401784700002401808700001901832700001701851773012501868856007401993852000902067655001202076IND60787653920221122040307.0220809e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078765392DNAL7 a10.1136/vr.1048632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRayner, Emma L10aPrevalence of mutilations and other skin wounds in working donkeys in Tamil Nadu, India  ap. 450.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWounds in working donkeys are a common and preventable welfare problem in many countries. Mutilations, iatrogenic injuries carried out by owners, are a particularly distressing welfare issue. However, little is known about their nature and prevalence. The project aim was to assess the general health and establish the prevalence, nature and severity of mutilations and other skin wounds in donkeys from several communities in Tamil Nadu, India, that were part of a donkey welfare initiative run by the Worldwide Veterinary Service charity. Five hundred and eighty‐two donkeys were examined from five locations and data collected using a predesigned, smartphone app between October 2016 and July 2017. The study revealed that 298 wounds were present in a total of 227 donkeys (39.0 per cent of the population). Mutilations, comprising nose‐splitting, ear‐splitting and branding, were the most common type of skin wound, comprising 62.8 per cent of all wounds. Poorly fitting harnesses and hobbles were also a common cause of injury. These data can be used to design future‐targeted and focused, educational interventions to reduce mutilation practices which are a common and important welfare issue. Further outreach initiatives are urgently needed to improve welfare of donkeys in these regions.  aPublisher supplied data  cAnimal Welfare Foundation (AWF) 3aasses 3amobile telephones 3aoutreach 3aveterinary services 3aIndia1 aAirikkala‐Otter, Ilona1 aSusheelan, Aswin1 aMellanby, Richard J1 aMeunier, Natascha V1 aGibson, Andrew1 aGamble, Luke0 tVeterinary record.g2018 Oct., v. 183, no. 14 p.450-450dBMJ Publishing Group LimitedwJournal:jnl45502x0042-49007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1136/vr.1048633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01540naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245005800165300001800223520047900241592002800720650001300748650001400761650001500775650002200790650001300812700002200825700002300847700005600870700006600926773013400992856007901126852000901205655001201214IND60743257120221119074151.0210707e20210603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074325712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.1c008532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSgorbati, Clara10aSolid-Phase Synthesis of Gly-Ψ[CH(CF₃)NH]-Peptides  ap. 9225-9232.  aThe solid-phase synthesis of Gly-Ψ[CH(CF₃)NH]-peptides is presented.

At pH 3.0 and FBR retention time of 5.7h, 96–98% of the added Fe(II) precipitated (99.1% of which was jarosite). The highest iron oxidation and precipitation rates were 1070 and 28mg/L/h, respectively, and were achieved at pH 3.0. Subsequently, the effect of pH on arsenic removal through sorption and/or co-precipitation was examined by gradually decreasing solution pH from 3.0 to 1.6 (feed pH). At pH 3.0, 2.4 and 1.6, the highest arsenic removal efficiencies obtained were 99.5%, 80.1% and 7.1%, respectively. As the system had ferric precipitates in excess, decreased arsenic removal was likely due to reduced co-precipitation at pH<2.4. As(III) was partially oxidized to As(V) in the system. In shake flask experiments, As(V) sorbed onto jarosite better than As(III). Moreover, the sorption capacity of biogenic jarosite was significantly higher than that of synthetic jarosite. The developed bioprocess simultaneously and efficiently removes iron and arsenic from acidic solutions, indicating potential for mining wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abioprocessing 3acoprecipitation 3aculture flasks 3afluidized beds 3agravity 3airon 3ajarosite 3amining 3aoxidation 3apH 3asorption 3awastewater treatment 0aArsenic removal 0aIron 0apH control 0aFluidized-bed reactor 0aBiogenic jarosite1 aKokko, Marika E.1 aPapirio, Stefano1 aÖzkaya, Bestamin1 aPuhakka, Jaakko A.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2016 Apr. 05, v. 306 p.124-132dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003700110040001800147100002000165245014300185300001800328500001500346520090800361650001501269650002501284650001801309650001901327650001801346650001001364650001201374650002701386650001101413650001801424650002301442650003601465650001601501650002301517650004001540650002201580650003301602653001001635653003701645653002001682700001801702700001301720773010001733852000901833856008701842930003301929945001301962946001301975990002301988655001202011IND2056850320221122012042.0970502e199611  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205685032DNAL7 a89022192pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod55.5.10692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobrinsky, J.R.10aDevelopment of a culture medium (BECM-3) for porcine embryos: effects of bovine serum albumin and fetal bovine serum on embryo development  ap. 1069-1074.  a2019-12-05  aMedia are available that can deliver modest porcine embryonic development from a single-cell zygote to the blastocyst stage. However, few embryos develop to hatched blastocysts by Day 7 in vitro, indicating deficiencies in media that inhibit early embryonic development. A defined culture medium, Beltsville Embryo Culture Medium (BECM-3), was developed to support porcine zygote development to the blastocyst stage. When fetal bovine serum was added by late Day 5 (late morula/early blastocyst stage), 80% of total embryos cultured from Day 2 developed into hatched blastocysts by Day 8. There was also a significant increase in the mean cell number of blastocysts and hatched blastocysts when culture was performed in BECM-3-based media in the absence of BSA fraction V. These studies provide a chemically defined foundation for elucidating key developmental components of preimplantation pig embryos. 3ablastocyst 3abovine serum albumin 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo culture 3aculture media 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxphysiology 2aCattle 2aCulture Media 2aCulture Techniques 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Development 2aFetal Blood 2aMorulaxphysiology 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexpharmacology 2aSwinexembryology 2aZygotexgrowth & development 0aserum 0abeltsville embryo culture medium 0aembryo (animal)1 aJohnson, L.A.1 aRath, D.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1996 Nov., v. 55, no. 5 p.1069-1074wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod55.5.10693Available from publisher's Web site  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03329naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003700110040001800147100002500165245013500190300001800325500001500343520159600358650002101954650001801975650003301993650001502026650000902041650001802050650001902068650001202087650002402099650001202123650002702135650001102162650002502173650002302198650003602221650001102257650002702268650003302295650002402328650001402352653001502366653001302381653001302394653002002407653001302427700002102440773010002461852000902561856008702570930003302657945001302690946001302703990002302716655001202739IND2056849420221122011916.0970502e199611  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205684942DNAL7 a89022112pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod55.5.10122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero-Arredondo, A.10aEffects of follicular fluid during in vitro maturation of bovine oocytes on in vitro fertilization and early embryonic development  ap. 1012-1016.  a2019-12-05  aIn vivo, oocytes mature while bathed in preovulatory follicular fluid, so we studied maturation of oocytes in vitro in media supplemented with such fluid. Bovine oocytes were obtained from 2- to 6-mm follicles from slaughterhouse ovaries and were matured for 24 h in tissue culture medium 199 + 10% estrous cow serum supplemented with bovine follicular fluid (BFF) obtained from a preovulatory follicle either before (0 h) or 8 or 20 h after a GnRH-induced LH surge. After in vitro fertilization, oocytes matured in 10% or 40% 20-h BFF had higher cleavage rates (p < 0.05) than those matured in 10% or 40% 0-h BFF (80% and 86% vs. 46% and 51%, respectively), oocytes matured in 8-h BFF were intermediate. A greater percentage of oocytes showed cumulus expansion with 20-h BFF than with 0-h BFF (p < 0.05). In experiment 2, more (p < 0.05) embryos from oocytes matured in 20% or 40% 20-h BFF developed to blastocysts after culture of embryos compared to those matured in 20% or 40% 0-h BFF (29% and 29%, vs. 7% and 14%, respectively) or those matured in no BFF (12%). Embryos from oocytes matured in a mixture of 0-h and 20-h BFF developed to the blastocyst stage similarly (27%) to those matured in 20-h BFF, suggesting that positive factors in 20-h BFF overcame any inhibitory effect of 0-h BFF. To summarize, bovine oocytes matured with BFF collected 20 h after LH surge result in higher cleavage rates after in vitro fertilization and more blastocysts than those matured in 0-h BFF When the factors responsible are identified, they might be used to enhance maturation of oocytes in vitro. 3afollicular fluid 3aculture media 3afertilization (reproduction) 3ablastocyst 3acows 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo culture 3aoocytes 3aluteinizing hormone 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxphysiology 2aCattle 2aCleavage Stage, Ovum 2aCulture Techniques 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Development 2aFemale 2aFertilization in Vitro 2aFollicular Fluidxphysiology 2aOocytesxphysiology 2aPregnancy 0amaturation 0ain vitro 0acleavage 0aembryo (animal) 0alh surge1 aSeidel, G.E.

Eight (11%) samples were positive for L. monocytogenes, and 39 (56%) samples were found to contain other Listeria spp. Seven pork and one chicken sample contained L. monocytogenes, whereas all beef and lamb were free of L. monocytogenes, Meanwhile, 15 (60%) pork, 11 (52%) chicken, 7 (70%) beef, and 6 (43%) lamb samples were positive for other Listeria spp. The eight confirmed isolates of L. monocytogenes were serologically typed. Six (5 from pork and 1 from chicken) were serotype 1/2a, and the other two isolates (2 pork) were serotype 1/2c and 1/2b. No isolates were of serotypes 3 and 4. All positive samples for L. monocytogenes were frozen meats, and the incidence of Listeria spp. was greater for frozen samples than for fresh. Sixty of 70 samples (22 pork, 8 beef, 11 lamb, and 19 chicken) were used to compare the effectiveness of Oxford medium and Palcam medium for the isolation of L. monocytogenes from meat samples. L. monocytogenes was isolated from seven samples by Palcam medium, while five samples were positive by Oxford medium, indicating that Palcam medium was more effective for recovering L. monocytogenes than Oxford medium. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3ameat 3aretail marketing 3afood contamination 3aculture media 3afrozen foods 3aChina 0acomparisons1 aYan, K.T.1 aFeng, X.M.1 aChen, S.M.1 aLui, A.P.1 aKokubo, Y.0 tJournal of food protection.g1992 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.56-58x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01995naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001400154245007900168300002000247520076600267650001701033650001501050650002001065650001201085650001901097650002001116650001201136650001601148650001801164650001501182650002101197650001901218650001901237653002301256700001701279773010801296852000901404856007701413930003301490945002501523946001301548655001201561IND4377000720221122011531.0060105e20051228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437700072DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05145712doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The percentage of phospholipid removed from muscle homogenates increased with increasing Ca(2+) concentrations at 1 mM citric acid. More than 85% phospholipid and 45% protein in the muscle homogenates were removed at Ca(2+) concentrations of >20 mM in the presence of 1 mM citric acid. At 8 mM Ca(2+), addition of citric acid at 5 mM improved phospholipid removal to approximately 78% from 58% in its absence. Because treatment with 8 mM Ca(2+) alone can remove significant amounts of phospholipid, it is likely that Ca(2+) played the major role in membrane removal in muscle homogenates solubilized at pH 10.5. 3aGadus morhua 3acod (fish) 3aClupea harengus 3aherring 3acell membranes 3afish processing 3acalcium 3acitric acid 3aphospholipids 3aseparation 3aalkali treatment 3amuscle protein 3asolubilization 0amuscle homogenates1 aHultin, H.O.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Dec. 28, v. 53, no. 26 p.10012-10017x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05145713Available from publisher's Web site  a20060210b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle02235naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001800154245014200172300001800314500001500332520090200347650002301249650001601272650001801288650001401306650001301320650001901333650001601352653002301368653003101391653002401422653001301446653001301459700001601472700001901488700001901507773010601526852000901632856007701641930003301718945002501751946001301776655001201789IND4377000420221121235317.0060105e20051228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437700042DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05116482doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

When the reactions were performed in darkness at 45 degrees C, the (-)-epicatechin concentration decreased more rapidly than that of (+)-catechin, and the (-)-epicatechin sample had twice the 440 nm absorbance of the (+)-catechin sample after the 14 day incubation period. The main pigments generated were identified as xanthylium cation pigments regardless of the isomeric character of the phenolic compound. Using a combination of absorbance and ion current data, the xanthylium cation pigments generated from (-)-epicatechin were found to have combined molar absorptivity coefficients 1.8 times that of the xanthylium cation pigments generated from (+)-catechin. The implication of these results on the development of an index of white wine oxidation susceptibility is discussed. 3amodel food systems 3aepicatechin 3afood spoilage 3aoxidation 3acatechin 3aglyoxylic acid 3awhite wines 0aoxidative spoilage 0axanthylium cation pigments 0awhite wine spoilage 0abrowning 0apigments1 aClark, A.C.1 aPrenzler, P.D.1 aScollary, G.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Dec. 28, v. 53, no. 26 p.9993-9998x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05116483Available from publisher's Web site  a20060210b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle02644naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100002300171245012200194300001800316500001500334520133900349650001801688650001101706650001801717650002301735650001001758650003901768650002301807653002901830653001201859653004401871700002401915700002001939773010601959852000902065856007702074930003302151945002502184946001302209655001202222IND4376998020221121222153.0060105e20051228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437699802DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051973r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aGarcia-Reyes, J.F.10aRapid determination of diphenylamine residues in apples and pears with a single multicommuted fluorometric optosensor  ap. 9874-9878.  a2019-12-04  aIn this work, a single flow injection multicommuted system using solid-surface fluorescence spectroscopy has been explored for the determination of diphenylamine in apples and pears. The native fluorescence signal of diphenylamine retained on the solid support (C18 silica gel) was used for its determination (lambda(exc)/lambda(em) 291/372 nm). The sample treatment consists of a liquid-liquid extraction with acetonitrile followed by a cleanup step using primary-secondary amines. The use of a continuous flow assembly implementing multicommutation, based on a set of three-way solenoid valves controlled by appropriate software, provides the automatic control of sample, carrier, and eluting solution with remarkable advantages in relation to conventional flow injection approaches. Using an optimized sampling time, the proposed method was linear in the range 0.25-5 mg kg(-1) with a detection limit of 0.06 mg kg(-1) and RSD (percent) values better than 3%. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of diphenylamine in different apple and pear samples fortified at different concentrations, and recoveries between 78 and 104% were found. The results obtained illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method for the screening and evaluation of postharvest treatment of crops possibly containing diphenylamine. 3adiphenylamine 3aapples 3afood analysis 3afood contamination 3apears 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afungicide residues 0afluorometric optosensors 0asensors 0asolid-surface fluorescence spectroscopy1 aOrtega-Barrales, P.1 aMolina-Diaz, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Dec. 28, v. 53, no. 26 p.9874-9878x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051973r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060210b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/10  aOther US 7aarticle01378naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245013300177300001600310500002400326520037400350650001400724650001700738650002000755650001500775650002600790650001100816650001100827650002000838773014000858852000900998856005701007655001201064IND4456034120221121153005.0110408e196512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445603412DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1965.tb00863.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatoon, Naushaba,14aTHE Distribution of dipeptidase activity in the digestive organs of the larvae of utetheisa pulchella l.

  1 aBasu, A.10aAnalysis of genetic diversity in cultivated jute determined by means of SSR markers and AFLP profiling  ap. 678-685.  aGenetic improvement of the cultivars of jute (Corchorus olitorius L. and Corchorus capsalaris L.) is needed to broaden the genetic base of new cultivars. All the cultivars in use have been evolved through pure line selection from a few common accessions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic diversity available in the cultivated species of jute. Genetic diversity was evaluated by simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker loci and an AFLP assay. A total of 305 polymorphic products were detected by AFLP analysis using 10 pairs of primers (EcoRI and MseI) to amplify template DNA from 49 genotypes of the two jute species. Additionally, polymorphism with two to four allelic lengths was detected with each pair of chloroplast microsatellite primers developed from Nicotiana tabacum L. Results from both evaluations showed that the level of variation between species is high. The two species indeed are distantly related and their maternal origins may be different. On the contrary, genetic variability present at the intraspecific level is low. The resulting dendrogram showed common ancestral origin for many accessions. A few major Indian cultivars of both the species, used as an internal check, were closely related to the wild accessions. Nevertheless, RG, an Indian accession and two Kenyan accessions, KEN/BL/17 and KEN/DS/35C, among the C. olitorius genotypes and CHN/FJ/69 of C. capsularis revealed phenetic distinctiveness from the rest of the genotypes studied. The results indicate that enough diversity exists to broaden the genetic base of new jute cultivars.2 amolecular sequence data 3aCorchorus capsularis 3aCorchorus olitorius 3ajute 3acultivars 3agenetic variation 3aplant genetic resources 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic markers 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aloci 3agenetic polymorphism 3awild relatives 3agenotype 3aphylogeny1 aGhosh, M.1 aMeyer, R.1 aPowell, W.1 aBasak, S.L.1 aSen, S.K.0 tCrop science.g2004 , v. 44, no. 2 p.678-685x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20070215b20070303c00000000  aINDd2CTe2007/01/05  aOther US 7aarticle02103naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002100154245008300175300001800258500001500276520092600291650001601217650001801233650001501251650003101266650001601297650001401313650001601327650002001343650001401363653001701377653002101394700001501415773010601430852000901536856007701545930003301622945002501655946001301680655001201693IND4376424420221121152952.0051202e20051116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437642442DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051559r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Quercetin was the molecule more efficiently oxidized, followed by resveratrol and naringenin. When this molecule was incubated in the presence of GSH, a quinoid derivative was produced. This compound was not obtained in the presence of naringenin or resveratrol, suggesting that in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and lipoxygenase, quercetin may be oxidized to a prooxidant species. When hydrogen peroxide was substituted by hydroperoxy linoleic acid, the same oxidative process was observed. This means that in food products in which lipoxygenase and linoleic acid are presents, quercetin may be oxidized to prooxidant species; in contrast, naringenin and resveratrol may constitute a valid additive for the prevention of the oxidative degradation of foods. 3apolyphenols 3alinoleic acid 3anaringenin 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aperoxidases 3aoxidation 3aresveratrol 3aenzyme activity 3aquercetin 0alipoxygenase 0ahyddroperoxidase1 aMacias, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Nov. 16, v. 53, no. 23 p.9225-9230x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051559r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060206b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle02398naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002500171245005300196300001400249520097800263650001701241650001401258650001201272650002401284650001101308650001401319650000901333650003401342650004101376650001001417651002501427653002201452700002501474700002301499700002401522700002401546700002501570700002401595700002201619700002101641773012501662852000901787856007601796930003301872946001101905655001201916IND4389076420221121152910.0070318e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438907642DNAL7 a174931372pmid7 a10.1111/j.1600-0684.2006.00202.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCianciolo, Rachel E.10aSpontaneous neoplasia in the baboon (Papio spp.)  ap. 61-79.  aThere are several comprehensive reviews of spontaneous neoplasia in non-human primates that compile individual cases or small numbers of cases, but do not provide statistical analysis of tumor incidence, demographics, or epidemiology.

  1 aGandia-Herrero, F.10aCharacterization of the activity of tyrosinase on betaxanthins derived from (R)-amino acids  ap. 9207-9212.  aThe activity of tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) on selected (R)-betaxanthins is characterized in depth, demonstrating that the activity of the enzyme is not restricted to betaxanthins derived from (S)-amino acids. Conversion of (R)-tyrosine-betaxanthin [(R)-portulacaxanthin II] to the pigment (R)-dopaxanthin and its further oxidation to a series of products is described. Compound identity was studied by high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The reaction rate on the (R)-isomer of dopaxanthin is 1.9-fold lower than that obtained for the (S)-isomer in previous studies. Tyrosinase showed stereospecificity in its affinity toward betaxanthins. The characterization of the activity of tyrosinase on (R)-betaxanthins reinforces the role of the enzyme in the biosynthetic scheme of betalains. 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aenzyme activity 3aorganic nitrogen compounds 3asecondary metabolites 3abetalains 3aoxidation 3astereochemistry 0abetaxanthins1 aEscribano, J.1 aGarcia-Carmona, F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Nov. 16, v. 53, no. 23 p.9207-9212x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05141203Available from publisher's Web site  a20060206b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/03  aOther US 7aarticle01790naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001400154245014900168300001800317500001500335520054300350650001400893650001400907650001500921650001300936650001600949650002300965653001500988653001201003653001301015700001501028700002101043700002201064700001901086773010601105852000901211856007701220930003301297945002501330946001301355655001201368IND4376424920221121212112.0051202e20051116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437642492DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051970e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPouvreau, L.10aConformational stability of the potato serine protease inhibitor group  ap. 3191-3196.  aThe thermal unfolding of potato serine protease inhibitor (PSPI), the most abundant protease inhibitor group in potato tuber, was measured using far UV CD spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and DSC. The results indicate that the thermal as well as the guanidinium-induced unfolding of PSPI occurs via a non-two-state mechanism in which at least one stable intermediate is present. Additionally, the occurrence of aggregation, especially at low scan rates, increases the apparent cooperativity of the unfolding and makes the system kinetically rather than thermodynamically controlled. Aggregate formation seems to occur via a specific mechanism of which PSPI in a tetrameric form is the end product and which may involve disulfide interchanges. 3apotatoes 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aserine proteinases 3aheat treatment 3adenaturation 3aprotein secondary structure 0aguanidinium hydrochloride1 aGruppen, H.1 aKoningsveld, G. van1 aBroek, L.A. van den1 aVoragen, A.G.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 20, v. 53, no. 8 p.3191-3196x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048353v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060804b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/05  aOther US 7aarticle04268naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001700164245018300181300001600364520213000380650001402510650001402524650002202538650002402560650001902584650001802603650002402621650003302645650002002678650002902698650001202727650002302739650002802762650006102790650002302851650001102874650005302885650003302938650003102971650004403002650001603046650004703062653002703109653001603136653003103152700001503183700001703198700001803215700001903233700001603252700001603268700001703284700001803301700001703319773008103336852000903417856008603426930003303512945001303545946001303558990002303571655001203594IND2047850920221121105534.0950920e199502  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204785092DNAL7 a77111992pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod52.2.2972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKojima, F.N.10aEffects of 17 beta-estradiol on distribution of pituitary isoforms of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone during the follicular phase of the bovine estrous cycle  ap. 297-304.  aThe objective of this study was to examine the influence of 17 beta-estradiol (E2) on distribution of LH and FSH isoforms during the follicular phase of the bovine estrous cycle prior to the preovulatory surges of LH and FSH. On Day 16 of the estrous cycle (Day 0 = estrus), intact controls (CONT; n = 4) were treated with prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) to induce luteal regression and initiation of the follicular phase. Other cows were also treated with PGF2 alpha and other ovariectomized (OVX; n = 5) or ovariectomized and given E2 implants (OVXE; n = 6) to mimic the pattern of increasing E2 concentrations during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle. Pituitaries were collected 40 h after treatment with PGF2 alpha, or ovariectomy (0 h). Aliquots of pituitary extracts were chromatofocused on pH 10.5-4.0 gradients. The LH resolved into thirteen isoforms (designated A-L and S, beginning with the most basic form) while FSH resolved into nine isoforms (designated I-IX, beginning with the most basic form). The percentage of LH as isoform F (elution pH = 9.32 +/- 0.01) was greater (p < 0.05) in the OVX group (48.5%) than in the OVXE group (45.0%). LH isoforms I (elution pH = 6.98 +/- 0.01) and J (elution pH = 6.48 +/- 0.01) were more abundant (p < 0.05) in cows from the OVXE (2.3 and 5.8%, respectively) than the OVX group (1.4 and 3.7%, respectively). Distribution of LH isoforms in cows from the three groups did not differ (p > 0.10). Distribution of FSH isoforms were similar (p > 0.05) among all groups. In summary, removal of the ovary (OVX) resulted in a slight increase in percentage of the basic LH isoform F, while removal of the ovary and administration of E2 (OVXE) in a pattern that mimicked increasing concentrations of E2 during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle resulted in a slight increase in the percentage of acidic LH isoforms (I and J). There was no influence of ovariectomy or treatment with E2 on distribution of FSH isoform in the pituitary. Thus, gonadotropin heterogeneity does not appear to change significantly during the follicular phase of the bovine estrous cycle. 3abeef cows 3aestradiol 3ahormone secretion 3ahormonal regulation 3aprostaglandins 3aestrous cycle 3aluteinizing hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3apituitary gland 3abiochemical polymorphism 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDinoprostxpharmacology 2aEstradiolxadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacology. 2aEstrusxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexbloodxmetabolism. 2aFollicular Phasexmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLuteinizing Hormonexbloodxmetabolism. 2aOvariectomy 2aPituitary Glandxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0aovariectomized females 0aisohormones 0agonadotropin heterogeneity1 aCupp, A.S.1 aStumpf, T.T.1 aZalesky, D.D.1 aRoberson, M.S.1 aWerth, L.A.1 aWolfe, M.W.1 aKittok, R.J.1 aGrotjan, H.E.1 aKinder, J.E.0 tBiology of reproduction.g1995 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.297-304x0006-33637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod52.2.2973Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02254naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245008700188300001400275520065200289650000900941650002500950650001200975650003900987650005301026650000901079650001801088650003401106650003001140650000901170650003101179650002301210650004101233650006101274651001001335653003001345653001901375700002801394700002201422700002601444700002201470700002301492773011101515852000901626856006901635930003301704946001101737655001201748IND4388207920221121074435.0070225e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438820792DNAL7 a172943542pmid7 a10.1007/s11046-006-0086-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCafarchia, Claudia 10aLymphocutaneous and nasal sporotrichosis in a dog from Southern Italy: Case Report  ap. 75-79.  aSporotrichosis is a chronic, granulomatous and usually lymphocutaneous infection of humans and animals caused by the dimorphic fungus, Sporothrix schenckii.

Overview survey methods are faster and more economic compared to more intensive field surveys. This work tests the quality of both approaches, with a focus on the hydromorphological status assessment. First, WFD criteria and descriptions for hydromorphological quality components and monitoring demands are summarized. A practical assessment of hydromorphological features follows, performed in German and Czech sub-catchments of the Elbe River. Three different methods of stream habitat survey were applied, two German field and overview survey standards by LAWA (Weisseritz basin), and a new Czech field survey method EcoRivHab (Rolava basin). Comparability of results and suitability to fulfil the WFD and CEN standard requirements were tested. Results show that the field and overview survey methods are non-interchangeable and irreplaceable. The overview method provides good results when conditions of large areas need to be evaluated but results seem to overestimate the true quality of the aquatic ecosystem. The field survey methods provide more accurate information. Both field survey methods (LAWA and EcoRivHab) offer good results on hydromorphological river characteristics, evaluated by a point system. Both methods are powerful in evaluating riparian belts and floodplain hydromorphology. The relative added effort of field mapping is overcompensated by the quality of the outputs, which are fully compatible with the aims of the WFD. 3abasins 3aecosystems 3afloodplains 3ahabitats 3amonitoring 3arivers 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3asurveys1 aMatouskova, Milada1 aMatschullat, Jörg.0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 May, v. 603, no. 1 p.53-72dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-007-9247-2 7aarticle02657naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245010500174300001600279500002400295520156800319650001201887650001901899650001201918650001101930650001301941650001701954650001601971650001201987650001201999650002602011650001502037650001902052700002102071773012702092852000902219856005502228655001202283IND4418917720221121074421.0090410e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441891772DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2008.00315.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFOLLETT, PETER A.10aComparative radiation dose mapping of single fruit type and mixed-fruit boxes for export from hawaii  ap. 231-244.  aIncludes references  aA generic radiation quarantine treatment of 400 Gy for insect pests infesting fresh fruit and vegetable and other horticultural commodities was recently approved in the U.S.A.

When radiation was applied to a single box containing one type of fruit or a mixture of two or three fruit types, measured doses were sometimes higher in the mixture. Irradiation of a simulated commercial load of 12 boxes resulted in no significant difference between single-fruit boxes and mixed-fruit boxes. In all experiments, the technical objectives of radiation treatment were met, meaning that all resulting doses fell between the minimum required dose of 400 Gy and the maximum allowable dose of 1,000 Gy. Quarantine treatment protocols to disinfest fresh agricultural commodities of quarantine insect pests are traditionally developed for single commodities. No postharvest quarantine treatment has ever been approved for mixed fresh commodities. The information contained herein using a generic radiation dose will be submitted to regulatory authorities to gain approval for the first disinfestation treatment for mixed fresh commodities. This could lead to export approvals for value-added mixed-fruit gift boxes or other products which would diversify revenue for the tropical fruit industry. 3abananas 3adisinfestation 3aexports 3afruits 3aindustry 3ainsect pests 3airradiation 3amangoes 3apapayas 3apostharvest treatment 3aquarantine 3araw vegetables1 aWEINERT, ERIC D.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2009 Apr., v. 33, no. 2 p.231-244dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2008.00315.x 7aarticle02887naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001300171245010700184300001800291500001500309520162600324650001301950650002401963650001001987650002801997650001302025650001302038650002002051650002502071650001402096653003502110653001502145653001702160700001402177773010502191852000902296856007702305930003302382945002502415946001302440655001202453IND4376130620221121074434.0051118e20050420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437613062DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048550u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWu, C.H.10aInhibitory effect of naturally occurring flavonoids on the formation of advanced glycation endproducts  ap. 3167-3173.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of naturally occurring flavonoids on individual stage of protein glycation in vitro using the model systems of delta-Gluconolactone assay (early stage), BSA-methylglyoxal assay (middle stage), BSA-glucose assay, and G.K. peptide-ribose assay (last stage). In the early stage of protein glycation, luteolin, qucertin, and rutin exhibited significant inhibitory activity on HbA1C formation (p < 0.01), which were more effective than that of aminoguanidine (AG, 10 mM), a well-known inhibitor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). For the middle stage, luteolin and rutin developed more significant inhibitory effect on methylglyoxal-medicated protein modification, and the IC50's were 66.1 and 71.8 micromolar, respectively. In the last stage of glycation, luteolin was found to be potent inhibitors of both the AGEs formation and the subsequent cross-linking of proteins. In addition, phenyl-tert-butyl-nitron served as a spin-trapping agent, and electron spin resonance (ESR) was used to explore the possible mechanism of the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on glycation. The results indicated that protein glycation was accompanied by oxidative reactions, as the ESR spectra showed a clear-cut radical signal. Statistical analysis showed that inhibitory capability of flavonoids against protein glycation was remarkably related to the scavenging free radicals derived from glycoxidation process (r = 0.79, p < 0.01). Consequently, the inhibitory mechanism of flavonoids against glycation was, at least partly, due to their antioxidant properties. 3aproteins 3areaction inhibition 3arutin 3areactive oxygen species 3apeptides 3aluteolin 3apolysaccharides 3aantioxidant activity 3aquercetin 0aadvanced glycation endproducts 0aflavonoids 0aantioxidants1 aYen, G.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 20, v. 53, no. 8 p.3167-3173x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048550u3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060804b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/05  aOther US 7aarticle03725naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001500163245010000178300001400278520156200292650002501854650000901879650001301888650002301901650001601924650001401940650000801954650001501962650002101977650002001998650001802018650002002036650001902056650001202075650001802087650001302105650004302118650002602161650002002187650004502207650000902252650000902261650002102270650002502291650002802316650003802344650004202382650004402424650004302468650004502511653002702556653001202583653001802595700001502613700001602628700001902644700001802663700001902681700001902700773009602719852000902815856008502824930003302909945001302942946001302955990002302968655001202991IND2048056420221121054834.0951002e199501  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204805642DNAL7 a77111802pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod52.1.202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhim, J.A.10aExpression of an avian protamine in transgenic mice disrupts chromatin structure in spermatozoa  ap. 20-32.  aThe objective of this study was to determine the consequences of disrupting spermatozoal chromatin condensation on spermatozoal development and function. The avian protamine, galline, was targeted to spermatids of transgenic mice using the mouse protamine 1 gene promoter. Three transgenic mouse lines were established that expressed galline mRNA at 65%, 120%, and 185% of the level found in rooster testis. Galline mRNA accumulated in round spermatids to levels similar to that of mouse protamine and, as with the mammalian counterpart, translation was delayed until the elongating spermatid stage. Protein gels revealed that galline accumulated in mature spermatozoa whereas mouse protamines were reduced, suggesting that galline competes with protamines for binding to spermatozoal DNA. Acridine orange binding analysis indicated that DNA of the transgenic spermatozoa was not as tightly packed as that of controls. This was corroborated by electron microscopy, which revealed disruption of the normal dense chromatin structure of spermatozoal heads. Despite these perturbations of chromatin condensation, the transgenic spermatozoa were functionally normal, as the majority of transgenic mice had normal fertility. However, in mice that expressed excessive galline, there was a gradual destruction of seminiferous tubules leading to infertility. Our findings suggest that very precise packaging of DNA in germ cells may not be essential for subsequent unpackaging in the pronucleus of fertilized eggs and for subsequent normal development of the embryo. 3aabnormal development 3amice 3aroosters 3atransgenic animals 3aspermatozoa 3achromatin 3aDNA 3aprotamines 3astructural genes 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aspermatogenesis 3amale fertility 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aChickens 2aChromatinxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aInfertility, Malexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtaminesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpermatidsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aSpermatogenesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSpermatozoaxmetabolismxultrastructure. 0achromatin condensation 0agalline 0achimeric gene1 aConnor, W.1 aDixon, G.H.1 aHarendza, C.J.1 aEvenson, D.P.1 aPalmiter, R.D.1 aBrinster, R.L.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1995 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.20-32wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod52.1.203Available from publisher's Web site  a19951102b19951108c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02658naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001500171245012400186300001800310500001500328520097900343650001101322650001201333650001101345650001301356650001101369650002101380650001801401650002501419650001901444650003001463650001001493650001201503650001501515650002501530650002301555650001201578650001001590650001901600650002101619653001301640700001501653700001601668700001701684700001801701700001401719700001401733700001901747700001701766773010401783852000901887856007701896930003301973945002502006946001302031655001202044IND4376217120221121054858.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437621712DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048041s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The structure of the new compound was established by one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) NMR, mass spectrometry, and optical rotation data. Nonpolar extracts of roots and bulbs of carrots, celery, fennel, parsley, and parsnip were investigated for their content of polyacetylenes by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC-DAD). All five species contained polyacetylenes, although carrots and fennel only in minor amounts. Additionally, the cytotoxicity of the four polyacetylenes against five different cell lines was evaluated by the annexin V-PI assay. Falcarinol proved to be the most active compound with a pronounced toxicity against acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CEM-C7H2, with an IC50 of 3.5 micromol/L. The possible chemopreventive impact of the presented findings is discussed briefly. 3afennel 3amyeloma 3acelery 3aleukemia 3ahumans 3aPastinaca sativa 3aDaucus carota 3aPetroselinum crispum 3aplant extracts 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3abulbs 3aparsley 3acell lines 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aFoeniculum vulgare 3acarrots 3aroots 3apolyacetylenes 3aApium graveolens 0alymphoma1 aJohrer, K.1 aGanzera, M.1 aSchubert, B.1 aSigmund, E.M.1 aMader, J.1 aGreil, R.1 aEllmerer, E.P.1 aStuppner, H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2518-2523x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048041s3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle02444naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001800171245011400189300001800303520098400321650001601305650002801321650002201349650002401371650001201395650002001407650002701427650002901454650001601483650001501499650001601514650000701530650001301537650002101550650001701571650001501588653002401603700001801627700001401645700001801659773010401677852000901781856007701790930003301867945002501900946001301925655001201938IND4376218020221121055027.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437621802DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048736t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Wine was produced using yeast cells immobilized on DCM at 20 degrees C, and after alcoholic fermentation, MLF at 27 degrees C followed using immobilized L. casei ATCC 393 cells. A total of 11 repeated alcoholic and subsequent MLF batches were performed within a period of 1 month. As the repeated MLF batches proceeded, the MLF activity of the immobilized biocatalyst was reduced. Malic acid degradation was reduced from 80 to 2%, pH was reduced by 0.5-0.1 unit, acetic acid concentrations were slightly reduced or remained stable (0.002 g/L), the higher alcohols 1-propanol, isobutyl alcohol, and amyl alcohol were decreased by 84, 23, and 11%, respectively, and ethyl acetate concentration was increased by approximately 56%. Wine samples were analyzed by GC-MS before and after MLF, revealing some qualitative differences. 3awhite wines 3amalolactic fermentation 3aimmobilized cells 3aLactobacillus casei 3asawdust 3adelignification 3aalcoholic fermentation 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3awine yeasts 3amalic acid 3aacetic acid 3apH 3aalcohols 3afood composition 3awine quality 3awinemaking 0adelignified sawdust1 aBekatorou, A.1 aNigam, P.1 aKanellaki, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2546-2551x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048736t3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle02990naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001600171245014300187300001800330500001500348520143900363650002101802650003101823650001401854650001701868650001401885650001801899650001601917650001101933650002401944650001701968650001801985650000902003650001902012650002702031653002502058653002002083653002902103653002202132653001402154700001602168700001502184773010402199852000902303856007702312930003302389945002502422946001302447655001202460IND4376217320221121054952.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437621732DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048601n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aChang, H.P.10aModulation of cytokine secretion by garlic oil derivatives is associated with suppressed nitric oxide production in stimulated macrophages  ap. 2530-2534.  a2019-12-04  aWe previously described that garlic oil derivatives differentially suppress the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in activated macrophages. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the garlic derivatives, diallyl sulfide (DAS), diallyl disulfide (DADS), and allyl methyl sulfide (AMS), on cytokine production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, and the association between modulation of cytokines and inhibition of NO production was also assessed. The results indicated that these garlic compounds had different effects on the secretion of activated cytokines, including proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6, as well as the antiinflammatory, IL-10. DAS inhibited the production of all stimulated cytokines in a concentration-dependent manner, and the inhibition was closely associated with the suppression of NO and PGE2 production. DADS repressed the production of stimulated TNF-alpha and IL-10 and increased the production of activated IL-1beta and, to a lesser extent, IL-6; but only the decreased IL-10 production was associated with DADS-induced NO inhibition. Yet, the DAS- and DADS-suppressed NO production was independent of TNF-alpha. AMS, on the other hand, slightly suppressed the stimulated TNF-alpha but enhanced IL-10 production, and such modulation was closely associated with the decrease in NO production. 3adiallyl sulfides 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3asecretion 3anitric oxide 3amonocytes 3ainterleukin-1 3amacrophages 3agarlic 3aplant fats and oils 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3amice 3ainterleukin-10 3atumor necrosis factors 0aallyl methyl sulfide 0adiallyl sulfide 0aorganic sulfur compounds 0adiallyl disulfide 0acytokines1 aHuang, S.Y.1 aChen, Y.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2530-2534x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048601n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle01448naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245005500177300001600232500002400248520059100272650001200863650002000875650001200895650001100907650001200918651001100930773015100941852000901092856005701101655001201158IND4449868420221121055022.0110225e199311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444986842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7976.1993.tb03753.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKowalski, Zbigniew10aBack to Market: Polish Family Farming in the 1990s  ap. 349-356.  aIncludes references  aThe economic reform in Poland has changed dramatically both the income and social position of farmers.

The paper highlights the background of the market reform in Polish agriculture, discusses accessible strategies and formulates some expectations for the future. 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3aimports 3aincome 3amarkets 3aPoland0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g1993 Nov., v. 41, no. 3 p.349-356dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw19495wJournal:jnl44931x0008-39767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7976.1993.tb03753.x 7aarticle01625naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245011100205300001800316500002400334506007600358520027200434506003700706650002600743650001200769650001000781650001000791650003000801650001700831700002000848700001900868700001800887700002100905700001700926773013500943852000901078856008001087856004801167655001201215IND4388542520221207121405.0070304e20070301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438854252DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01994-062doi7 aPMC18287642pmcid7 a172090752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManuzon, Michele Y.10aQuantitative Assessment of the Tetracycline Resistance Gene Pool in Cheese Samples by Real-Time TaqMan PCR  ap. 1676-1677.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA TaqMan real-time PCR assay was developed to quantify the tetS gene pool present in retail cheeses.

Eighteen minerals were quantified for each honey. Multiple linear regression (MLR) was used to establish equations relating the colorimetric CIELAB coordinates to the mineral data. The results obtained shown that lightness (L*) was significantly correlated with S, Ca, Fe, As, Pb, and Cd for the dark honey types (avocado, heather, chestnut, and honeydew). For the light and brown honey types (citrus, rosemary, lavender, eucalyptus, and thyme), C(ab)* and b* showed the lower correlation with the mineral content of the honeys; their regression functions involve a few independent variables (Mg and Al for b* and only Al for C(ab)*). Furthermore, by means of application of linear discriminant analysis to the mineral content, it was possible to obtain a model that classifies the honeys by their lightness. The prediction ability of the built model, determined with the test set method, was 85%. 3adiscriminant analysis 3aclassification 3aequations 3aregression analysis 3acolor 3afood composition 3amineral content 3ahoney 0alinear discriminant analysis 0amultiple linear regression 0amultivariate analysis 0amonofloral honey1 aTerrab, A.1 aHernanz, D.1 aFernandez-Recamales, M.A.1 aHeredia, F.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2574-2580x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048207p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle02765naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001500171245010500186300001800291520156600309650001701875650001401892650001301906650001101919650002101930650002101951650001001972650002201982653002302004653002002027653003102047700001602078773010402094852000902198856007702207930003302284945002502317946001302342655001202355IND4376221420221121044946.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437622142DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048027f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMuller, C.10aScreening of raw coffee for thiol binding site precursors using "in bean" model roasting experiments  ap. 2623-2629.  aThe purpose of the following study was to investigate the influence of coffee roasting on the thiol-binding activity of coffee beverages, and to investigate the potential of various green bean compounds as precursors of thiol-binding sites by using promising "in bean" model roast experiments. Headspace gas chromatographic analysis on coffee brews incubated in the presence of the roasty-sulfury smelling 2-furfurylthiol for 20 min at 30 degrees C in septum-closed vessels revealed that the amounts of "free" thiol decreased drastically with increasing the roasting degree of the beans used for preparation of the brews. A half-maximal binding capacity (BC50) of 183 mg of 2-furfurylthiol per liter of standard coffee beverage was determined for a roasted coffee (CTN value of 67), thus demonstrating that enormous amounts of the odor-active thiol are "bound" by the coffee. Furthermore, biomimetic "in bean" precursor experiments have been performed in order to elucidate the precursor for the thiol-binding sites in the raw coffee bean. These experiments opened the possibility of studying coffee model reactions under quasi-natural roasting conditions and undoubtedly identified chlorogenic acids as well as thermal degradation products caffeic acid and quinic acid as important precursors for low-molecular-weight thiol-binding sites. In particular, when roasted in the presence of transition metal ions, chlorogenic acids and even more caffeic acid showed thiol-binding activity which was comparable to the activity measured for the authentic coffee brew. 3acoffee beans 3araw foods 3aroasting 3athiols 3abinding capacity 3achlorogenic acid 3aodors 3acoffee (beverage) 0agreen coffee beans 0a2-furfurylthiol 0areconstituted coffee beans1 aHofmann, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2623-2629x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048027f3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle02524naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002000154245014100174300001800315520116400333650001501497650001701512650002901529650004301558650001401601650002601615650001701641650002101658650002301679650002401702653002701726700002101753700001801774700001701792700002001809773010401829852000901933856007701942930003302019945002502052946001302077655001202090IND4376214320221121032837.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437621432DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048083g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPatring, J.D.M.10aDevelopment of a simplified method for the determination of folates in baker's yeast by HPLC with ultraviolet and fluorescence detection  ap. 2406-2411.  aA simplified HPLC method for rapid determination of folates in yeast with ultraviolet and fluorescence detection without sample purification has been developed. By use of the column Aquasil C18, specially designed for polar analytes, and gradient elution, it was possible to separate and determine five folate derivatives: tetrahydrofolate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate with fluorescence detection, and 10-formylfolic acid and folic acid with ultraviolet detection. The sample preparation required only a small amount of dry yeast (25-50 mg) and included an extraction of folates by heat treatment and deconjugation of folate polyglutamates to monoglutamates with the use of rat serum conjugase. Validation involved investigation of matrix effects, determination of recovery by standard addition method, repeatability, and stability tests. The dominating folate forms in commercial dry baker's yeast were found to be tetrahydrafolate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate with a total folate content of 2890 microgram/100 g (63.4 nmol/g). The simplicity of the method makes it suitable for folate screening studies of different yeast strains. 3afolic acid 3abakers yeast 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3adetection 3aultraviolet radiation 3afluorescence 3afood composition 3astrain differences 3avitamin supplements 0afolic acid derivatives1 aJastrebova, J.A.1 aHjortmo, S.B.1 aAndlid, T.A.1 aJagerstad, I.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2406-2411x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048083g3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle02840naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002000154245008100174300001800255500001500273520156700288650001701855650001501872650001901887650001901906650002001925650002201945650002001967653003301987653001902020653001402039700001702053700001802070700001602088700001402104700001502118773010402133852000902237856007702246930003302323945002502356946001302381655001202394IND4376214220221121032824.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437621422DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048163k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTomaszewska, E.10aEvaluation of pheromone release from commercial mating disruption dispensers  ap. 2399-2405.  a2019-12-04  aPome fruit growers and crop consultants have expressed concerns about the seasonal release performance of commercial codling moth mating disruption dispenser products. Because of these concerns, we developed a laboratory flow-through volatile collection system (VCS) for measuring the volatile release of the codling moth sex pheromone, codlemone, from commercially available hand-applied dispensers. Under controlled air-flow and temperature conditions, the released vapor was trapped onto a polyurethane foam adsorbent followed by solvent extraction, solvent reduction, and GC/MS determination. Method recovery and breakthrough validations were performed to demonstrate system reliability before determining codlemone release from commercial dispensers field-aged over 140 days. The volatile collection was carried out in a consistent manner among five dispenser types most commonly used by growers, so that direct comparison of performance could be made. The comparison showed differences in the amount of pheromone released and in the patterns of release throughout the season between dispenser types. The variation in release performance demonstrates the need for routine evaluation of commercially marketed mating disruption dispensers. We believe that the simple and cost-effective volatile collection system can assist pheromone dispenser manufacturers in determining seasonal dispenser performance before new products are introduced into the commercial market and in rapidly verifying dispenser release when field-aged dispenser efficacy is in question. 3ainsect pests 3adispensers 3asex pheromones 3avolatilization 3apheromone traps 3amating disruption 3aCydia pomonella 0amating disruptoin dispensers 0ainsect control 0acodlemone1 aHebert, V.R.1 aBrunner, J.F.1 aJones, V.P.1 aDoerr, M.1 aHilton, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2399-2405x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048163k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle02661naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001500171245014800186300001800334500001500352520125700367650002101624650001701645650002101662650001801683650001601701650003101717650002101748650002801769650001501797650002101812650002501833650000901858653001701867653001701884700001401901700001501915773010401930852000902034856007702043930003302120945002502153946001302178655001202191IND4376215120221121024014.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437621512DNAL7 a10.1021/jf040325p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The procyanidins of lotus seedpod were extracted with Me2CO/H2O and purified by Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, with a purity of >98%. ESI-MS analysis showed that the main molecular weight distribution of procyanidins ranged from 291 to 1155, with M + H peak values of 291.1, 579.2, 731.2, 867.2, 1019.4, and 1155.3, respectively. This indicates that the extract contains monomers, dimers, and tetramers of procyanidins, in which the amounts of dimers are greatest, and catechin and epicatechin are the base units. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra confirmed that two to four monomers are linked through C4-C8 (or C6) bonds. The effects of the procyanidins on lipid autoxidation, lipoxygenase activities, and free radical scavenging were also studied. The results showed that 0.1% procyanidins have a strong antioxidant activity in a soybean oil system, better than BHT at the same concentration; inhibited lipoxygenase activity by >90% at a concentration of 62.5 microgram/mL, with an IC50 value of 21.6 microgram/mL; and had IC50 inhibitory values rate to hydroxyl radical of 10.5 mg/L and a scavenging effect on superoxide anion of 17.6 mg/L. 3aNelumbo nucifera 3aprocyanidins 3amolecular weight 3afree radicals 3afood plants 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3amedicinal plants 3afree radical scavengers 3aextraction 3asuperoxide anion 3aantioxidant activity 3apods 0alipoxygenase 0aantioxidants1 aXie, B.J.1 aYang, E.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2441-2445x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf040325p3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001200171245008500183300001800268500001500286520101000301650000901311650001301320650000901333650001701342650001301359650002501372650001401397650001901411653002201430653001401452653001601466653001701482700001601499700001601515700001801531700001501549700001401564773010401578852000901682856007701691930003301768945002501801946001301826655001201839IND4376222920221121001041.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437622292DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048304i2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWen, X.10aEffect of roasting on properties of the zinc-chelating substance in coffee brews  ap. 2684-2689.  a2019-12-04  aApV is a brownish polymer with zinc-chelating activity in brewed coffee. We investigated in this study the effects of roasting on the zinc-chelating, reducing, and antioxidative activities of ApV from light-, medium-, and dark-roasted coffee. We also discuss the effect on the zinc-chelating activity of adding milk to the brewed coffee. The chelating activities of ApVs were evaluated by the tetramethyl murexide method. As the intensity of roasting increased, the yield of ApV increased, and the brown color and molecular weight of ApV respectively became darker and higher. Increasing the degree of roasting also decreased the zinc-chelating activity of ApV. The reducing activities of ApVs estimated by the indophenol method were stronger than those of ascorbic acid. Both the antioxidative activity estimated by the ABTS assay and the reducing activity of ApV increased with roasting. When milk was added to instant coffee and its ApV was prepared, the zinc-chelating activity of ApV was not changed. 3azinc 3aroasting 3amilk 3acoffee beans 3apolymers 3aantioxidant activity 3achelation 3ainstant coffee 0acoffee (beverage) 0areduction 0amelanoidins 0acoffee brews1 aEnokizo, A.1 aHattori, H.1 aKobayashi, S.1 aMurata, M.1 aHomma, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2684-2689x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048304i3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle03295naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003700110040001800147100001700165245009700182300001800279520158100297650001101878650001201889650001901901650001901920650002001939650002001959650001801979650001401997650001202011650002802023650001102051650003202062650002002094650001902114650001102133650002002144650002002164650002202184650003202206650002802238650001202266650003102278653001502309653002402324653001602348653001402364700001802378700001902396773010002415852000902515856008702524930003302611945001302644946001302657990002302670655001202693IND2051820020221120175157.0960621e199511  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205182002DNAL7 a85275122pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod53.5.10882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTatham, B.G.10aEnucleation by centrifugation of in vitro-matured bovine oocytes for use in nuclear transfer  ap. 1088-1094.  aNuclear transfer has the potential to produce large numbers of identical progeny. Current limitations of the technique are associated with the use of micromanipulation for the demanding enucleation and reconstitution procedure. With the overcoming of this limitation, increased numbers of nuclear transfer embryos could be produced. Centrifugation of bovine oocytes at 15 000 X g for 2 min resulted in the stratification of organelles within the cytoplasm, which positioned the metaphase II spindle for enucleation. After removal of the zone pellucida with Pronase, the oocytes were centrifuged in a Percoll density gradient so that the oocytes were stretched apart to form cytoplasts and the metaphase II spindle was separated from the majority of oocytes. Enucleation by centrifugation efficiently produced a consistent population of enucleated cytoplasts from bovine in vitro-matured oocytes. The population of enucleated cytoplasts was enriched by exclusion of the cytoplasts that exhibited an extrusion cone containing metaphase II chromosomes 6 h after centrifugation. The enucleated oocyte cytoplasts were aggregated with blastomeres isolated from in vivo-collected morulae. The aggregated embryonic cells were electrofused to obtain nuclear transfer embryos that were placed into a sodium alginate false zone and were capable of cleavage and development in vitro. The development of nuclear transfer embryos produced through use of centrifugation and aggregation techniques was comparable with that of nuclear transfer embryos produced by micromanipulation techniques. 3acattle 3aoocytes 3acentrifugation 3aembryo culture 3aembryo transfer 3aembryo (animal) 3aelectrofusion 2aAlginates 2aAnimals 2aBlastomeresxphysiology 2aCattle 2aCell Fractionationxmethods 2aCells, Cultured 2aCentrifugation 2aFemale 2aGlucuronic Acid 2aHexuronic Acids 2aMicromanipulation 2aNuclear Transfer Techniques 2aOocytesxultrastructure 2aPronase 2aZona Pellucidaxphysiology 0ablastomere 0acell ultrastructure 0aenucleation 0acytoplast1 aDowsing, A.T.1 aTrounson, A.O.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1995 Nov., v. 53, no. 5 p.1088-1094wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod53.5.10883Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03293naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001800164245013100182300001600313520153600329650001101865650001701876650002301893650001001916650001601926650001601942650002301958650002001981650002302001650001002024650002602034650003202060650001202092650002102104650002102125650004102146650002402187650000902211650002102220650001202241650002402253650001702277653000802294700001502302700001502317700001602332700001802348700002102366700001602387773009902403852000902502856008602511930003302597945001302630946001302643990002302656655001202679IND2051197920221120175238.0960509e199509  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205119792DNAL7 a75786962pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod53.3.7002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonfort, S.L.10aUrinary 3 alpha, 17 beta-androstanediol glucuronide is a measure of androgenic status in Eld's deer stags (Cervus eldi thamin)  ap. 700-706.  aTo determine the primary excretory by-products of testosterone (T), 85 microCi [3H]T was administered i.v. to two adult Eld's deer stags. Blood (10 ml) was collected by jugular venipuncture at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, and 480 min after isotope infusion, and all urine and feces were collected for 96 h after injection. Seventy percent of labeled circulating steroid was conjugated by 30 min postinfusion. The majority (80.4 +/- 3.2%) of T metabolites were excreted into urine, and 95.0 +/- 0.9% of these were conjugated, 95.8 +/- 0.2% being hydrolyzable with glucuronidase. Seven urinary androgen metabolites, including androstanediol (5 alpha-androstan-3 alpha-17 beta-diol and 5 beta-androstan-3 alpha-17 beta-diol), were identified in glucuronidase-hydrolyzed, ether-extracted Eld's deer urine pools after gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A double-antibody 125I RIA for 5 alpha-androstanediol-3 alpha, 17 beta-diol, 17-glucuronide (3 alpha-diol-G) was validated for unprocessed urine. Longitudinal assessments of urine samples collected from 13 stags for 3 yr revealed biological concordance between fluctuations in urinary 3 alpha-diol-G and serum T, as well as seasonal changes in secondary sexual characteristics. Overall correlation between "sameday" matched serum T and urinary 3 alpha-diol-G was 0.58, (n = 6; p < 0.001). Thus, monitoring urinary 3 alpha-diol-G provides a noninvasive, alternative method for characterizing male endocrine interrelationships in an endangered ungulate species. 3aCervus 3atestosterone 3asteroid metabolism 3aurine 3ablood serum 3ametabolites 3aseasonal variation 3asexual behavior 3aendangered species 3amales 2aAndrogensxphysiology 2aAndrostane-3,17-diolxurine 2aAnimals 2aDeerxphysiology 2aFecesxchemistry 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGlucuronatesxurine 2aMale 2aRadioimmunoassay 2aSeasons 2aTestosteronexblood 2aTime Factors 0arut1 aHarvey, E.1 aGeurts, L.1 aPadilla, L.1 aSimmons, H.A.1 aWilliamson, L.R.1 aWildt, D.E.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1995 Sept., v. 53, no. 3 p.700-706wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod53.3.7003Available from publisher's Web site  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04392naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001500164245010700179300001600286520232300302650000902625650001202634650001402646650001702660650002202677650001902699650001702718650002302735650001802758650001402776650002402790650003302814650001202847650002302859650003002882650002802912650004602940650002302986650001103009650004503020650003303065650002603098650003803124650001303162650003603175650002703211650003303238650002403271653001503295700001803310700001403328700001303342700001303355700001703368700001703385700001703402773009803419852000903517856008603526930003303612945001303645946001303658990002303671655001203694IND2051426520221120175338.0960528e199510  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205142652DNAL7 a85474902pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod53.4.9312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneko, H.10aImmunoneutralization of inhibin and estradiol during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in cows  ap. 931-939.  aTo investigate the physiological importance of inhibin and estradiol in the regulation of FSH secretion during the follicular phase of the estrous cycle in cows, animals were passively immunized against the two hormones. Sixteen cows were divided into four equal groups and given injections of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PG) i.m. twice at 8-h intervals on Day 10 of the estrous cycle (Day 0 = day of estrus) to induce luteal regression. At 48 h after the first PG injection, each group of four cows received injections of one of the following: 100 ml castrated goat serum (control serum), 100 ml antiserum against inhibin, 100 ml antiserum against estradiol, or a combination of 100 ml inhibin antiserum and 100 ml estradiol antiserum. The LH surge occurred within 2 days after injection of the control serum or inhibin antiserum, whereas it was not detected in either of the groups passively immunized against estradiol, indicating that passive immunization against estradiol blocks a positive feedback effect of estradiol on LH secretion. There was no clear difference in basal concentrations of LH among the four groups. Injection of the inhibin antiserum resulted in a marked increase (p < 0.01) in plasma concentrations of FSH compared with values in the control group, while there were no significant changes in concentrations of plasma FSH after injection of the estradiol antiserum. Combined administration of the inhibin and estradiol antisera also produced a marked increase (p < 0.01) in plasma concentrations of FSH. The FSH response to the combined immunization was longer in duration than the FSH response to immunization with inhibin alone. Treatment with the inhibin antiserum, either alone or in combination with the estradiol antiserum, induced the growth of a large number of small (greater than or equal to 4 < 7 mm in diameter), medium (greater than or equal to 7 < 10 mm), and large (greater than or equal to 10 mm) follicles compared with numbers in the controls. No increase in the number of follicles was noted in the estradiol-immunized animals. The present results provide strong evidence that inhibin is an important factor in the inhibitory regulation of FSH secretion during the follicular phase in cows, suggesting also that estradiol has a synergistic effect with inhibin on FSH secretion. 3acows 3ainhibin 3aestradiol 3aimmunization 3ahormone secretion 3aprostaglandins 3aprogesterone 3aGraafian follicles 3aestrous cycle 3aantiserum 3aluteinizing hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCorpus Luteumxphysiology 2aDinoprostxpharmacology 2aEstradiolxbloodximmunologyxphysiology. 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexsecretion. 2aFollicular Phasexphysiology 2aImmunization, Passive 2aInhibinsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aKinetics 2aLuteinizing Hormonexsecretion. 2aLuteolysisxphysiology 2aOvarian Folliclexphysiology 2aProgesteronexblood 0aregulation1 aNakanishi, Y.1 aAkagi, S.1 aArai, K.1 aTaya, K.1 aWatanabe, G.1 aSasamoto, S.1 aHasegawa, Y.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1995 Oct., v. 53, no. 4 p.931-939wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod53.4.9313Available from publisher's Web site  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02376naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100002600154245009600180300001800276500001500294520093000309650001601239650001801255650001401273650002801287650001201315650001701327650002501344653002601369653002101395653001701416653002301433700001801456700001601474700002501490700001801515700002301533700001601556700001901572700002801591773010601619852000901725856007701734930003301811945002501844946001301869655001201882IND4376414820221120153956.0051202e20051116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437641482DNAL7 a10.1021/jf05156802doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We isolated several phenolic compounds of extra virgin olive oil (phenyl-ethyl alcohols, lignans, and secoiridoids) by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and identified them using ultraviolet, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, and electrospray ionization MS detection. The purity of these extracts was confirmed by analytical HPLC using two different gradients. Finally, the antioxidant capacity of the isolated compounds was evaluated by measuring the radical scavenging effect on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical, by accelerated oxidation in a lipid model system (OSI, oxidative stability instrument), and by an electrochemical method. 3apolyphenols 3afree radicals 3aolive oil 3afree radical scavengers 3alignans 3asecoiridoids 3aantioxidant activity 0aphenyl-ethyl alcohols 0avirgin olive oil 0aantioxidants 0aphenolic compounds1 aCerretani, L.1 aBendini, A.1 aSegura-Carretero, A.1 aDel Carlo, M.1 aGallina-Toschi, T.1 aLercker, G.1 aCompagnone, D.1 aFernandez-Gutierrez, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Nov. 16, v. 53, no. 23 p.8918-8925x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf05156803Available from publisher's Web site  a20060202b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle02417naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001400154245013200168300001800300500001500318520106500333650001801398650002501416650001801441650002001459650002301479650001301502650001701515650001101532650002201543650002101565650002601586653001901612653001601631653001501647653001801662700001601680773010601696852000901802856007701811930003301888945002501921946001301946655001201959IND4376415120221121060220.0051202e20051116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437641512DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051615o2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this procedure, shrimp tissue is prewashed with solvents followed by overnight acid hydrolysis, during which the side chains of the bound residues are released and simultaneously derivatized with 2-nitrobenzaldehyde. After liquid-liquid extraction cleanup, the derivatives are detected and quantitated using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization interface. The method was validated using control shrimp fortified with each side-chain analyte at 1, 2, and 4 ppb. Method accuracies were >80% with coefficients of variation of <20% for all four analytes. Tissues from dosed shrimp were assayed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for recovering bound residues of nitrofurans. In shrimp dosed with nitrofurans, nitrofurantoin exhibited the lowest level of bound residues. 3afood analysis 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3adrug residues 3aanimal proteins 3afood contamination 3aseafoods 3afurazolidone 3ashrimp 3amass spectrometry 3abinding capacity 3aliquid chromatography 0anitrofurantoin 0anitrofurans 0afualtadone 0anitrofurazone1 aLopez, M.I.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Nov. 16, v. 53, no. 23 p.8934-8939x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051615o3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060203b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle01989naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137072001700154100001800171245006600189300001800255500001500273520076600288650002501054650002701079650001701106650001101123650001501134653002301149700001801172700001701190700001701207700002001224700001501244700001401259700001901273773010601292852000901398856007701407930003301484945002501517946001301542655001201555IND4376416220221121060257.0051202e20051116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437641622DNAL7 a10.1021/jf051398r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Such compounds are studied widely for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, but there is a lack of information about their quantitative recovery. This research highlighted the key role played both by the selection of the cultivar and by the degree of olive fruit ripening on the phenolic content on the SOR. The extraction methods were selected to reach the best quantitative results mainly using a safe food solvent. In light of the results the Soxhlet extraction with ethanol could be proposed as preferential for a higher recovery of verbascoside and its analogues. 3achemical composition 3afood processing wastes 3averbascoside 3aolives 3aextraction 0aphenolic compounds1 aInnocenti, M.1 aLa Marca, G.1 aMercalli, E.1 aGiaccherini, C.1 aRomani, A.1 aErica, S.1 aVincieri, F.F.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Nov. 16, v. 53, no. 23 p.8963-8969x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf051398r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060202b20060302c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle01955naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072001700137100001900154245007800173300001800251500001500269520087900284650001401163650001501177650001101192650002101203653003201224653001501256700001601271700001801287700001501305773010401320852000901424856007701433930003301510945002501543946001301568655001201581IND4376224120221121045822.0051122e20050406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437622412DNAL7 a10.1021/jf048152r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This on-line technique allowed the identification of seven flavonols in southern Italian red onion, quercetin 4'-glucoside and quercetin 3,4'-diglucoside being the most abundant components. Five minor flavonols have been recognized, offering a characteristic profile of such compounds in red onions under study. Quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin 7,4'-diglucoside, quercetin 3,7,4'-triglucoside, and isorhamnetin 4'-glucoside have been previously reported as minor flavonoid components in Allium cepa, while isorhamnetin 3,4'-diglucoside was previously found in Allium ascalonicum. Traces of isorhamnetin 3-glucoside and free quercetin were also detected. 3aflavonols 3aglucosides 3aonions 3afood composition 0asouthern Italian red onions 0aflavonoids1 aCaristi, C.1 aGargiulli, C.1 aLeuzzi, U.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2005 Apr. 6, v. 53, no. 7 p.2733-2740x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf048152r3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060308b20060402c00000000  aINDdRHFe2005/12/02  aOther US 7aarticle03661naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002300183245012000206300001800326500002400344506007600368520137900444506003701823650002501860650002501885650001801910650001401928650002001942650001001962650001801972650002801990650005002018650004802068650001802116650002102134650002402155650003802179650002802217650002402245650003302269650001902302650002002321650003002341650002502371650004102396650004202437650004802479650005502527650002302582650003402605650001502639700002302654700002102677700002002698700002402718700001902742700002602761773010902787852000902896856008202905655001202987IND4448251920221207123728.0110126e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444825192DNAL7 a210757702pmid7 aPMC30151082pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.110.0779902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Gordon G.10aNoncanonical Translation Initiation of the Arabidopsis Flowering Time and Alternative Polyadenylation Regulator FCA  ap. 3764-3777.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe RNA binding protein FCA regulates the floral transition and is required for silencing RNAs corresponding to specific noncoding sequences in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. Through interaction with the canonical RNA 3' processing machinery, FCA affects alternative polyadenylation of many transcripts, including antisense RNAs at the locus encoding the floral repressor FLC. This potential for widespread alteration of gene regulation clearly needs to be tightly regulated, and we have previously shown that FCA expression is autoregulated through poly(A) site choice. Here, we show distinct layers of FCA regulation that involve sequences within the 5' region that regulate noncanonical translation initiation and alter the expression profile. FCA translation in vivo occurs exclusively at a noncanonical CUG codon upstream of the first in-frame AUG. We fully define the upstream flanking sequences essential for its selection, revealing features that distinguish this from other non-AUG start site mechanisms. Bioinformatic analysis identified 10 additional Arabidopsis genes that likely initiate translation at a CUG codon. Our findings reveal further unexpected complexity in the regulation of FCA expression with implications for its roles in regulating flowering time and gene expression and more generally show plant mRNA exceptions to AUG translation initiation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aantisense RNA 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 2a5' Untranslated Regions 2aArabidopsisxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCodon, Initiator 2aFlowersxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPoint Mutation 2aPolyadenylation 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aTranscription Initiation Site 2aTransgenes1 aLaurie, Rebecca E.1 aDijkwel, Paul P.1 aQuesada, Victor1 aStockwell, Peter A.1 aDean, Caroline1 aMacknight, Richard C.0 tplant cell.g2010 Nov., v. 22, no. 11 p.3764-3777dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.110.0779903Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02675naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001600161245020000177300001800377500002400395520092900419650001401348650002601362650003401388650002701422650001301449650001501462650001201477650005401489650002001543650003201563650002101595650001401616650003501630650002001665650001801685650003101703650003201734650002301766650005401789650004501843650002301888700001201911700001801923700001701941773010801958852000902066856008202075655001202157IND4440161520221120140415.0100716s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444016152DNAL7 a205333432pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2010000742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Chaofan10aDevelopment of magnetic octadecylsilane particles as solid-phase extraction adsorbent for the determination of fat-soluble vitamins in fruit juice-milk beverage by capillary liquid chromatography  ap. 2145-2152.  aIncludes references  aA sensitive, fast and simple method based on magnetic octadecylsilane particles was developed for the extraction of three fat-soluble vitamins followed by capillary LC (CLC) analysis with UV detection.

It has been listed as a rare and endangered species in China. Here we studied the effects of plant growth regulators and their concentrations on the induction of somatic embryogenesis and shoot organogenesis from leaf and shoot explants of O. integerrima for the first time. Cytokinins played a crucial role in somatic embryogenesis and shoot organogenesis. Among them, a higher concentration of thidiazuron (10.0-15.0 μM TDZ) could induce both somatic embryogenesis and adventitious shoot formation whereas low concentrations of TDZ (5.0 μM) could only induce adventitious shoots. However, 6-benzyladenine (BA at 5-15 μM) could only induce adventitious shoots. Shoot explants induced more adventitious shoots and somatic embryos than leaf explants when cultured on medium with the same concentration (5-15 μM) of TDZ or 15 μM BA. Medium containing 0.5 μM α-naphthaleneacetic acid and 8 μM indole-3-butyric acid and 0.1% activated charcoal could induce adventitious roots within 1 month. An efficient mass propagation and regeneration system has been established. 3aOchna 3aactivated carbon 3aadventitious roots 3aadventitious shoots 3aculture media 3acytokinins 3aendangered species 3aexplants 3aindole butyric acid 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3aorganogenesis 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos1 aLü, Jinfeng.1 aSilva, Jaime A.

The main difference was found to be the relative percentage of thymoquinone (not found in the essential oil) and carvacryl methyl ether (1.0-1.2% for HD versus t-0.4 for SFE) which can explain the higher antioxidant activity, assessed by Rancimat test, of the SFE volatiles when compared with HD. Thymoquinone is considered a strong antioxidant compound. 3aThymus vulgaris 3aantioxidant activity 3acarbon dioxide 3acarvacrol 3aessential oils 3aflowering 3agamma-terpinene 3alinalool 3aoils 3ap-cymene 3aparticle size 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3atemperature 3athymol 3avolatile compounds 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aChromatography, Supercritical Fluidxmethods 2aDistillationxmethods 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aOils, Volatilexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aParticle Size 2aPlant Oilsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aThymus Plantxchemistry1 aFigueiredo, Ana Cristina1 aBurillo, J.1 aMainar, Ana M.1 aUrieta, José S.1 aBarroso, José G.1 aCoelho, José A.1 aPalavra, António M.F.0 tJournal of separation science.g2010 July, v. 33, no. 14 p.2211-2218dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2010001923Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03492naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009700143300002000240500001500260520170600275650001601981650002501997650002202022650002402044650002502068650002702093650001102120650002402131650001202155650001802167650001302185650002802198650003602226650002202262650002802284650002102312650002502333650003302358650003202391650001302423650004502436650001002481650003402491650001402525650002102539650001702560653002202577653002802599653002302627700002002650700001702670700001502687773009602702852000902798930003302807945001302840946001302853655001202866IND2061077720221120120920.0980105e19970502mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206107772DNAL7 a91152652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonrat, R.10aSolution structure of the carboxyl-terminal LIM domain from quail cysteine-rich protein CRP2  ap. 12001-12007.  a2019-12-05  aProteins of the cysteine-rich protein (CRP) family (CRP1, CRP2, and CRP3) are implicated in diverse processes linked to cellular differentiation and growth control. CRP proteins contain two LIM domains, each formed by two zinc-binding modules of the CCHC and CCCC type, respectively. The solution structure of the carboxyl-terminal LIM domain (LIM2) from recombinant quail CRP2 was determined by multidimensional homo- and heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The folding topology retains both independent zinc binding modules (CCHC and CCCC). Each module consists of two orthogonally arranged antiparallel beta-sheets, and the carboxyl-terminal CCCC module is terminated by an alpha-helix. 15N magnetic relaxation data indicate that the modules differ in terms of conformational flexibility. They pack together via a hydrophobic core region. In addition, Arg122 in the CCHC module and Glu155 in the CCCC module are linked by an intermodular hydrogen bond and/or salt bridge. These residues are absolutely conserved in the CRP family of LIM proteins, and their interaction might contribute to the relative orientation of the two zinc-binding modules in CRP LIM2 domains. The global fold of quail CRP2 LIM2 is very similar to that of the carboxyl-terminal LIM domain of the related but functionally distinct CRP family member CRP1, analyzed recently. The carboxyl-terminal CCCC module is structurally related to the DNA-binding domain of the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. In the two zinc-binding modules of quail CRP2 LIM2, flexible loop regions made up of conserved amino acid residues are located on the same side of the LIM2 domain and may cooperate in macromolecular recognition. 3acell growth 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aspectral analysis 3aDNA-binding domains 3acell differentiation 3amolecular conformation 3aquails 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aChickens 2aEye Proteinsxchemistry 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteins 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProteins 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-mycxchemistry 2aQuail 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSolutions 2aZincxmetabolism 2aZinc Fingers 0aprotein structure 0amolecular sequence data 0achemical structure1 aWeiskirchen, R.1 aKrautler, B.1 aBister, K.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1997 May 2, v. 272, no. 18 p.12001-12007x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03260naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245012800142300002000270520188500290650002302175650001202198650001102210650001302221650001702234650001302251650001802264650002402282650001202306650002402318650004802342650004502390650002502435650001402460650003102474650001502505650002802520700001802548700001402566700001502580700001702595773009802612852000902710930003302719945001302752946001302765655001202778IND2048985720221120105215.0951129e19941118mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204898572DNAL7 a79618692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Y.14aThe chymotrypsin-sensitive site, FFD315, in anthrax toxin protective antigen is required for translocation of lethal factor  ap. 29039-29046.  aThe protective antigen (PA) component of anthrax toxin contains two sites that are uniquely sensitive to proteolytic cleavage. Cleavage at the sequence RKKR167 by the cellular protease furin is absolutely required for toxicity, whereas cleavage by chymotrypsin or thermolysin at the sequence FFD3l5 inactivates the protein, apparently by blocking the ability of PA to translocate the catalytic moieties of the toxins, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF), to the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. To specify the role of the chymotrypsin-sensitive site of PA in the translocation of LF, we altered residues 313-315. None of the mutations in this region interfered with the ability of PA to bind to its cellular receptor, be cleaved by cell surface furin, and bind LF. Substitution of Ala for Asp315 or for both Phe313 and Phe314 reduced the ability of PA to intoxicate cells in the presence of LF by 3- and 7-fold, respectively. Substitution of Phe313 by Cys greatly reduced the rate of LF translocation and delayed toxicity. The rate at which the Cys-substituted PA killed cells was increased significantly by blocking the sulfhydryl group with iodoacetamide, suggesting that this added Cys interacts with cellular proteins and slows translocation of LF. Deletion of the 2 Phe rendered PA completely non-toxic. This deleted PA protein lacked the ability shown by native PA to form oligomers on cells and in solution and to induce release of 86Rb from Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that the chymotrypsin-sensitive site in PA is required for membrane channel formation and translocation of LF into the cytosol. PA double mutants were constructed that cannot be cleaved at either the furin or chymotrypsin sites. These PA proteins were more stable in Bacillus anthracis culture supernatants and may therefore be useful as a replacement for PA in anthrax vaccines. 3aBacillus anthracis 3aanthrax 3atoxins 3aantigens 3achymotrypsin 3amutation 3abinding sites 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterial 2aBacillus anthracisximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Toxinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBiological Transport 2aCHO Cells 2aChymotrypsinxpharmacology 2aCricetinae 2aMolecular Sequence Data1 aKlimpel, K.R.1 aArora, N.1 aSharma, M.1 aLeppla, S.H.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Nov. 18, v. 269, no. 46 p.29039-29046x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02085naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002100158245009300179300001400272500002400286520124000310650001001550650001201560650001401572700002101586773011201607852000901719856007901728655001201807IND4414771320221120072652.0090109e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441477132DNAL7 a216281772pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.08000662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHileman, Lena C.10aMore is better: the uses of developmental genetic data to reconstruct perianth evolution  ap. 83-95.  aIncludes references  aThe origin and evolution of the perianth remains enigmatic. While it seems likely that an undifferentiated perianth consisting of tepals arose early in angiosperm evolution, it is unclear when and how differentiated perianths consisting of distinct organs, such as petals and sepals, arose. Phylogenetic reconstructions of ancestral perianth states across angiosperms have traditionally relied on morphological data from extant species, but these analyses often produce equivocal results. Here we describe the use of developmental genetic data as an additional strategy to infer the ancestral perianth character state for different angiosperm clades. By assessing functional data in combination with expression data in a maximum likelihood framework, we provide a novel approach for investigating the evolutionary history of the perianth. Results of this analysis provide new insights into perianth evolution and provide a proof of concept for using this strategy to explore the incorporation of developmental genetic data in character state reconstructions. As the assumptions outlined here are tested and more genetic data are generated, we hope that ancestral state reconstructions based on multiple lines of evidence will converge. 3acalyx 3acorolla 3aevolution1 aIrish, Vivian F.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2009 Jan., v. 96, no. 1 p.83-95dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.08000663Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02926naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012400127300001800251500022300269500002400492520147200516650002001988650001402008650002602022650002002048650001502068650001302083650001402096650002402110650001302134650001002147650001102157650001902168650002302187700002102210700001502231700001602246700001302262700001502275700001702290700002002307700001502327773011702342852000902459655001202468IND4364635220221120072640.0040923e200408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436463522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiaiese, P.10aSulphur and nitrogen nutrition influence the response of chickpea seeds to an added, transgenic sink of organic sulphur  ap. 1889-1901.  aIn the special issue: Sulphur metabolism in plants--integrating complexity / edited by M.J.

Paper presented at the Society for Experimental Biology Annual Meeting held March 29-April 2, 2004, Edinburgh, UK.  aIncludes references  aIn order to increase the concentration of the nutritionally essential sulphur amino acids in seed protein, a transgene encoding a methionine- and cysteine-rich protein, sunflower seed albumin (SSA), was transferred to chickpeas (Cicer arietinum L). Transgenic seeds that accumulated SSA contained more methionine and less oxidized sulphur than the controls, suggesting that additional demand for sulphur amino acids from the expression of the transgene stimulated sulphur assimilation. In addition, the activity of trypsin inhibitors, a known family of endogenous, sulphur-rich chickpea seed proteins, was diminished in transgenic, SSA-containing seeds compared with the non-transgenic controls. Together, these results indicate that the reduced sulphur sequestered into SSA was supplied partly by additional sulphur assimilation in the developing transgenic seeds, and partly by some diversion of sulphur amino acids from endogenous seed proteins. Growth of chickpeas on nutrient with a high sulphur-to-nitrogen ratio increased the total seed sulphur content and the accumulation of sulphur amino acids in the seeds, and partly mitigated the effect of SSA accumulation on the trypsin inhibitor amount. The results suggest that free methionine and O-acetylserine (OAS) acted as signals that modulated chickpea seed protein composition in response to the variation in sulphur demand, as well as in response to variation in the nitrogen and sulphur status of the plant. 3aCicer arietinum 3achickpeas 3aessential amino acids 3agene expression 3amethionine 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3aprotein composition 3aproteins 3aseeds 3asulfur 3asunflower seed 3atrypsin inhibitors1 aOhkama-Ohtsu, N.1 aMolvig, L.1 aGodfree, R.1 aDove, H.1 aHocart, C.1 aFujiwara, T.1 aHiggins, T.J.V.1 aTabe, L.M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2004 Aug., v. 55, no. 404 p.1889-1901dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002300161245009100184300001600275500002400291520113400315650002101449650001401470650002001484650001901504650003001523650001401553650001601567650003701583650001701620650001801637650003201655650002101687650005201708650005701760650001101817650002201828650002801850650003601878700002001914700001901934700002001953700002401973700002201997700001602019700002402035700002402059700002002083700002202103700002002125700002502145773011102170852000902281856004502290655001202335IND4423433520221120065609.0090718e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442343352DNAL7 a194960852pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2008003312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLappano, Rosamaria10aStructure-activity relationships of resveratrol and derivatives in breast cancer cells  ap. 845-858.  aIncludes references  aResveratrol (RSV) is classified as a phytoestrogen due to its ability to interact with estrogen receptors (ERs). We assessed structure-activity relationships of RSV and the analogs 4,4'-dihydroxystilbene (4,4'-DHS), 3,5-dihydroxystilbene (3,5-DHS), 3,4'-dihydroxystilbene (3,4'-DHS), 4-hydroxystilbene (4-HS) using as model systems the ERα-positive and negative MCF7 and SkBr3 breast cancer cells, respectively. In binding assays and transfection experiments RSV and the analogs showed the following order of agonism for ERα: 3,4'-DHS > 4,4'-DHS > 4-HS > RSV, while 3,5-DHS did not elicit any ligand properties. Computational docking analysis and real-time PCR revealed for each analog a distinct ERα binding orientation and estrogen target gene expression profile. Interestingly, the aforementioned order of ligand activity was confirmed in proliferation assays which also showed the lack of growth stimulation by 3,5-DHS. Our data suggest that subtle changes in the structure of the RSV derivatives examined may be responsible for the different ERα-mediated biological responses observed in estrogen-sensitive cancer cells. 3abreast neoplasms 3aestrogens 3agene expression 3agene targeting 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areceptors 3aresveratrol 3astructure-activity relationships 3atransfection 2aBinding Sites 2aBreast Neoplasmsxpathology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEstrogen Receptor alphaxchemistryxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aModels, Molecular 2aStilbenesxpharmacology 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aRosano, Camillo1 aMadeo, Antonio1 aAlbanito, Lidia1 aPlastina, Pierluigi1 aGabriele, Bartolo1 aForti, Luca1 aStivala, Lucia Anna1 aIacopetta, Domenico1 aDolce, Vincenza1 aAndò, Sebastiano1 aPezzi, Vincenzo1 aMaggiolini, Marcello0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2009 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.845-858dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200800331 7aarticle02412naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001800169245011900187300001800306500002400324520095700348650001501305650002201320650002301342650001301365650001101378650001701389650001601406650000901422650001901431650001801450650001101468650001501479650003301494650003901527650002201566650003101588650001701619650003001636650003001666650002201696700002201718700001701740773009901757852000901856856005301865655001201918IND4421756320221120054629.0090612e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442175632DNAL7 a194142512pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shao-Jung10aSynthesis of zero-valent copper-chitosan nanocomposites and their application for treatment of hexavalent chromium  ap. 4348-4353.  aIncludes references  aThis study used ionotropic crosslinking to synthesize chitosan-tripolyphosphate chelating resin beads, which are used to fabricate zero-valent copper-chitosan nanocomposites.

The results showed that, the adsorption behavior of hexavalent chromium from aqueous solution onto fabricated nanocomposites has better adsorption capacity than that of the chitosan-tripolyphosphate beads. 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achemical reduction 3achromium 3acopper 3acrosslinking 3adispersions 3aions 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aresins 2aAdsorption 2aChitosanxchemical synthesis 2aChromiumxisolation & purification 2aCopperxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMicrospheres 2aNanocompositesxchemistry 2aPolyphosphatesxchemistry 2aSpectrum Analysis1 aLiou, Tzong-Horng1 aMi, Fwu-Long0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Oct., v. 100, no. 19 p.4348-4353dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.04.013 7aarticle02773naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245009100185300001600276500002400292520115000316650001401466650002201480650001801502650001101520650001301531650001401544650001801558650001701576650001601593650003101609650004201640650001401682650002801696650004701724650001001771650004301781650003801824650004601862650004901908650002901957650002201986700002302008700001702031700001902048700001502067773010402082852000902186856004802195655001202243IND4434289620221120034145.0100319e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443428962DNAL7 a201309952pmid7 a10.1007/s11120-010-9534-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOja, V.q(Vello)10aEquilibrium or disequilibrium?

During the re-reduction from stromal reductants the mutual interdependence of the two signals followed the theoretical relationship calculated assuming redox equilibrium between plastocyanin (PC) and P700, with the equilibrium constant of 40 ± 10 (ΔE m = 86-99 mV) in most of the measured 24 leaves of nine plant species. The presence of non-oxidizable PC of up to 13% of the whole pool, indicating partial control of electron transport by PC diffusion, was transiently detected during a saturation pulse of white light superimposed on FRL or on low WL. Nevertheless, non-oxidizable PC was absent in the steady state during fast light-saturated photosynthesis. It is concluded that in leaves during steady state photosynthesis the electron transport rate is not critically limited by PC diffusion, but the high-potential electron carriers PC and P700 remain close to the redox equilibrium. 3aC3 plants 3aelectron transfer 3afar-red light 3aleaves 3alighting 3aoxidation 3aphotosystem I 3aplastocyanin 3awhite light 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aElectron Transportxradiation effects 2aElectrons 2aFerredoxinsxmetabolism 2aHelianthusxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aLight 2aOxidation-Reductionxradiation effects 2aPhotosynthesisxradiation effects 2aPhotosystem I Protein Complexxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPlastocyaninxmetabolism 2aSpectrum Analysis1 aEichelmann, Hillar1 aAnijalg, Agu1 aRämma, Heikko1 aLaisk, Agu0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2010 Mar., v. 103, no. 3 p.153-166dSpringer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-010-9534-z 7aarticle02340naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245012800168300001600296500002400312520117300336650001701509650001801526650001601544650002101560650001801581650001001599650001201609650001101621650001501632650003401647650001101681650001601692651001301708700002101721700001701742773008501759852000901844856008901853655001201942IND4440473520221123013925.0100727s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444047352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegnet Abebaw.14aThe impact of a food security program on household food consumption in Northwestern Ethiopia: A matching estimator approach  ap. 286-293.  aIncludes references  aWith the financial support from various development partners, Ethiopia has designed and implemented several programs to improve household food security. Yet, food insecurity is still a major challenge to several millions of people in the country and it is questionable whether the different food security programs implemented over the past years have been successful. Using a propensity score matching method to control for pre-intervention differences, this study examined the impact on household food calorie intake of an integrated food security program (IFSP), which had been implemented in Northwestern Ethiopia by two non-governmental organizations as a case study. The estimated results provide evidence that IFSP has a positive and statistically significant effect on food calorie intake. In particular, IFSP has raised physical food calorie intake by 30% among the beneficiary households. However, we also found that IFSP has differential impact depending on family size, landownership and gender of head of household. Overall, the paper provides evidence that supporting integrated food security programs is important to improve food security in rural areas. 3acase studies 3aenergy intake 3afamily size 3afood consumption 3afood security 3afoods 3afunding 3agender 3ahouseholds 3anongovernmental organizations 3apeople 3arural areas 3aEthiopia1 aFentie, Yibeltal1 aKassa, Belay0 tFood policy.g2010 Aug., v. 35, no. 4 p.286-293dPergamon Pressx0306-91927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02420naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002400186245013300210300001600343500002400359506007600383520050500459506003700964650000801001650001401009650002201023650001601045650002101061650002001082650001001102650002201112650001201134650001801146650003601164650002901200650005401229650005001283650002801333650003501361650003701396650003101433650002301464650001101487650002801498650003501526650003001561650002901591700002001620700002201640773008601662852000901748856008501757655001201842IND4440665420221207133837.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444066542DNAL7 a201748152pmid7 aPMC29103142pmcid7 a10.1007/s00412-010-0262-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhlsson, R.q(Rolf)10aCTCF shapes chromatin by multiple mechanisms: the impact of 20 years of CTCF research on understanding the workings of chromatin  ap. 351-360.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMore than 10⁹ base pairs of the genome in higher eucaryotes are positioned in the interphase nucleus such that gene activation, gene repression, remote gene regulation by enhancer elements, and reading as well as adjusting epigenetic marks are possible.

DNA can be methylated at specific C residues and each histone molecule can be covalently modified at a large variety of amino acids in both their tail and core domains. Furthermore, nucleosomes are not static entities and both their position and histone composition can also vary. As a consequence, chromatin behaves as a highly dynamic cellular component with a large combinatorial complexity beyond DNA sequence that conforms the epigenetic landscape. This has key consequences on various developmental processes such as root and flower development, gametophyte and embryo formation and response to the environment, among others. Recent evidence indicate that posttranslational modifications of histones also affect cell cycle progression and processes depending on a correct balance of proliferating cell populations, which in the context of a developing organisms includes cell cycle, stem cell dynamics and the exit from the cell cycle to endoreplication and cell differentiation. The impact of epigenetic modifications on these processes will be reviewed here. 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3aamino acids 3acell cycle 3acell differentiation 3acell proliferation 3aflowering 3ahistones 3anucleosomes 3anucleotide sequences 3apost-translational modification 3astem cells 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCell Proliferation 2aEpigenesis, Genetic 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aNucleosomesxmetabolism1 aSanchez, M.P.1 aRamirez-Parra, E.1 aGutierrez, C.0 tHeredity.g2010 July, v. 105, no. 1 p.80-91x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/hdy.2010.503Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03350naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002500186245010300211300001600314500002400330506007600354520133400430506003701764650002101801650001401822650002701836650001301863650001701876650001701893650001201910650003001922650002101952650002701973650003902000650006202039650004802101650001502149650001102164650006202175650002902237650004602266650001202312650005002324650002702374650004502401650002402446700001902470700002002489700001702509700002202526700002002548773008602568852000902654856008502663655001202748IND4440666020221207133236.0100730s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444066602DNAL7 a202379352pmid7 aPMC29198282pmcid7 a10.1007/s00412-010-0267-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanenbaum, Marvin E.10aCyclin G-associated kinase promotes microtubule outgrowth from chromosomes during spindle assembly  ap. 415-424.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring mitosis, all chromosomes must attach to microtubules of the mitotic spindle to ensure correct chromosome segregation. Microtubule attachment occurs at specialized structures at the centromeric region of chromosomes, called kinetochores. These kinetochores can generate microtubule attachments through capture of centrosome-derived microtubules, but in addition, they can generate microtubules themselves, which are subsequently integrated with centrosome-derived microtubules to form the mitotic spindle. Here, we have performed a large scale RNAi screen and identify cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) as a novel regulator of microtubule generation at kinetochores/chromatin. This function of GAK requires its C-terminal J-domain, which is essential for clathrin recycling from endocytic vesicles. Consistently, cells lacking GAK show strongly reduced levels of clathrin on the mitotic spindle, and reduction of clathrin levels also inhibits microtubule generation at kinetochores/chromosomes. Finally, we present evidence that association of clathrin with the spindle is promoted by a signal coming from the chromosomes. These results identify a role for GAK and clathrin in microtubule outgrowth from kinetochores/chromosomes and suggest that GAK acts through clathrin to control microtubule outgrowth around chromosomes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3achromatin 3achromosome segregation 3aclathrin 3akinetochores 3amicrotubules 3amitosis 3amitotic spindle apparatus 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCentromerexmetabolism 2aChromosome Segregationxphysiology 2aChromosomes, Humanxgeneticsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aClathrinxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxmetabolism 2aKinetochoresxphysiology 2aMicrotubulesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aMitosis 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interfering 2aSpindle Apparatusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTubulinxmetabolism1 aVallenius, Tea1 aGeers, Erica F.1 aGreene, Lois1 aMäkelä, Tomi P.1 aMedema, Rene H.0 tChromosoma.g2010 Aug., v. 119, no. 4 p.415-424dSpringer-Verlagx0009-59157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00412-010-0267-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02224naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245016200169300001800331500002400349520108500373650001201458650001401470650001001484650001501494650001101509650001801520650001101538651002101549700001701570700002201587700001601609700002001625700001901645773009201664852000901756856008501765655001201850IND4440038120221122225820.0100716s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444003812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-010-1451-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaupach, Michael J.10aGenetic homogeneity and circum-Antarctic distribution of two benthic shrimp species of the Southern Ocean, Chorismus antarcticus and Nematocarcinus lanceopes  ap. 1783-1797.  aIncludes references  aDuring the last years, molecular studies revealed significant population differentiation and cryptic species within various benthic and pelagic marine Antarctic taxa. This is unexpected due to the lack of obvious barriers to gene flow and strong current systems. Using mitochondrial (COI, 16S rDNA) and nuclear (28S rDNA: D2) gene fragments, we tested whether two circum-Antarctic benthic shrimps with planktotrophic larvae, Chorismus antarcticus and Nematocarcinus lanceopes, show patterns of regional differentiation. For both species, the 16S and the 28S fragment were invariant. However, for COI we found 24 different haplotypes for Chorismus antarcticus and 54 for Nematocarcinus lanceopes. No significant differentiation was observed among populations or regions. Furthermore, we found signatures of a population expansion in the late Pleistocene hinting at an impact of large-scale glaciations in particular on the shallow-water shrimp Chorismus antarcticus, supporting a (re)colonization and demographic expansion of this shrimp species in response to climate oscillation. 3aclimate 3agene flow 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3alarvae 3aribosomal DNA 3ashrimp 3aAntarctic region1 aThatje, Sven1 aDambach, Johannes1 aRehm, Peter1 aMisof, Bernhard1 aLeese, Florian0 tMarine biology.g2010 Aug., v. 157, no. 8 p.1783-1797dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1451-33Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03055naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245010300185300001600288500002400304520129800328650001501626650001801641650001601659650002001675650001901695650002201714650001501736650001301751650002201764650001201786650001801798650003501816650004701851650006001898650001101958650002001969650002001989650004302009650001102052650001302063650001402076650003402090650002802124650003502152650002202187650002702209650003602236700002002272700002102292773010702313852000902420856004802429655001202477IND4406056920221122230010.0080523e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440605692DNAL7 a183503192pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-008-0336-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozma, Gabriella10aReplacement of a Drosophila Polycomb response element core, and in situ analysis of its DNA motifs  ap. 595-603.  aIncludes references  aLong-term repression of homeotic genes in the fruit fly is accomplished by proteins of the Polycomb Group, acting at Polycomb response elements (PREs). Here we use gene conversion to mutate specific DNA motifs within a PRE to test their relevance, and we exchange PREs to test their specificity. Previously we showed that removal of a 185 bp core sequence from the bithoraxoid PRE of the bithorax complex results in posteriorly directed segmental transformations. Mutating multiple binding sites for either the PHO or the GAF proteins separately in the core bithoraxoid PRE resulted in only rare and subtle transformations in adult flies. However, when both sets of sites were mutated, the transformations were similar in strength and penetrance to those caused by the deletion of the 185 bp core region. In contrast, mutating the singly occurring binding site of another DNA-binding protein, DSP1 (reportedly essential for PRE-activity), had no similar effect in combination with mutated PHO or GAF sites. Two minimal PREs from other segment-specific regulatory domains of the bithorax complex could substitute for the bithoraxoid PRE core. Our in situ analysis suggests that core PREs are interchangeable, and the cooperation between PHO and GAF binding sites is indispensable for silencing. 3aDrosophila 3abinding sites 3afruit flies 3agene conversion 3ahomeotic genes 3anucleotide motifs 3apenetrance 3aproteins 3aresponse elements 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGene Conversion 2aGenes, Homeobox 2aHigh Mobility Group Proteinsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPolycomb Repressive Complex 1 2aPolycomb-Group Proteins 2aRepressor Proteinsxmetabolism 2aResponse Elements 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics1 aBender, Welcome1 aSipos, László.0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2008 June, v. 279, no. 6 p.595-603dSpringer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-008-0336-3 7aarticle03167naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245007800146300002000224500001500244520116600259650001301425650002101438650002301459650003001482650001101512650002501523650002501548650003401573650001501607650001201622650002401634650001201658650001801670650002301688650001301711650004801724650001601772650002801788650001801816650001101834650001201845650002801857650003001885650002801915650005101943650003901994650004702033650003902080650003402119650003302153653001202186653001602198653002802214653001902242653002002261700001602281700002002297773009602317852000902413930003302422945001302455946001302468655001202481IND2061077920221122213306.0980105e19970502mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206107792DNAL7 a91152792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurnari, B.A.10apch1+, A second essential C-type cyclin gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe  ap. 12100-12106.  a2019-12-05  aThe Schizosaccharomyces pombe gene pch1+ (pombe cyclin C homology) was isolated in a two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with Cdc2. The cyclin box region of Pch1 protein shares greatest sequence identity with mammalian and Drosophila C-type cyclins (approximately 33% identity). Pch1 is significantly less similar to Mcs2 (19% identity), a second member of the C-type cyclin family in S. pombe. Cdc2 co-precipitates with Pch1 in S. pombe cell lysates, although Cdc2 may not be the major catalytic partner of a Pch1 kinase in vivo. Purified Pch1-associated kinase phosphorylated myelin basic protein, histone H1, and a peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal domain repeat of RNA polymerase II. The amount of pch1 mRNA does not oscillate during the cell cycle, as is the case for mRNA transcripts of other C-type cyclin genes. deltapch1 cells are inviable, therefore S. pombe has two essential genes that encode members of the C-type cyclin family, pch1+ and mcs2+. The deltapch1 mutation causes pleiotropic morphological defects and an associated growth deficiency, but loss of Pch1 activity does not result in a cdc cell cycle-arrest phenotype. 3aproteins 3astructural genes 3asequence alignment 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3aclones 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3acell cycle 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCyclin C 2aCyclinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA Primers 2aDrosophila melanogaster 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHumans 2aMammals 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Multimerization 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSchizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques 0akinases 0acomparisons 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u92879 0aessential genes1 aRussell, P.1 aLeatherwood, J.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1997 May 2, v. 272, no. 18 p.12100-12106x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03668naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009700145300002000242500001500262520162800277650001601905650001701921650002401938650002201962650002701984650002402011650002102035650002002056650002202076650002002098650002002118650002802138650002002166650002202186650003402208650004702242650002702289650005302316650001302369650003802382650002202420650002402442650004802466650003802514650005702552653001302609653001202622653001502634653001502649653002602664653001402690653003302704700001502737700001402752700001602766700002002782700001402802773009802816852000902914930003302923945001302956946001302969655001202982IND2038555920221122180237.0940406e19931125mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203855592DNAL7 a82270142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLegendre, L.10aPhospholipase C activation during elicitation of the oxidative burst in cultured plant cells  ap. 24559-24563.  a2019-12-05  aAlthough phospholipase C hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides constitutes one of the major second messenger pathways in animal cells, its participation in signal transduction in higher plants has not been established. To determine whether activation of phosphatidylinositol-directed phospholipase C might be involved in signaling the elicitor-induced oxidative burst in plants, suspension-cultured soybean cells were treated with two stimulants of the H2O2 burst and examined for polyphosphoinositide turnover. Both polygalacturonic acid elicitor and the G protein activator, mastoparan, promoted a transient increase in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) content that exceeded basal IP3 levels (0.9 +/- 0.4 pmol of IP3/10(6) cells, n = 28) by 2.6- and 7-fold, respectively. In each case, intracellular IP3 content reached a maximum at 1 min post-stimulation and declined to near basal levels during the subsequent 5-10 min. Neomycin sulfate, an inhibitor of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, blocked the IP3 transient, and Mas-17, an inactive analogue of mastoparan, induced no change in IP3. Thin layer chromatography of lipid extracts of the soybean cells corroborated the above results by revealing a rapid decrease in phosphatidylinositol monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate following polygalacturonic acid elicitor and mastoparan (but not Mas-17) stimulation. Since the rise in IP3 preceded H2O2 production and since neomycin sulfate inhibited the appearance of both, we hypothesize that phospholipase C activation might constitute one pathway by which elicitors trigger the soybean oxidative burst. 3aGlycine max 3abiosynthesis 3ainositol phosphates 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aguanosine triphosphate 3asignal transduction 3abinding proteins 3aphospholipase C 3agalacturonic acid 3apolysaccharides 3aenzyme activity 3acell suspension culture 2aCells, Cultured 2aEnzyme Activation 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aInositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphatexbiosynthesis 2aNeomycinxpharmacology 2aPectinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aPeptides 2aPhosphatidylinositolsxmetabolism 2aRespiratory Burst 2aSignal Transduction 2aSoybeansxcytologyxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aType C Phospholipasesxmetabolism 2aWasp Venomsxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 0aproteins 0arelease 0amastoparan 0aregulation 0apolygalacturonic acid 0ag protein 0ainositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate1 aYueh, Y.G.1 aCrain, R.1 aHaddock, N.1 aHeinstein, P.F.1 aLow, P.S.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1993 Nov. 25, v. 268, no. 33 p.24559-24563x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02709naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001800161245017800179300001800357500002400375520121400399650002301613650001601636650002001652650001801672650002001690650002301710650002201733650002401755650003601779650004101815650003101856650002901887650003501916650002101951650004101972700001502013700001902028700001702047773010802064852000902172856008202181655001202263IND4441073620221122045853.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444107362DNAL7 a205749542pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2010000512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qingyang10aIonic liquid for single-drop microextraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection to determine carbonyl compounds in environmental waters  ap. 2376-2382.  aIncludes references  aA sensitive method based on ionic liquid for single-drop liquid microextraction coupled with HPLC-UV was developed for the determination of carbonyl compounds in environmental waters using 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [C₈min][PF₆] as extraction solvent and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine as derivatizing agent. The extraction parameters affecting the enrichment factors such as solvent volume, pH, extraction time and salt concentration were investigated. A homemade funnel form polytetrafluoroethylene sleeve was fixed at the tip of the syringe needle and this allowed the use of 10 μL drop of ionic liquid for direct immersion extraction. Under the optimal conditions, the remarkable enrichment factors up to 150-fold were obtained depending on the target analytes. The method has been validated when rectilinear relationship was obtained between the concentrations of analytes and peak area in the range of 5-100 ng/mL, the correlation coefficients were from 0.995 to 0.998, and the limit of detection was in the range of 0.04-2.03 ng/mL.

As for any real-world sample type, the development of rapid and reliable methods for (i) sample identification (in this case, bacterium type), and (ii) constituent identification (in this instance, the fatty acid profile) is desirable. In this research, a half-an-hour procedure, to analyze bacteria, was developed: a 2-min one-step sample preparation step was followed by a relatively fast comprehensive 2D GC-MS separation (25 min). Furthermore, dedicated MS libraries were constructed for the identification of bacteria and fatty acids. Finally, data processing, only qualitative at this stage, was carried out with the support of a novel comprehensive 2D GC software. 3abacteria 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3aplant tissues 2aBacillus subtilisxchemistry 2aEscherichia colixchemistry 2aFatty Acidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aPseudomonas aeruginosaxchemistry 2aPseudomonas fluorescensxchemistry 2aSoftware 2aStaphylococcus aureusxchemistry 2aTime Factors1 aTranchida, Peter Quinto1 aDugo, Paola1 aCamera, Erminia La1 aBisignano, Giuseppe1 aConte, Lanfranco1 aMondello, Luigi0 tJournal of separation science.g2010 Aug., v. 33, no. 15 p.2334-2340dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2010001603Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03805naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245018700144300002000331500001500351520191500366650001102281650001702292650002202309650002402331650002502355650001602380650001702396650001802413650002402431650001802455650003302473650002702506650001502533650001702548650006402565650002802629650003002657650004102687650002502728650002702753650003402780650002502814650003302839653001702872653001902889653001502908653002802923653002502951700001802976700001402994700001603008773009903024852000903123930003303132945001303165946001303178655001203191IND2057258020221122040026.0970522e19960920mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205725802DNAL7 a87985242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogel, B.S.10aAbietadiene synthase from grand fir (Abies grandis). cDNA isolation, characterization and bacterial expression of a bifunctional diterpene cyclase involved in resin acid biosynthesis  ap. 23262-23268.  a2019-12-05  a(-)-Abietic acid, the principal diterpenoid resin acid of the wound-induced oleoresin secreted by grand fir (Abies grandis), is synthesized by the cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to (-)-abieta-7(8),13(14)-diene, followed by sequential three-step oxidation of the C-18 methyl group of the olefin to a carboxyl function. The enzyme catalyzing the cyclization reaction, abietadiene synthase, was purified from stems of wounded grand fir saplings and was digested with trypsin. Amino acid sequence information from the resulting peptides allowed construction of degenerate oligonucleotide primers, which amplified a 551-base pair fragment from a wound-induced stem cDNA library. This hybridization probe was then utilized to screen the wound-induced stem cDNA library, from which three cDNA clones were isolated that were functionally expressed in Escherichia coli, thereby confirming that a single protein catalyzes the complex, multistep cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to abietadiene. cDNA isolate Ac22.1, which yielded the highest expressed level of cyclase activity, was 2861 base pairs in length and encoded an 868-amino acid open reading frame that included a putative plastidial transit peptide. Deduced amino acid sequence comparison to other terpene cyclases revealed an amino-terminal region of the abietadiene synthase, which resembles those of enzymes that employ substrate double bond protonation to initiate the carbocationic reaction cascade, and a carboxyl-terminal region of the synthase, which resembles those of enzymes that employ ionization of the substrate allylic diphosphate ester function to initiate the cyclization reaction. This apparent fusion of segments of the two distinct terpenoid cyclase types is consistent with the novel mechanism of the bifunctional abietadiene synthase in catalyzing both protonation-initiated and ionization-initiated cyclization steps. 3alyases 3abiosynthesis 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3aamino acid sequences 3aresin acids 3aditerpenoids 3aAbies grandis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aDiterpenesxmetabolism 2aAbietanes. 2aGene Library 2aIsomerasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenanthrenesxmetabolism 2aPolyisoprenyl Phosphatesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTerpenesxmetabolism 2aTreesxenzymologyxgenetics. 0apurification 0agenbank/u50765 0aprecursors 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aWildung, M.R.1 aVogel, G.1 aCroteau, R.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1996 Sept. 20, v. 271, no. 38 p.23262-23268x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03598naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245014500144300001800289520174500307650002202052650001102074650001202085650002202097650002102119650002502140650002502165650002402190650001202214650001802226650003202244650001602276650003502292650001102327650002802338650005702366650002502423650003302448650001202481650002402493650003002517650003402547650002502581653001602606653003302622653002802655653001902683653001902702700001402721700002002735700001702755700001802772700002002790773009402810852000902904930003302913945001302946946001302959655001202972IND2038208420221122035934.0940325e19940204mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203820842DNAL7 a81063562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDever, T.E.10aDetermination of the amino acid sequence of rabbit, human, and wheat germ protein synthesis factor eIF-4C by cloning and chemical sequencing  ap. 3212-3218.  aThe small eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4C is implicated in the initiation pathway, where it enhances ribosome dissociation into subunits and stabilizes the binding of the initiator Met-tRNAi to 40 S ribosomal subunits. In order to elucidate the function of eIF-4C, its structure has been further characterized. The amino acid sequence of many peptides from rabbit reticulocyte and wheat germ eIF-4C have been determined chemically From the chemical sequencing of the rabbit protein, it was noted that at least two different eIF-4C molecules were present which differed by conservative substitutions at three positions (2 aspartic acid for glutamic acid switches and 1 valine for isoleucine switch). By the use of unique sequences with low codon degeneracy, primers were used to obtain a polymerase chain reaction product of appropriate size and sequence. This product was then used to isolate full-length coding sequence cDNA clones for human eIF-4C. A similar strategy was used to design PCR primers and then isolate a wheat cDNA clone which lacked the coding region for the first 23 amino acids, but contained a complete 3'- untranslated region. The protein amino acid sequence of wheat germ eIF-4C is 68% identical with the mammalian protein, and, allowing for the most conservative substitutions, the proteins are 76% similar. Both the mammalian and wheat germ proteins are 143 amino acids in length and have molecular weights of about 16,400. A unique feature of eIF-4C is its apparent "polarity" as 9 of the first 15 amino acids are basic while 13 of the last 20 amino acids are acidic. This dipole nature may enable the protein to interact with both the ribosome (perhaps via the rRNA) and other translation initiation factors. 3aTriticum aestivum 3ahumans 3arabbits 3acomplementary DNA 3abinding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aDNA Primers 2aEukaryotic Initiation Factor-1 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Initiation Factorsxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aRabbits 2aRestriction Mapping 2aReticulocytesxmetabolism 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTriticumxmetabolism 0atranslation 0aeukaryotic initiation factor 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l18960 0agenbank/l080601 aWei, C.L.1 aBenkowski, L.A.1 aBrowning, K.1 aMerrick, W.C.1 aHershey, J.W.B.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1994 Feb. 4, v. 269, no. 5 p.3212-3218x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02180naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245009800169300001800267500002400285520110800309650001901417650001201436650001401448650002001462650002201482650002101504650001101525650001301536650001501549650002201564700002401586700002101610773009301631852000901724856008501733655001201818IND4441581020221122025750.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444158102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-010-1464-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavid, Gwendolyn K.10aLatitudinal variability in spatial genetic structure in the invasive ascidian, Styela plicata  ap. 1955-1965.  aIncludes references  aIncreases in temperature can shorten planktonic larval durations, so that higher temperatures may reduce dispersal distances for many marine animals. To test this prediction, we first quantified how minimum time to settlement is shortened at higher temperatures for the ascidian Styela plicata. Second, using latitude as a correlate for ocean temperature and spatial genetic structure as a proxy for dispersal, we tested for a negative correlation between latitude and spatial genetic structure within populations, as measured by anonymous DNA markers. Spatial genetic structure was variable among latitudes, with significant structure at low and intermediate latitudes (high and medium temperatures) and there was no genetic structure within high-latitude (low temperature) populations. In addition, we found consistently high genetic diversity across all Australian populations, showing no evidence for recent local bottlenecks associated S. plicata's history as an invasive species. There was, however, significant genetic differentiation between all populations indicating limited ongoing gene flow. 3aStyela plicata 3aanimals 3agene flow 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3alatitude 3aprediction 3awater temperature1 aMarshall, Dustin J.1 aRiginos, Cynthia0 tMarine biology.g2010 Sept., v. 157, no. 9 p.1955-1965dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1464-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03234naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245013500162300001800297500002400315520207800339650001302417650002302430650000902453650002002462650001502482650002702497650002202524650002502546651001702571700002102588700001802609700002302627700002302650773009302673852000902766856008502775655001202860IND4441581620221122005436.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444158162DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-010-1471-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeske, P.

Such issues are particularly important in species with low dispersal potential, many of which exist as genetically distinct regional stocks. The roman, Chrysoblephus laticeps, is an overexploited, commercially important sparid endemic to South Africa. Post-recruits display resident behavior and occupy small home ranges, making C. laticeps a suitable model species to study genetic structure in marine teleosts with potentially low dispersal ability. We used multilocus data from two types of highly variable genetic markers (mitochondrial DNA control region and seven microsatellite markers) to clarify patterns of genetic connectivity and population structure in C. laticeps using samples from two MPAs and several moderately or severely exploited regions. Despite using analytical tools that are sensitive to detect even subtle genetic structure, we found that this species exists as a single, well-mixed stock throughout its core distribution. The high levels of connectivity identified among sites support the findings of previous studies that have indicated that inshore MPAs are an adequate tool for managing overexploited temperate reef fishes. Even though dispersal of adult C. laticeps out of MPAs is limited, the fact that the large adults in these reserves produce exponentially more offspring than their smaller counterparts in exploited areas makes MPAs a rich source of recruits. We nonetheless caution against concluding that the lack of structure identified in C. laticeps and several other southern African teleosts can be considered to be representative of marine teleosts in this region in general. Many such species are represented in more than one marine biogeographic province and may be comprised of regionally adapted stocks that require individual management. 3aSparidae 3aconservation areas 3afish 3agenetic markers 3ahome range 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation structure 3aSouth Africa1 aForget, F.

Here we report the isolation of an Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA, FFC (fifty-four chloroplast homologue), that encodes a chloroplast protein (54CP) homologous to the 54-kDa subunit of the signal recognition particle. 54CP shares 27% identity with mammalian SRP54 and 44% identity with the Escherichia coli ffh gene product suggesting a prokaryotic origin for this gene. FFC is a nuclear gene encoding a 62-kDa cytoplasmically synthesized precursor that is capable of being imported into isolated chloroplasts and processed to a 53-kDa stromal polypeptide. Antibodies generated against a portion of 54CP recognize an endogenous 53-kDa chloroplast protein that sediments at 4 S and 70 S, the latter form may be associated with ribosomes. The FFC transcript is most abundant in green shoot tissue whereas etiolated buds and roots have transcript levels about 30 and 10%, respectively, relative to light grown green shoots. By analogy with the eukaryotic signal recognition particle which targets secretory proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum, it is speculated that 54CP may target chloroplast proteins to either the thylakoid or envelope membranes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleoproteins 3abinding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3achloroplasts 3aEscherichia coli 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3abuds 3aroots 3ashoots 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aribonucleoproteins 3aetiolation 0acomparisons 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/z219701 aHoffman, N.E.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1993 Oct. 15, v. 268, no. 39 p.22175-22180x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02880naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245007500163300001800238500002400256500001500280520157300295650001101868650002001879650002501899650001001924650001101934650001701945650002401962650001401986650001202000650001902012650002002031650002302051650001402074650001802088650000902106650001302115650001202128651001402140653001602154700001802170700002302188773009302211852000902304856008502313655001202398IND4441582220221122005630.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444158222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-010-1477-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHufnagl, Marc10aHermaphroditism in brown shrimp: lessons from field data and modelling  ap. 2097-2108.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis study was undertaken to further clarify whether the brown shrimp, Crangon crangon (Linnaeus 1758), is a gonochorist, a facultative or an obligate hermaphrodite. Juvenile shrimps were sampled from intertidal habitats along the German Wadden Sea coast with a push net and from a power plant water inlet to quantify the share of primary females. Length-based sex ratios were determined for about 27,000 individuals using external characteristics. Observed sex ratios were mainly female-biased, and also large males occurred regularly in the catch. This indicates that sex at hatch is not male as would be characteristic for an obligate protandric hermaphrodite and that not all male shrimps change sex. A cohort-based computer simulation, including sex-specific growth rates, mortality and seasonally varying recruitment, generated sex ratios comparable to the field. The observed decline in the proportion of males with increasing size can be explained solely by faster growth of females without involving hermaphroditism. Based on temperature-dependent growth and moult rates as well as length-specific numbers of eggs per female, the potential egg production of primary and secondary females was modelled, yielding contributions of secondary females of <1%. Sex change in C. crangon has previously been observed and may be interpreted as an evolutionary relict of this species having evolved in a habitat characterized by lower population densities, lower predation levels and increased longevity compared to today's living conditions in North Sea coastal waters. 3ashrimp 3aCrangon crangon 3aprimary productivity 3amales 3amodels 3asex reversal 3acomputer simulation 3amortality 3amolting 3aegg production 3ahermaphroditism 3apopulation density 3apredation 3acoastal water 3aeggs 3ahabitats 3afemales 3aNorth Sea 0arecruitment1 aTemming, Axel1 aDänhardt, Andreas0 tMarine biology.g2010 Sept., v. 157, no. 9 p.2097-2108dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1477-63Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03054naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245014000173300001800313500002400331520188400355650001102239650002302250650001102273650002402284650001402308650000902322650001202331650001502343650001302358650001302371650002302384650001202407650001502419651001502434700002002449773009302469852000902562856008502571655001202656IND4441582020221122005619.0100820s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444158202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-010-1475-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrantes, Kátya Gisela10aImportance of freshwater flow in terrestrial-aquatic energetic connectivity in intermittently connected estuaries of tropical Australia  ap. 2071-2086.  aIncludes references  aδ¹³C was used to identify seasonal variations in the importance of autochthonous and allochthonous sources of productivity for fish communities in intermittently connected estuarine areas of Australia's dry tropics. A total of 224 fish from 38 species were collected from six intermittently connected estuarine pools, three in central Queensland (two dominated by C₃ forest and one by C₄ pasture) and three in north Queensland (one dominated by C₃ and two by C₄ vegetation). Samples were collected before and after the wet season. Fish collected in the two forested areas in central Queensland had the lowest δ¹³C, suggesting a greater incorporation of C₃ terrestrial material. A seasonal variation in δ¹³C was also detected for these areas, with mean δ¹³C varying from −20 to −23‰ from the pre- to the post-wet season, indicating a greater incorporation of terrestrial carbon after the wet season. Negative seasonal shifts in fish δ¹³C were also present at the pasture site, suggesting a greater dependence on carbon of riparian vegetation (C₃ Juncus sp.) in the post-wet season. In north Queensland, terrestrial carbon seemed to be incorporated by fish in the two C₄ areas, as δ¹³C of most species shifted towards slightly heavier values in the post-wet season. A two-source, one-isotope mixing model also indicated a greater incorporation of carbon of terrestrial origin in the post-wet season. However, no seasonal differences in δ¹³C were detected for fish from the forested area of north Queensland. Overall, hydrologic connectivity seemed to be a key factor in regulating the ultimate sources of carbon in these areas. It is therefore important to preserve the surrounding habitats and to maintain the hydrologic regimes as close to natural conditions as possible, for the conservation of the ecological functioning of these areas. 3aJuncus 3aanimal communities 3acarbon 3aecological function 3aestuaries 3afish 3aforests 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3apastures 3aseasonal variation 3atropics 3awet season 3aQueensland1 aSheaves, Marcus0 tMarine biology.g2010 Sept., v. 157, no. 9 p.2071-2086dSpringer-Verlagx0025-31627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-010-1475-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02607naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002400136245006100160300001800221500002400239520171900263650001501982650001901997650001402016650001102030650001302041650001202054650002402066650001302090700001902103773011102122852000902233856003902242655001202281IND4421520120221121102925.0090605e20090615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442152012DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.73102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGopakumar R,d1972-12aA fuzzy dynamic flood routing model for natural channels  ap. 1753-1767.  aIncludes references  aA fuzzy dynamic flood routing model (FDFRM) for natural channels is presented, wherein the flood wave can be approximated to a monoclinal wave. This study is based on modification of an earlier published work by the same authors, where the nature of the wave was of gravity type. Momentum equation of the dynamic wave model is replaced by a fuzzy rule based model, while retaining the continuity equation in its complete form. Hence, the FDFRM gets rid of the assumptions associated with the momentum equation. Also, it overcomes the necessity of calculating friction slope (Sf) in flood routing and hence the associated uncertainties are eliminated. The fuzzy rule based model is developed on an equation for wave velocity, which is obtained in terms of discontinuities in the gradient of flow parameters. The channel reach is divided into a number of approximately uniform sub-reaches. Training set required for development of the fuzzy rule based model for each sub-reach is obtained from discharge-area relationship at its mean section. For highly heterogeneous sub-reaches, optimized fuzzy rule based models are obtained by means of a neuro-fuzzy algorithm. For demonstration, the FDFRM is applied to flood routing problems in a fictitious channel with single uniform reach, in a fictitious channel with two uniform sub-reaches and also in a natural channel with a number of approximately uniform sub-reaches. It is observed that in cases of the fictitious channels, the FDFRM outputs match well with those of an implicit numerical model (INM), which solves the dynamic wave equations using an implicit numerical scheme. For the natural channel, the FDFRM outputs are comparable to those of the HEC-RAS model. 3aalgorithms 3adynamic models 3aequations 3afloods 3afriction 3agravity 3amathematical models 3amomentum1 aMujumdar, P.P.0 tHydrological processes.g2009 June 15, v. 23, no. 12 p.1753-1767dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7310 7aarticle02484naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245018000142300002000322520084700342650002501189650001501214650001901229650002201248650002501270650002501295650002401320650001201344650001801356650001401374650002301388650003101411650003301442650001201475650007001487650006801557650002801625650002101653650003401674653001201708653002801720653001901748700001901767700001501786773009701801852000901898930003301907945001301940946001301953655001201966IND2061106220221121050643.0980106e19960607mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206110622DNAL7 a86627932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHomma, K.10aPurification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of a novel growth factor from the conditioned medium of NIH-Sape-4, an embryonic cell line of Sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly)  ap. 13770-13775.  aA growth factor from the conditioned medium of NIH-Sape-4, an embryonic cell line of the flesh fly, was purified to homogeneity.

Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is considered the most important disease of wheat in Central Asia and the Caucasus (CAC). Although stripe rust has been present in the region for a long time, it has become a serious constraint to wheat production in the past 10 years. This is reflected by the occurrence of five epidemics of stripe rust in the CAC region since 1999, the most recent in 2010. Several wheat varieties occupying substantial areas are either susceptible to stripe rust or possess a low level of resistance. Information on the stripe rust pathogen in terms of prevalent races and epidemiology is not readily available. Furthermore, there is an insufficient understanding of effective stripe rust resistance genes in the region, and little is known about the resistance genes present in the commercial varieties and advanced breeding lines. The deployment of resistant varieties is further complicated by putative changes in virulence in the pathogen population in different parts of the CAC. Twenty four out of 49 improved wheat lines received through international nurseries or other exchange programs showed high levels of resistance to stripe rust to local pathogen populations in 2009. Fifteen of the 24 stripe rust resistant lines also possessed resistance to powdery mildew. It is anticipated that this germplasm will play an important role in developing stripe rust resistant wheat varieties either through direct adoption or using them as parents in breeding programs. 3aPuccinia striiformis 3abreeding lines 3acrop production 3adisease outbreaks 3agenes 3agermplasm 3aparents 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3araces 3avirulence 3awheat 3aArmenia 3aAzerbaijan 3aKazakhstan 3aKyrgyzstan 3aTajikistan 3aTurkmenistan 3aUzbekistan1 aSharma, R.

This product is one of the supply-managed commodities in Canada, but unlike other commodities, where food safety risks are extensively explored and reported, information on the prevalence of enteric organisms (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter) and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in layers in Canada are limited. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of select bacteria and the associated AMR patterns in layer flocks using 2 sample matrices. Farms were located within FoodNet Canada and the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance sentinel sites (SS). Fecal samples (Ontario: ONSS1a, ONSS1b) and environmental sponge swabs (British Columbia: BC(SS2a)) were collected. Salmonella prevalence was 29% and 8% in ONSS1a and ONSS1b, respectively, and 7% in BC(SS2a). S. Kentucky and S. Livingstone were the most frequently isolated serovars and no S. Enteritidis was detected. Campylobacter was not detected in the BC sponge swabs but was isolated from 89% and 53% of Ontario fecal samples (ON(SS1a) and ON(SS1b), respectively). Seven C. jejuni from Ontario were ciprofloxacin-resistant. Escherichia coli prevalence was high in both sample types (98%). Overall, tetracycline resistance among E. coli ranged from 26% to 69%. Resistance to ceftiofur (n = 2 isolates) and gentamicin (n = 2) was relatively low. There were diverse resistance patterns (excludes susceptible isolates) observed among E. coli in Ontario (10 patterns) and British Columbia (14 patterns). This study revealed that fecal samples are more informative for farm-level monitoring of pathogen and AMR prevalence. Without further validation, sponge swabs are limited in their utility for Campylobacter detection and thus, for public health surveillance. 3aEscherichia coli 3aFoodNet (CDC) 3aSalmonella 3aantibiotic resistance 3aceftiofur 3achickens 3adiet 3aeggs 3afood safety 3agentamicin 3amonitoring 3apathogens 3apublic health 3aserotypes 3atetracycline 3aveterinary medicine 3aBritish Columbia 3aOntario1 aGow, Sheryl P.1 aLeger, David F.1 aFlockhart, Logan1 aDaignault, Danielle1 aDesruisseau, Andrea1 aZabek, Erin1 aPollari, Frank1 aReid-Smith, Richard J.0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2021 Jan., v. 85, no. 1 p.27-35dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33390650/40uhttp://handle.usda.gov/10.13031/7361610  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010500125300001600230520167200246650002001918650002601938700001501964700001401979773009401993852000902087930003302096945001302129946001302142655001202155IND2059174520221120140057.0970826e199707  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205917452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolter, T.10aMolecular analysis of insulin resistance in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes of obese Zucker rats  ap. E59-E67.  aIsolated ventricular cardiomyocytes obtained from lean and genetically (fa/fa) obese Zucker rats were used to correlate alterations of insulin-induced glucose transport activation and GLUT-4 translocation to possible defects of the insulin signaling cascade. Maximal stimulation with insulin was found to produce an unaltered translocation of GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane (4.2- and 3.7-fold increase for lean and obese rats, respectively). However, a largely reduced sensitivity of 3-O-methylglucose transport could be detected in obese rats at physiological doses of insulin (completely unresponsive at 8 x 10(-11) M compared with 3-fold stimulation of glucose transport in lean controls). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit and the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) was stimulated identically in cardiomyocytes from both lean and obese rats. Labeling of cells with [33P]orthophosphate revealed a marked increase in the serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the obese group (370% of lean controls), with a concomitant reduction in IRS-1 abundance (30-40%). The reduced sensitivity of glucose transport at 8 x 10(-11) M insulin was then found to correlate to a completely blunted response of IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity in cardiomyocytes from obese rats. Those data show that cardiac insulin resistance of obesity involves defective insulin signaling at low concentrations of the hormone, whereas GLUT-4 translocation is fully operative in the isolated cell.

Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide solution (LPS) and CDE solution were separated into >100-kDa and <100-kDa fractions by ultracentrifugation. Endotoxin activity was predominantly present in the >100-kDa fractions of the LPS and CDE solutions. Charged-membrane filtration of the >100-kDa fractions of LPS and CDE resulted in the reduction of endotoxin activity by 99.9 and 80%, respectively. Treatment of the >100-kDa fractions of LPS and CDE with polymyxin B-coated beads reduced the endotoxin activity by 96 and 89% respectively. The untreated >100-kDa fractions of LPS and CDE caused significantly greater (P < 0.01) release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) from THP-1 cells in vitro compared with its respective <100-kDa fraction or either of the treated (charged filter or polymyxin B) >100-kDa fractions. Similarly, mice exposed to either of the untreated >100-kDa fractions of LPS or CDE by inhalation developed significantly greater (P < 0.01) concentrations of lavage neutrophils and TNF-alpha in the lavage fluid compared with mice exposed to the respective <100-kDa fraction or either of the treated >100kDa fractions. These results indicate that endotoxin is primarily responsible for the in vitro and in vivo inflammatory response to CDE. 3ainflammation 3acorn 3aplant extracts 3amice 3alungs 3aanalytical methods 3agrain dust 3aendotoxins 0ain vivo inflammation 0ain vitro 0amolecular mass exclusion 0arespiratory system 0amaize dust 0aairway inflammation 0amembrane filtration 0ain vitro inflammation 0apolymyxin b resin binding1 aThorne, P.S.1 aKern, J.A.1 aQuinn, T.J.1 aSchwartz, D.A.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1996 June, v. 270, no. 6:pt.1 p.L1052-L1059x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970303b19970307c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02241naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006600127300002000193520144900213650002001662650002601682700001701708700001601725700002201741700002301763773009701786852000901883930003301892945001301925946001301938655001201951IND2059232220221120125225.0970828e199705  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205923222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHorton, T.J.10aFemale rats do not develop sucrose-induced insulin resistance  ap.

Physiol. 271 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 40): R1319-R1326, 1996]. The present study aimed to determine if female rats also become insulin resistant and hypertriglyceridemic in response to high-sucrose feeding. Female Wistar rats (7 wk old) were fed either a high-sucrose diet (68% energy) (SU) or a high-starch diet (68% energy) (ST) for 3, 5, or 8 wk. In each animal, glucose kinetics were measured using [3-3H]glucose under basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions (insulin infusion 4.0 mU.kg-1.min-1). Body weight and basal glucose kinetics were not different between diet groups at 3, 5, or 8 wk. Glucose infusion rate (mg.kg-1.min-1) was not different between groups (3 wk: 17.7 +/- 1.6 ST, 16.6 +/- 0.9 SU; 5 wk: 16.1 +/- 0.9 ST, 15.1 +/- 2.0 SU; 8 wk: 18.3 +/- 1.9 ST 16.1 +/- 1.5 SU). Clamp rate of glucose appearance (mg.kg-1. min-1) was also not different between diet groups (3 wk: 4.0 +/- 1.6 ST, 3.6 +/- 1.4 SU; 5 wk: 2.6 +/- 1.0 ST, 2.3 +/- 1.14 SU; 8 wk: 5.9 +/- 1.8 ST, 7.7 +/- 1.2 SU). No difference was observed in plasma and tissue triglycerides or tissue glycogen between sucrose- and starch-fed animals. We therefore conclude that female rats, in contrast to males, do not develop sucrose-induced insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases1 aGayles, E.C.1 aPrach, P.A.1 aKoppenhafer, T.A.1 aPagliassotti, M.J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1997 May, v. 272, no. 5:pt.2 p.R1571-R1576x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02166naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008800124300001800212520127700230650002601507650002501533650002001558700001501578700001901593700001701612700001501629700001801644700001401662773009601676852000901772930003301781945001301814946001301827655001201840IND2058589920221120125236.0970722e199704  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205858992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCayol, M.10aInfluence of protein intake on whole body and splanchnic leucine kinetics in humans  ap. E584-E591.  aThe influence of the protein content of the meal on protein turnover was investigated in the splanchnic bed and in the remaining parts of the body in humans. Two groups of subjects consumed every 20 min a liquid formula providing either 1.5 g protein.kg-1.day-1 (P) or no protein (PF). L-[13C]leucine and L-[5,5,5-2H3]leucine were administered by vein and gut, respectively. An open two-pool model was developed to calculate leucine kinetics in both compartments, with the assumption that the enrichment of the tracers incorporated into very low density lipoprotein apolipoprotein B100 at isotopic steady state could reflect the leucine labeling in the splanchnic region. Nonsplanchnic uptake and release of leucine were not significantly different in the two groups. Within the splanchnic area, leucine uptake was 2.1 times higher in the P than in the PF group (P < 0.01), whereas leucine release was reduced but not significantly (-19%) in the P group compared with the PF group. Moreover, data derived from this model showed that protein intake induced an increase in whole body protein synthesis and no change in whole body protein breakdown. Albumin synthesis, as well as its contribution to whole body protein synthesis, was significantly enhanced by protein intake. 3adiet-related diseases 3anutrition physiology 3ahuman nutrition1 aBoirie, Y.1 aRambourdin, F.1 aPrugnaud, J.1 aGachon, P.1 aBeaufrere, B.1 aObled, C.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1997 Apr., v. 272, no. 4:pt.1 p.E584-E591x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19970901b19970905c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02743naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010200132300002000234500001500254520177600269650001002045650001502055650001002070650003202080650002102112650001902133653001702152653003002169700001102199700001702210773009802227852000902325930003302334945001302367946001302380655001202393IND2037958920221120125143.0940316e199310  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203795892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStonestreet, B.S.10aCirculatory and metabolic effects of beta-adrenergic blockade in the hyperinsulinemic ovine fetus  ap. H1098-H1106.  a2019-12-05  aOffspring of women with poorly controlled diabetes exhibit hypoxemia, elevated catecholamine concentration at birth, and an increased incidence of fetal death. Experimental fetal hyperinsulinemia results in increased catecholamine concentration and hemodynamic changes including increased combined ventricular output and vasodilation of select fetal organs. We hypothesized that insulin-induced catecholamine-mediated beta-adrenergic stimulation supports some of these hemodynamic changes in the hyperinsulinemic ovine fetus. To study this, 24 chronically instrumented fetal sheep receiving insulin for 24 h were exposed to beta- (propranolol), beta 1- (metoprolol), and beta 2- (ICI 118,551) adrenergic blockade. Insulin infusion resulted in hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia, a surge in epinephrine and norepinephrine concentration, and increases in the combined ventricular output and regional blood flow to the heart, adrenal glands, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, liver, fat, muscle, carcass, and placenta. In the hyperinsulinemic state, beta-adrenergic blockade was associated with significant reductions in the combined ventricular output and blood flow to fat, carcass, lungs, and the placenta; beta-blockade was associated with reductions in the combined ventricular output and blood flow to the lungs; and beta 2-adrenergic blockade was associated with reductions in blood flow to muscle and lungs. Because beta-adrenergic blockade was associated with reductions in placental blood flow during hyperinsulinemia, oxygen and glucose metabolism were also compromised. We conclude that in the hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic normoxemic ovine fetus, insulin-induced catecholamine-mediated hemodynamic changes are modulated in part by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. 3asheep 3ablood flow 3afetus 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ablood pressure 0ahemodynamics 0abeta-adrenergic receptors1 aLe, E.1 aBerard, D.J.0 tAmerican journal of physiology.g1993 Oct., v. 265, no. 4:pt.2 p.H1098-H1106x0002-95137nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02506naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245009200176300001600268520123000284650002501514650001601539650000901555650001401564650001001578650001701588650002601605650001001631650001301641650001501654650001201669650002301681650001701704650001101721650001401732650001101746650001201757650001401769651000901783700002101792773018101813856005701994852000902051655001202060IND60622505320221120090442.0181126e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062250532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01627.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, Helen F.14aThe diet and ecology of Hawaii's extinct flightless waterfowl: evidence from coprolites  ap. 279-297.  aAt least five species of large flightless waterfowl have become extinct in the Hawaiian Islands in recent millennia. These birds are thought to have occupied the role of large herbivores in a wide range of terrestrial habitats. A collection of coprolites from one of the species (Thambetochen chauliodous) was obtained during excavations in Holocene cave sediments on the island of Maui. The chemical composition and pollen and spore content of the coprolites are analysed and compared with pollen/spore spectra from the cave sediments and from recent goose scats. The results support the contention that these birds were primarily folivorous, and further suggest that ferns were important in the diet. The coprolites have a very fine texture that may result from efficient hindgut fermentation and digestion of plant fibre. Our data are discussed in the light of a recent hypothesis of plant/herbivore coevolution between extinct avian herbivores and native Hawaiian lobelias. The loss of large native herbivores, as well as other changes in vertebrate trophic structure due to extinctions over the past few thousand years, may still be affecting ecological processes in areas of the Hawaiian islands with native vegetation. 3achemical composition 3acoevolution 3adiet 3adigestion 3afeces 3afermentation 3aferns and fern allies 3ageese 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3ahindgut 3aindigenous species 3aplant fibers 3apollen 3asediments 3aspores 3atexture 3awaterfowl 3aMaui1 aBurney, David A.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1997 Oct., v. 62, no. 2 p.279-297dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01627.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02015naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245015600177300001600333520091300349650001701262650001601279650001101295650001301306650001401319650001001333650002901343650001001372651001001382651001601392700002201408773018101430856005701611852000901668655001201677IND60622505220221120090529.0181126e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062250522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01626.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHauffe, Heidi C.10aEvolution of the chromosomal races of Mus musculus domesticus in the Rhaetian Alps: the roles of whole-arm reciprocal translocation and zonal raciation  ap. 255-278.  aThe evolution of ten Robertsonian (Rb) races of the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) in the Rhaetian Alps of northern Italy and southern Switzerland is reconsidered. The mechanisms of centric fusion, zonal raciation and, for the first time, whole-arm reciprocal translocation (WART), are used in this non-mathematical approach to produce a phylogenetic tree (using chromosome fusions as characters) with the smallest number of steps. The shortest tree that we found (16 steps) is at least two to nine mutations shorter than previously published models. Three other trees (17 or 18 steps) are also considered, since they are geographically more sensible. In general, these four scenarios correspond more closely to the present distributions of the ten Rb races than previous trees. Our results suggest that zonal raciation and WARTs play an important role in the evolution of Rb races of the house mouse. 3aMus musculus 3achromosomes 3amodels 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3araces 3areciprocal translocation 3atrees 3aItaly 3aSwitzerland1 aPiálek, Jaroslav0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1997 Oct., v. 62, no. 2 p.255-278dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01626.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002000156245011700176300001600293520164300309650002401952650001101976650001401987650001402001650001202015650001802027650002702045650000902072650002802081650001002109650002602119650001402145650001502159650001102174700001902185773018102204856005702385852000902442655001202451IND60622505020221120075257.0181126e199710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062250502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01623.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForsman, Anders10aRejection of non-adaptive hypotheses for intraspecific variation in trophic morphology in gape-limited predators  ap. 209-223.  aRecent studies have interpreted intraspecific divergence in relative head sizes in snakes as evidence for adaptation of the trophic apparatus in gape-limited predators to local prey size. However, such variation might also arise from non-adaptive processes (such as allometry, correlated response, genetic drift, or non-adaptive phenotypic plasticity). We test predictions from these alternative hypotheses using data on the allometric relationship between head size and body size in two wide-ranging snake species: eight populations of adders (Vipera berus) and 30 populations of common gartersnakes (Thamnophis sirtalis). Our data enable strong rejection of the alternative (non-adaptive) hypotheses, because the relationship between head and body size differed significantly among populations, the geographic distance separating pairs of populations explained less than 1.5% of their divergence in allometric coefficients, and the within-population allometric coefficients were higher than the among-population coefficients in each species. In addition, the geographical variability of allometric coefficients in females did not parallel that in males, suggesting that allometric coefficients have evolved independently in the two sexes. Phenotypic plasticity also cannot explain the data, because laboratory studies show that the allometric relationship between head size and body size is relatively insensitive to differing growth rates. We conclude that the intraspecific head size divergence in these snakes is better explained by spatially heterogeneous selection to optimize prey handling ability, than by non-adaptive processes. 3aThamnophis sirtalis 3aVipera 3aallometry 3abody size 3afemales 3agenetic drift 3ageographical variation 3ahead 3aintraspecific variation 3amales 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apredators 3aprediction 3asnakes1 aShine, Richard0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1997 Oct., v. 62, no. 2 p.209-223dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01623.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002200156245013800178300001600316520164300332650001801975650001401993650001102007650002402018650001402042650002202056650002402078650002602102650001302128650002202141650002402163650002502187650001402212650001902226650001302245650002102258651001702279651001802296700002102314773018102335856005702516852000902573655001202582IND60622500920221120075312.0181126e199711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062250092DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01634.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamudio, Kelly R.10aPhylogeography of the bushmaster (Lachesis muta: Viperidae): implications for neotropical biogeography, systematics, and conservation  ap. 421-442.  aWe used mitochondrial gene sequences to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among subspecies of the bushmaster, Lachesis muta. These large vipers are widely distributed in lowland tropical forests in Central and South America, where three of four allopatric subspecies are separated by montane barriers. Our phylogeny indicates that the four subspecies belong to two clades, the Central American and South American lineages. We use published molecular studies of other taxa to estimate a ‘reptilian mtDNA rate’ and thus temporal boundaries for major lineage divergences in Lachesis. We estimate that the Central and South American forms diverged 18-6 Mya, perhaps due to the uplifting of the Andes, whereas the two Central American subspecies may have diverged 11-4 Mya with the uprising of the Cordillera de Talamanca that separates them today. South American bushmasters from the Amazon Basin and the Atlantic Forest are not strongly differentiated, perhaps due to episodic gene flow during the Pleistocene, when suitable habitat for this species was at times more continuous. Our results agree with previous evidence that genetic divergence among some neotropical vertebrates pre-dated Pleistocene forest fragmentation cycles and the appearance of the Panamanian Isthmus. Based on morphological, behavioral, and molecular evidence, we recognize three species of Lachesis. In addition to L. muta, the widespread South American form, the Central American forms are treated as distinct species (L. meknocephak and L. stenophrys), each deserving of special conservation status due to restricted distribution and habitat destruction. 3aLachesis muta 3aallopatry 3abasins 3aconservation status 3agene flow 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3areptiles 3atropical forests 3aAndes region 3aSouth America1 aGreene, Harry W.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1997 Nov., v. 62, no. 3 p.421-442dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1997.tb01634.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02744naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002600156245010000182300001400282520145200296650002001748650001701768650001701785650001401802650001401816650003001830650000901860650001001869650002701879650000901906650002801915650001101943650001001954650002001964650001201984650001701996651001002013700002102023700002102044773017902065856005702244852000902301655001202310IND60622500520221120075419.0181126e199801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062250052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1998.tb01638.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClelland, Blinda E.10aIntraspecific variation in laryngeal and ear morphology in male cricket frogs (Acris crepitans)  ap. 51-67.  aIn a previous report, the authors found significant population variation in the calls of cricket frogs (Acris crepitans) that could not be explained by geographic variation in body size alone. Here we extend that work by investigating intraspecific population variation in the morphological characteristics underlying acoustic communication in male cricket frogs from several sites in Texas. We measured the volumes of laryngeal and auditory components responsible for the generation or reception of species-specific vocalizations in male frogs from eight populations. We found significant differences among populations in body size, as well as all the laryngeal and ear components we measured. With the exception of vocal cord and extracolumella volumes, the volumes of these anatomical structures differ among populations independently of body size as determined by a covariate analysis with snout-vent length as the covariate. Call dominant frequency differs among populations in a clinal pattern and head width, arytenoid cartilage, vocal cord and dilator muscle volume show a similar pattern when the residuals of the regression of morphological component on SVL are assessed for this trend. The results show that both larynx and ear structures can change in size independently of body size, yielding significant geographic variation in the behavioral and physiological expressions of the acoustic communication system underlying mate choice. 3aAcris crepitans 3aNeobatrachia 3abioacoustics 3abody size 3acartilage 3acommunications technology 3aears 3afrogs 3ageographical variation 3ahead 3aintraspecific variation 3alarynx 3amales 3amating behavior 3amuscles 3avocalization 3aTexas1 aWilczyński, W.,1 aRyan, Michael J.0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1998 Jan., v. 63, no. 1 p.51-67dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1998.tb01638.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01071naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245002600134300001400160300001900174520032200193650002000515650002500535650002300560650001800583653002100601773007100622852001300693939003300706945000800739946001300747852000900760655001200769991606579230742620221120054757.0890822e198904  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI890014682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlumenthal, D.10aComplex carbohydrates  ap. 13-17.  ap. 13-17. ill.  aComplex carbohydrates are becoming the chosen food of health-conscious diners.

Compared to farmers selling only to the traditional market channels, farmers selling to supermarket channels are larger (but are in the upper tier of the "small farmer" category), have more capital, and are much more specialized in commercial horticulture in general and in tomatoes in particular. While they have higher yields, they also have higher input use, including use of chemicals. In fact, they severely overuse pesticides and fungicides. Moreover, these greater input expenditures mean that their profit rates are roughly similar to those of farmers in the traditional market channel. Supermarket-channel farmers prefer the more demanding wholesale-supermarket channel because it offers lower risks and lower transaction costs to market, a variety of quality grades of tomatoes, all year long. In turn, the supermarkets, who do not buy direct but rather source from a few specialized-dedicated wholesalers, rely on this year-round supply, lower transaction costs, and consistency of quality. 3acapital 3acommercial horticulture 3afungicides 3agrowers 3amarketing channels 3apesticide application 3arisk 3asupermarkets 3atomatoes 3aGuatemala 0aWholesalers 0aDevelopment1 aReardon, Tom.1 aBerdegué, Julio.0 tAgricultural economics.g2007 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.281-290dBlackwell Publishing Incx0169-51507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-0862.2007.00206.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01746naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008100169300001400250520067400264650002200938650002400960650001100984650001700995650002601012650002301038653003601061653002301097653000801120700001801128773010501146852000901251856009201260930003301352946001101385655001201396IND4399280420221117170127.0071223e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439928042DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-0862.2007.00236.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Will14aThe Doha agenda and agricultural trade reform: the role of economic analysis  ap. 77-87.  aThis article shows that research on international agricultural trade reform can make much greater contributions to understanding than was feasible in earlier trade negotiations.

The aim of this study was to determine the degree of variability in the timing of ovulation relative to other follicular phase events and to determine how variations in the timing of follicular phase events contribute to the timing of the postovulatory progesterone rise. Plasma concentrations of progesterone, oestradiol and luteinising hormone (LH) and the timing of oestrus and ovulation were determined following induction of luteolysis were determined in 18 mature, non-lactating Holstein-Friesian cows. Four cows were excluded on the basis of abnormal reproductive function. In the remaining 14 cows oestrus occurred at 57.4 ± 4.3 h and the LH surge at 54.6 ± 4.0 h following luteolysis (progesterone <1ng mL-1) followed by a fall in circulating oestradiol concentration at 64.6 ± 4.4 h. Cows ovulated at 88.0 ± 4.7 h with the postovulatory progesterone rise (to >1 ng mL-1) occurring 159 ± 7.2 h after luteolysis. There was considerable variation in the timing of ovulation following luteolysis (range 64-136 h) onset of oestrus (range 24-40 h) and onset of the LH surge (range 24-44 h). Cows were then split on the basis of interval from progesterone fall to progesterone rise giving groups (n = 7 per group) with intervals of 180.6 ± 6.7 and 138.3 ± 5.7 h (P < 0.001). Between groups, both the intervals from luteolysis to ovulation (98.3 ± 6.9 vs 77.7 ± 3.4 h; P < 0.05) and ovulation to progesterone rise (82.3 ± 4.2 vs. 60.6 ± 5.5 h; P < 0.01) were longer in late rise cows. There was no difference between groups in the interval from oestrus or LH surge to ovulation. In conclusion the results of this study further highlight the high variability that exists in the timing and interrelationships of follicular phase events in the modern dairy cow, reemphasising the challenges that exist in optimising mating strategies. However, the data do suggest that in cows with poor post ovulatory progesterone secretion, the key problem appears to be poor post ovulatory development rather than a delay in ovulation. 3afollicular development 3aovulation 3aprogesterone 3aestrus synchronization 3aluteolysis 3afemale fertility 3acows 3aestrus detection 3aovarian follicles 2aAnimals 2aCattlexbloodxphysiology. 2aEstradiolxblood 2aEstrusxbloodxphysiology. 2aEstrus Synchronizationxmethods 2aFemale 2aFollicular Phasexbloodxphysiology. 2aInsemination, Artificialxveterinary 2aLuteinizing Hormonexblood 2aOvulationxphysiology 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Rate 2aProgesteronexblood 2aTime Factors1 aGutierrez, C.G.1 aPeters, A.R.1 aMann, G.E.0 tVeterinary journal.g2006 July, v. 172, no. 1 p.103-108dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.02.0063electronic resource  a20070308b20070402c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/02/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02630naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100002100174245007400195300001400269500002400283500001500307520108100322650001101403650001601414650001601430650002601446650003101472650001101503650001501514650001901529650005701548650001201605650001201617650005001629650003001679650001101709650002801720650005101748653002101799653001101820700001701831700001901848773008501867852000901952856007001961930003302031945002502064946001102089655001202100IND4385083820221122224907.0061111e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438508382DNAL7 a167721332pmid7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8401 aRichardson, L.E.12aA quantitative study of the equine soft palate using histomorphometry  ap. 78-85.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDorsal displacement of the soft palate is a common cause of upper airway obstruction in racehorses and is of unknown aetiology. To determine whether the palate may displace for structural reasons, knowledge of the normal soft palate is required. The present study aimed to describe, qualitatively and quantitatively, the structure of the normal equine soft palate using histomorphometry. In soft palates from 12 Thoroughbreds, glandular tissue predominated (ca. 40% of total area), located mainly in the rostral and ventral regions. Rostrally, muscles attached to a tendinous aponeurosis located dorsal to the glandular tissue. Muscle was most abundant in the dorsal mid region and decreased caudally. The oral mucosa consisted of a non-keratinised stratified squamous epithelium whereas the nasopharyngeal mucosa was pseudostratified, columnar and ciliated. Elastin fibres were observed in the nasopharyngeal submucosa, becoming more prevalent caudally. The palates were bilaterally symmetrical although the proportion of tissue types varied considerably between individuals. 3apalate 3amorphometry 3anasopharynx 3aquantitative analysis 3arespiratory tract diseases 3amucosa 3aracehorses 3ahorse diseases 2aAirway Obstructionxetiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aCadaver 2aHistological Techniquesxmethodsxveterinary. 2aHorse Diseasesxpathology 2aHorses 2aMouth Mucosaxpathology 2aPalate, Softxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 0ahistomorphometry 0ahorses1 aWakley, G.K.1 aFranklin, S.H.0 tVeterinary journal.g2006 July, v. 172, no. 1 p.78-85dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2005.02.0323electronic resource  a20070308b20070402c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/02/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02999naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245007000180300001600250520148300266650002301749650001501772650002501787650000901812650001001821650001301831650001101844650001301855650002201868650003401890650002501924650001401949650001501963650002101978650003001999650005102029650004202080650002202122650002502144650001402169700001902183700001802202700001502220773008302235852000902318856008502327930003302412945001302445946001102458655001202469IND2331131920221121100352.0030304e200212  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233113192DNAL7 a124201582pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-002-0476-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeeks, J.C.10aCellular differentiation in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme  ap. 395-403.  aNostoc punctiforme is a phenotypically complex, filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium, whose vegetative cells can mature in four developmental directions. The particular developmental direction is determined by environmental signals. The vegetative cell cycle is maintained when nutrients are sufficient. Limitation for combined nitrogen induces the terminal differentiation of heterocysts, cells specialized for nitrogen fixation in an oxic environment. A number of unique regulatory events and genes have been identified and integrated into a working model of heterocyst differentiation. Phosphate limitation induces the transient differentiation of akinetes, spore-like cells resistant to cold and desiccation. A variety of environmental changes, both positive and negative for growth, induce the transient differentiation of hormogonia, motile filaments that function in dispersal. Initiation of the differentiation of heterocysts, akinetes and hormogonia are hypothesized to depart from the vegetative cell cycle, following separate and distinct events. N. punctiforme also forms nitrogen-fixing symbiotic associations; its plant partners influence the differentiation and behavior of hormogonia and heterocysts. N. punctiforme is genetically tractable and its genome sequence is nearly complete. Thus, the regulatory circuits of three cellular differentiation events and symbiotic interactions of N. punctiforme can be experimentally analyzed by functional genomics. 3aNostoc punctiforme 3acell cycle 3acell differentiation 3acold 3agenes 3agenomics 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria 3anucleotide sequences 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3avegetative cells 2aCell Divisionxphysiology 2aCyanobacteriaxcytologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aPlant Development 2aPlantsxmicrobiology 2aSymbiosis1 aCampbell, E.L.1 aSummers, M.L.1 aWong, F.C.0 tArchives of microbiology.g2002 Dec., v. 178, no. 6 p.395-403x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-002-0476-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03834naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245020800182300001400390520193200404650002402336650002102360650002002381650001202401650004302413650001202456650002102468650001502489650002102504650001302525650002502538650002402563650001802587650002602605650003202631650002302663650007102686650003102757650003802788650002502826650002802851650001302879650005202892700002202944700001402966700002002980700002403000773008103024852000903105856008503114930003303199945001303232946001103245655001203256IND2328985120221121100346.0020919e200207  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232898512DNAL7 a120707652pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-002-0417-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaemmli, C.M.10aTfdD(II), one of the two chloromuconate cycloisomerases of Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 (pJP4), cannot efficiently convert 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate to trans-dienelactone to allow growth on 3-chlorobenzoate  ap. 13-25.  aRalstonia eutropha JMP134 (pJP4) harbors two functional gene clusters for the degradation of chlorocatechols, i.e. tfdCDEF (in short: tfd(I)) and tfdD(II)C(II)E(II)F(II) (in short: tfd(II)), which are both present on the catabolic plasmid pJP4. In this study, we compared the function of both gene clusters for degradation of chlorocatechols by constructing isolated and hybrid tfd(I)-tfd(II) clusters on plasmids in R. eutropha, by activity assays of Tfd enzymes, and by HPLC/MS of individual enzymatic catalytic steps in chlorocatechol conversion. R. eutropha containing the tfd(II) cluster alone or hybrid tfd-clusters with tfdD(II) as sole gene for chloromuconate cycloisomerase were impaired in growth on 3-chlorobenzoate, in contrast to R. eutropha harboring the complete tfd(I) cluster. Enzyme activities for TfdD(II) and for TfdE(II) were very low in R. eutropha when induced with 3-chlorobenzoate. By contrast, a relatively high enzyme activity was found for TfdF(II). Spectral conversion assays with extracts from R. eutropha strains expressing tfdD(II) all showed accumulation of a compound with a similar UV spectrum as 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate from 3-chlorocatechol. HPLC analysis of in vitro assays in which each individual step in 3-chlorocatechol conversion was reproduced by sequentially adding cell extracts of an Escherichia coli expressing one Tfd enzyme only demonstrated that TfdD(II) was unable to cause conversion of 2-chloro-cis,cis-muconate. No accumulation of intermediates was observed with 4-chlorocatechol. From these results, we conclude that at least TfdD(II) is a bottleneck in conversion of 3-chlorocatechol and, therefore, in efficient metabolism of 3-chlorobenzoate. This study showed the subtle functional and expression differences between similar enzymes of the tfd-encoded pathway and demonstrated that extreme care has to be taken when inferring functionality from sequence data alone. 3aCupriavidus necator 3aEscherichia coli 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahybrids 3ain vitro studies 3ametabolism 3amultigene family 3aplasmids 2aAdipatesxmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCatecholsxmetabolism 2aChlorobenzoatesxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCupriavidus necatorxenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aIntramolecular Lyasesxphysiology 2aLactonesxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmids 2aSorbic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism.1 aSchonenberger, R.1 aSuter, M.1 aZehnder, A.J.B.1 aMeer, J.R. van der.0 tArchives of microbiology.g2002 July, v. 178, no. 1 p.13-25x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-002-0417-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20021104b20021107c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03127naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245019600180300001600376520142700392650002701819650001301846650003101859650004901890650000901939650002201948650001201970650002101982650001802003650001602021650001702037650002102054650001802075650003702093650003002130650007102160650002202231650005402253650001302307700001502320700002002335700002002355773008302375852000902458856008502467930003302552945001302585946001102598655001202609IND2328363920221121070614.0020805e200203  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232836392DNAL7 a119076772pmid7 a10.1007/s00203-001-0380-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, S.L.10aCorrelation of long-range membrane order with temperature-dependent growth characteristics of parent and a cold-sensitive, branched-chain-fatty-acid-deficient mutant of Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 217-222.  aListeria monocytogenes is a food-borne, pathogenic, psychrotolerant bacterium that grows at refrigeration temperatures. Long-range membrane order of the parent (10403S) and of a cold-sensitive mutant (cld-1) deficient in odd-numbered, branched-chain fatty acids was measured using the width of the central line of spectra of an electron paramagnetic resonance probe, 4,4-dimethyl-2-heptyl-2-hexyloxazolidine-N-oxyl (7N14), that locates deep in the hydrocarbon region of the membranes. The line width decreased from 0.9 to 0.5 milliTesla (mT) over the temperature range of 0-10 degrees for strain 10403S and -5 to 32 degrees C for strain cld-1 independent of protein state (heat denatured or intact). This provided new evidence for phase transitions in the membranes. When strain cld-1 was grown in medium supplemented with 2-methylbutyric acid, which restores anteiso fatty acids and the ability to grow at low temperature, the change in central line width as a function of temperature resembled that of strain 10403S. The temperatures at which the central line width became 0.8 mT corresponded to those at which growth became very slow in both strains (3-5 degrees C for 10403S, 15 degrees C for cld-1) as determined by Arrhenius plots. These data underscore the critical role of odd-numbered anteiso fatty acids in influencing the lower temperature limits of growth through their effects on long-range membrane fluidity. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3abacteria 3abranched chain fatty acids 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aheat 3amembrane fluidity 3amutants 3aphase transition 3arefrigeration 3atemperature 2aButyric Acid 2aCold Temperature 2aCulture Media 2aFatty Acidsxanalysisxgenetics. 2aLipid Bilayersxchemistry 2aListeria monocytogenesxchemistryxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aMembrane Fluidity 2aMembrane Lipidsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMutation1 aDrouin, P.1 aWilkinson, B.J.1 aMorse, P.D.

Prepenetration development, including conidial germination and appressorial formation, are requisite for successful infection. Pharmacological data from our laboratory indicated a role for a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway during these early morphogenic transitions. Thus, the cloning and characterization of the genes for PKA catalytic and regulatory subunits were undertaken to more precisely determine the function of PKA during C. trifolii pathogenic growth and development. In this report, the cloning, sequencing, and partial characterization of the gene encoding the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Ct-PKAR) is described. An open reading frame of 1,212 bp containing 404 predicted amino acid residues was identified. Database analysis revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of Ct-PKAR shares considerable similarity with that of PKA regulatory subunits in other organisms, particularly in the conserved regions. Furthermore, the Ct-PKAR protein is classified as a type II regulatory subunit based on the presence of the hallmark autophosphorylation site. Southern blot analysis indicated that Ct-PKAR is a single-copy gene. Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of Ct-PKAR is developmentally regulated. Ct-PKAR was shown to be a functional regulatory subunit of PKA by complementating the Neurospora crassa mcb mutant, which has a temperature-sensitive mutation in the regulatory subunit of PKA. 3aColletotrichum trifolii 3aNeurospora crassa 3aNorthern blotting 3aSouthern blotting 3aalfalfa 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aanthracnose 3aappressoria 3acAMP-dependent protein kinase 3aconidia 3adatabases 3afungi 3agenes 3agermination 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3amutation 3aopen reading frames 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aColletotrichumxenzymologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Type II 2aCyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeurospora crassaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 0agenbank/af046922 0amolecular sequence data1 aDickman, M.B.0 tArchives of microbiology.g1999 Mar., v. 171, no. 4 p.249-256x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020300507073Available from publisher's Web site  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03357naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001800159245015200177300001600329520160100345650001901946650002001965650001601985650001502001650002502016650001302041650001702054650002002071650002302091650002102114650001402135650000702149650003002156650003502186650002302221650002802244650004202272650003602314650001302350650002002363650003102383650002602414650005302440650002802493650002202521700001802543773008302561852000902644856008102653930003302734945001302767946001102780655001202791IND2196729820221121034939.0990129e199808  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219672982DNAL7 a96836472pmid7 a10.1007/s0020300506212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroadus, R.M.10aPurification and characterization of the NADH:ferredoxin BPH oxidoreductase component of biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase from Pseudomonas sp. strain LB400  ap. 106-112.  aNADH:ferredoxin(BPH) oxidoreductase (reductase(BPH)) of biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase was purified over 47-fold to homogeneity with a yield of 41% from cell extract of Pseudomonas sp. strain LB400. Reductase(BPH) transfers reducing equivalents from NADH to the catalytic oxygenase component (ISP(BPH)) via a ferredoxin (ferredoxin(BPH)) during the oxidation of biphenyl to cis-biphenyl 2,3-dihydrodiol. Reductase(BPH) was a monomer with a molecular weight of 43,600 as determined by electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Gel filtration column chromatography gave a molecular weight of 41,500 for native reductase(BPH). The absorbance spectrum of the protein in its oxidized state had maxima at 271 nm, 376 nm and 448 nm with shoulders at 422 nm and 476 nm. The peak around 448 nm was partially bleached upon reduction with NADH under anoxic conditions. Reductase(BPH) contained 0.89 mol FAD/mol protein. Reductase(BPH) was required for oxidation of biphenyl to cis-biphenyl 2,3-dihydrodiol by ISP(BPH) and ferredoxin(BPH). Potassium ferricyanide, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), nitrobluetetrazolium and cytochrome c served as artificial electron acceptors. Reduction of cytochrome c was dependent upon the presence of ferredoxin(BPH). The fastest rate of DCPIP reduction occurred at pH 7.2 and 32 degrees C. The apparent Km for NADH and NADPH in the DCPIP assay were 58 micromolar and 156 micromolar, respectively. Vmax was 3,120 U mg(-1) for NADH and 1,140 U mg(-1) for NADPH. NADH is most likely the physiological electron donor for oxidation of biphenyl and polychlorinated biphenyls. 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aPseudomonas 3aabsorbance 3aanaerobic conditions 3abiphenyl 3acytochrome c 3aelectrophoresis 3agel chromatography 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 2aBiphenyl Compoundsxmetabolism 2aElectron Transport 2aEnvironmental Pollution 2aFlavin-Adenine Dinucleotidexanalysis 2aIron-Sulfur Proteinsxchemistry 2aKinetics 2aNADxmetabolism 2aOxidoreductasesxchemistry 2aOxygenasesxchemistry 2aPolychlorinated Biphenylsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aPseudomonasxenzymology 2aSpectrophotometry1 aHaddock, J.D.0 tArchives of microbiology.g1998 Aug., v. 170, no. 2 p.106-112x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020300506213Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03573naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003100110040001800141100001700159245010200176300001600278520149100294650001301785650000801798650001101806650002501817650001101842650002701853650002201880650001301902650001901915650001201934650002201946650001601968650001301984650002101997650002402018650003302042650001802075650002302093650002302116650005202139650003802191650002502229650006702254650003102321650003102352650003702383650002802420650003202448650003402480650002302514650002702537650003402564650003602598700001802634700001702652773008302669852000902752856008102761930003302842945001302875946001102888655001202899IND2195854820221121034904.0981207e199804  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219585482DNAL7 a95316262pmid7 a10.1007/s0020300505712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOxelfelt, F.10aHydrogen uptake in Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102. Cloning and characterization of a hupSL homologue  ap. 267-274.  aStructural genes encoding an uptake hydrogenase of Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102 were isolated. From partial libraries of genomic DNA, two clones (pNfo01) and pNfo02) were selected and sequenced, revealing the complete sequence of both a hupS (960 bases) and a hupL (1,593 bases) homologue in Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102. A comparison between the deduced amino acid sequences of HupS and HupL of Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102 and Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 showed that the HupS proteins are 89% identical and the HupL proteins are 91% identical. However, the noncoding region between the genes in Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102 (192 bases) is longer than that of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 and of many other microorganisms. Southern hybridizations using DNA from both N2-fixing and non-N2-fixing cells of Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102 and different probes from within hupL clearly demonstrated that, in contrast to Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120, there is no rearrangement within hupL of Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102. Indeed, 6 nucleotides out of 16 within the potential recombination site are different from those of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. Furthermore, we have recently published evidence demonstrating the absence of the bidirectional/reversible hydrogenase in Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102. The present knowledge, in combination with the unique characteristics, makes Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102 an interesting candidate for the study of deletion mutants lacking the uptake-type enzyme. 3aAnabaena 3aDNA 3aNostoc 3aamino acid sequences 3aclones 3aferredoxin hydrogenase 3agenomic libraries 3ahydrogen 3amicroorganisms 3amutants 3anitrogen fixation 3anucleotides 3aproteins 3astructural genes 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCyanobacteriaxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Primersxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA Probesxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aGenes, Bacterialxgenetics 2aHydrogenxpharmacokinetics 2aHydrogenasexanalysisxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aOpen Reading Framesxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid1 aTamagnini, P.1 aLindblad, P.0 tArchives of microbiology.g1998 Apr., v. 169, no. 4 p.267-274x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020300505713Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02259naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245005600159300001600215520121000231650002801441650002401469650002101493650002101514650001101535650001901546650001401565650001201579650001501591650001201606650001101618700001401629773008301643852000901726856008101735930003301816945001301849946001101862655001201873IND2059704720221120221754.0970916e199706  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205970472DNAL7 a10.1007/s0020300504542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKremnicky, L.10abeta-Mannanolytic system of Aureobasidium pullulans  ap. 350-355.  aA xylanolytic yeast strain Aureobasidium pullulans NRRL Y 2311-1, was found to produce all enzymes required for complete degradation of galactomannan and galactoglucomannan. The enzymes differed in function and cellular localization: endo-beta-1,4-mannanase was secreted into the culture fluid, beta-mannosidase was strictly intracellular, and alpha-galactosidase and beta-glucosidase were found both extracellularly and intracellularly. Among these enzyme components, only extracellular beta-mannanase and intracellular beta-mannosidase were inducible. The production of beta-mannanase and beta-mannosidase was 10- to 100-fold higher in galactomannan medium than in medium with one of the other carbon sources. beta-mannanase and beta-mannosidase were coinduced in glucose-grown cells by galactomannan, galactoglucomannan, and beta-1,4-manno-oligosaccharides. The natural inducer of extracellular beta-mannanase and intracellular beta-mannosidase appeared to be beta-1,4-mannobiose. Synthesis of both enzymes was completely repressed by glucose, mannose, or galactose. The synthetic glycoside methyl beta-D-mannopyranoside served as a nonmetabolizable inducer of both beta-mannosidase and beta-mannanase. 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3aalpha-galactosidase 3abeta-glucosidase 3abeta-mannosidase 3acarbon 3agalactomannans 3agalactose 3aglucose 3aglycosides 3amannose 3ayeasts1 aBiely, P.0 tArchives of microbiology.g1997 June, v. 167, no. 6 p.350-355x0302-89337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0020300504543Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03697naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100002400184245014700208300001600355500002400371500001500395520211000410650001702520650001302537650001702550650002202567650002302589650001602612650000902628650001702637650001602654650001802670650002602688650001702714650002302731651001102754653001902765700002102784700002102805700001702826700002702843700001802870773008902888852000902977856008802986930003303074945002503107946001103132655001203143IND4402977220221120200836.0080319e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440297722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2007.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF840 0aF600 0aF1201 aMontes-Molina, J.A.10aAre extracts of neem (Azadirachta indica A.

Extracts from Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (L.) leaves (NEEM treatment), a plant originating from India known for its bio-insecticide characteristics, and Gliricidia sepium (Jacquin kunth ex Walp.) (GLIRICIDIA treatment), a plant originating from Mexico and Central America known to repel insects, were compared to a standard insecticide, lambda-cyalothrin or Karate® (CHEMICAL treatment) for insect pest efficacy in cultivated maize in Chiapas, Mexico. Untreated maize plants served as control (CONTROL treatment). Plant damage, crop growth, yield and fauna were monitored during four growing seasons from 2003 to 2006. Mean maize yield was significantly higher in the NEEM and CHEMICAL treatments, i.e. 9784 and 9916kgha⁻¹, respectively, compared to the CONTROL treatment (7206kgha⁻¹). The GLIRICIDIA treatment yielded 8747kgha⁻¹. Of the 26 insect species found during the growing season, only the number of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Macrodactylus spp. (Coleoptera: Melolonthidae) and Frankliniella spp. (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) was significantly different between the treatments, with the lowest values found in the chemical treated plots. The amount of beneficial insects was not affected by treatment, while the amount of insects that cause damage was significantly lower (ca. 2-fold) in the CHEMICAL treatment than in the other treatments. Mean damage to the newly formed leaves was 18% in the NEEM treatment and 23% in the GLIRICIDIA treatment and significantly lower than that of the CONTROL treatment (37%), but significantly higher than that of the CHEMICAL treatment (11%). It was found that leaf extracts of G. sepium and A. indica reduced damage to the newly formed leaves and increased yields compared to untreated maize plants, with neem being more effective. However, neem was not as effective as chemical control with lambda-cyalothrin, for overall maize protection. 3aplant growth 3aZea mays 3ainsect pests 3aGliricidia sepium 3aAzadirachta indica 3aplant pests 3acorn 3apest control 3agrain yield 3aneem extracts 3afield experimentation 3aplant damage 3abiological control 3aMexico 0aplant extracts1 aLuna-Guido, M.L.1 aEspinoza-Paz, N.1 aGovaerts, B.1 aGutierrez-Miceli, F.A.1 aDendooven, L.0 tCrop protection.g2008 , v. 27, no. 3-5 p.763-774dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2007.11.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080612b20080704c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/06/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02782naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100001900193245015400212300001600366500002400382520134100406650001801747650001701765650001601782650001101798650001601809650001901825650001101844650001901855650002301874650001401897650002401911650001501935650002601950651001301976700001801989700001402007773008902021852000902110856008802119930003302207945002502240946001102265655001202276IND4402976820221120201011.0080319e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440297682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2007.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF110 0aL600 0aL300 0aL0011 aLarentzaki, E.10aEffect of kaolin particle film on Thrips tabaci (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), oviposition, feeding and development on onions: A lab and field case study  ap. 727-734.  aIncludes references  aLaboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of a kaolin-based particle film on biological characteristics of the onion thrips, Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), on onions. Oviposition rate was significantly reduced on kaolin-treated vs. water-treated onion leaves and plants, in choice and no-choice assays. Hatch rate was reduced when kaolin particle film was applied over eggs on onion leaves. The time required for development of larval stages was significantly increased and mortality was significantly higher on kaolin than on water-treated onion leaves. Feeding choice was influenced by the presence of the kaolin treatment and in choice assays both larvae and adults fed significantly less on kaolin-treated than on water-treated leaves. In a field study, significantly more adults were captured in the beginning of the season on control than on kaolin-treated plots, and at population peaks significantly more larvae and adults were harbored in control plots. The results indicate the potential of kaolin particle film against onion thrips in an integrated pest management program. However, because of the importance of a continuous coverage of plant material with kaolin particle film, better application methods and perhaps frequent applications will be required to cover newly expanding foliage. 3aThrips tabaci 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3aonions 3aAllium cepa 3ainsect control 3akaolin 3aparticle films 3ainsect development 3amortality 3afeeding preferences 3acrop yield 3afield experimentation 3aNew York1 aShelton, A.M.1 aPlate, J.0 tCrop protection.g2008 , v. 27, no. 3-5 p.727-734dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2007.10.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080612b20080704c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/06/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02897naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245006200172300001800234500002400252520103500276650001101311650002101322650001101343650001401354650001901368650001101387650001701398650001001415650001301425650001201438650001101450650000901461650001501470650002501485650003101510650002101541650001401562650004301576650002201619650001301641650001301654650004301667650002301710650002501733650002301758650002301781650002101804650001701825650001301842650001701855700002101872700002301893700001601916700002401932700002301956700001901979700002201998773011602020852000902136856007802145655001202223IND4438439220221120175817.0100611e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443843922DNAL7 a204480492pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHo, Q. Tri10aGenotype effects on internal gas gradients in apple fruit  ap. 2745-2755.  aIncludes references  aA permeation-diffusion-reaction model was applied to study gas exchange of apple fruit (Kanzi, Jonagold, and Braeburn) as effected by morphology and respiratory metabolism. The gas exchange properties and respiration parameters of the fruit organ tissues were measured. The actual internal tissue geometry of the fruit was reconstructed from digital fruit images and the model was solved over this geometry using the finite element method. The model was validated based on measurements of internal gas concentrations and the gas flux of the fruit to its environment. Both measurements and an in silico study revealed that gradients of metabolic gases exist in apple fruit, depending on diffusion properties and respiration of the different cultivars. Macroscale simulation confirmed that Jonagold has large potential for controlled atmosphere (CA) storage while low diffusion properties of cortex tissue in Braeburn indicated a risk of storage disorder development. Kanzi had less O₂ anoxia at CA storage compared with Braeburn. 3aapples 3acell respiration 3acortex 3acultivars 3adigital images 3afruits 3agas exchange 3agases 3agenotype 3ahypoxia 3amodels 3arisk 2aAtmosphere 2aBiological Transport 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCell Respiration 2aDiffusion 2aFruitxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGasesxmetabolism 2aGenotype 2aKinetics 2aMalusxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aModels, Biological 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPartial Pressure 2aPermeability 2aPorosity 2aTime Factors1 aVerboven, Pieter1 aVerlinden, Bert E.1 aSchenk, Ann1 aDelele, Mulugeta A.1 aRolletschek, Hardy1 aVercammen, Jef1 aNicolaï, Bart M.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2010 June, v. 61, no. 10 p.2745-2755dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq1083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02926naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245010000156300001600256500002400272520185200296650001102148650001102159650001502170650001302185650001102198650001802209650001102227650001102238650001302249650004002262650001602302651001402318651001002332700001702342700002902359773009302388852000902481856003802490655001202528IND4422245520221120171149.0090622s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442224552DNAL7 a10.1071/CP082532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConnor, David J.10aYield determination in olive hedgerow orchards. II. Analysis of radiation and fruiting profiles  ap. 443-452.  aIncludes references  aProfiles of fruit density, fruit size, and oil content were measured on 12 occasions in 7 olive orchards in Spain and 2 in Australia. Orchard structure varied widely. Height ranged from 2.0 to 5.5m, row spacing from 3 to 6m, and canopy width from 0.7 to 3m. Most orchards were oriented north-south (N-S) but one in Spain was oriented close to east-west (E-W) (20° NE-SW). All orchards in Spain were cv. Arbequina, and in Australia they were cvv. Barnea and Picual. Analyses with a model of interception and transmission that estimated interception by individual sides of hedgerows revealed that fruit size and oil content were strongly related to intercepted radiation during the month before harvest across all orchards. Relationships were also evident between fruit density and interception but varied among orchards and years, indicating the importance of other environmental and probably physiological effects. In N-S orchards of cv. Arbequina, average fruit size and oil content increased linearly from 0.40g (dry weight) to 0.72g, and from 36 to 49% (of dry weight), as daily intercepted PAR increased from 6 to 25 mol/m² (15-60% of horizontally incident radiation). The general principles of response extended to E-W orchards. There, it was shown that generally large fruit with high oil content on S sides was consistent with the plateau responses to radiation evident in the more extensive N-S data. On the N side, however, and accounting for transmission through the hedgerow, both fruit size and oil content were greater than in positions intercepting equivalent radiation in N-S orchards. Examples are provided of the utility of responses of fruit density, size, and oil content in establishing combinations of row height, row width, and row distance to improve or maintain productivity in some of the orchards included in the study. 3aBarnea 3acanopy 3acrop yield 3afruiting 3afruits 3alipid content 3amodels 3aolives 3aorchards 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3arow spacing 3aAustralia 3aSpain1 aCenteno, Ana1 aGómez-del-Campo, María0 tCrop & pasture science.g2009, v. 60, no. 5 p.443-452dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/CP08253 7aarticle02861naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245009800206300001800304500002400322506007600346520129200422506003701714650001201751650002001763650002601783650002301809650003901832650001001871650001301881650001201894650001501906650001301921650001301934650001401947650003001961650001801991650001402009650001302023700001902036700003602055700002202091700001702113773013602130852000902266856008002275655001202355IND4421138320221207135101.0090529e20090601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442113832DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00067-092doi7 aPMC26872712pmcid7 a193296582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEttwig, Katharina F.10aEnrichment and Molecular Detection of Denitrifying Methanotrophic Bacteria of the NC10 Phylum  ap. 3656-3662.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAnaerobic methane oxidation coupled to denitrification was recently assigned to bacteria belonging to the uncultured phylum NC10. In this study, we incubated sediment from a eutrophic ditch harboring a diverse community of NC10 bacteria in a bioreactor with a constant supply of methane and nitrite. After 6 months, fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that NC10 bacteria dominated the resulting population. The enrichment culture oxidized methane and reduced nitrite to dinitrogen gas. We assessed NC10 phylum diversity in the inoculum and the enrichment culture, compiled the sequences currently available for this bacterial phylum, and showed that of the initial diversity, only members of one subgroup had been enriched. The growth of this subgroup was monitored by quantitative PCR and correlated to nitrite-reducing activity and the total biomass of the culture. Together, the results indicate that the enriched subgroup of NC10 bacteria is responsible for anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to nitrite reduction. Due to methodological limitations (a strong bias against NC10 bacteria in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and inhibition by commonly used stopper material) the environmental distribution and importance of these bacteria could be largely underestimated at present.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiomass 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aenrichment culture 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agases 3ainoculum 3amethane 3amonitoring 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3astoppers1 avan Alen, Theo1 avan de Pas-Schoonen, Katinka T.1 aJetten, Mike S.M.1 aStrous, Marc0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 June 1, v. 75, no. 11 p.3656-3662dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00067-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03019naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245014800175300001600323500002400339520142700363650002501790650001201815650001301827650001001840650002101850650002201871650001001893650001901903650001901922650002101941650002201962650001801984650001702002650001402019650001302033650001402046650003002060650002302090650001102113650001902124651001102143700003302154700003602187700002502223700002602248700002702274773012402301852000902425856005502434655001202489IND4443437520221122213540.0101015e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444343752DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00424.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, GianaBastos10aDiagnosis of Necrotizing Hepatopancreatitis in Pacific White Shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, through Wet Mount, Histopathology and PCR Techniques  ap. 816-822.  aIncludes references  aThe shrimp disease necrotizing hepatopancreatitis (NHPB) is caused by an intracellular rickettsia-like bacterium. When present on shrimp farms this pathogen leads to high mortalities and economic losses. In an effort to improve the diagnosis of NHPB in farmed Litopenaeus vannamei, we compared two traditional techniques, wet mounts and histopathology with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Shrimp (n = 154) were collected from a commercial farm in Brazil with reportedly high mortalities caused by NHPB and had their hepatopancreas divided into three samples; one sample was wet mounted and examined under a light microscope for alteration in fluid color, lipid content, and tubular alteration (presence of loose cells, atrophy, melanization, necrosis, and hemocytic nodules), while the other two were fixed and preserved for histopathology (examined for hemocytic infiltration, edema, granulomatous lesions, and tubular atrophy) and PCR analyses. A poor correlation (R = 0.0718) was found among the PCR results and those parameters observed in wet mounts or histopathology, because a significant percentage of PCR negative individuals also presented hepatopancreatic lesions, possibly caused by other etiologies besides NHPB. Under the specific conditions of our study, we conclude that neither wet mount examination nor histopathology techniques should be used without confirmatory PCR to diagnose NHPB in farmed shrimp. 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aatrophy 3abacteria 3acolor 3acommercial farms 3adisease diagnosis 3aedema 3ahepatopancreas 3ahistopathology 3alesions (animal) 3alight microscopes 3alipid content 3amelanization 3amortality 3anecrosis 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ashellfish diseases 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3aBrazil1 aSantosDomingos, JoséAntonio1 aOliveira, KarineKellyCavalcanti1 aDePaulaMendes, Paulo1 aArnsDaSilva, Veronica1 aMendes, EmikoShinozaki0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2010 Oct., v. 41, no. 5 p.816-822dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00424.x 7aarticle02742naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245011400168300001800282500002400300520149400324650001101818650003001829650001201859650001501871650001501886650002001901650001501921650001901936650001101955650001601966650001301982650002401995650002102019700001502040700002002055700001302075700001702088700002102105773011802126852000902244856005502253655001202308IND4397982920221122064653.0071118e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439798292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00941.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheis, D.E.10aDynamics of soil organic matter turnover and soil respired CO₂ in a temperate grassland labelled with ¹³C  ap. 1364-1372.  aIncludes references  aThe fate of carbon (C) in grassland soils is of particular interest since the vast majority in grassland ecosystems is stored below ground and respiratory C-release from soils is a major component of the global C balance. The use of ¹³C-depleted CO₂ in a 10-year free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiment, gave a unique opportunity to study the turnover of the C sequestered during this experiment. Soil organic matter (SOM), soil air and plant material were analysed for δ¹³C and C contents in the last year of the FACE experiment (2002) and in the two following growing seasons. After 10 years of exposure to CO₂ enrichment at 600 ppmv, no significant differences in SOM C content could be detected between fumigated and non-fumigated plots. A ¹³C depletion of 3.4[per thousand] was found in SOM (0-12 cm) of the fumigated soils in comparison with the control soils and a rapid decrease of this difference was observed after the end of fumigation. Within 2 years, 49% of the C in this SOM (0-12 cm) was exchanged with fresh C, with the limitation that this exchange cannot be further dissected into respiratory decay of old C and freshly sequestered new C. By analysing the mechanistic effects of a drought on the plant-soil system it was shown that rhizosphere respiration is the dominant factor in soil respiration. Consideration of ecophysiological factors that drive plant activity is therefore important when soil respiration is to be investigated or modelled. 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3adrought 3aecosystems 3afumigation 3agrassland soils 3agrasslands 3agrowing season 3amodels 3arhizosphere 3asoil air 3asoil organic matter 3asoil respiration1 aJaeggi, M.1 aAeschlimann, D.1 aBlum, H.1 aFrossard, E.1 aSiegwolf, R.T.W.0 tEuropean journal of soil science.g2007 Dec., v. 58, no. 6 p.1364-1372dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1351-07547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2389.2007.00941.x 7aarticle02095naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002300166245007700189300001600266500002400282520089300306650001801199650001001217650001001227650001701237650001501254650002301269650001501292650002601307651001201333700002501345700002501370700002301395773008901418852000901507856008801516930003301604945002501637946001101662655001201673IND4402978120221122035659.0080319e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440297812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2007.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF1101 aGilreath, James P.10aEfficacy of early post-transplant herbicides in leeks (Allium porrum L.)  ap. 847-850.  aIncludes references  aThree field studies were conducted to determine the selectivity on leeks (Allium porrum L.) of early post-transplant herbicides and their efficacy on weed populations and crop yields.

Research is now indicating that is partly due to ineffective EST training methods, resulting in a lack of therapist competence. However, at present, the specific competencies that are required for the effective implementation of ESTs for this population are unknown, making the development of more effective EST training difficult. This study therefore aimed to develop a model of therapist competencies for the empirically supported cognitive behavioral treatment of child and adolescent anxiety and depressive disorders using a version of the well-established Delphi technique. In doing so, the authors: (1) identified and reviewed cognitive behavioral ESTs for child and adolescent anxiety and depressive disorders, (2) extracted therapist competencies required to implement each treatment effectively, (3) validated these competency lists with EST authors, (4) consulted with a panel of relevant local experts to generate an overall model of therapist competence for the empirically supported cognitive behavioral treatment of child and adolescent anxiety and depressive disorders, and (5) validated the overall model with EST manual authors and relevant international experts. The resultant model offers an empirically derived set of competencies necessary for effectively treating children and adolescents with anxiety and depressive disorders and has wide implications for the development of therapist training, competence assessment measures, and evidence-based practice guidelines for working with this population. This model thus brings us one step closer to bridging the gap between science and practice when treating child and adolescent anxiety and depression. 0aCompetencies 0aChild and adolescent 0aDepression and anxiety 0aTraining 0aDissemination1 aSchniering, Carolyn A. 1 aLyneham, Heidi J. 1 aRapee, Ronald M. 0 tClinical child and family psychology review.g2011 Mar., v. 14, no. 1 p.89-109dBoston : Springer USx1096-40377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10567-011-0083-63Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110327  aOther US 7aarticle02758naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245017400166300001600340520122800356650002001584650002201604650004301626650001101669650001501680650002301695650001601718650002601734650001201760650001301772650002501785650001701810650001301827650002001840650001601860650001901876653003701895653000901932653002501941653000901966653001601975700002201991773011302013852000902126856008502135930003302220946001102253655001202264IND4450735520221122230730.0110316e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445073552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-010-0983-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDann, Alison L. 10aComparative assessment of genetic and epigenetic variation among regenerants of potato (Solanum tuberosum) derived from long-term nodal tissue-culture and cell selection  ap. 631-639.  aThree long-term nodal tissued cultured Russet Burbank potato clones and nine thaxtomin A-treated regenerant lines, derived from the nodal lines, were assessed for genetic and epigenetic (in the form of DNA methylation) differences by AFLP and MSAP. The treated regenerant lines were originally selected for superior resistance to common scab disease and acceptable tuber yield in pot and field trials. The long-term, tissue culture clone lines exhibited genetic (8.75-15.63% polymorphisms) and epigenetic (12.56-26.13% polymorphisms) differences between them and may represent a stress response induced by normal plant growth disruption. The thaxtomin A-treated regenerant lines exhibited much higher significant (p < 0.05) genetic (2-29.38%) and epigenetic (45.22-51.76%) polymorphisms than the nodal cultured parent clones. Methylation-sensitive mutations accumulated within the regenerant lines are significantly correlated (p < 0.05) to disease resistance. However, linking phenotypic differences that could be of benefit to potato growers, to single gene sequence polymorphisms in a tetraploid plant such as the potato would be extremely difficult since it is assumed many desirable traits are under polygenic control. 3aDNA methylation 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aclones 3acrop yield 3adisease resistance 3aepigenetics 3afield experimentation 3agrowers 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant growth 3apotatoes 3astress response 3atetraploidy 3atissue culture 0aTissue culture-induced variation 0aAFLP 0aCytosine methylation 0aMSAP 0aThaxtomin A1 aWilson, Calum R. 0 tPlant cell reports.g2011 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.631-639dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-010-0983-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20110316b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02398naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245008700162300001600249520127700265650001101542650001701553653000901570653000901579653000901588653002201597700002101619700002701640700002401667700002101691700002101712700002401733773012701757852000901884856008501893930003301978946001302011655001202024IND4450764120221122230636.0110316e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445076412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00418-011-0789-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIde, Shinji 10aLeptin and vascular endothelial growth factor regulate angiogenesis in tooth germs  ap. 281-292.  aLeptin, a 16 kDa non-glycolated polypeptide of 146 amino acids produced by the ob gene, has a variety of physiological roles not only in lipid metabolism, hematopoiesis, thermogenesis and ovarian function, but also in angiogenesis. This study focuses to investigate the possibility that leptin, as an angiogenic factor, may regulate the angiogenesis during tooth development. We firstly studied the expression of leptin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) during tooth development immunohistochemically. This investigation revealed that leptin is expressed in ameloblasts, odontoblasts, dental papilla cells and stratum intermedium cells. This expression pattern was similar to that of VEGF, one of the most potent angiogenic factors. Interestingly, more leptin-positive cells were observed in the upper third portion of dental papilla, which is closest to odontoblastic layer, compared to middle and lower thirds. Moreover, in the dental papilla, more CD31 and/or CD34-positive vascular endothelial cells were observed in the vicinity of ameloblasts and odontoblasts expressing leptin and VEGF. These findings strongly suggest that ameloblasts, odontoblasts and dental papilla cells induce the angiogenesis in tooth germs by secretion of leptin as well as VEGF. 3aleptin 3aangiogenesis 0aVEGF 0aCD31 0aCD34 0aTooth development1 aTokuyama, Reiko 1 aDavaadorj, Purevsuren 1 aShimozuma, Masashi 1 aKumasaka, Shuku 1 aTatehara, Seiko 1 aSatomura, Kazuhito 0 tHistochemistry and cell biology.g2011 Mar., v. 135, no. 3 p.281-292dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0948-61437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00418-011-0789-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110316b20110402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02717naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009800162300001800260520114400278650002801422650003201450650002701482650001001509650002101519650001201540650001701552650001301569650002801582650003001610650001301640650002001653650001201673650003601685650001501721650000901736653002201745653001901767653002201786700001401808700001901822700001501841700002001856700001801876700001801894773013701912852000902049856008502058930003302143946001102176655001202187IND4450813020221122221305.0110316e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445081302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-010-4463-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Han-Zhi 10aProteomics investigation on aristolochic acid nephropathy: a case study on rat kidney tissues  ap. 3431-3439.  aProlonged intake of aristolochic acid (AA) has been shown to be associated with the development of certain renal disorders. Renal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis are the early symptoms of AA nephropathy. The symptoms were observed in rats that were dosed with AA at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day for 1 month. Apart from the renal tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, AA-DNA adducts were detected in the rat kidney tissue. Differentiated proteins were identified in the kidney tissues from proteomics investigations. The upregulated proteins identified included ornithine aminotransferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, actin, aspartoacylase, 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, and peroxiredoxin-1. Downregulated proteins such as ATP synthase subunit β, glutamate dehydrogenase 1, regucalcin, glutamate-cysteine ligase regulatory subunit, dihydropteridine reductase, hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1, prohibitin, and adenylate kinase isoenzyme 4 were also identified. Several identified protein markers were found to have biological and medical significance.

We studied 12 patients who had been diagnosed with HSPN of at least ISKDC type III. All patients were treated with MUPM. Clinical features, pathological findings, and prognosis were prospectively investigated. Ten patients (responders; nine with ISKDC grade IIIb and one with grade IVb) were treated with MUPM, whereas MUPM was discontinued due to the lack of response in two patients (non-responders; two with grade IVb). Among responders, urinary protein excretion had decreased significantly from 99.7 ± 37.8 to 25.9 ± 33.4 mg/m² per hour after 3 months of therapy. The acute index and tubulointerstitial scores decreased significantly from 5.8 ± 1.5 and 3.8 ± 0.6 at the first biopsy to 2.3 ± 1.3 and 1.0 ± 0.8 at the second biopsy, respectively. At the most recent follow-up, eight of the responders had normal urine, and two had minor urinary abnormalities. Non-responders demonstrated continued high levels of urinary protein excretion after 3 months of therapy, and MUPM was discontinued. Our study suggests that MUPM is effective in ameliorating the proteinuria and the histological severity of HSPN in patients with <50% crescents but is not so effective for HSPN in patients with >50% crescents. 3aprognosis 0aHSPN 0aMethylprednisolone pulse therapy 0aMizoribine 0aUrokinase pulse therapy1 aSuyama, Kazuhide 1 aHashimoto, Koichi 1 aHosoya, Mitsuaki 0 tClinical rheumatology.g2011 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.529-535dLondon : Springer-Verlagx0770-31987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10067-010-1572-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20110327b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02855naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002300179245009900202300001200301506007600313520149800389506003701887650002101924650001701945650003001962650001101992650002202003650001802025650001902043650001402062650001202076650002702088700002002115700001702135700002302152773008002175852000902255856007802264930003302342946001102375990002302386655001202409IND4418034520221207120830.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441803452DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp0392doi7 aPMC26556822pmcid7 a191900952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuranaka, Norihito13aAn efficient platform for genetic selection and screening of gene switches in Escherichia coli  ap. e39.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEngineered gene switches and circuits that can sense various biochemical and physical signals, perform computation, and produce predictable outputs are expected to greatly advance our ability to program complex cellular behaviors. However, rational design of gene switches and circuits that function in living cells is challenging due to the complex intracellular milieu. Consequently, most successful designs of gene switches and circuits have relied, to some extent, on high-throughput screening and/or selection from combinatorial libraries of gene switch and circuit variants. In this study, we describe a generic and efficient platform for selection and screening of gene switches and circuits in Escherichia coli from large libraries. The single-gene dual selection marker tetA was translationally fused to green fluorescent protein (gfpuv) via a flexible peptide linker and used as a dual selection and screening marker for laboratory evolution of gene switches. Single-cycle (sequential positive and negative selections) enrichment efficiencies of >7000 were observed in mock selections of model libraries containing functional riboswitches in liquid culture. The technique was applied to optimize various parameters affecting the selection outcome, and to isolate novel thiamine pyrophosphate riboswitches from a complex library. Artificial riboswitches with excellent characteristics were isolated that exhibit up to 58-fold activation as measured by fluorescent reporter gene assay.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3afluorescence 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amodels 3anatural selection 3anucleic acids 3areporter genes 3ascreening 3athiamin 3atranslation (genetics)1 aSharma, Vandana1 aNomura, Yoko1 aYokobayashi, Yohei0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Apr., v. 37, no. 5 p.e39-e39x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp0393Available from publisher's Web site  a20090320b20090508c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02743naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245015300160300001600313520174200329650001402071653003402085653000902119653000802128653002502136700001902161700001602180700001702196773011102213852000902324856008502333946001102418655001202429IND4450789520221122152015.0110316e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445078952DNAL7 a10.1007/s11030-010-9250-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuzyn, T. 10aEstimating persistence of brominated and chlorinated organic pollutants in air, water, soil, and sediments with the QSPR-based classification scheme  ap. 173-188.  aWe have estimated degradation half-lives of both brominated and chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PBDDs and PCDDs), furans (PBDFs and PCDFs), biphenyls (PBBs and PCBs), naphthalenes (PBNs and PCNs), diphenyl ethers (PBDEs and PCDEs) as well as selected unsubstituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in air, surface water, surface soil, and sediments (in total of 1,431 compounds in four compartments). Next, we compared the persistence between chloro- (relatively well-studied) and bromo- (less studied) analogs. The predictions have been performed based on the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) scheme with use of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier and the semi-quantitative system of persistence classes. The classification models utilized principal components derived from the principal component analysis of a set of 24 constitutional and quantum mechanical descriptors as input variables. Accuracies of classification (based on an external validation) were 86, 85, 87, and 75% for air, surface water, surface soil, and sediments, respectively. The persistence of all chlorinated species increased with increasing halogenation degree. In the case of brominated organic pollutants (Br-OPs), the trend was the same for air and sediments. However, we noticed that the opposite trend for persistence in surface water and soil. The results suggest that, due to high photoreactivity of C-Br chemical bonds, photolytic processes occurring in surface water and soil are able to play significant role in transforming and removing Br-OPs from these compartments. This contribution is the first attempt of classifying together Br-OPs and Cl-OPs according to their persistence, in particular, environmental compartments. 3ahalf life 0aBrominated organic pollutants 0aQSPR 0akNN 0aClass of persistence1 aHaranczyk, M. 1 aSuzuki, N. 1 aSakurai, T. 0 tMolecular diversity.g2011 Feb., v. 15, no. 1 p.173-188dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1381-19917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11030-010-9250-93Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02660naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245008900156300001600245520125700261650001501518650002001533650001201553650001501565650002601580650001901606650002301625650002201648650002501670650001401695650001301709650001501722650001101737650001301748650001601761650001701777650001501794651001501809653002001824653002801844653001801872700002601890773012201916852000902038856007502047930003302122946001102155655001202166IND4451266020221122152056.0110325s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445126602DNAL7 a10.1071/MF092862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViers, Joshua H.10aFreshwater conservation options for a changing climate in California's Sierra Nevada  ap. 266-278.  aCatchments of California's Sierra Nevada have been managed for hydropower, water supply, recreation and the environment, during which regional freshwater ecosystems have experienced extirpations of anadromous fishes, widespread loss in amphibian abundance and increases in non-native species. California's Mediterranean-montane climate is expected to warm by 2-6°C over the next century, reducing snowpack, causing earlier runoff and altering flows. Freshwater conservation efforts currently rely on a patchwork of legal and regulatory mechanisms, and have failed to achieve their full potential because of weak and uncoordinated implementation. No scheme adequately addresses freshwater conservation objectives such as representation and persistence, and all ignore anticipated impacts of climate change. We recommend that (1) existing legislation be fully implemented, with explicit anticipation of future conditions, (2) local institutions develop and implement a systematic freshwater conservation plan, focusing on resilience to climate warming, (3) policies be crafted to prioritise catchments to emphasise key regional objectives (e.g. conservation) and (4) regional planning agencies with regulatory authority be formed at the catchment level. 3aamphibians 3aanadromous fish 3aclimate 3afreshwater 3afreshwater ecosystems 3aglobal warming 3aintroduced species 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3amountains 3aplanning 3arecreation 3arunoff 3asnowpack 3awater power 3awater supply 3awatersheds 3aCalifornia 0aclimate warming 0afreshwater conservation 0aSierra Nevada1 aRheinheimer, David E.0 tMarine & freshwater research.g2011, v. 62, no. 3 p.266-278dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1323-16507nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/MF092863Available from publisher's Web site  a20110325b20110402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03255naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001800181245013800199300001800337500002400355506007600379520164700455506003702102650002202139650003102161650002102192650002702213650002102240650002402261650001402285650001402299650001402313650003702327650002902364650001502393650003902408650002302447700001802470700002602488773013402514852000902648856008002657856004802737655001202785IND4384177020221207130907.0061007e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438417702DNAL7 a170212282pmid7 aPMC16102742pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00844-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobley, Laura10aBdellovibrio Predation in the Presence of Decoys: Three-Way Bacterial Interactions Revealed by Mathematical and Experimental Analyses  ap. 6757-6765.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a small, gram-negative, motile bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria, including several known human pathogens. Its predation efficiency is usually studied in pure cultures containing solely B. bacteriovorus and a suitable prey. However, in natural environments, as well as in any possible biomedical uses as an antimicrobial, Bdellovibrio is predatory in the presence of diverse decoys, including live nonsusceptible bacteria, eukaryotic cells, and cell debris. Here we gathered and mathematically modeled data from three-member cultures containing predator, prey, and nonsusceptible bacterial decoys. Specifically, we studied the rate of predation of planktonic late-log-phase Escherichia coli S17-1 prey by B. bacteriovorus HD100, both in the presence and in the absence of Bacillus subtilis nonsporulating strain 671, which acted as a live bacterial decoy. Interestingly, we found that although addition of the live Bacillus decoy did decrease the rate of Bdellovibrio predation in liquid cultures, this addition also resulted in a partially compensatory enhancement of the availability of prey for predation. This effect resulted in a higher final yield of Bdellovibrio than would be predicted for a simple inert decoy. Our mathematical model accounts for both negative and positive effects of predator-prey-decoy interactions in the closed batch environment. In addition, it informs considerations for predator dosing in any future therapeutic applications and sheds some light on considerations for modeling the massively complex interactions of real mixed bacterial populations in nature.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus subtilis 3aBdellovibrio bacteriovorus 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aeukaryotic cells 3amathematical models 3apathogens 3apredation 3apredators 2aBacillus subtilisxpathogenicity 2aBdellovibrioxphysiology 2aFood Chain 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxphysiology 2aModels, Biological1 aKing, John R.1 aSockett, R.

In this study, low-frequency and low-intensity ultrasound was employed to accelerate the alliinase-catalysed synthesis of allicin in freshly crushed garlic. RESULTS: The optimal conditions for improvement of the alliinase-catalysed synthesis of allicin in freshly crushed garlic were found to be as follows: ultrasound intensity 0.4 W cm⁻², ultrasound frequency 50 kHz, enzymatic reaction temperature 35 °C and reaction time 30 min. Under these conditions the yield of allicin was increased by about 25.2% compared with the control without ultrasound. Alliinase in the freshly crushed garlic was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and gel filtration on a Sephacryl S-200 column. The employed ultrasound increased the activity of the purified alliinase by about 42.8%, did not affect the enzyme's temperature optimum and improved its thermal stability. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicated that the activity of alliinase in freshly crushed garlic might be enhanced by low-frequency and low-intensity ultrasound, thereby accelerating the alliinase-catalysed conversion of alliin in garlic to allicin. 3aallicin 3aammonium sulfate 3aenzymatic reactions 3afiltration 3agarlic 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3aultrasonics 2aCarbon-Sulfur Lyasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCatalysis 2aCysteinexanalogs & derivativesxmetabolism. 2aDrug Stability 2aFiltration 2aGarlicxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aPlant Extractsxmetabolism 2aSonicationxmethods 2aSulfinic Acidsxmetabolism 2aTemperature1 aCao, Yanping1 aWang, Chengtao1 aSun, Baoguo0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 91, no. 10 p.1766-1772dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4377 7aarticle02205naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245010700131300001400238500001500252520100100267650002001268650001101288650001001299650001601309650001301325650001901338650001301357650002701370650001101397650001101408653001501419653002901434653001601463653001701479653003201496653002401528700001701552700001801569700001301587773008101600852000901681930003301690945001301723946001101736655001201747IND2202147320221120151150.0000104e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220214732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaergestad, E.M.10aInfluence of flour quality and baking process on hearth bread characteristics made using gentle mixing  ap. 61-70.  a2019-12-05  aHearth bread was made from 12 blends of four flours, which varied in protein content (10.2-14.3%) and protein quality, by a straight dough baking procedure. Doughs were mixed using a Farinograph operated at 63 rpm for variable mixing times (5-25 min), and proof times were also varied (35-60 min). Loaf volume was strongly positively related to protein content(r = 0.95), Farinograph dough development time (FDT) (r = 0.88) and Farinograph dough stability (FDS) (r = 0.97), but not to Zeleny sedimentation volume, SDS sedimentation volume or Mixograph peak time (MPT). Similar observations were found for the form ratio of loaves. The positive relationships between protein content on the one hand and loaf volume and form ratio on the other were only observed at medium (15 min) and long (25 min) mixing times, but not after a short mixing time (5 min). Furthermore, loaf characteristics were strongly affected by the process parameters, giving independent effects on loaf volume vs. form ratio. 3aprotein content 3amixing 3adough 3awheat flour 3arheology 3abaking quality 3aduration 3arheological properties 3abreads 3abaking 0aproof time 0asds sedimentation volume 0aloaf volume 0afood quality 0azeleny sedimentation volume 0aprotein composition1 aMagnus, E.M.1 aSahlstrom, S.1 aNaes, T.0 tJournal of cereal science.g1999 July, v. 30, no. 1 p.61-70x0733-52107nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02394naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007600125300001600201500001500217520112600232650001401358650002101372650001101393650002001404650001501424650000901439650001101448650002001459650001401479650001601493650001801509650001101527650001201538650002101550650001701571650000901588650001401597650002001611653001201631653000801643653002501651653002001676700001601696700001501712773008301727852000901810930003301819945001301852946001101865655001201876IND2201089220221120140441.0991014e199903  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220108922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoksel, H.10aBarley bulgur: effect of processing and cooking on chemical composition  ap. 185-190.  a2019-12-05  aThree barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L.) were processed into bulgur by pressure cooking or cooking at atmospheric pressure. The effect of processing on levels of thiamine, riboflavin, minerals (Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg) as well as the phytic acid and beta-glucan was investigated. Significant decreases (p<0(.)05) were observed in ash, riboflavin and thiamine contents during bulgur processing. Neither the cooking methods nor the dehulling process had significant influence on the content of Fe, Cu, Zn or Mg. However, the Mn and Ca content of the bulgurs were significantly (p<0(.)05) lower compared with the corresponding raw barleys. For all cultivars total P and phytate P contents of the bulgurs were significantly (p<0(.)05) lower compared with the corresponding raw barleys. In contrast, levels of beta-glucan were significantly higher in processed bulgur vs raw barley. Protein contents of the samples did not change significantly during bulgur processing. Bulgur processed from barley appeared to retain most of the nutritional value of raw barley, in particular it showed high levels of soluble dietary fibre. 3amanganese 3anutrient content 3abarley 3aHordeum vulgare 3ariboflavin 3airon 3abulgur 3amineral content 3acultivars 3aphytic acid 3adietary fiber 3acopper 3acalcium 3apressure cooking 3abeta-glucans 3azinc 3amagnesium 3aprotein content 0acooking 0aash 0achemical composition 0afood processing1 aEdney, M.J.1 aOzkaya, B.0 tJournal of cereal science.g1999 Mar., v. 29, no. 2 p.185-190x0733-52107nnas  aDNAL  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04287naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001900186245013400205300001800339500001500357520202900372650002502401650002202426650003102448650002502479650001202504650003602516650002902552650004602581650004402627650001102671650003102682650005302713650003902766650006002805650000902865650002302874650004102897650005602938650000902994650001703003650002803020653003603048653001703084653002803101653002203129653001903151653003603170700001903206700001803225700001703243700001803260700001803278700002303296700002703319700002503346773010803371852000903479856006903488930003303557946001103590655001203601IND4390162820221120130920.0070408e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439016282DNAL7 a173331052pmid7 aPMC19142922pmcid7 a10.1007/s00125-007-0621-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, J.

AGEs formed in the diabetic milieu affect the same processes, leading to diabetic complications including diabetic retinopathy. We hypothesised that pathological effects of AGEs in the diabetic retina are a consequence of AGE-induced alterations in CCN family expression. Materials and methods CCN gene expression levels were studied at the mRNA and protein level in retinas of control and diabetic rats using real-time quantitative PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry at 6 and 12 weeks of streptozotocin-induced diabetes in the presence or absence of aminoguanidine, an AGE inhibitor. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were repeatedly injected with exogenously formed AGE to establish whether AGE modulate retinal CCN growth factors in vivo. Results After 6 weeks of diabetes, Cyr61 expression levels were increased more than threefold. At 12 weeks of diabetes, Ctgf expression levels were increased twofold. Treatment with aminoguanidine inhibited Cyr61 and Ctgf expression in diabetic rats, with reductions of 31 and 36%, respectively, compared with untreated animals. Western blotting showed a twofold increase in CTGF production, which was prevented by aminoguanidine treatment. In mice infused with exogenous AGE, Cyr61 expression increased fourfold and Ctgf expression increased twofold in the retina. Conclusions/interpretation CTGF and CYR61 are downstream effectors of AGE in the diabetic retina, implicating them as possible targets for future intervention strategies against the development of diabetic retinopathy. 3adiabetic retinopathy 3abasement membrane 3agene expression regulation 3aextracellular matrix 2aAnimals 2aConnective Tissue Growth Factor 2aCysteine-Rich Protein 61 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxgenetics 2aExtracellular Matrix Proteinsxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGlycosylation End Products, Advancedxphysiology 2aImmediate-Early Proteinsxgenetics 2aIntercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxgenetics 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNephroblastoma Overexpressed Protein 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aRetinaxphysiopathology 0aAdvanced glycation end products 0aExperimental 0aCystein-rich protein 61 0adiabetes mellitus 0aAminoguanidine 0aConnective tissue growth factor1 aKuiper, E.

E. 10aShortcomings in methodology complicate measurements of serum retinol binding protein (RBP4) in insulin-resistant human subjects  ap. 814-823.  aAims/hypothesis Levels of retinol binding protein (RBP4) are increased in the serum of insulin-resistant human subjects even before overt diabetes develops. RBP4 levels correlate with insulin resistance, BMI, WHR, dyslipidaemia and hypertension. Improvement of insulin sensitivity with exercise training is associated with reduction in serum RBP4 levels. Therefore serum RBP4 may be useful for early diagnosis of insulin resistance and for monitoring improvements in insulin sensitivity. We sought to determine the performance of assays for this application. Subjects and methods We compared quantitative western blotting and three commercially available multiwell immunoassays in parallel measurements of RBP4 concentrations in serum from insulin-sensitive subjects and from insulin-resistant subjects with impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. Results The assays yielded different absolute values and magnitudes of elevation of serum RBP4. Western blotting and a sandwich ELISA reported RBP4 concentrations that highly inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity measured by euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp. However, western blotting yielded concentrations with a greater dynamic range and less overlap between control and insulin-resistant subjects. Two competitive enzyme-linked immunoassays undervalued serum RBP4 concentrations in insulin-resistant subjects, possibly due to assay saturation. Poor linearity of dilution also limited assay utility. All assays tested exhibited greater immunoreactivity with urinary (C-terminal proteolysed) RBP4 than with full-length RBP4, the predominant form in serum. Conclusions/interpretations These findings support the use of quantitative western blotting standardised to full-length RBP4 protein as a 'gold standard' method for measuring serum RBP4 in insulin-resistant states. Other assays should use full-length RBP4 and be extensively cross-validated using other methods. 3ametabolic syndrome 3aobesity 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3avitamin A 3aadipokines 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlotting, Western 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xblood 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aImmunoassayxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aInsulinxbloodxmetabolism. 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMetabolic Syndromexmetabolism. 2aObesityxbloodxmetabolism. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aRetinol-Binding Proteinsxanalysisxbiosynthesis. 2aRetinol-Binding Proteins, Plasma 2aVitamin Axmetabolism 0aInsulin-resistance1 aWason, C.

We evaluated the technique of oscillatory neck suction at 0.1 Hz to quantify cerebral regulation in diabetic patients and healthy control subjects. Subjects and methods In nine type 2 diabetic patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy and 11 age-matched controls, we measured blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity responses to application of 0.1 Hz neck suction. We determined spectral powers and calculated the transfer function gain and phase shift between 0.1 Hz blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity oscillations as parameters of cerebral regulation. Results In the patients and control subjects, neck suction did not significantly influence mean values of the RR interval, blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity. The powers of 0.1 Hz blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity oscillations increased in the control subjects, but remained stable in the patients. Transfer function gain remained stable in both groups. Phase shift decreased in the patients, but remained stable in control subjects. Conclusions/interpretation The absence of an increase in the power of 0.1 Hz blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity oscillations confirmed autonomic neuropathy in the diabetic patients. Gain analysis did not show altered cerebral regulation. The decrease in phase shift in the patients indicates a more passive transmission of neck suction-induced blood pressure fluctuations onto the cerebrovascular circulation, i.e. altered cerebral regulation, in the patients, and is therefore suited to identifying subtle impairment of cerebral regulation in these patients. 3aspectral analysis 3asympathetic nervous system 2aAutonomic Nervous System Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aBlood Pressure 2aBrainxphysiopathology 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xphysiopathology 2aDiabetic Angiopathiesxphysiopathology 2aDiabetic Neuropathiesxphysiopathology 2aElectrocardiography 2aHeart Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aHumans 2aManometry 2aReference Values 2aStrokexepidemiology 2aSuction 2aSupine Position 0aAutonomic neuropathy 0aHeart rate variability 0aPhase shift 0aTransfer function gain1 aBrown, C.

The main objective of the study was to analyse whether MBL influences the effects of diabetes on the kidneys. Materials and methods In one group of wild-type mice and in one group of MBL double knockout mice we induced diabetes by the use of streptozotocin as a model of type 1 diabetes. Two groups of non-diabetic mice, wild-type and MBL knockout, were also included. By two-way ANOVA we evaluated if MBL modulated the effects of diabetes by testing the interaction between diabetes and MBL. Results MBL interacted with the effects of diabetes on three outcome measures: kidney weight (p < 0.001), urinary albumin excretion (p = 0.001) and the expression of collagen IVα1 (Col4a1) mRNA (p = 0.002). This means that the effects that diabetes normally has on these parameters were significantly modified by MBL. MBL showed a tendency to interact with the effects of diabetes on glomerular basement membrane thickness and total mesangial volume (p = 0.065 and p = 0.063, respectively). Glomerular volume and total mesangial volume were significantly smaller in animals lacking MBL than in wild-type animals (p = 0.006 and p = 0.047, respectively). Conclusions/interpretation These findings, for the first time, show that the degree of kidney alteration as a consequence of diabetes is modified by MBL. These findings support a pivotal role of MBL in the development of diabetic kidney disease. 3aanimals 3acollagen 3acomplement 3adiabetic nephropathy 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAlbuminsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCollagen Type IVxbiosynthesis 2aCreatininexurine 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxpathologyxtherapy. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xgeneticsxpathology. 2aFemale 2aKidneyxpathology 2aMale 2aMannose-Binding Lectinxdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aOrgan Size 2aStreptozocinxpharmacology 0aAlbumin excretion 0aDiabetic angiopathy 0aKidney weight 0aMannose-binding lectin1 aThiel, S. 1 aGadjeva, M. 1 aHansen, T.

It exerts effects on energy homeostasis via peripheral and central mechanisms. However, it is not clear whether adiponectin crosses the blood-brain barrier in humans. In serum, adiponectin circulates in several different complexes, each of which has distinct functions. Here, we wanted to test whether adiponectin can be found in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and whether specific adiponectin complexes are enriched in CSF compared with peripheral serum samples. We also wanted to establish whether there is a sex-related difference with regard to the distribution of adiponectin oligomers in CSF. Materials and methods We studied 22 subjects (11 men, 11 women) in this study. Their average BMI was 28.0 ± 4.7 kg/m²; average age was 70 ± 7 years. Results Analysis of total adiponectin revealed that adiponectin protein is present in human CSF at approximately 0.1% of serum concentration. The distribution of adiponectin oligomers differs considerably in CSF from that of serum within matched samples from the same patients. Only the adiponectin trimeric and low-molecular-mass hexameric complexes are found in CSF, with a bias towards the trimeric form in most patients. Male subjects have a higher CSF:serum ratio of total adiponectin (p < 0.05; n = 20) and have slightly higher trimer levels in serum and CSF than female subjects. Conclusions/interpretation We conclude that the adiponectin trimer is the predominant oligomer in human CSF. 3ametabolic syndrome 3aadiponectin 3ahumans 3ablood-brain barrier 2aAdiponectinxbloodxcerebrospinal fluid. 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aBody Mass Index 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Weight 0aObesity/energy homeostasis 0aadipokines1 aMcTernan, P.

A. 10aSubtle metabolic and liver gene transcriptional changes underlie diet-induced fatty liver susceptibility in insulin-resistant mice  ap. 1867-1879.  aAims/hypothesis Complex changes in gene expression are associated with insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) promoted by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD). We used functional genomic technologies to document molecular mechanisms associated with diet-induced NAFLD. Materials and Methods Male 129S6 mice were fed a diet containing 40% fat (high-fat diet, HFD) for 15 weeks. Glucose tolerance, in vivo insulin secretion, plasma lipid profile and adiposity were determined. Plasma metabonomics and liver transcriptomics were used to identify changes in gene expression associated with HFD-induced NAFLD. Results In HFD-fed mice, NAFLD and impaired glucose and lipid homeostasis were associated with increased hepatic transcription of genes involved in fatty acid uptake, intracellular transport, modification and elongation, whilst genes involved in beta-oxidation and lipoprotein secretion were, paradoxically, also upregulated. NAFLD developed despite strong and sustained downregulation of transcription of the gene encoding stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (Scd1) and uncoordinated regulation of transcription of Scd1 and the gene encoding sterol regulatory element binding factor 1c (Srebf1c) transcription. Inflammatory mechanisms appeared to be stimulated by HFD. Conclusions/interpretation Our results provide an accurate representation of subtle changes in metabolic and gene expression regulation underlying disease-promoting and compensatory mechanisms, collectively contributing to diet-induced insulin resistance and NAFLD. They suggest that proposed models of NAFLD pathogenesis can be enriched with novel diet-reactive genes and disease mechanisms. 3agenome 3ainsulin resistance 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atranscriptomics 3ametabolomics 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aDietary Fats 2aFatty Liverxgenetics 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aInsulinxsecretion. 2aInsulin Resistancexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aKinetics 2aLipidsxblood 2aLiverxphysiology 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aGene transcription 0aHigh-fat diet1 aDumas, M.

Plant selectable markers were retrofitted on both YAC arms so that recovery of each arm in transgenic calli could be monitored. Stably transformed calli resistant to kanamycin (300 mg/L) were recovered for each size of YAC tested. Two of 12 kanamycin-resistant transformants for the 80 kb YAC and 8 of 29 kanamycin-resistant transformants for the 150 kb YAC also contained a functional hygromycin gene derived from the opposite YAC arm. Southern analyses using probes that spanned the entire 55 kb insert region of the 80 kb YAC confirmed that one of the two double-resistant lines had integrated a fully intact single copy of the YAC DNA while the other contained a major portion of the insert. Transgenic lines that contained only one selectable marker gene from the 80 kb YAC incorporated relatively small portions of the YAC insert DNA distal to the selectable marker. Our data suggest genomic DNA cloned in artificial chromosomes up to 150 kb in size have a reasonable likelihood of being transferred by biolistic methods and integrated intact into the genome of plant cells. Biolistic transfer of YAC DNA may accelerate the isolation of agronomically useful plant genes using map-based cloning strategies. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aDNA 3abiolistics 3agenetic transformation 3acell suspension culture 3agenetic markers 3acallus 3akanamycin 3adrug resistance 3achromosome mapping 3ayeast artificial chromosomes 3atransgenic plants 0ain vitro selection1 aAdam, Gilles.1 aBlowers, A.1 aEarle, E.0 tMolecular breeding.g1998 Oct., v. 4, no. 5 p.449-457x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02746naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245018600126300001600312500001500328520147900343650002701822650001801849650001801867650002201885650001301907650001001920650002201930650002301952650002701975650004002002650002602042650001602068653001502084653001602099653003002115700001602145700001502161773007002176852000902246930003302255945001302288946001102301655001202312IND2322784020221120100841.0010829s2001    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232278402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerrero, S.10aMolecular determinants influencing the inheritance of transgenic virus resistance in segregating tobacco families transformed with the nucleocapsid gene of tomato spotted wilt virus  ap. 131-139.  a2019-12-05  aThe successful introgression of transgenic virus resistance to control tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) epidemics relies on the stable inheritance of this type of resistance. We developed five segregating tobacco families transformed with sense or antisense copies of the TSWV nucleocapsid gene to determine the usefulness of TSWV-resistant transgenic parents in a breeding program, and to define the molecular determinants (transgene dosage, transcript and protein accumulation) controlling the expression of resistance. Three generations per family were evaluated: (1) R3 or R4 progeny derived from resistant transgenic parents used in crosses, (2) F1 hybrids from crosses between the resistant transgenic parents and untransformed tobacco, and (3) F2 progeny derived from resistant F1 plants. Analysis of two of these families revealed that resistance was correlated with either two insertions in hemizygous plants or a single homozygous insertion. In contrast, in two other families, there was no correlation between the number of insertions and the resistance response, but rather resistance was correlated with a single, actively transcribed insertion. Transgene protein accumulation was not detected in any of the plants analyzed, indicating that resistance is probably RNA-mediated. As inheritance of the transgene does not always result in the expression of resistance, special care may be necessary when using transgenic resistant parents in a breeding population. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3aantisense DNA 3atransgenic plants 3amutation 3agenes 3aNicotiana tabacum 3adisease resistance 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aTomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus 3anucleocapsid proteins 3agene dosage 0ainsertions 0asegregation 0aTomato spotted wilt virus1 aRufty, R.C.1 aDaub, M.E.0 tMolecular breeding.g2001, v. 7, no. 2 p.131-139x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03760naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245017700182300001600359520174000375650001802115650002302133650001102156650002002167650001202187650002602199650004302225650003802268650002402306650002602330650002302356650000902379650000902388650002302397650001902420650005502439650006502494650002702559650002902586650004702615650004602662650004202708650000902750650004802759653002302807653001002830700001502840700001802855700001802873700002202891773010702913852000903020856008503029930003303114946001103147655001203158IND4399653920221120075702.0080106e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439965392DNAL7 a180603812pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-007-0861-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadin, M.

The current study assessed the potential role of the lipopolysaccharide receptor known as Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), a component of the innate immune system, in mediating lipid-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Methods The effects of TLR-4 inhibition/deletion on lipid-induced insulin resistance was determined in skeletal muscle of TLR-4 null mice in vivo and in rat L6 myotubes in vitro. Results In mice, acute hyperlipidaemia induced skeletal muscle insulin resistance, but a deletion of TLR-4 conferred significant protection against these effects. In L6 myotubes, inhibition of TLR-4 activity substantially reduced the capacity of the saturated fatty acid palmitate to induce insulin resistance. Importantly, palmitate activated the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) pathway in L6 myotubes and mouse skeletal muscle, and these effects were blocked by inhibition of TLR-4 in L6 myotubes and absence of TLR-4 in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, inhibition of the NFκB pathway downstream of TLR-4 in L6 myotubes also protected against the induction of insulin resistance by palmitate. Conclusions/interpretation Inhibition or absence of TLR-4 confers protection against the detrimental effects of lipids on skeletal muscle insulin action, and these effects are associated with a prevention of the activation of the NFκB pathway by lipids. Importantly, inhibition of the NFκB pathway in myotubes downstream of TLR-4 also protects against lipid-induced insulin resistance, suggesting a mechanism by which reduced TLR-4 activity confers beneficial effects on insulin action. 3aimmune system 3ainsulin resistance 3alipids 3askeletal muscle 2aAnimals 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aGlucose Transporter Type 4xmetabolism 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxpharmacology 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aInsulinxpharmacology 2aInsulin Resistance 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMuscle Fibers, Skeletalxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMuscle, Skeletalxdrug effectsxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aPalmitatesxpharmacology 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxmetabolism 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aToll-Like Receptor 4xgeneticsxphysiology. 0aToll-like receptor 0aNFκB1 aSinha, S. 1 aBhatt, B.

Few biochemical markers reflect calcium status. Fasting urinary calcium:creatinine ratios may hold promise as an easy, inexpensive method to indicate recent calcium status. Calcium status may best be assessed by integrated measures of calcium assimilation, such as total-body calcium. Although bone-mass measurements do not correlate well with recent dietary intakes of calcium, long-term adequacy of calcium intake influences bone mass. Whether low calcium intakes lead to calcium deficiencies depends on one's ability to adapt and conserve calcium. The relationship between calcium status and a particular disease state, such as osteoporosis, hypertension, or colon cancer, cannot be established until a reliable indicator of calcium status is found. 3acalcium 3anutritional status 3anutrition assessment 3ametabolism 3anutrient deficiencies 3abone formation 3ablood serum 3aurine 3acreatinine 0aliterature reviews0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Nov., v. 120, no. 11S p.1470-1473x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03173naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245009900186300001400285520153200299650001401831650004001845650001501885650001001900650002301910650003501933650001001968650002101978650005601999650001102055650001102066650001402077650001102091650002002102650002002122650000902142650001702151650001202168651001202180653001602192653001902208653001602227700002002243700002102263700001902284700002302303700002202326700002002348773010502368852000902473856006902482930003302551946001102584655001202595IND4387936320221120033835.0070218e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438793632DNAL7 a170939482pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-006-0456-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaiserman, A.

This finding indicates that environmental factors operating during pre- and/or postnatal development could be aetiologically important. We examined whether the pattern of month of birth for type 1 diabetes patients in Ukraine differs from that for total live births. Methods Data consist of prevalent cases of type 1 diabetes in Ukraine by the end of 2003. Cases are restricted to persons born after 1 January 1960, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes before the age of 30 years (n = 20,117). People born during the same time in the general population (n = 29,105,560) were the reference standard. Seasonal patterns were estimated using logistic regression with harmonic terms. Results We found a strongly significant seasonal pattern of type 1 diabetes incidence rates (p < 0.001), with the lowest rates in December and the highest in April. The rate ratio between the extremes was 1.32 (95% CI 1.27-1.39). Tests for seasonal patterns in subgroups defined by sex and age or by sex and date of birth were all significant with p values less than 0.02. We found no interactions with sex (p = 0.142) or age at diagnosis (p = 0.207), but found a strong interaction with period of birth (p < 0.0001). Conclusions/interpretation The results obtained indicate that early-life factors linked to seasons may influence type 1 diabetes risk later in life. 3aincidence 3ainsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBirth Certificates 2aBirth Ratexethnologyxtrends. 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 1xepidemiologyxethnology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aRisk Factors 2aSeasons 0aUkraine 0aAge cohorts 0aMonth of birth 0aSeasonality1 aCarstensen, B. 1 aVoĭtenko, V.

The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D in the United States of 200 IU (5.0 microgram) is reasonable for adults who receive some exposure to sunlight; however, in the absence of any exposure to sunlight, this recommendation may be 2 to 3 times lower than that actually required to satisfy the body's needs. Vitamin D was first measured by bioassays. However, bioassays became obsolete in light of the revelation that vitamin D must be activated first in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) and then in the kidney to 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] before becoming biologically functional. Current assays measure circulating concentrations of vitamin D, 25-OH-D or 1,25(OH)2D. The serum vitamin D concentration is of value for determining the role of sunlight in producing vitamin D in skin and as a provocative test to determine the absorption of vitamin D in patients with malabsorption syndromes. The serum concentration of 25- OH-D is most valuable for determining the overall vitamin D status of an individual, since it is an average of dietary and sunlight-induced vitamin D. The measurement of the serum 1,25(OH)2D concentrations has been most useful in evaluating disorders in calcium and bone metabolism related to acquired and inborn errors in the conversion of 25-OH-D to 1,25(OH)2D. 3ametabolism 3asolar radiation 3anutritional status 3ablood serum 3a25-hydroxyergocalciferol 3aassays 3acalcitriol 3avitamin deficiencies 3ametabolites 0aliterature reviews 0avitamin D0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Nov., v. 120, no. 11S p.1464-1469x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01781naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245004100135300001800176500012800194500001500322520076900337650001801106650002301124650002701147650000901174650002501183650002601208650001401234653002501248653001201273773008301285852000901368939003301377945000801410946001301418655001201431991608568110742620221120033821.0910626e199011  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910018232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnderwood, B.A.10aDose-response tests in field surveys  ap. 1455-1458.  aPaper presented at "Nutrition Monitoring and Nutrition Status Assessment," Charleston, South Carolina, December 8-10, 1989.  a2019-12-04  aSingle static biochemical measures that are commonly used in field surveys often do not capture the dynamic metabolic situation that is most closely related to nutritional status. In contrast, short-term dose-response tests provide more reliable information about nutritional status for some nutrients, but not for others. In vivo response tests for vitamin A and for iron are promising, and in vitro enzyme stimulation tests for thiamin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, and selenium have been widely used. In vivo response tests are constrained by the needs for a waiting period, often for two or more biological samples, and usually for sophisticated instrumentation. In large field surveys, dose-response tests may be best used on a subsample of the population studied. 3adose response 3anutritional status 3awater-soluble vitamins 3airon 3anutrition assessment 3afield experimentation 3avitamin A 0afat soluble vitamins 0atissues0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Nov., v. 120, no. 11S p.1455-1458x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle04058naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245017400182300001800356520186800374650001502242650000902257650001902266650006902285650002202354650003402376650002702410650001102437650004102448650002902489650004002518650002502558650000902583650003602592650001502628650002202643650002102665650002402686650001702710650004002727650004202767651002602809653002902835653003102864653003302895653003602928653001102964653003902975653002903014653004403043700001903087700001803106700002103124700001503145773011003160852000903270856008503279930003303364946001103397655001203408IND4393954520221120033858.0070812e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439395452DNAL7 a176184132pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-007-0746-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahlgren, A. 10aVariants of the TCF7L2 gene are associated with beta cell dysfunction and confer an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the ULSAM cohort of Swedish elderly men  ap. 1852-1857.  aAims/hypothesis In a population-based cohort of elderly men with well-defined phenotypes and biochemical markers related to type 2 diabetes mellitus, we analysed two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs7903146 and rs12255372, in the transcription factor 7-like 2 gene (TCF7L2), which are associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Materials and methods The 1,142 subjects were from the population-based Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men cohort study (see http://www.pubcare.uu.se/ULSAM/, last accessed in May 2007). Insulin sensitivity was assessed using a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp; fasting intact and 32-33 split proinsulin, immunoreactive insulin and specific insulin were measured in plasma samples. The SNPs rs7903146 and rs12255372 were genotyped using a fluorescent homogeneous single base extension assay. The SNP genotypes were analysed against diabetes prevalence at age 70 using logistic regression and against quantitative biochemical measures using linear regression analysis. Results We replicated the association with type 2 diabetes mellitus for both SNPs in this cohort of elderly males. The highest significant odds ratio (2.15, 95% CI 1.20-3.85) was found for SNP rs7903146. The odds ratio for SNP rs12255372 was 1.69 (95% CI 1.20-2.39). Both TCF7L2 SNPs were found to be significantly associated with plasma proinsulin when adjusting for insulin sensitivity, both in the whole cohort and when the diabetic subjects were excluded. Analysis for fasting plasma insulin or insulin sensitivity did not give significant results. Conclusions/interpretation The association between the risk alleles of the two SNPs studied and levels of proinsulin in plasma, identified when adjusting for insulin sensitivity using euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp measurements in this study, is an important novel finding. 3aproinsulin 2aAged 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapyxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aGenetic Variation 2aGlucose Intolerancexgenetics 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aInsulin-Secreting Cellsxphysiology 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aPrevalence 2aProinsulinxblood 2aReference Values 2aRegression Analysis 2aRisk Factors 2aTCF Transcription Factorsxgenetics 2aTranscription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein 0aSwedenxepidemiology. 0aImpaired fasting glucose 0aImpaired glucose tolerance 0aSingle base primer extension 0aSingle nucleotide polymorphisms 0aTCF7L2 0aTranscription factor 7-like 2 gene 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus 0aUppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men1 aZethelius, B. 1 aJensevik, K. 1 aSyvänen, A.-C. 1 aBerne, C. 0 tDiabetologia.g2007 Sept., v. 50, no. 9 p.1852-1857dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-007-0746-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02296naa a2200421 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245004700135300001800182500012800200500002300328500001500351520104100366650002001407650002301427650001601450650001801466650001001484650002801494650002001522650003101542650002501573650001701598650001401615653002301629653002101652653001601673653002701689773008301716852000901799939003301808945000801841946001301849655001201862991608568020742620221120033907.0910626e199011  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910018242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnderwood, B.A.10aMethods for assessment of vitamin A status  ap. 1459-1463.  aPaper presented at "Nutrition Monitoring and Nutrition Status Assessment," Charleston, South Carolina, December 8-10, 1989.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aAssessment of the relative level of vitamin A nutriture in human populations when clinical signs and symptoms of deficiency or of toxicity are absent has presented methodological difficulties.

New and developing nonclinical indicators include the relative dose response (RDR) test or a modification (MRDR) of it, conjunctival impression cytology (CIC), and isotope dilution to estimate total body reserves. These methods, all of which are promising, require additional work to verify their sensitivity, specificity, and predictive power as indicators of relative states of vitamin A depletion for individuals and populations under the many varied conditions commonly associated with an inadequate vitamin status. Currently, the most reliable assessment of vitamin A nutriture is likely when a combination of methods is used. 3anutrient intake 3anutritional status 3ablood serum 3adose response 3aliver 3aretinol-binding protein 3adark adaptation 3aisotope dilution technique 3anutrition assessment 3acell biology 3avitamin A 0aliterature reviews 0abinding proteins 0amethodology 0arelative dose response0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Nov., v. 120, no. 11S p.1459-1463x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01429naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245005800134300001800192500012800210520041800338650002000756650001500776650002100791650002400812650002000836653002700856653002700883700001800910700001700928773008300945852000901028939003301037945000801070946001301078655001201091991608567860742620221120033816.0910626e199011  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910018212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGinnis, J.M.10aNutrition monitoring: interface of science and policy  ap. 1437-1439.  aPaper presented at "Nutrition Monitoring and Nutrition Status Assessment," Charleston, South Carolina, December 8-10, 1989.  aInformation collected through nutrition monitoring efforts is an essential component in the process of effectively translating scientific evidence into public policy.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether Rac-1 is involved in the effect of atorvastatin on oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction. Materials and methods Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) we evaluated the effect of high glucose levels on peroxide production by dihydrodichlorofluorescein and on Rac-1 activity using immunocytochemistry to detect Rac-1 translocation to the membrane. We evaluated vascular function, peroxide production by dihydroethidium and NADPH oxidase activity in vessels from atorvastatin-treated mice. Rac-1 activity was also assessed, both by immunoprecipitation of the Rac-p21-activated kinase complex and by analysis of Rac-1 translocation to the membrane. These experiments were also conducted in vessels infected with an adenoviral vector carrying a constitutively active mutant of Rac-1. Results In HAECs exposed to high glucose levels, atorvastatin prevented oxidative stress, and this protection was associated with impaired Rac-1 activation. This effect was also observed in a murine model of diabetes mellitus. More importantly, the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) blocked the effects of atorvastatin in both glucose-exposed HAECs and diabetic vessels. Atorvastatin failed to afford protection against vascular abnormalities in the presence of a constitutively active mutant of Rac-1. Conclusions/interpretation The results of this study demonstrate that the vascular antioxidant effect of atorvastatin in diabetes is mediated through inhibition of Rac-1 via a reduction in GGPP. Thus, selective Rac-1 inhibition should be considered in the design of novel pharmacological strategies to reduce the impact of diabetes mellitus on vascular function. 3adiabetes 3aoxidative stress 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aAortaxcytology 2aDiabetes Complicationsxmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitusxdrug therapy 2aEndothelial Cellsxcytology 2aHeptanoic Acidsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aOxidative Stress 2aPolyisoprenyl Phosphatesxmetabolism 2aPyrrolesxpharmacology 2arac GTP-Binding Proteinsxmetabolism 0aAtorvastatin 0aRac-11 aGentile, M.

The first stage of folate depletion can be assessed by measuring serum folate levels, which drop prior to tissue depletion, and which are paralleled by a reduction in red blood cell (RBC) folate. Functional changes associated with abnormalities in biochemical pathways can be monitored by the deoxyuridine suppression test. Cell division, including erythropoiesis, becomes impaired in the same time sequence as changes in biochemical functions, as evidenced by abnormal erythrocyte morphology and a reduction in hemoglobin concentration. In addition to inadequate dietary folate intake, key factors that may impair folate utilization and thus status include alcohol consumption, smoking, and specific drugs. Folate requirements may increase during various phases of the life cycle due to physiological stresses such as pregnancy and lactation. Folate status may also be compromised during adolescence and in senescence for diverse reasons that require special emphasis on factors such as biological maturity and socioeconomic status, as well as chronic use of alcohol, drugs, and smoking. 3afolic acid 3anutritional status 3anutrition assessment 3anutrition physiology 3anutrient intake 3asmoking (habit) 3ainfants 3aadolescents 3alactating women 3aelderly 3aalcoholic beverages 3adrugs 0aliterature reviews0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Nov., v. 120, no. 11S p.1508-1511x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02414naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245003300132300001800165500012800183500002300311520128900334650001501623650002501638650002301663650001701686650002401703650001401727650002101741650001001762650001501772650001501787650001801802653002301820653002701843773008301870852000901953939003301962945000801995946001302003655001202016991608566610742620221120021604.0910626e199011  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910018322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeklem, J.E.10aVitamin B-6: a status report  ap. 1503-1507.  aPaper presented at "Nutrition Monitoring and Nutrition Status Assessment," Charleston, South Carolina, December 8-10, 1989.  aLiterature review.  aOver the past 50 yr there has been an increased awareness of the importance of vitamin B-6 in human nutrition. The knowledge base for evaluation of vitamin B-6 status has also increased. Indices for vitamin B-6 status can be separated into direct and indirect measures. Among the direct measures, plasma pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is considered the most relevant. However, measurement of plasma pyridoxal or total vitamin B-6 and urinary 4-pyridoxic acid are also recommended. Indirect measures of vitamin B-6 include the assessment of urinary excretion of xanthurenic acid following a tryptophan load. This is a valid functional index for otherwise healthy persons. Evaluation of erythrocyte transaminase activity and stimulation with PLP provide an estimate of vitamin B-6 intake over an extended period of time. In addition to biochemical measures, determination of vitamin B-6 and protein intake are necessary. Present evidence suggests plasma PLP, urinary 4-pyridoxic acid, at least one indirect measure, and the intake of vitamin B-6 and protein are needed to properly assess vitamin B-6 status. The levels of plasma pyridoxal and erythrocyte PLP are newer measures of status and, with further refinement of methodology, may provide additional insight into vitamin B-6 status. 3apyridoxine 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3ablood plasma 3apyridoxal phosphate 3apyridoxal 3a4-pyridoxic acid 3aurine 3atryptophan 3amethionine 3atransaminases 0aliterature reviews 0apyridoxal 5'-phosphate0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Nov., v. 120, no. 11S p.1503-1507x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle03724naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245009000182300001800272520179600290650001702086650002202103650001102125650002102136650002102157650001202178650002902190650001402219650002002233650004802253650004902301650001102350650002402361650001102385650002102396650000902417650004002426650002102466650002402487653002702511653002802538653001902566653001802585700001902603700001802622700001602640700001802656700001902674700001502693700002002708700001402728700001602742700001602758700002302774700001802797773010902815852000902924856008502933930003303018946001103051655001203062IND4393245020221120021634.0070722e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439324502DNAL7 a175081972pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-007-0684-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIhnat, M.

In this report we sought to duplicate and extend this finding. Materials and methods HUVECs and ARPE-19 retinal cells were incubated in 5 or in 30 mmol/l glucose for 3 weeks or subjected to 1 week of normal glucose after being exposed for 2 weeks to continuous high glucose. HUVECs were also treated in this last condition with several antioxidants. Similarly, four groups of rats were studied for 3 weeks: (1) normal rats; (2) diabetic rats not treated with insulin; (3) diabetic rats treated with insulin during the last week; and (4) diabetic rats treated with insulin plus α-lipoic acid in the last week. Results In human endothelial cells and ARPE-19 retinal cells in culture, as well as in the retina of diabetic rats, levels of the following markers of high glucose stress remained induced for 1 week after levels of glucose had normalised: protein kinase C-β, NAD(P)H oxidase subunit p47phox, BCL-2-associated X protein, 3-nitrotyrosine, fibronectin, poly(ADP-ribose) Blockade of reactive species using different approaches, i.e. the mitochondrial antioxidant α-lipoic acid, overexpression of uncoupling protein 2, oxypurinol, apocynin and the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor PJ34, interrupted the induction both of high glucose stress markers and of the fluorescent reactive oxygen species (ROS) probe CM-H₂DCFDA in human endothelial cells. Similar results were obtained in the retina of diabetic rats with α-lipoic acid added to the last week of normalised glucose. Conclusions/interpretation These results provide proof-of-principle of a ROS-mediated cellular persistence of vascular stress after glucose normalisation. 3aantioxidants 3aendothelial cells 3amemory 3aoxidative stress 3aretinal diseases 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aCells, Cultured 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxmetabolism 2aEndothelium, Vascularxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aHumans 2aOxidative Stress 2aRats 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aRetinaxcytology 2aSignal Transduction 0aDiabetic complications 0aEndothelial dysfunction 0aHyperglycaemia 0aRetinal cells1 aThorpe, J.

Multiple male copulations can have detrimental effects on female fitness due to sperm limitation. 2. Monandrous Naryciinae females are immobile while the males are short-lived and do not feed. Multiple male mating is therefore expected to lead to sperm limitation in females. Sperm limitation and male limitation are hypothesised as causes of the repeated evolution of parthenogenetic reproduction in the Psychidae. 3. In this study, the effects of multiple male mating on female reproduction are investigated in several species of Naryciinae by allowing males multiple copulations. The results for two species, Siederia listerella and Dahlica lichenella, are compared. The sex ratios of 53 natural populations are examined for indications of male limitation. 4. Previous copulations by the male increased the female's risk of remaining unfertilised. However, contrary to expectations, those unfertilised females were capable of successful re-mating. 5. In S. listerella, the number of previous copulations of males negatively influenced female fitness. Females produced 30% fewer offspring if they mated with a previously mated male. In D. lichenella, the older the male and the lower its number of total lifetime copulations, the higher the female's reproductive success. 6. Only a fraction of the investigated populations had a female-skewed sex ratio, but differences in development time between males and females could lead to reproductive asynchrony. 7. In conclusion, male mating history did not lead to strong sperm limitation in Naryciinae as had been suggested by their life history. 3aPsychidae 3aevolution 3afemales 3alife history 3amales 3asex ratio 3aspermatozoa1 aVERONICA, CHEVASCO1 aALESSANDRO, GRAPPUTO1 aJOHANNA, MAPPES0 tEcological entomology.g2011 Apr., v. 36, no. 2 p.170-180dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01258.x 7aarticle02947naa a2200613 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245006800152300001600220520113400236650002001370650002001390650002001410650002001430650001601450650001401466650002401480650001101504650001001515650001801525650001501543650001001558650005001568650000901618650003801627650005101665650004201716650004601758650005401804650001101858650001101869650003901880650004001919650001601959650004001975651001702015653002502032700002202057700001802079700001802097700002002115700001402135773009602149852001302245939003302258945000802291946001302299852000902312655001202321991608563990742620221123034231.0910625e199104  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910018092DNAL7 a20088672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPedersen, A.B.10aMenstrual differences due to vegetarian and nonvegetarian diets  ap. 879-885.  aWe studied 41 nonvegetarian and 34 vegetarian premenopausal women whom we closely screened. The two groups were indistinguishable with respect to height, weight, body mass index, and menarche. The incidence of menstrual irregularity was 4.9% among nonvegetarians and 26.5% among vegetarians (P = 0.009). The vegetarian group consumed significantly greater amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, vitamin B-6, and dietary fiber whereas the nonvegetarians reported greater intakes of saturated fatty acids, protein, cholesterol, caffeine, and alcohol. Logistic-regression analyses showed that the probability of menstrual regularity among all study subjects (n = 75) was positively associated with increasing protein/kJ and increasing cholesterol/kJ intakes. The probability of being menstrually regular was negatively associated with increasing dietary fiber/kJ and increasing magnesium/kJ intakes. These results are consistent with the notion that menstrual regularity can be influenced by specific dietary nutrients that may have direct effects or exert their effects by modulating circulating sex steroid status. 3avegetarian diet 3amenstrual cycle 3anutrient intake 3adietary protein 3acholesterol 3amagnesium 3aregression analysis 3aadults 3awomen 3adietary fiber 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aDiet 2aDiet, Vegetarianxadverse effects 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acids, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMagnesiumxadministration & dosage 2aMenstruation Disturbancesxetiology 2aMiddle Aged 2aPyridoxinexadministration & dosage 3aPennsylvania 0amenstrual regularity1 aBartholomew, M.J.1 aDolence, L.A.1 aAljadir, L.P.1 aNetteburg, K.L.1 aLloyd, T.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 Apr., v. 53, no. 4 p.879-885x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03192naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001200164245009100176300001800267520160100285650001401886650001101900650004301911650001001954650000901964650001901973650002001992650002302012650001902035650002802054650008802082650001102170650002202181650001102203650001402214650000902228650001602237650003702253650002202290651002702312700002002339700001502359700002002374700002002394773011002414852000902524856008502533930003302618946001102651655001202662IND4393950920221123034246.0070812e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439395092DNAL7 a168969342pmid7 a10.1007/s00125-006-0378-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, G. 14aThe effect of diabetes and stroke at baseline and during follow-up on stroke mortality  ap. 2309-2316.  aAims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to compare the magnitude of the effect of diabetes and stroke at baseline and during follow-up on risk of stroke mortality. Materials and methods Study cohorts included 25,155 Finnish men and 26,423 women aged 25-74 years. Data on diabetes and stroke history at baseline, their incidence during follow-up, and stroke death were obtained from national registers. Results During a mean follow-up of 18.9 years, 838 stroke deaths were recorded. In the baseline study, hazard ratios (HRs) for stroke mortality were 5.26 for men with prior diabetes only, 4.76 for men with prior stroke only, and 13.4 for men with both prior diabetes and stroke compared with men without diabetes and stroke at baseline and during follow-up. In women, the corresponding hazard ratios were 7.29, 5.27 and 5.52, respectively. When only diabetes and stroke status during the follow-up were considered, the hazard ratios for stroke mortality were 1.41 for men and 1.56 for women with incident diabetes only, 5.62 for men and 5.58 for women with incident stroke only, and 5.59 for men and 4.48 for women with both incident diabetes and stroke compared with men and women without diabetes and stroke at baseline and during follow-up. Conclusions/interpretation Diabetes and stroke, present either at baseline or during follow-up, markedly increase the risk of stroke death. Prior stroke at baseline carries a similar risk of stroke mortality as prior diabetes. There is a greater risk of stroke mortality associated with incident stroke during follow-up than with incident diabetes. 3amortality 3astroke 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Mass Index 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xcomplicationsxepidemiologyxmortalityxphysiopathology. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aStrokexepidemiologyxmortality. 2aSurvival Analysis 0aFinlandxepidemiology.1 aJousilahti, P. 1 aSarti, C. 1 aAntikainen, R. 1 aTuomilehto, J. 0 tDiabetologia.g2006 Oct., v. 49, no. 10 p.2309-2316dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-006-0378-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20070812b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02671naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002400169245016200193300001800355500002400373520114400397650002401541650001101565650001501576650001101591650001101602650002101613650001101634650001901645650001901664650002001683650001101703650002101714650002301735650003101758650002501789650002801814650002401842650002001866650001701886650001001903651002501913700001801938700002101956700001601977773009801993852000902091856005302100655001202153IND4409050720221123025709.0080815e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440905072DNAL7 a184629362pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLópez-Piñeiro, A.10aShort and medium-term effects of two-phase olive mill waste application on olive grove production and soil properties under semiarid mediterranean conditions  ap. 7982-7987.  aIncludes references  aA five-year field study was conducted to evaluate the potential use of oiled and de-oiled two-phase olive mill waste (TPOMW and DTPOMW, respectively) as soil amendment on a representative olive grove soil: a Cutanic Luvisol. Treatments included a non-amended control, TPOMW1, TPOMW2, DTPOMW1 and DTPOMW2 (30, 60, 27 and 54Mgha⁻¹ dry weight equivalent). Significant increases (P <0.05) in organic carbon, total N, available P and K, and aggregate stability were observed in the amended soils. Leaf analysis showed significant increases in N, P, and K concentrations in treated plots after the two first years of TPOMW or DTPOMW amendments. Also, a general increase in olive production was observed in the treated plots, this increase being higher in the TPOMW1 and DTPOMW1 treated soils. After five years of repeated TPOMW and DTPOMW application, the increase in yield was 29%, 9.8%, 30%, and 19% for TPOMW1, TPOMW2, DTPOMW1, and DTPOMW2, respectively.

Methods Human beta cells were purified by FACS by virtue of their high zinc content using Newport Green, and excluding ductal and dead cells. Rat beta cells were sorted by autofluorescence or using the same method developed for human cells. Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine or ECMs from rat or human bladder carcinoma cells or bovine corneal ECM and incubated in the presence of BrdU with or without growth factors. Results The newly developed method for sorting human beta cells yields a population containing 91.4 ± 2.8% insulin-positive cells with a low level of spontaneous apoptosis and a robust secretory response to glucose. Beta cells from 8-week-old rats proliferated in culture and this was increased by ECM. Among growth factors, only human growth hormone (hGH) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 analogue liraglutide enhanced proliferation of rat beta cells, with a significant increase on both poly-l-lysine and ECM. By contrast, sorted adult human beta cells from 16 donors aged 48.9 ± 14.3 years (range 16-64 years) failed to replicate demonstrably in vitro regardless of the substratum or growth factors used. Conclusions/interpretation These findings indicate that, in our conditions, the fully differentiated human adult insulin-producing beta cell was unable to proliferate in vitro. This has important implications for any attempt to expand cells from pancreases of donors of this age group. By contrast, the rat beta cells used here were able to divide in vitro, and this was enhanced by ECM, hGH and liraglutide. 3aextracellular matrix 3agrowth factors 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Separation 2aDiabetes Mellitusxtherapy 2aExtracellular Matrix 2aFlow Cytometryxmethods 2aHumans 2aInsulin-Secreting Cellsxcytologyxphysiology. 2aIslets of Langerhans Transplantationxmethods 2aMiddle Aged 2aRats 2aSpecies Specificity 0aBeta cells 0aProliferation1 aBosco, D. 1 aBerney, T. 1 aPattou, F. 1 aKerr-Conte, J. 1 aDonath, M.

Materials and methods Isolated human and rat islets and different insulin-secreting cell lines were incubated with human oxidised LDL with or without HDL particles. The insulin level was monitored by ELISA, real-time PCR and a rat insulin promoter construct linked to luciferase gene reporter. Cell apoptosis was determined by scoring cells displaying pycnotic nuclei. Results Prolonged incubation with human oxidised LDL particles led to a reduction in preproinsulin expression levels, whereas the insulin level was preserved in the presence of native LDL-cholesterol. The loss of insulin production occurred at the transcriptional levels and was associated with an increase in activator protein-1 transcriptional activity. The rise in activator protein-1 activity resulted from activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK, now known as mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 [MAPK8]) due to a subsequent decrease in islet-brain 1 (IB1; now known as MAPK8 interacting protein 1) levels. Consistent with the pro-apoptotic role of the JNK pathway, oxidised LDL also induced a twofold increase in the rate of beta cell apoptosis. Treatment of the cells with JNK inhibitor peptides or HDL countered the effects mediated by oxidised LDL. Conclusions/interpretation These data provide strong evidence that oxidised LDL particles exert deleterious effects in the progression of beta cell failure in diabetes and that these effects can be countered by HDL particles. 3aapoptosis 3adiabetes 3ainsulin 3aislets of Langerhans 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aCell Line 2aDiabetes Mellitusxenzymology 2aDisease Progression 2aEnzyme Activation 2aGenes, Reporter 2aHumans 2aInsulinxgeneticsxmetabolismxsecretion. 2aInsulin-Secreting Cellsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxpathology. 2aLipoproteins, HDLxpharmacology 2aLipoproteins, LDLxpharmacology 2aMAP Kinase Kinase 4xantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 0aHDL 0aJNK pathway 0aMAPK 0aOxidised LDL1 aNiederhauser, G. 1 aFavre, D. 1 aAbdelli, S. 1 aFerdaoussi, M. 1 aYang, Neon.1 aRegazzi, R. 1 aWidmann, C. 1 aWaeber, G. 0 tDiabetologia.g2007 June, v. 50, no. 6 p.1304-1314dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-007-0642-z3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070507b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03662naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100003200181245018100213300001800394500002400412506007600436520180000512506003702312650002702349650001302376650002502389650002002414650001102434650002102445650003202466650001402498650002802512650001402540650001402554650004602568650001102614650003302625650002402658650003102682650006702713650004302780650006202823700002202885700003202907773011602939852000903055856008003064655001203144IND4404575320221207135959.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457532DNAL7 a183322092pmid7 aPMC23467112pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01422-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSöderberg, Jenny Johansson14aThe Intrinsic Immunoglobulin G Endopeptidase Activity of Streptococcal Mac-2 Proteins Implies a Unique Role for the Enzymatically Impaired Mac-2 Protein of M28 Serotype Strains  ap. 2183-2188.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIdeS, a secreted cysteine protease of the important human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes, interferes with phagocytic killing by specifically cleaving the heavy chain of immunoglobulin G (IgG). Two allelic variants of the enzyme have been described, the IgG-specific endopeptidase, IdeS (or Mac-1) and Mac-2, a protein with only weak IgG endopeptidase activity, which has been suggested to interfere with opsonophagocytosis by blocking Fcγ receptors of phagocytic cells. However, despite the fact that Mac-2 proteins interact with Fcγ receptors, no inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, opsonophagocytosis, or streptococcal killing by Mac-2 has been reported. In the present study, Mac-2 proteins are shown to contain IgG endopeptidase activity indistinguishable from the enzymatic activity exhibited by IdeS/Mac-1 proteins. The earlier reported weak IgG endopeptidase activity appears to be unique to Mac-2 of M28 serotype strains (Mac-2M₂₈) and is most likely due to the formation of a disulfide bond between the catalytic site cysteine and a cysteine residue in position 257 of Mac-2M₂₈. Furthermore, Mac-2 proteins are shown to inhibit ROS production ex vivo, independently of the IgG endopeptidase activity of the proteins. Inhibition of ROS generation per se, however, was not sufficient to mediate streptococcal survival in bactericidal assays. Thus, in contrast to earlier studies, implicating separate functions for IdeS and Mac-2 protein variants, the current study suggests that Mac-2 and IdeS are bifunctional proteins, combining Fcγ receptor binding and IgG endopeptidase activity. This finding implies a unique role for Mac-2 proteins of the M28 serotype, since this serotype has evolved and retained a Mac-2 protein lacking IgG endopeptidase activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStreptococcus pyogenes 3acysteine 3acysteine proteinases 3aenzyme activity 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin heavy chains 3apathogens 3areactive oxygen species 3areceptors 3aserotypes 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gxmetabolism 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aStreptococcal Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aStreptococcus pyogenesxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology.1 aEngström, Patrik1 avon Pawel-Rammingen, Ulrich0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.2183-2188dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01422-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03669naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001700158245011800175300001600293500002400309520141600333650002201749650002501771650002001796650003101816650001001847650002201857650001101879650002701890650003301917650001301950650000901963650002701972650003501999650002002034650003702054650005302091650001102144650002002155650003002175650006002205650004302265650001102308650002502319650004702344650006402391650004502455650002302500650003902523650001402562650002302576700001802599700001602617700001902633700001902652700001902671700001902690700001602709700001902725700002002744700001702764773009002781852000902871856007902880655001202959IND4404613520221123015228.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440461352DNAL7 a184114102pmid7 a10.1530/REP-07-03592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimber, S.J.10aExpression of genes involved in early cell fate decisions in human embryos and their regulation by growth factors  ap. 635-647.  aIncludes references  aLittle is understood about the regulation of gene expression in human preimplantation embryos. We set out to examine the expression in human preimplantation embryos of a number of genes known to be critical for early development of the murine embryo. The expression profile of these genes was analysed throughout preimplantation development and in response to growth factor (GF) stimulation. Developmental expression of a number of genes was similar to that seen in murine embryos (OCT3B/4, CDX2, NANOG). However, GATA6 is expressed throughout preimplantation development in the human. Embryos were cultured in IGF-I, leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF), all of which are known to stimulate the development of human embryos. Our data show that culture in HBEGF and LIF appears to facilitate human embryo expression of a number of genes: ERBB4 (LIF) and LIFR and DSC2 (HBEGF) while in the presence of HBEGF no blastocysts expressed EOMES and when cultured with LIF only two out of nine blastocysts expressed TBN. These data improve our knowledge of the similarities between human and murine embryos and the influence of GFs on human embryo gene expression. Results from this study will improve the understanding of cell fate decisions in early human embryos, which has important implications for both IVF treatment and the derivation of human embryonic stem cells. 3aearly development 3aembryonic stem cells 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahuman development 3ahumans 3ain vitro fertilization 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aleukemia 3amice 2aBlastocystxmetabolism 2aCell Differentiationxgenetics 2aCells, Cultured 2aCleavage Stage, Ovumxmetabolism 2aEmbryonic Developmentxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxdrug effects 2aHeparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixpharmacology 2aIntercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxpharmacology 2aLeukemia Inhibitory Factorxpharmacology 2aMorulaxmetabolism 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPregnancy 2aZygotexmetabolism1 aSneddon, S.F.1 aBloor, D.J.1 aEl-Bareg, A.M.1 aHawkhead, J.A.1 aMetcalfe, A.D.1 aHoughton, F.D.1 aLeese, H.J.1 aRutherford, A.1 aLieberman, B.A.1 aBrison, D.R.0 tReproduction.g2008 May, v. 135, no. 5 p.635-647dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-07-03593Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03212naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002300139245016300162300001600325500002400341520183300365650001702198650001102215650001602226650001802242650002102260650002002281650001002301650002702311650001202338650001102350650001202361650001702373650001902390650005202409700003402461700002302495700002302518700002202541700002502563773009002588852000902678856007902687655001202766IND4404613120221123015215.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440461312DNAL7 a10.1530/REP-07-04532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuttinck, Fabienne10aExpression of genes involved in prostaglandin E₂ and progesterone production in bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes during in vitro maturation and fertilization  ap. 593-603.  aIncludes references  aProstaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) and progesterone appear to be critical mediators of cumulus expansion and the resumption of oocyte meiosis. The aim of this study was to identify the types of prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) expressed in the bovine cumulus-oocyte complex (COC), to characterize their temporal expression during the periconceptional interval using an in vitro model of maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF), and to compare their expression with the level of steroidogenic gene expression. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that enzymes related to the PGE₂ biosynthesis pathway were mainly expressed during IVM. Transcripts encoding PTGES1-3 were detected in bovine COCs. Only the expression of PTGES1 significantly increased during IVM whereas that of PTGES2 and PTGES3 remained unchanged. The induction of PTGES1 expression paralleled the induction of prostaglandin G/H synthase-2 (PTGS2) expression and the amounts of PGE₂ secreted by maturing COCs. Concomitantly, cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P450 expression was significantly upregulated in maturing COCs and the high level of expression persisted in fertilized COCs. The expression of the StAR protein remained constant during IVM and then decreased significantly during IVF. Expression of the progesterone catabolic-related enzyme, 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase significantly decreased throughout the periconceptional interval. This was associated with a rising level of progesterone released by COCs in the culture media. In conclusion, our results suggest that the periconceptional differentiation of the bovine COC includes the transient induction of PGE₂ biosynthetic activity via the PTGS2/PTGES1 pathway during the maturation period and the increasing ability to produce progesterone from the immature to the fertilized stages. 3abiosynthesis 3acattle 3acholesterol 3aculture media 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3agenes 3ain vitro fertilization 3ameiosis 3amodels 3aoocytes 3aprogesterone 3aprostaglandins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aGuienne, Brigitte Marquant-Le1 aClément, Laetitia1 aReinaud, Pierrette1 aCharpigny, Gilles1 aGrimard, Bénédicte0 tReproduction.g2008 May, v. 135, no. 5 p.593-603dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-07-04533Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02877naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001300181245016600194300001800360500002400378506007600402520135300478506003701831650003101868650000801899650002801907650003101935650001301966650001001979650001301989650000902002650001102011650001302022650002502035650001102060650001702071650001602088700002502104700002002129700002002149700002102169773011602190852000902306856008002315655001202395IND4404576120221207132501.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457612DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.00024-082doi7 aPMC23466952pmcid7 a183322052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Ying10aVaccine-Elicited 10-Kilodalton Culture Filtrate Protein-Specific CD8⁺ T Cells Are Sufficient To Mediate Protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infection  ap. 2249-2255.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe 10-kDa culture filtrate protein (CFP-10) and 6-kDa early secretory antigen of T cells (ESAT-6) are secreted in abundance by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and are frequently recognized by T cells from infected people. The genes encoding these proteins have been deleted from the genome of the vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and it is hypothesized that these proteins are important targets of protective immunity. Indeed, vaccination with ESAT-6 elicits protective CD4⁺ T cells in C57BL/6 mice. We have previously shown that M. tuberculosis infection of C3H mice elicits CFP-10-specific CD8⁺ and CD4⁺ T cells. Here we demonstrate that immunization with a CFP-10 DNA vaccine stimulates a specific T-cell response only to the H-2Kk-restricted epitope CFP-10₃₂₋₃₉. These CFP-10₃₂₋₃₉-specific CD8⁺ cells undergo a rapid expansion and accumulate in the lung following challenge of immunized mice with aerosolized M. tuberculosis. Protective immunity is induced by CFP-10 DNA vaccination as measured by a CFU reduction in the lung and spleen 4 and 8 weeks after challenge with M. tuberculosis. These data demonstrate that CFP-10 is a protective antigen and that CFP-10₃₂₋₃₉-specific CD8⁺ T cells elicited by vaccination are sufficient to mediate protection against tuberculosis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aDNA 3aMycobacterium bovis BCG 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aepitopes 3agenes 3aimmunity 3amice 3apeople 3aproteins 3arecombinant vaccines 3aspleen 3atuberculosis 3avaccination1 aWoodworth, Joshua S.1 aShin, Daniel S.1 aMorris, Sheldon1 aBehar, Samuel M.0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.2249-2255dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00024-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02696naa a2200661 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245012200151300001600273520094500289650001101234650001801245650001201263650001201275650001401287650001401301650001201315650000801327650001001335650001101345650001501356650001001371650000901381650002201390650001101412650001801423650001201441650001101453650002301464650003301487650000901520650001601529650002601545650002001571650002601591650003401617650002301651653002501674653002301699653003101722700001501753700001801768700001401786700001301800700001701813700002001830773009601850852001301946939003301959945000801992946001302000852000902013655001202022991608561400742620221122235836.0910624e199103  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910017812DNAL7 a20008332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeaugerie, L.10aIsotonic high-sodium oral rehydration solution for increasing sodium absorption in patients with short-bowel syndrome  ap. 769-772.  aWe compared the effect of a standard oral rehydration solution and a high-sodium polymeric-glucose solution on sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome. Six patients with high jejunostomy were tested in a random order with the standard solution or a solution containing maltodextrins (18 g Glucidex 12/L) enriched with 2.5 g NaCl/L. Solutions were administered via a nasogastric tube at a rate of 2 mL/min. Jejunal effluent was collected during an 8-h period. The net 8-h fluid absorption was not significantly different in the two periods. Glucose absorption was > 90% of the administered amount for both solutions. Net sodium absorption was greater for the maltodextrin solution than for the standard solution (56 +/- 12 vs 24 +/- 20 mmol, P < 0.05). We conclude that replacement of glucose with maltodextrins and addition of sodium in the standard oral rehydration solution results in improved sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome. 3asodium 3amaltodextrins 3ajejunum 3aliquids 3apotassium 3achlorides 3aglucose 3amen 3awomen 3aadults 2aAbsorption 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aFemale 2aFluid Therapy 2aGlucose 2aHumans 2aIsotonic Solutions 2aJejunostomyxadverse effects 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPolysaccharides 2aRehydration Solutions 2aShort Bowel Syndromextherapy 2aSodiumxmetabolism 0ashort bowel syndrome 0amineral absorption 0aoral rehydration solutions1 aCosnes, J.1 aVerwaerde, F.1 aDupas, H.1 aLamy, P.1 aGendre, J.P.1 aLe Quintrec, Y.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.769-772x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200601 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001900133245014100152300001600293500001500309520099600324650002001320650001301340650001601353650001301369650002001382650002501402650001001427650002401437650002601461650002201487650000901509650002301518650001201541650002101553650003801574650002901612650002101641650001101662650001101673650002601684650000901710650002501719650002501744650002401769650003101793651000901824653001601833653001601849653001201865700001601877773009601893852001301989939003302002945000802035946001302043852000902056655001202065991608561200742620221122235651.0910624e199103  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910017842DNAL7 a20008352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaavedra, J.M.10aNonabsorbable marker and single, random stool samples used for measuring intestinal absorption of macronutrients in infants and children  ap. 790-794.  a2019-12-04  aTo measure intestinal absorption by using a single, random stool sample, polyethylene glycol (PEG), 1 g/d, and a constant diet were given to healthy infants, with a constant PEG-to-macronutrient ratio. After 10 d equilibration, apparent intestinal absorption of macronutrients was estimated from a standard 3-d metabolic balance and compared with that estimated by using the ratio of PEG to macronutrients in a single random sample of feces. Correlation coefficients for this comparison were 0.649, 0.715, and 0.924 for nitrogen, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. Additionally, apparent intestinal absorptions estimated from two separate consecutive 3-d metabolic-balance studies were compared, showing correlation coefficients of 0.106, 0.653, and 0.463 for nitrogen, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. The random sample-marker technique appears to be acceptable for measuring apparent absorption of macronutrients and is at least as accurate as a standard 3-d metabolic-balance study. 3abalance studies 3asampling 3adietary fat 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3adietary carbohydrate 3afeces 3apolyethylene glycol 3aintestinal absorption 3ametabolic studies 3aboys 3apreschool children 3ainfants 2aChild, Preschool 2aDietary Carbohydratesxmetabolism 2aDietary Fatsxmetabolism 2aFecesxchemistry 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aMale 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPolyethylene Glycols 2aRegression Analysis 2aReproducibility of Results 3aPeru 0acomparisons 0amethodology 0amarkers1 aBrown, K.H.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.790-794x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245008500151300001600236500014000252500001500392520121600407650001101623650001701634650001301651650001501664650001301679650002101692650002501713650002501738650002001763650002601783650001101809650001101820650002201831650004601853650001801899650001301917651001801930651001801948653002601966653002201992700001702014773007902031852000902110939003302119945000802152946001302160655001202173991608560490742620221122225251.0910624e199103  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910017902DNAL7 a19005302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabicht, J.P.10aPrinciples for effective surveys of hunger and malnutrition in the United States  ap. 403-407.  aPaper presented at "Nutritional Assessment and Intervention: Interface of Science and Policy" Symposium, Washington, DC, April 4, 1990.  a2019-12-04  aTo be effective, the information derived from a survey must be used to make decisions that affect policies and programs. This paper discusses why scientifically sound surveys may not be effective and vice versa. Effectiveness depends on the information being relevant to the decision-maker's understanding of the problem to be solved. To the extent that science contributes to both understanding the problem and providing the information for a decision, the survey will be scientific and effective. The measurement of malnutrition and barriers to communication are not at present the major obstacles to effective scientific surveys relative to hunger and malnutrition in the United States. Rather, the obstacles seem to be poor scientific conceptualization and measurement of hunger, on the one hand, and poor sampling techniques for malnutrition, on the other hand. These frontiers of knowledge have implications for science and policy beyond surveys. The challenge for the American Institute of Nutrition is to recruit the scientific skills needed to understand hunger and identify pockets of malnutrition and their causes-scientific skills that go beyond those traditional associated with nutrition research. 3ahunger 3amalnutrition 3asampling 3amonitoring 3avalidity 3anutrition policy 3anutrition assessment 3ainformation exchange 3adietary surveys 2aEpidemiologic Methods 2aHumans 2aHunger 2aNutrition Surveys 2aProtein-Energy Malnutritionxepidemiology 2aPublic Policy 2aResearch 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0adiet study techniques 0ainformation needs1 aMeyers, L.D.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1991 Mar., v. 121, no. 3 p.403-407x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01317naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002300115245005600138300001600194520049900210650002400709650002100733650002500754653002500779653002100804653001600825653002700841773008400868852000900952939003300961945000800994946001301002655001201015991608560400742620221122225347.0800515e197810  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800005952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelmick, Sandra A.10aFamily living patterns - projections for the future  ap. 155-157.  aChanging family forms and living patterns offer new opportunities for personal growth for family members and new challenges to educators to meet the diversity of needs.

Double tracer analysis, using [2H6] isopentenyladenosine and deuterium oxide, provided evidence for an alternative, iPMP-independent, biosynthetic pathway for zeatin-type cytokinins, present in both ipt-expressing and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana. Reduction of the biosynthetic flux in the alternative pathway by use of mevastatin, an inhibitor for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, indicated a terpenoid origin for the side-chain precursor of the iPMP independent pathway.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agene transfer 3amessenger RNA 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3agene expression 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzyme inhibitors 3agenes 3aenzyme activity 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3aacyltransferases 2aAlkyl and Aryl Transferasesxgenetics 2aArabidopsis 2aCytochromes 2aCytokininsxbiosynthesis 2aDeuterium 2aGene Expression 2aIsotope Labeling 2aTerpenes 0aadenosine phosphates 0azeatin riboside 0aphosphates (esters) 0aisopentenyladenosine 0aisopentenyltransferase 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase 0azeatin riboside-5'-monophosphate 0aisopentenyladenosien-5'-monophosphate1 aDolezal, K.1 aNordstrom, A.1 aWang, Q.1 aKunkel, T.1 aMoritz, T.1 aChua, N.H.1 aSandberg, G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2000 Dec. 19, v. 97, no. 26 p.14778-14783x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2605040973Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04391naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002000181245014500201300001800346500002400364506007600388520179300464506003702257650002302294650000802317650002102325650001202346650001502358650001302373650001702386650002602403650001102429650002002440650001202460650000902472650001502481650002502496650001402521650001602535650005202551650001202603650003402615650004402649650003302693650002202726650004702748650002802795650004602823650004402869650004202913650001402955650003702969650001103006650001103017650002803028650002803056650000903084650002403093650002303117650001903140650002503159650006503184650002203249650004103271700001803312700001903330700001403349700001703363773011603380852000903496856008003505655001203585IND4404572620221207131409.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457262DNAL7 a182854942pmid7 aPMC23466712pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01722-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Yong Sung10aEnhancement of Antibody Responses to Bacillus anthracis Protective Antigen Domain IV by Use of Calreticulin as a Chimeric Molecular Adjuvant  ap. 1952-1959.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe generation of protective humoral immune responses against the receptor-binding domain (domain IV) of protective antigen [PA(dIV)] of Bacillus anthracis represents a plausible approach against anthrax toxin. In the current study, we have developed a naked DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to PA(dIV) of Bacillus anthracis [CRT/PA(dIV)]. We transfected a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293) with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA and performed Western blotting and confocal microscopy analysis. We found that linkage of CRT to PA(dIV) targets PA(dIV) to the endoplasmic reticulum, resulting in secretion of the chimeric CRT/PA(dIV) protein. We then evaluated the ability of CRT/PA(dIV) DNA to generate PA(dIV)-specific antibody responses and protective immunity against lethal anthrax toxin (PA plus lethal factor) challenge. We found that mice immunized with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA were capable of rapidly inducing significantly higher PA(dIV)-specific antibody responses than mice immunized with PA(dIV) DNA alone. Furthermore, we observed that this enhanced antibody response generated by CRT/PA(dIV) DNA was CD4 dependent, since CD4 knockout mice demonstrated a significant reduction in antibody responses. In addition, analysis of the titers and avidity maturation of the induced PA-specific antibodies revealed that vaccination with CRT/PA(dIV) DNA vaccine accelerated the avidity maturation of antibodies to PA(dIV) compared to vaccination with PA(dIV) DNA. Importantly, the enhanced antibody responses correlated to protective immunity against lethal anthrax toxin challenge. Thus, DNA vaccines encoding CRT linked to PA(dIV) may dramatically enhance PA-specific protective antibody responses. Our results have significant clinical applications for biodefense against anthrax toxin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacillus anthracis 3aDNA 3aWestern blotting 3aanthrax 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3acalreticulin 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3amice 3amicroscopy 3arecombinant vaccines 3asecretion 3avaccination 2aAdjuvants, Immunologicxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aAnimals 2aAnthraxxprevention & control 2aAnthrax Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aAntibody Affinity 2aAntigens, Bacterialxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCD4 Antigensxgenetics. 2aBacillus anthracisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBacterial Toxinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aCalreticulinxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aCell Line 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxchemistry 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aImmunoglobulin Mxblood 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxanalysisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSurvival Analysis 2aVaccines, DNAxgeneticsximmunology.1 aLee, Jin Hyup1 aHung, Chien-Fu1 aWu, T.-C.1 aKim, Tae Woo0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.1952-1959dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01722-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle00953naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245002800135300001500163520034500178650001300523650001400536773007300550852001300623939003300636945000800669946001300677852000900690655001200699991608560000742620221122225418.0910624e199105  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910017952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRhodeback, M.J.10aEmbrace the bottom line  ap. 53- 59.  aIf HR executives are to command the respect of management or their peers, they must be able to translate their knowledge of human resources into terms that have tangible and recognizable economic benefits.

Beta cells respond to cytokine exposure by activating gene networks that alter cellular metabolism, induce chemokine release (thereby increasing insulitis), and cause apoptosis. We have previously shown by microarray analysis that exposure of INS-1E cells to IL-1β + IFN-γ induces the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (Ppar)-δ and several of its target genes. PPAR-δ controls cellular lipid metabolism and is a major regulator of inflammatory responses. We therefore examined the role of PPAR-δ in cytokine-treated beta cells. Materials and methods Primary beta cells that had been purified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and INS-1E cells were cultured in the presence of the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, or IL-1β + IFN-γ, or the synthetic PPAR-δ agonist GW501516. Gene expression was analysed by real-time PCR. PPAR-δ, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1, now known as CCL2) promoter and NF-κB activity were determined by luciferase reporter assays. Results Exposure of primary beta cells or INS-1E cells to cytokines induced Ppar-δ mRNA expression and PPAR-δ-dependent CD36, lipoprotein lipase, acyl CoA synthetase and adipophilin mRNAs. Cytokines and the PPAR-δ agonist GW501516 also activated a PPAR-δ response element reporter in beta cells. Unlike immune cells, neither INS-1E nor beta cells expressed the transcriptional repressor B-cell lymphoma-6 (BCL-6). As a consequence, PPAR-δ activation by GW501516 did not decrease cytokine-induced Mcp-1 promoter activation or mRNA expression, as reported for macrophages. Transient transfection with a BCL-6 expression vector markedly reduced Mcp-1 promoter and NF-κB activities in beta cells. Conclusions/interpretation Cytokines activate the PPAR-δ gene network in beta cells. This network does not, however, regulate the pro-inflammatory response to cytokines because beta cells lack constitutive BCL-6 expression. This may render beta cells particularly susceptible to propagating inflammation in type 1 diabetes. 3aapoptosis 0aBCL-6 0aCytokine 0aIslet 0aMCP-1 0aNF-κB 0aPancreatic beta cell 0aPPAR-δ 0aType 1 diabetes mellitus1 aLee, C.-H. 1 aHekerman, P. 1 aDarville, M.

We hypothesise that this vasoconstrictor may prevent full perfusion of muscle, thereby limiting delivery of insulin and glucose and contributing to insulin resistance. Materials and methods The acute effects of endothelin-1 on insulin-mediated haemodynamic and metabolic effects were examined in rats in vivo. Endothelin-1 (50 pmol min-¹ kg-¹ for 2.5 h) was infused alone, or 30 min prior to a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic insulin clamp (10 mU min-¹ kg-¹ for 2 h). Insulin clamps (10 or 15 mU min-¹ kg-¹) were performed after 30 min of saline infusion. Results Endothelin-1 infusion alone increased plasma endothelin-1 11-fold (p < 0.05) and blood pressure by 20% (p < 0.05). Endothelin-1 alone had no effect on femoral blood flow, capillary recruitment or glucose uptake, but endothelin-1 with 10 mU min-¹ kg-¹ insulin caused a decrease in insulin clearance from 0.35 ± 0.6 to 0.19 ± 0.02 ml/min (p = 0.02), resulting in significantly higher plasma insulin levels (10 mU min-¹ kg-¹ insulin: 2,120 ± 190 pmol/l; endothelin-1 + 10 mU min-¹ kg-¹ insulin: 4,740 ± 910 pmol/l), equivalent to 15 mU min-¹ kg-¹ insulin alone (4,920 ± 190 pmol/l). The stimulatory effects of equivalent doses of insulin on femoral blood flow, capillary recruitment and glucose uptake were blocked by endothelin-1. Conclusions/interpretation Endothelin-1 blocks insulin's haemodynamic effects, particularly capillary recruitment, and is associated with decreased muscle glucose uptake and glucose infusion rate. These findings suggest that elevated endothelin-1 levels may contribute to insulin resistance of muscle by increasing vascular resistance and limiting insulin and glucose delivery. 0aCapillary recruitment 0a2-Deoxyglucose uptake 0aEndothelin-1-mediated hypertension 0aFemoral blood flow 0a1-Methylxanthine metabolism 0aMuscle insulin action1 aKolka, C.

This definition includes subgroups of the United States population that are at increased risk of adverse health effects associated with malnutrition. Examples include persons who are rare (pregnant women), difficult to locate (migrant farm workers), difficult to enumerate (homeless individuals) or difficult to interview (substance abusers). Probability methods to sample rare and elusive populations are reviewed briefly. Methods include disproportionatety allocated sampling, multiplicity sampling and the use of multiple frames. The advantages and disadvantages of nonprobability sampling methods are compared using criteria typically applied to assess alternative probability sampling methods. The cost of data collection alone may prohibit consideration of probability sampling methods, but caution is urged before abandoning this statistically sound approach to sample selection. Considerations for sampling the difficult-to-sample are illustrated for one such population, the homeless. 3asampling 3apopulation 3adietary surveys 2aFemale 2aIll-Housed Persons. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNutrition Disordersxepidemiology 2aPregnancy 2aProbability 2aRandom Allocation 2aSampling Studies 0aUnited States 0atarget groups 0adiet study techniques 0amethodology0 tJournal of nutrition.g1991 Mar., v. 121, no. 3 p.416-423x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02730naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003400131040001800165100001500183245005400198300002000252500001500272506007600287520099300363506003701356650001201393650001501405650002401420650001001444650002101454650001201475650002201487650002001509650001201529650002501541650001101566650004301577650000901620650001401629650002401643651003101667653002101698653002101719653001501740653002101755653001001776653001901786653002301805700001501828773014501843852000901988856008401997930003302081945001302114946001302127655001202140IND2229489120221207132151.0010123e20001219dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222948912DNAL7 a111210462pmid7 aPMC189392pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.97.26.144492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGray, D.A.10aSexual selection and speciation in field crickets  ap. 14449-14454.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent theoretical work has shown that sexual selection may cause speciation under a much wider range of conditions than previously supposed. There are, however, no empirical studies capable of simultaneously evaluating several key predictions that contrast this with other speciation models. We present data on male pulse rates and female phonotactic responses to pulse rates for the field cricket Gryllus texensis; pulse rate is the key feature distinguishing G. texensis from its cryptic sister species G. rubens. We show (i) genetic variation in male song and in female preference for song, (ii) a genetic correlation between the male trait and the female preference, and (iii) no character displacement in male song, female song recognition, female species-level song discrimination, or female song preference. Combined with previous work demonstrating a lack of hybrid inviability, these results suggest that divergent sexual selection may have caused speciation between these taxa.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afemales 3aphonotaxis 3agenetic correlation 3amales 3asexual selection 3aGryllus 3agenetic variation 3amating behavior 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aFemale 2aGryllidaexclassificationxphysiology. 2aMale 2aPair Bond 2aSpecies Specificity 3aSoutheastern United States 0asound production 0agryllus texensis 0aspeciation 0asound pulse rate 0asongs 0agryllus rubens 0ataxis (physiology)1 aCade, W.H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2000 Dec. 19, v. 97, no. 26 p.14449-14454x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.97.26.144493Available from publisher's Web site  a20010301b20010313c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03407naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002800181245010900209300001800318500002400336506007600360520128200436506003701718650002601755650000801781650001401789650002001803650001001823650002001833650001101853650002001864650000901884650003001893650001401923650001401937650001701951650001201968650003801980650001402018650002002032650002802052650002802080650004102108650004002149650003202189650003002221650001102251650000902262650002302271650004202294650005002336700002302386700002202409700001902431700002902450700002702479700002202506773011602528852000902644856008002653655001202733IND4404574520221207132151.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457452DNAL7 a183322082pmid7 aPMC23466962pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00047-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamirez-Ortiz, Zaida G.10aToll-Like Receptor 9-Dependent Immune Activation by Unmethylated CpG Motifs in Aspergillus fumigatus DNA  ap. 2123-2129.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPhagocytic defenses are critical for effective host defenses against the opportunistic fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Previous studies found that following challenge with A. fumigatus, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) knockout mice survived longer than wild-type mice. However, the mechanism responsible was not defined. Here we demonstrate that A. fumigatus contains unmethylated CpG sequences, the natural ligands for TLR9. A. fumigatus DNA and synthetic CpG-rich oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) containing sequences found in the A. fumigatus genome potently stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and human plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The response was decreased when the fungal DNA was treated with a CpG methylase or with CpG-specific endonucleases. A role for TLR9 was demonstrated as cytokine production was abolished in BMDCs from TLR9-deficient mice. Moreover, transfection of HEK293 cells with human TLR9 conferred responsiveness to synthetic CpG-rich ODNs containing sequences found in A. fumigatus DNA. Taken together, these data demonstrate that TLR9 detects A. fumigatus DNA, resulting in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, which may contribute to the immune response to the pathogen.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aDNA 3acytokines 3adendritic cells 3afungi 3agenomic islands 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3amice 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apathogens 3asecretion 3atransfection 2aAnimals 2aAspergillus fumigatusximmunology 2aCell Line 2aCells, Cultured 2aCpG Islandsximmunology 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aDNA, Fungalximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Cytosine Methylasesxmetabolism 2aDendritic Cellsximmunology 2aEndonucleasesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesximmunology 2aToll-Like Receptor 9xdeficiencyximmunology.1 aSpecht, Charles A.1 aWang, Jennifer P.1 aLee, Chrono K.1 aBartholomeu, Daniella C.1 aGazzinelli, Ricardo T.1 aLevitz, Stuart M.0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.2123-2129dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00047-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02880naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245012300161300001800284520161300302650001301915653001001928653001101938653001301949653000801962653002201970700001401992700001802006700002002024700001702044700002802061700001702089700001802106700001402124700002302138700001902161700001802180773011002198852000902308856008502317930003302402946001102435655001202446IND4393951720221122221047.0070812e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439395172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-006-0365-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlanas, R. 10aReg (regenerating) gene overexpression in islets from non-obese diabetic mice with accelerated diabetes: role of IFNβ  ap. 2379-2387.  aAims/hypothesis The expression of IFNβ in beta cells results in accelerated type 1 diabetes. The REG family of beta cell proliferation factors have been described as autoantigens in autoimmune diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of IFNβ on Reg expression, and the implications of this in terms of autoimmunity. Methods Reg gene expression was determined in islets from non-obese diabetic (NOD) RIP-HuIFNβ mice by cDNA microarray, quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. The effect of IFNβ on Reg1 and Reg2 expression was assessed in the NOD insulinoma cell line NIT-1. IL-6, known to induce Reg expression, was measured in the insulitis microenvironment. Morphological studies were carried out to determine islet enlargement in this model. Results Reg2 was upregulated in islets from the NOD RIP-HuIFNβ mice at the onset of the autoimmune attack. IFNβ upregulates Reg1 and Reg2 genes in NIT-1 cells. The expression of Il6 was increased in islets from transgenic mice and in NIT-1 cells exposed to HuIFNβ. Moreover, islets from transgenic mice were enlarged compared with those from wild-type mice. Conclusions/interpretation Reg overexpression correlates well with the acceleration of diabetes in this model. The upregulation of Reg suggests that islets try to improve hyperglycaemia by regenerating the cells lost in the autoimmune attack. Reg expression is regulated by several factors such as inflammation. Therefore, the overexpression of an IFNβ-induced autoantigen (REG) in the islets during inflammation might contribute to the premature onset of diabetes. 3adiabetes 0aIFNβ 0aIslets 0aNOD mice 0aREG 0aRegenerating gene1 aAlba, A. 1 aCarrillo, J. 1 aPuertas, M.

Two distinct phylogenetic types of FhbA have been delineated (FhbA1 and FhbA2). These orthologs share a conserved C-terminal domain that contains two alpha helices with a high predictive probability of coiled-coil formation that are separated by a 14-amino-acid loop domain. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified residues within these domains that influence the binding of both mouse and human FH, plasminogen, and/or the 60-kDa protein. To further investigate the involvement of FhbA in the host-pathogen interaction, strains that are either FhbA⁺ (isolate YOR) or FhbA⁻ (isolate REN) were tested for serum sensitivity. Significant differences were observed, with YOR and REN being serum resistant and serum sensitive (intermediate), respectively. To test the abilities of these strains to infect and persist in mice, mice were needle inoculated, and infectivity and persistence were then assessed. While both strains REN and YOR infected mice, only the FhbA⁺ YOR strain persisted beyond day 4. Survival of the YOR isolate in blood correlated with the upregulation of the fhbA gene, as demonstrated by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. These data advance our understanding of the unique interactions of FhbA with individual serum proteins and provide support for the hypothesis that FhbA is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of the relapsing fever spirochete B. hermsii.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorrelia hermsii 3ablood proteins 3ablood serum 3aetiological agents 3afever 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3ahumans 3amice 3apathogenesis 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aplasminogen 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprobability 3asite-directed mutagenesis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aBloodxmicrobiology 2aBlood Bactericidal Activity 2aBorreliaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBorrelia Infectionsxmicrobiology 2aCarrier Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aComplement Factor Hxmetabolism 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aMicrobial Viability 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPlasminogenxmetabolism 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aSequence Alignment 2aTime Factors 3aNorth America1 aFreedman, John C.1 aZhang, Hongming1 aForbes, Jonathan L.1 aMarconi, Richard T.0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.2113-2122dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01266-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04194naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002400181245011900205300001800324500002400342506007600366520172900442506003702171650002402208650001602232650001502248650002802263650002002291650002102311650002002332650002102352650001902373650001802392650001602410650001802426650000902444650001402453650003202467650001602499650005302515650001202568650004602580650001502626650001402641650002002655650003902675650001102714650003002725650001102755650003902766650004502805650002602850650005502876650004502931650000902976650002402985650002303009650001903032650006603051650005003117700002203167700002903189700002503218773011603243852000903359856008003368655001203448IND4404574820221207132207.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457482DNAL7 a182993402pmid7 aPMC23466732pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01528-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhitaker, Shanta M.10aLeishmania pifanoi Proteoglycolipid Complex P8 Induces Macrophage Cytokine Production through Toll-Like Receptor 4  ap. 2149-2156.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe P8 proteoglycolipid complex (P8 PGLC) is a glyconjugate expressed by Leishmania mexicana complex parasites. We previously have shown that vaccination with P8 PGLC provides protection against cutaneous leishmaniasis in susceptible BALB/c mice. However, the biological importance of this complex remains unknown. Here we show that P8 PGLC localizes to the surface of Leishmania pifanoi amastigotes and that upon exposure to macrophages, P8 PGLC binds and induces inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNAs such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and RANTES early after stimulation. Our studies indicate that cytokine and chemokine induction is dependent upon Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Interestingly, key inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (such as interleukin-6 [IL-6], macrophage inflammatory protein 1β, and beta interferon [IFN-β]) that can be induced through TLR4 activation were not induced or only slightly upregulated by P8 PGLC. Activation by P8 PGLC does not occur in the presence of TLR4 alone and requires both CD14 and myeloid differentiation protein 2 for signaling; this requirement may be responsible for the limited TLR4 response. This is the first characterization of a TLR4 ligand for LEISHMANIA: In vitro experiments indicate that L. pifanoi amastigotes induce lower levels of cytokines in macrophages in the absence of TLR4; however, notably higher IL-10/IFN-γ ratios were found for TLR4-deficient mice than for BALB/c mice. Further, increased levels of parasites persist in BALB/c mice deficient in TLR4. Taken together, these results suggest that TLR4 recognition of Leishmania pifanoi amastigotes is important for the control of infection and that this is mediated, in part, through the P8 PGLC.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLeishmania mexicana 3aamastigotes 3achemokines 3acutaneous leishmaniasis 3adisease control 3ain vitro studies 3ainterferon-beta 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-6 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aparasites 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccination 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingximmunology 2aAnimals 2aLipopolysaccharide Receptorsximmunology. 2aCell Count 2aCell Line 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aHumans 2aLeishmaniaxchemistryximmunology. 2aLeishmaniasisximmunologyxparasitology. 2aLymphocyte Antigen 96 2aMacrophages, Peritonealximmunologyxparasitology. 2aMembrane Proteinsxanalysisximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Knockout 2aProteolipidsxanalysisximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aToll-Like Receptor 4xdeficiencyxmetabolism.1 aColmenares, Maria1 aPestana, Karen Goldsmith1 aMcMahon-Pratt, Diane0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.2149-2156dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01528-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02892naa a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001400133245007900147300001600226500001500242520110300257650002001360650001501380650001801395650000801413650001601421650002301437650002401460650001901484650001101503650002301514650001001537650002101547650001601568650000901584650005101593650004201644650004601686650002201732650001501754650001101769650000901780650003401789650000901823651001101832651001101843653000901854653001801863653001601881653001701897653001801914700001901932700001501951700001701966700001501983700001701998700001902015773009602034852001302130939003302143945000802176946001302184852000902197655001202206991608558610742620221122185010.0910625e199104  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910017992DNAL7 a17508722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz, E.10aEffects of dietary supplementation on work performance in Gambian laborers  ap. 803-811.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of food supplementation on productivity of Gambian subsistence farmers was studied during a natural food shortage induced by the annual hungry season. Sixteen men in two groups matched for weight, height, hemoglobin, and physical-work capacity followed a crossover protocol with 6-wk supplementation and control periods. Productivity was assessed over the final 3 wk of each period by quantifying piece-rate-paid road building. Supplementation comprised an ad libitum supply of highly palatable energy-dense food provided three times daily. Outcome variables were total loads transported, loads per working hour, time per load, total energy expenditure assessed by doubly labeled water and heart-rate monitoring, postwork activity, and anthropometry. Body weight decreased during control periods, indicating a real energy deficit, and increased during supplementation in both groups. Supplementation had no significant impact on productivity variables. Energy-deficient men can maintain maximal productivity over short periods if sufficiently motivated but at the expense of body weight. 3anutrient intake 3aheart rate 3aenergy intake 3amen 3abody weight 3aenergy expenditure 3adietary supplements 3alean body mass 3aadults 3askinfold thickness 2aAdult 2aBasal Metabolism 2aBody Weight 2aDiet 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aHeart Rate 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPhysical Exertionxphysiology 2aWork 3aGambia 0aGambia 0adiet 0awork capacity 0awork output 0aproductivity 0aweight losses1 aGoldberg, G.R.1 aTaylor, M.1 aSavage, J.M.1 aSellen, D.1 aCoward, W.A.1 aPrentice, A.M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 Apr., v. 53, no. 4 p.803-811x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001900181245010800200300001800308500002400326506007600350520117300426506003701599650002101636650002701657650001501684650003101699650001601730650001301746650002501759650001101784650001901795650001201814650002801826650001701854650002401871650006301895650002501958650003201983650003202015650002002047650002202067650003102089650005202120650001102172650002402183650002702207650004202234650002802276650002002304650003202324650003002356650003402386650004802420650002302468700001802491700002002509700001502529773011602544852000902660856008002669655001202749IND4404573820221207123154.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457382DNAL7 a182854902pmid7 aPMC23467182pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01643-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoke, David E.10aLipL32 Is an Extracellular Matrix-Interacting Protein of Leptospira spp. and Pseudoalteromonas tunicata  ap. 2063-2069.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLipL32 is the major outer membrane protein in pathogenic LEPTOSPIRA: It is highly conserved throughout pathogenic species and is expressed in vivo during human infection. While these data suggest a role in pathogenesis, a function for LipL32 has not been defined. Outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria are the first line of molecular interaction with the host, and many have been shown to bind host extracellular matrix (ECM). A search for leptospiral ECM-interacting proteins identified the major outer membrane protein, LipL32. To verify this finding, recombinant LipL32 was expressed in Escherichia coli and was found to bind Matrigel ECM and individual components of ECM, including laminin, collagen I, and collagen V. Likewise, an orthologous protein found in the genome of Pseudoalteromonas tunicata strain D2 was expressed and found to be functionally similar and immunologically cross-reactive. Lastly, binding activity was mapped to the C-terminal 72 amino acids. These studies show that LipL32 and an orthologous protein in P. tunicata are immunologically cross-reactive and function as ECM-interacting proteins via a conserved C-terminal region.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLeptospira 3aPseudoalteromonas tunicata 3aamino acids 3acollagen 3aextracellular matrix 3agenome 3ahuman diseases 3alaminin 3aouter membrane proteins 3apathogenesis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aCollagenxmetabolism 2aCollagen Type Ixmetabolism 2aCollagen Type Vxmetabolism 2aCross Reactions 2aDrug Combinations 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aExtracellular Matrixxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aHumans 2aLamininxmetabolism 2aLeptospiraxmetabolism 2aLipoproteinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aProteoglycansxmetabolism 2aPseudoalteromonasxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment1 aEgan, Suhelen1 aCullen, Paul A.1 aAdler, Ben0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.2063-2069dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01643-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01727naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002700132245004700159300001600206520066800222650003100890650002300921650001200944650001500956650005800971650004001029650003301069650006501102651001501167651001801182653003201200773007001232852000901302939003301311945000801344946001301352655001201365991608558110742620221122185029.0800523e19791201xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800007952DNAL7 a1157762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHales, Dianne Rafalik.10aParenteral nutrition: First decade, trends  ap. 100-102.  aTotal parenteral nutrition was pioneered 10 years ago to care for hospital patients who cannot eat.

Initial experiments cared for premature infants, chemotherapy patients, and patients recovering from major surgery. To reduce infection, physicians learned to establish controls on solutions and catheters.

The kinetic properties required for the solid-phase and enzyme-conjugated antibodies of sandwich ELISA were determined rationally on the basis of a kinetic model describing antibody-antigen interaction. Some antibodies possessing the required kinetic properties against a model antigen, C-reactive protein (CRP), were successfully isolated from a phage antibody library under the screening conditions that were designed on the basis of simulation results. The best combination of solid-phase and enzyme-conjugated antibodies that gives the most sensitive sandwich ELISA was determined by simulation on the basis of the apparent association and dissociation rate constants of the isolated antibodies. It was confirmed by experiment that the sandwich ELISA using the best combination of antibodies was actually the most sensitive one. Our strategy would be useful for the rapid establishment of sensitive sandwich ELISAs compared with the traditional hybridoma method in which the best condition is determined by trial and error. 3aC-reactive protein 3aantibodies 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3aantigens 3abacteriophages 3abioengineering 3adissociation 3aenzyme kinetics 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3ahybridomas 3ascreening 3asimulation models 3asolids1 aKatakura, Yoshio1 aNinomiya, Kazuaki1 aShioya, S.q(Suteaki)0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2008 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.261-272dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1263/jbb.105.2613Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03495naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001200181245021900193300001800412500002400430506007600454520106000530506003701590650002601627650001501653650002401668650001801692650002201710650001701732650001201749650002201761650001401783650001401797650001501811650001401826650002401840650003801864650001201902650003801914650003101952650003001983650001402013650001502027650003102042650001102073650002802084650003102112650003802143650002002181650003202201650003302233650003202266650006902298650002702367650002302394700001902417700001902436700001902455700001802474700002602492700001902518700001902537773011602556852000902672856008002681655001202761IND4404571520221207121627.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457152DNAL7 a182993392pmid7 aPMC23467092pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00480-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Min14aThe C-Terminal Segment of the Cysteine-Rich Interdomain of Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 Determines CD36 Binding and Elicits Antibodies That Inhibit Adhesion of Parasite-Infected Erythrocytes  ap. 1837-1847.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAttachment of erythrocytes infected by Plasmodium falciparum to receptors of the microvasculature is a major contributor to the pathology and morbidity associated with malaria. Adhesion is mediated by the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP-1), which is expressed at the surface of infected erythrocytes and is linked to both antigenic variation and cytoadherence. PfEMP-1 contains multiple adhesive modules, including the Duffy binding-like domain and the cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR). The interaction between CIDRα and CD36 promotes stable adherence of parasitized erythrocytes to endothelial cells. Here we show that a segment within the C-terminal region of CIDRα determines CD36 binding specificity. Antibodies raised against this segment can specifically block the adhesion to CD36 of erythrocytes infected with various parasite strains. Thus, small regions of PfEMP-1 that determine binding specificity could form suitable components of an antisequestration malaria vaccine effective against different parasite strains.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantibodies 3aantigenic variation 3acell adhesion 3aendothelial cells 3aerythrocytes 3amalaria 3amembrane proteins 3amorbidity 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3areceptors 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Substitutionxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanximmunology 2aCD36 Antigensxmetabolism. 2aCell Adhesionximmunology 2aCell Line 2aCricetinae 2aErythrocytesxparasitology 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPlasmodium falciparumxphysiology 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Interaction Mapping 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProtozoan Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSequence Alignment1 aLee, Hooi Chen1 aKotaka, Masayo1 aNiang, Makhtar1 aGao, Xiaohong1 aIyer, Jayasree Kaveri1 aLescar, Julien1 aPreiser, Peter0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.1837-1847dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00480-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02265naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001600133245008400149300001600233500001500249520080300264650001801067650001401085650001401099650002301113650001401136650004401150650001001194650001501204650002701219650002001246650003201266650001801298650001701316650002301333650001201356650001801368650001101386650002701397650002601424650003101450653002301481653002301504653001501527653000901542773009601551852001301647939003301660945000801693946001301701852000901714655001201723991608554870742620221122075910.0910624e199103  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910017732DNAL7 a20008262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPryor, W.A.10aCan vitamin E protect humans against the pathological effects of ozone in smog?  ap. 702-722.  a2019-12-04  aOzone reacts with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in vitro to form free radicals, and vitamin E slows or prevents this reaction. Consistent with this, dietary vitamin E significantly protects animals against the deleterious effects of ozone and the absence of vitamin E potentiates damage by ozone. Thus, chemical and animal studies as well as the opposite effects of ozone and vitamin E on the immune system suggest the hypothesis that vitamin E can protect humans against the harmful effects of chronic exposures to ozone. However, because most humans are not vitamin E deficient, the more relevant question is whether amounts of vitamin E above the minimum of dietary requirement provide increased protection. The need for and design of further studies to answer this question are discussed. 3afree radicals 3aneoplasms 3avitamin E 3alipid peroxidation 3aozonation 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3aozone 3apollutants 3aanimal experimentation 3aimmune response 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aair pollution 3aantioxidants 3anutrition research 2aAnimals 2aFree Radicals 2aHumans 2aOzonexadverse effects 2aSmogxadverse effects 2aVitamin Extherapeutic use 0achemical reactions 0aliterature reviews 0aprotection 0asmog0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1991 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.702-722x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle01928naa a2200433 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002000132245006900152300001800221520056500239650001100804650001700815650002400832650002400856650002300880650002100903650002500924650002300949650003000972650002901002650002501031650002101056650002001077650001101097650002401108650004601132650003601178711010601214773009901320852000901419939003301428945000801461946001301469655001201482991608554650742620221122065139.0800512e197812  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800005392DNAL7 a7271672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTonon, Marilyn.10aModels for educational interventions in malnourished populations  ap. 2279-2283.  aHealth education consists of attempts to change the behavior of individuals, families, groups, and communities.

Their applicability to developing nations and malnourished populations is discussed. A rational empirical model has two prime assumptions: man is guided by reason and logic, and man acts in his own self interest. Normative reeducation models view man as inherently active and continually in quest of need satisfaction. 3amodels 3amalnutrition 3aeducational methods 3anutrition education 3adisease prevention 3ahealth education 3adeveloping countries 3acommunity programs 2aCommunity Health Services 2aCommunity Participation. 2aDeveloping Countries 2aHealth Education 2aHealth Planning 2aHumans 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNutrition Disordersxprevention & control 2aNutritional Sciencesxeducation2 aEffective Interventions to Reduce Infection in Malnourished Populations, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, 1977.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1978 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.2279-2283x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800512c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle01448naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245005600137300001800193520053300211650001400744650001300758650001700771650002300788650001700811650001300828650002500841711010600866773009900972852000901071939003301080945000801113946001301121655001201134991608554480742620221122065221.0800512e197812  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800005342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeusch, Gerald T.10aResume of the discussion on "Prophylactic measures"  ap. 2248-2251.  aHighlights of a discussion which occurred at a symposium on effective interventions to reduce infections in malnourished populations are featured.

In this vessel, solid-liquid mass transfer was studied using a disc turbine impeller with six flat blades. The effect of impeller rotation rate as an operating variable on the mass transfer coefficient was evaluated experimentally using various geometrical conditions of the apparatus, such as impeller diameter and height, in relation to the impeller power consumption. Mixing of gas above the free surface into the bulk liquid, i.e. surface aeration, which accompanied the solid-liquid agitation, was also investigated. Comparison of the mass transfer characteristics between this type of vessel and a baffled vessel with a unidirectional rotating impeller underscored the sufficient solid-liquid contact for prevention of gas mixing in the forward-reverse rotation mode of the impeller. 3aaeration 3aagitation 3amass transfer 3amixing1 aKimura, Akihiro1 aYoshida, Masanori1 aYamagiwa, Kazuaki1 aOhkawa, Akira0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2008 May, v. 83, no. 5 p.763-767dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.18493Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02896naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001800139245012800157300001600285500002400301520137600325650001501701650002501716650001901741650002501760650001801785650002801803650002301831650001501854650001901869650001901888650002101907650002601928650001901954650001601973700002001989700002002009700002102029700001902050700002402069700001902093700001702112700002002129773017702149852000902326856007902335655001202414IND4404426120221122042137.0080414s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440442612DNAL7 a10.1263/jbb.105.2212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamura, Aiko10aEffective cell separation utilizing poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-grafted polypropylene membrane containing adsorbed antibody  ap. 221-225.  aIncludes references  aWe previously developed a cell separation method using a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-grafted polypropylene (PNIPAAm-g-PP) membrane containing an adsorbed monoclonal antibody (mAb). The purpose of this study is to elucidate the cell separation mechanism in detail and to design an optimal method. As the grafting yield of PNIPAAm increased, the level of the adsorption of IgG₁ and cell adhesion to the membrane decreased. After BSA was adsorbed to a PNIPAAm-g-PP membrane at 6°C, where PNIPAAm was hydrophilic, a small amount of IgG₁ was adsorbed to the membrane at 37°C, where PNIPAAm was hydrophobic. The desorption of the adsorbed IgG₁ was not enhanced even though temperature was reduced to 10°C, where PNIPAAm was hydrophilic. These results indicate that the antibody adsorbed to the intact PP surface of the membrane predominantly contributes to the capture of target cells through the antigen-antibody reaction and that a thermoresponsive transition of PNIPAAm contributes to the detachment of the captured cells. The total number of cells recovered from a PNIPAAm-g-PP membrane containing the adsorbed mAb decreased as the grafting yield increased. A PNIPAAm-g-PP membrane with a 1.7% grafting yield containing adsorbed anti-human CD34 mAb enriched CD34-positive KG-1a cells to 85% from a 1:1 cell suspension of KG-1a cells and CD34-negative Jurkat cells. 3aadsorption 3aartificial membranes 3abioengineering 3abovine serum albumin 3acell adhesion 3acell suspension culture 3acomposite polymers 3adesorption 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolypropylenes 3atemperature1 aHagiwara, Taeko1 aYamagami, Souko1 aYamaguchi, Manae1 aShinbo, Toshio1 aKanamori, Toshiyuki1 aKondo, Satoshi1 aMiwa, Keishi1 aItagaki, Ichiro0 tJournal of bioscience and bioengineering.g2008 Mar., v. 105, no. 3 p.221-225dSociety for Bioscience and Bioengineering, Japan; Amsterdam, the Netherlandsx1389-17237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1263/jbb.105.2213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03021naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245020600168300001600374520196600390650002302356653000802379653002202387653002302409700001502432700001602447700001502463773010702478852000902585856006902594930003302663946001102696655001202707IND4388418520221121173454.0070304e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438841852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-006-0522-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Alessandris, C. 10aC-reactive protein induces phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 on Ser³⁰⁷ and Ser⁶¹² in L6 myocytes, thereby impairing the insulin signalling pathway that promotes glucose transport  ap. 840-849.  aAims/hypothesis C-reactive protein (CRP) is associated with insulin resistance and predicts development of type 2 diabetes. However, it is unknown whether CRP directly affects insulin signalling action. To this aim, we determined the effects of human recombinant CRP (hrCRP) on insulin signalling involved in glucose transport in L6 myotubes. Materials and methods L6 myotubes were exposed to endotoxin-free hrCRP and insulin-stimulated activation of signal molecules, glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis were assessed. Results We found that hrCRP stimulates both c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activity. These effects were paralleled by a concomitant increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser³⁰⁷ and Ser⁶¹², respectively. The stimulatory effects of hrCRP on IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser³⁰⁷ and Ser⁶¹² were partially reversed by treatment with specific JNK and ERK1/2 inhibitors, respectively. Exposure of L6 myotubes to hrCRP reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Tyr⁶³², a site essential for engaging p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K), protein kinase B (Akt) activation and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) phosphorylation. These events were accompanied by a decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transporter (GLUT) 4 translocation to the plasma membrane, glucose uptake and glucose incorporation into glycogen. The inhibitory effects of hrCRP on insulin signalling and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation were reversed by treatment with JNK inhibitor I and the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor, PD98059. Conclusions/interpretation Our data suggest that hrCRP may cause insulin resistance by increasing IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser³⁰⁷ and Ser⁶¹² via JNK and ERK1/2, respectively, leading to impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, GLUT4 translocation, and glycogen synthesis mediated by the IRS-1/PI-3K/Akt/GSK-3 pathway. 3ainsulin resistance 0aCRP 0aGlucose transport 0aInsulin signalling1 aLauro, R. 1 aPresta, I. 1 aSesti, G. 0 tDiabetologia.g2007 Apr., v. 50, no. 4 p.840-849dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-006-0522-y3electronic resource  a20070304b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02787naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009600163300001600259520178200275653001202057653003302069653002602102700001602128700001602144700001602160700001502176700001602191700001402207773010602221852000902327856006902336930003302405946001102438655001202449IND4390163620221121173524.0070408e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439016362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-007-0643-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHermanns, N. 10aAssociation of glucose levels and glucose variability with mood in type 1 diabetic patients  ap. 930-933.  aAims/hypothesis The aim of this study was to investigate the association of glucose levels and variability of glucose, assessed by continuous glucose monitoring, with mood in type 1 diabetic patients. Materials and methods Thirty-six type 1 diabetic patients (77.8% male, age: 31.1 ± 10.0 years; disease duration: 14.7 ± 7.1 years, BMI: 26.7 ± 5.1 kg/m², HbA₁c 8.4 ±1.8%, 27.8% with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII] therapy) used a continuous glucose monitoring system for 48.8 h. During this time the patients rated their current mood states 14.6 times on average, using the University of Wales Institute of Science and Technology Mood Adjective Checklist and hand-held computers. Results Sensor performance was satisfactory, with a mean absolute difference from reference laboratory glucose measurement of 13.7%. Current glucose values were significantly associated with ratings of 'tension' (z = 2.40), 'hedonic tone' (z = -2.63) and 'energetic arousal' (z = -2.09). 'Anger' (z = 1.64) was not significantly associated with glucose values. The glucose AUC during the 60 min prior to the mood rating showed similar associations. The two parameters of glucose variability--coefficient of variation and absolute glucose change during the 60 min prior to the mood ratings--did not show any significant association with the mood ratings. The magnitude of association was significantly higher for glucose level than for glucose variability in the scales 'tension' and 'hedonic tone'. Conclusions/interpretation High glucose values had a negative impact on mood; positive mood ratings decreased, whereas negative mood ratings increased. The association between mood and glucose variability seemed to be less important than that between glucose level and mood. 0aDevices 0aMetabolic physiology in vivo 0aPsychological aspects1 aScheff, C. 1 aKulzer, B. 1 aWeyers, P. 1 aPauli, P. 1 aKubiak, T. 1 aHaak, T. 0 tDiabetologia.g2007 May, v. 50, no. 5 p.930-933dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-007-0643-y3electronic resource  a20070408b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04436naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003300131040001800164100001800182245012200200300001800322500001500340506007600355520195000431506003702381650002102418650001802439650002502457650001702482650000802499650001102507650001302518650001702531650000902548650001002557650001902567650001602586650001102602650003102613650002202644650001202666650006502678650001102743650003002754650002502784650002302809650002502832650001002857650002602867650003902893650000902932650001502941650002902956650005302985650001903038650002503057650003403082650005003116653001203166653000903178653001003187653001403197653001503211653002803226653001403254653002603268700001603294700001603310773014103326852000903467856008303476930003303559945001303592946001303605655001203618IND2243465220221207121807.0010305e20000509dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND224346522DNAL7 a108058092pmid7 aPMC258632pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.97.10.55342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcBride, A.A.10aProduction of infectious bovine papillomavirus from cloned viral DNA by using an organotypic raft/xenograft technique  ap. 5534-5539.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1) induces fibropapillomas in its natural host and can transform fibroblasts in culture. The viral genome is maintained as an episome within fibroblasts, which has allowed extensive genetic analyses of the functions required for DNA replication, gene expression, and transformation. Much less is known about BPV-1 gene expression and replication in bovine epithelial cells because the study of the complete viral life cycle requires an experimental system capable of generating a fully differentiated stratified bovine epithelium. Using a combination of organotypic raft cultures and xenograft on nude mice, we have developed a system in which BPV-1 can replicate and produce infectious viral particles. Organotypic cultures were established with bovine keratinocytes plated on a collagen raft containing BPV-1-transformed fibroblasts. These keratinocytes were infected with virus particles isolated from a bovine wart or were transfected with cloned BPV-1 DNA. Several days after the rafts were lifted to the air interface, they were grafted on nude mice. After 6-8 weeks, large xenografts were produced that exhibited a hyperplastic and hyperkeratotic epithelium overlying a large dermal fibroma. These lesions were strikingly similar to a fibropapilloma caused by BPV-1 in the natural host. Amplified viral DNA and capsid antigens were detected in the suprabasal cells of the epithelium. Moreover, infectious virus particles could be isolated from these lesions and quantitated by a focus formation assay on mouse cells in culture. Interestingly, analysis of grafts produced with infected and uninfected fibroblasts indicated that the fibroma component was not required for productive infection or morphological changes characteristic of papillomavirus-infected epithelium. This system will be a powerful tool for the genetic analysis of the roles of the viral gene products in the complete viral life cycle.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPapillomaviridae 3akeratinocytes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3acell culture 3aDNA 3agenome 3acollagen 3atransfection 3amice 3afetus 3aviral antigens 3afibroblasts 3acalves 3anucleic acid hybridization 3avirus replication 2aAnimals 2aBovine papillomavirus 1xgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxvirology 2aCell Transplantation 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aFetus 2aFibroblastsxcytology 2aKeratinocytesxcytologyxvirology. 2aMice 2aMice, Nude 2aOrgan Culture Techniques 2aPapillomavirus Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 2aSkinxcytology 2aSkin Transplantation 2aTransplantation, Heterologous 2aTumor Virus Infectionsxveterinaryxvirology. 0acloning 0askin 0acells 0anude mice 0axenografts 0aexperimental infections 0ahistology 0aBovine papillomavirus1 aDlugosz, A.1 aBaker, C.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2000 May 9, v. 97, no. 10 p.5534-5539x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.97.10.55343Available from publisher's Web site  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03156naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245020700159300001800366520186400384650002002248650001702268650002002285653001502305653002302320653001202343653001302355700001602368700001802384700001702402700001602419700001802435700001502453700001402468700001702482773010902499852000902608856008502617930003302702946001102735655001202746IND4393024920221121132349.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439302492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-007-0729-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, C. 10aImpact of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator-1β (PGC-1β) Ala203Pro polymorphism on in vivo metabolism, PGC-1β expression and fibre type composition in human skeletal muscle  ap. 1615-1620.  aAims/hypothesis Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ coactivator-1β (PGC-1β, also known as PPARGC1B) expression is reduced in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in elderly subjects. Ala203Pro, a common variant in the PGC-1β gene is associated with obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the PGC-1β Ala203Pro polymorphism influences the age-related decline in skeletal muscle PGC-1β expression, in vivo metabolism and markers for muscle fibre type composition. Materials and methods The PGC-1β Ala203Pro polymorphism was genotyped in 110 young (age 28.0 ± 1.9 years) and 86 elderly (age 62.4 ± 2.0 years) twins and related to muscle PGC-1β expression, in vivo metabolism and markers for fibre type composition. Results Insulin-stimulated non-oxidative glucose metabolism (NOGM; p = 0.025) and glycolytic flux rate (GF; p = 0.026) were reduced in young Ala/Ala carriers compared with carriers of a 203Pro allele. In addition, a regression analysis, correcting for covariates, showed that the PGC-1β 203Pro allele was positively related to insulin-stimulated NOGM and GF in the young twins. While muscle expression of PGC-1β was reduced in elderly compared with young carriers of the Ala/Ala genotype (p <= 0.001), there was no significant age-related decline in PGC-1β expression in carriers of the 203Pro allele (p >= 0.4). However, a regression analysis, correcting for covariates, showed that only age was significantly related to muscle PGC-1β expression. Finally, PGC-1β expression correlated positively with markers for oxidative fibres in human muscle. Conclusions/interpretation This study suggests that young carriers of a PGC-1β 203Pro allele have enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism and may be protected against an age-related decline in PGC-1β expression in muscle. 3agene expression 3apolymorphism 3askeletal muscle 0aFibre type 0aIn vivo metabolism 0aPGC-1β 0aPPARGC1B1 aWegner, L. 1 aAndersen, G. 1 aAlmgren, P. 1 aHansen, T. 1 aPedersen, O. 1 aGroop, L. 1 aVaag, A. 1 aPoulsen, P. 0 tDiabetologia.g2007 Aug., v. 50, no. 8 p.1615-1620dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-007-0729-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02796naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001500139245016600154300001600320500002400336520155100360650001101911650001101922650002301933650002001956650001001976650001801986650001302004650002002017650001202037650001102049650004002060700001702100700001902117700002902136700002102165700002202186773009002208852000902298856007902307655001202386IND4404614120221121132408.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440461412DNAL7 a10.1530/REP-08-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Wenbo10aRelaxin (RLX) and estrogen affect estrogen receptor α, vascular endothelial growth factor, and RLX receptor expression in the neonatal porcine uterus and cervix  ap. 705-712.  aIncludes references  aThe porcine female reproductive tract undergoes estrogen receptor (ER) α-dependent development after birth (postnatal day=PND 0), the course of which can determine adult uterine function. Uterotrophic effects of relaxin (RLX) in the porcine neonate are age specific and may involve ER activation. Here, objectives were to determine effects of RLX and estrogen administered from birth on uterine and cervical growth and expression of ERα, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the RLX receptor (RXFP1). On PND 0, gilts were treated with the antiestrogen ICI 182 780 (ICI) or vehicle alone and, 2 h later, were given estradiol-17β (E) or porcine RLX for 2 days. Neither RLX nor E affected uterine wet weight or protein content on PND 2. However, RLX, but not E, increased cervical wet weight and protein content when compared with controls. Pretreatment with ICI did not inhibit RLX-stimulated cervical growth. Uterine and cervical ERα increased in response to RLX, but not E. Both RLX and E increased VEGF in the uterus and cervix on PND 2. Pretreatment with ICI increased VEGF in both tissues and increased RLX-induced cervical VEGF. In the uterus E, but not RLX, increased RXFP1 mRNA. In the cervix, E increased RXFP1 gene expression whereas RLX decreased it. Results indicate that the neonatal uterus and cervix are sensitive to E and RLX and that growth responses to RLX in these tissues differ by PND 2. Effects of RLX on uterine and cervical ERα and VEGF expression may be important for neonatal reproductive tract development. 3aadults 3acervix 3aestrogen receptors 3agene expression 3agilts 3amessenger RNA 3aneonates 3aprotein content 3arelaxin 3auterus 3avascular endothelial growth factors1 aChen, Joseph1 aWiley, Anne A.1 aCrean-Harris, Bethany D.1 aBartol, Frank F.1 aBagnell, Carol A.0 tReproduction.g2008 May, v. 135, no. 5 p.705-712dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/REP-08-00143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03148naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245013800205300001400343520166400357650001502021650002302036650002302059650001202082650001402094653001402108653002002122700002202142700002002164700001602184700001302200700001902213700001702232700001702249700001902266700002102285700001502306700001902321700002202340700001702362700002002379773010502399852000902504856008502513930003302598946001102631655001202642IND4398490220221121132347.0071209e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439849022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-007-0793-y2doi7 aPMC21004292pmcid7 a178516492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYajnik, C.

We studied the association between maternal vitamin B₁₂, folate and tHcy status during pregnancy, and offspring adiposity and insulin resistance at 6 years. Methods In the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study we studied 700 consecutive eligible pregnant women in six villages. We measured maternal nutritional intake and circulating concentrations of folate, vitamin B₁₂, tHcy and methylmalonic acid (MMA) at 18 and 28 weeks of gestation. These were correlated with offspring anthropometry, body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan) and insulin resistance (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-R]) at 6 years. Results Two-thirds of mothers had low vitamin B₁₂ (<150 pmol/l), 90% had high MMA (>0.26 μmol/l) and 30% had raised tHcy concentrations (>10 μmol/l); only one had a low erythrocyte folate concentration. Although short and thin (BMI), the 6-year-old children were relatively adipose compared with the UK standards (skinfold thicknesses). Higher maternal erythrocyte folate concentrations at 28 weeks predicted higher offspring adiposity and higher HOMA-R (both p < 0.01). Low maternal vitamin B₁₂ (18 weeks; p = 0.03) predicted higher HOMA-R in the children. The offspring of mothers with a combination of high folate and low vitamin B₁₂ concentrations were the most insulin resistant. Conclusions/interpretation Low maternal vitamin B₁₂ and high folate status may contribute to the epidemic of adiposity and type 2 diabetes in India. 3afolic acid 3ainsulin resistance 3amaternal nutrition 3aprogeny 3apregnancy 0aAdiposity 0aVitamin B₁₂1 aDeshpande, S.

Wild-type polarize with a leading edge enriched in F-actin toward a chemoattractant. Overexpression of constitutively active Dictyostelium Rac1B61L or disruption of DdracGAP1, which encodes a Dictyostelium Rac1GAP, induces membrane ruffles enriched with actin filaments around the perimeter of the cell and increased levels of F-actin in resting cells. Whereas wild-type cells move linearly toward the cAMP source, Rac1B61L and Ddracgap1 null cells make many wrong turns and chemotaxis is inefficient, which presumably results from the unregulated activation of F-actin assembly and pseudopod extension. Cells expressing dominant-negative DdRac1B17N do not have a well-defined F-actin-rich leading edge and do not protrude pseudopodia, resulting in very poor cell motility. From these studies and assays examining chemoattractant-mediated F-actin assembly, we suggest Ddrac1 regulates the basal levels of F-actin assembly, its dynamic reorganization in response to chemoattractants, and cellular polarity during chemotaxis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acyclic AMP 3apolymerization 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aG-proteins 3acytoskeleton 3amutants 3aactin 3aDictyostelium 3achemotaxis 2aActinsxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCell Aggregation 2aChemotaxisxphysiology 2aCyclic AMPxphysiology 2aCytoskeletonxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aDictyosteliumxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2arac1 GTP-Binding Proteinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0abinding proteins1 aLee, S.1 aBriscoe, C.1 aEllsworth, C.1 aFirtel, R.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2000 May 9, v. 97, no. 10 p.5225-5230x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.97.10.52253Available from publisher's Web site  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02583naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002800136245004500164300001400209500002400223520128500247650001401532650001201546650002601558650002501584650001301609650001101622650001101633650001601644650001601660650001801676650001001694650001401704650001301718650001301731650002301744650001101767650002201778650001501800650001301815650002301828700001901851700003601870773011001906852000902016856007602025655001202101IND4404634920221121092138.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440463492DNAL7 a10.1002/ffj.18572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez-Araújo, Laura10aAroma volatiles of 'a la Piedra' Turrón  ap. 84-92.  aIncludes references  a'A la piedra' turrón is a typical Spanish confection prepared from toasted almonds, sugar, lemon peel and cinnamon; it is the simplest version of turrón. To date, no information has been available on aroma profiles of any type of turrón. The aroma profiles of 'a la piedra' turrón from two different manufacturing companies were studied. A total of 66 compounds were detected, including terpenes (21), terpenoids (16), aldehydes (8), pyrazines (5), furans (3), pyrroles (2), aromatic hydrocarbons (7) and others (4). The predominant volatile compounds were those originated from the lemon peel ([almost equal to]30%), the most characteristic and important ingredient of this food from a flavour point of view. However, descriptive sensory analysis proved that other attributes, such as toasted, nutty, cinnamon, sweet and aftertaste, were also of importance. The low levels of pyrazines (the chemical group most characteristic of toasted nuts) were probably related to a deficient and not optimized toasting process. Thus, further studies are needed to optimize the roasting conditions of almonds. Finally, this study proved that the flavour of this type of turrón was dominated by the lemon peel and cinnamon notes, and that low-toasted almonds were used in its manufacture. 3aaldehydes 3aalmonds 3aaromatic hydrocarbons 3abusiness enterprises 3acinnamon 3aflavor 3afurans 3aingredients 3alemon peels 3amanufacturing 3aodors 3apyrazines 3apyrroles 3aroasting 3asensory evaluation 3asugars 3ataste sensitivity 3aterpenoids 3atoasting 3avolatile compounds1 aVerdú, Alexis1 aCarbonell-Barrachina, Ángel A.0 tFlavour and fragrance journal.g2008 Mar., v. 23, no. 2 p.84-92dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0882-57347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ffj.18573Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03218naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002100181245009800202300001800300500002400318506007600342520096900418506003701387650002401424650001801448650002301466650002801489650001401517650001101531650002001542650001701562650002601579650001601605650000901621650001901630650001201649650002201661650001601683650001201699650002901711650002801740650001101768650004101779650005501820650006301875650003501938650005401973650000902027650002302036650002902059650002102088650004802109700002102157700002002178700002202198700002202220700002202242700002502264700002602289773011602315852000902431856008002440655001202520IND4404575920221207122713.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457592DNAL7 a183322132pmid7 aPMC23466892pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01481-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaparakis, Maria10aMacrophages Are Mediators of Gastritis in Acute Helicobacter pylori Infection in C57BL/6 Mice  ap. 2235-2239.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHelicobacter pylori is the etiological agent of human chronic gastritis, a condition seen as a precursor to the development of gastrointestinal ulcers or gastric cancer. This study utilized the murine model of chronic H. pylori infection to characterize the role of macrophages in the induction of specific immune responses and gastritis and in the control of the bacterial burden following H. pylori infection and vaccination. Drug-loaded liposomes were injected intravenously to deplete macrophages from C57BL/6 mice, and effective removal of CD11b⁺ cells from the spleens and stomachs of mice was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Transient elimination of macrophages from C57BL/6 mice during the early period of infection reduced the gastric pathology induced by H. pylori SS1 but did not affect the bacterial load in the stomach. These data suggest that macrophages are important to the severity of gastric inflammation during H. pylori infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aanimal models 3aetiological agents 3afluorescence microscopy 3agastritis 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aintravenous injection 3amacrophages 3amice 3amicrobial load 3astomach 3astomach neoplasms 3avaccination 2aAnimals 2aCD11b Antigenxanalysis. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aFemale 2aGastritisximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aHelicobacter Infectionsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aHelicobacter pyloriximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aLeukocyte Reduction Procedures 2aMacrophagesxchemistryximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aSpleenxcytology 2aStomachxcytologyxmicrobiologyxpathology.1 aWalduck, Anna K.1 aPrice, Jason D.1 aPedersen, John S.1 avan Rooijen, Nico1 aPearse, Martin J.1 aWijburg, Odilia L.C.1 aStrugnell, Richard A.0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.2235-2239dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01481-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04162naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002200181245013200203300001800335500002400353500001500377506007600392520176000468506003702228650002002265650002802285650001402313650001602327650001902343650001602362650002302378650001702401650003002418650002802448650001302476650001202489650001002501650001102511650001402522650001302536650002302549650004602572650004402618650002702662650003502689650001802724650001502742650003302757650001102790650005102801650004502852650008302897650008202980650008203062653003003144700001703174700002603191700002003217700002203237773011603259852000903375856008003384655001203464IND4404575520221207123639.0080418s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440457552DNAL7 a183470502pmid7 aPMC23466772pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01704-072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasselli, Timothy10aVibrio parahaemolyticus Inhibition of Rho Family GTPase Activation Requires a Functional Chromosome I Type III Secretion System  ap. 2202-2211.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVibrio parahaemolyticus is a leading cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis; however, its virulence mechanisms are not well understood. The identification of type III secreted proteins has provided candidate virulence factors whose functions are still being elucidated. Genotypic strain variability contributes a level of complexity to understanding the role of different virulence factors. The ability of V. parahaemolyticus to inhibit Rho family GTPases and cause cytoskeletal disruption was examined with HeLa cells. After HeLa cells were infected, intracellular Rho activation was inhibited in response to external stimuli. In vitro activation of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 isolated from infected HeLa cell lysates was also inhibited, indicating that the bacteria were specifically targeting GTPase activation. The inhibition of Rho family GTPase activation was retained for clinical and environmental isolates of V. parahaemolyticus and was dependent on a functional chromosome I type III secretion system (CI-T3SS). GTPase inhibition was independent of hemolytic toxin genotype and the chromasome II (CII)-T3SS. Rho inhibition was accompanied by a shift in the total actin pool to its monomeric form. These phenotypes were abrogated in a mutant strain lacking the CI-T3S effector Vp1686, suggesting that the inhibiting actin polymerization may be a downstream effect of Vp1686-dependent GTPase inhibition. Although Vp1686 has been previously characterized as a potential virulence factor in macrophages, our findings reveal an effect on cultured HeLa cells. The ability to inhibit Rho family GTPases independently of the CII-T3SS and the hemolytic toxins may provide insight into the mechanisms of virulence used by strains lacking these virulence factors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agastroenteritis 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aphenotype 3achromosomes 3apolymerization 3amacrophages 3astrain differences 3acytoskeleton 3atype III secretion system 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3agenotype 3amutants 3aactin 3atoxins 3avirulence 3abacteria 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCarrier Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChromosomes, Bacterial 2aEpithelial Cellsxmicrobiology 2aGene Deletion 2aHeLa Cells 2aHemolysin Proteinsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aVibrio parahaemolyticusxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aVirulence Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2acdc42 GTP-Binding Proteinxantagonists & inhibitorsxisolation & purification. 2arac GTP-Binding Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxisolation & purification. 2arho GTP-Binding Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxisolation & purification. 0aType III secretion system1 aLynch, Tarah1 aSouthward, Carolyn M.1 aJones, Bryan W.1 aDeVinney, Rebekah0 tInfection and immunity.g2008 May, v. 76, no. 5 p.2202-2211dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01704-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02620naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001700148245008600165300001400251500002400265520176200289650003402051650001402085650001202099700001902111700001902130773009602149852000902245856008802254655001202342IND4404677420221121075624.0080421s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440467742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLü, Yanbin.10aUsing the liquid nature of the stationary phase in counter-current chromatography  ap. 10-18.  aIncludes references  aThe main feature of counter-current chromatography (CCC) is that the stationary phase is a liquid as well as the mobile phase. The retention volumes of solutes are directly proportional to their distribution coefficients K D in the biphasic liquid system used in the CCC column. Solutes with high K D coefficients are highly retained in the column. The back-extrusion method (BECCC) uses the fact that the liquid stationary phase, that contains the retained solutes, can be easily moved. Switching the column inlet and outlet ports without changing the liquid phase used as the mobile phase causes the rapid collapse of the two immiscible liquid phases inside the column, the previously stationary phase being gathered at the new column outlet. Then this previously stationary liquid phase is extruded outside the CCC column carrying the retained solutes. The back-extrusion method is tested with a standard mixture of five compounds and compared with the recently described elution-extrusion method. It is shown that the chromatographic resolution obtained during the back-extrusion step is good because the solute band broadening is minimized as long as the solute is located inside the “stationary” phase. However, a major drawback of the BECCC method is that all solutes are split between the liquid phases according to their distribution ratios when the CCC column equilibrium is broken. The change of flowing direction should be done after a sufficient amount of mobile phase has flushed the column in the classical mode, eluting solutes with small and medium distribution ratios. Otherwise, a significant portion of the solutes will stay in the mobile phase inside the column and produce a broad peak showing after the stationary phase extrusion. 3acountercurrent chromatography 3aextrusion 3asolutes1 aPan, Yuanjiang1 aBerthod, Alain0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 May 2, v. 1189, no. 1-2 p.10-18dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.0103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01885naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245520105100261650003701312650001301349650002501362650002501387653002801412700001601440773009601456852000901552939003301561946001301594655001201607IND9102908420221121043348.0910719e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910290842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolzin, K.M.10aIdentification, DNA sequence, and distribution of LS981, a new, high-copy-number insertion sequence in lactococci  ap. 734-743.  aAn insertion in the lactococcal plasmid pGBK17, which inactivated the gene(s) encoding resistance to the prolate-headed phage c2, was cloned, sequenced, and identified as a new lactococcal insertion sequence (IS). IS981 was 1,222 bp in size and contained two open reading frames, one large enough to encode a transposase. IS981 ended in imperfect inverted repeats of 26 of 40 bp and generated a 5-bp direct repeat of target DNA at the site of insertion. IS981 was present on the chromosome of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LM0230 from where it transposed to pGBK17 during transformation. Twenty-three strains of lactococci examined for the presence of IS981 by Southern hybridization showed 4 to 26 copies per genome, with L. lactis subsp. cremoris strains containing the highest number of copies. Comparison of the DNA sequence and the amino acid sequence of the long open reading frame to other known sequences showed that IS981 is related to a family of IS elements that includes IS2, IS3, IS51, IS15O, IS600, IS629, IS861, IS904, and ISL1. 3aLactococcus lactis subsp. lactis 3aplasmids 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aMcKay, L.L.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1991 Mar., v. 57, no. 3 p.734-743x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03364naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003400131040001800165100001300183245010300196300002000299506007600319520125100395506003701646650002501683650001001708650001601718650002801734650001201762650001801774650001101792650002701803650001301830650001401843650001201857650002001869650001801889650001701907650001601924650002401940650002601964650002501990650001802015650003402033650001602067650001702083650001202100650002802112650001302140650002902153650003902182653002702221653001902248653001402267653002002281700001102301700001402312700001902326700001102345773014602356852000902502856008402511930003302595945001302628946001302641655001202654IND2205482020221207122051.0000628e19990928dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220548202DNAL7 a105001912pmid7 aPMC180482pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.96.20.114162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, M.14aThe Arabidopsis SKP1-LIKE1 gene is essential for male meiosis and may control homologue separation  ap. 11416-11421.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe yeast and human SKP1 genes regulate the mitotic cell cycle but are not yet known to be required for meiosis. Nine Arabidopsis SKP1 homologues have been uncovered and are named ASK1 through ASK9. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a male sterile Arabidopsis mutant and show that the mutant defect was caused by a Ds transposon insertion into the ASK1 gene. In the ask-1 mutant, abnormal microspores exhibit a range of sizes. Furthermore, during mutant male meiosis, although homologous chromosome pairing appeared normal at metaphase I, chromosome segregation at anaphase I is unequal, and some chromosomes are abnormally extended. Therefore, in ask1-1, at least some homologues remain associated after metaphase I. In addition, immunofluorescence microscopy indicates that the mutant spindle morphology at both metaphase I and early anaphase I is normal; thus, the abnormal chromosome segregation is not likely caused by a spindle defect. Because the yeast Skp1p is required for targeting specific proteins for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, we propose that ASK1 controls homologue separation by degrading or otherwise removing a protein that is required directly or indirectly for homologue association before anaphase I.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3agenes 3atransposons 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3ameiosis 3agametogenesis 3apollen 3achromosome segregation 3aanaphase 3ametaphase 3amutants 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3amicrotubules 3amicrospores 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgenetics 2aChromosomes 2aGenes, Plant 2aMeiosis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aS-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins 0achromosome disposition 0amale sterility 0aask1 gene 0ameiotic spindle1 aHu, Y.1 aLodhi, M.1 aMcCombie, W.R.1 aMa, H.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1999 Sept. 28, v. 96, no. 20 p.11416-11421x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.20.114163Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03872naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003400131040001800165100001600183245010900199300002000308500001500328506007600343520124200419506003701661650001801698650002101716650002001737650002201757650001101779650002201790650002201812650003001834650002501864650002601889650000901915650002001924650002201944650002501966650002001991650002702011650001102038650001202049650006602061650002202127650004102149650003802190650001102228650007002239650000902309650001802318650007302336650006602409650002202475653002902497653001702526653001502543653001102558653001802569653003002587653002402617700001302641700001702654700001702671700001702688700001602705700001902721700001602740773014602756852000902902856008402911930003302995945001303028946001303041655001203054IND2205451620221207130948.0000627e19990928dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220545162DNAL7 a105001412pmid7 aPMC179982pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.96.20.111282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVaquero, C.10aTransient expression of a tumor-specific single-chain fragment and a chimeric antibody in tobacco leaves  ap. 11128-11133.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo evaluate the expression of different forms of a tumor-specific antibody in plants, we adapted a recently described Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression system. A recombinant single-chain Fv antibody (scFvT84.66) and a full-size mouse/human chimeric antibody (cT84.66) derived from the parental murine mAb T84.66 specific for the human carcinoembryonic antigen were engineered into a plant expression vector. Chimeric T84.66 heavy and light chain genes were constructed by exchanging the mouse light and heavy chain constant domain sequences with their human counterparts and cloned into two independent plant expression vectors. In vivo assembly of full-size cT84.66 was achieved by simultaneous expression of the light and heavy chains after vacuum infiltration of tobacco leaves with two populations of recombinant Agrobacterium. Upscaling the transient system permitted purification of functional recombinant antibodies from tobacco leaf extracts within a week. His6-tagged scFvT84.66 was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and cT84.66 by protein A affinity chromatography. Sufficient amounts of recombinant antibodies were recovered for detailed characterization by SDS/PAGE, Western blotting, and ELISA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3agene transfer 3aimmunoglobulin G 3arecombinant DNA 3acomplementary DNA 3ahumans 3aneoplasm antigens 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3arecombinant proteins 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amice 3asynthetic genes 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aimmunoglobulin genes 3agene expression 3arecombinant antibodies 3aleaves 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Neoplasmxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCarcinoembryonic Antigenximmunology 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Fragmentsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aMice 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aTobaccoxgenetics 0acarcinoembryonic antigen 0apurification 0aantibodies 0avacuum 0agene splicing 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0avacuum infiltration1 aSack, M.1 aChandler, J.1 aDrossard, J.1 aSchuster, F.1 aMonecke, M.1 aSchillberg, S.1 aFischer, R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1999 Sept. 28, v. 96, no. 20 p.11128-11133x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.20.111283Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01839naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245006500144300001600209520108400225650000901309650001801318650001501336650001601351700001501367700001601382773009601398852000901494939003301503946001301536655001201549IND9102908620221120085648.0910719e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910290862DNAL7 a163484412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsai, Y.I.10aRapid method for direct extraction of mRNA from seeded soils  ap. 765-768.  aA protocol for direct extraction of mRNA from soil samples was developed. Soil samples (10 g) were washed twice with 120 mM phosphate buffer (pH 5.2). The lysis of cells, fixation of RNA, and hydrolysis of DNA were achieved by vigorously shaking the washed soil in a 4 M guanidine thiocyanate solution containing 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% sarcosyl, and 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol. The pH of the homogenized mixture was adjusted with 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.0); the mRNA was then extracted with phenol and chloroform. Total RNA was precipitated with isopropanol. This method extracts up to 17 microgram of total RNA per g (wet weight) of soil containing 8.0 X 10(8) cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PU21, and mRNA has been detected in 160-ng total RNA fractions. This method has been used for the detection of mRNA transcribed from specific biodegradative genes, including the nah and mer operons, in contaminated soils. This extraction method can be completed within a few hours and has tremendous potential for ecological studies of in situ gene expression among soil microbiotas. 3asoil 3amessenger RNA 3aextraction 3amethodology1 aPark, M.J.1 aOlson, B.H.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1991 Mar., v. 57, no. 3 p.765-768x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04547naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003400131040001800165100001600183245007800199300002000277500007700297500001500374506007600389520176900465506003702234650001902271650001302290650000902303650002302312650001402335650001002349650002402359650002502383650002302408650002502431650002302456650002102479650002402500650001502524650002702539653002102566653002102587653002102608653002102629653002102650653002102671653002102692653002602713653002102739653002102760653002102781653002102802653002102823653002802844653001402872653002602886653002102912653001602933653002602949653002602975653002103001653001403022653002103036653002203057653002103079653002103100653002103121653002103142653002103163653002403184653002103208653002103229653002103250653002103271700001603292700001703308773014403325852000903469856008403478930003303562945001303595946001303608655001203621IND2205837320221207134935.0000718e19991207dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220583732DNAL7 a105887182pmid7 aPMC244492pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.96.25.144062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCronn, R.C.10aDuplicated genes evolve independently after polyploid formation in cotton  ap. 14406-14411.  aThe accession numbers AF13818-AF13821 do not conform to standard format.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOf the many processes that generate gene duplications, polyploidy is unique in that entire genomes are duplicated. This process has been important in the evolution of many eukaryotic groups, and it occurs with high frequency in plants. Recent evidence suggests that polyploidization may be accompanied by rapid genomic changes, but the evolutionary fate of discrete loci recently doubled by polyploidy (homoeologues) has not been studied. Here we use locus-specific isolation techniques with comparative mapping to characterize the evolution of homoeologous loci in allopolyploid cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) and in species representing its diploid progenitors. We isolated and sequenced 16 loci from both genomes of the allopolyploid, from both progenitor diploid genomes and appropriate outgroups. Phylogenetic analysis of the resulting 73.5 kb of sequence data demonstrated that for all 16 loci (14.7 kb/genome), the topology expected from organismal history was recovered. In contrast to observations involving repetitive DNAs in cotton, there was no evidence of interaction among duplicated genes in the allopolyploid. Polyploidy was not accompanied by an obvious increase in mutations indicative of pseudogene formation. Additionally, differences in rates of divergence among homoeologues in polyploids and orthologues in diploids were indistinguishable across loci, with significant rate deviation restricted to two putative pseudogenes. Our results indicate that most duplicated genes in allopolyploid cotton evolve independently of each other and at the same rate as those of their diploid progenitors. These indications of genic stasis accompanying polyploidization provide a sharp contrast to recent examples of rapid genomic evolution in allopolyploids.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aallopolyploidy 3adiploidy 3aloci 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aphylogeny 3agenes 3aGossypium herbaceum 3anucleotide sequences 3aGossypium arboreum 2aBiological Evolution 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGene Duplication 2aGossypiumxgenetics 2aPolyploidy 2aRecombination, Genetic 0agenbank/af139417 0agenbank/af136808 0agenbank/af136809 0agenbank/af136813 0agenbank/af136811 0agenbank/af201876 0agenbank/af201877 0agenbank/af13820 [sic] 0agenbank/af136810 0agenbank/af201892 0agenbank/af139419 0agenbank/af201891 0agenbank/af139477 0amolecular sequence data 0aGossypium 0agenbank/af13818 [sic] 0agenbank/af139418 0aduplication 0agenbank/af13821 [sic] 0agenbank/af13819 [sic] 0agenbank/af201893 0aevolution 0agenbank/af201889 0agenbank/af139420+ 0agenbank/af139474 0agenbank/af136814 0agenbank/af201879 0agenbank/af136815 0agenbank/af139475 0agossypium raimondii 0agenbank/af201890 0agenbank/af139476 0agenbank/af136816 0agenbank/af2018781 aSmall, R.L.1 aWendel, J.F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1999 Dec. 7, v. 96, no. 25 p.14406-14411x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.25.144063Available from publisher's Web site  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03110naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003400131040001800165100001400183245009300197300002000290506007600310520139600386506003701782650001501819650001601834650001601850650003401866650002001900650002201920650001801942650001401960650001801974650002201992650002102014650002202035650001202057650001702069650001802086650001902104650001202123653001602135653002302151653002402174700001602198700001802214700001502232773014502247852000902392856008402401930003302485945001302518946001302531655001202544IND2205803420221207134935.0000717e19991012dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220580342DNAL7 a105185982pmid7 aPMC184342pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.96.21.121922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob, T.10aAbscisic acid signal transduction in guard cells is mediated by phospholipase D activity  ap. 12192-12197.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn guard cells, the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits stomatal opening and induces stomatal closure through the coordinated regulation of ion transport. Despite this central role of ABA in regulating stomatal function, the signal transduction events leading to altered ion fluxes remain incompletely understood. We report that the activity of the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) transiently increased in guard cell protoplasts at 2.5 and 25 min after ABA application. Treatment of guard cell protoplasts with phosphatidic acid (PtdOH), one of the products of PLD activity, led to an inhibition of the activity of the inward K+ channel. PtdOH also induced stomatal closure and inhibited stomatal opening when added to epidermal peels. Application of 1-butanol (1-buOH), a selective inhibitor of PtdOH production by PLD, inhibited the increase in PtdOH production elicited by ABA. 1-BuOH treatment also partially prevented ABA-induced stomatal closure and ABA-induced inhibition of stomatal opening. This inhibitory effect of buOH was enhanced by simultaneous application of nicotinamide, an inhibitor of cADP ribose action. These results suggest that in the guard cell, ABA activates the enzyme PLD, which leads to the production of PtdOH. This PtdOH is then involved in triggering subsequent ABA responses of the cell via a pathway operating in parallel to cADP ribose-mediated events.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVicia faba 3aguard cells 3aprotoplasts 3aphosphoric diester hydrolases 3aenzyme activity 3astomatal movement 3aabscisic acid 3apotassium 3aion transport 3aelectrophysiology 3aelectric current 3aenzyme inhibitors 3abutanol 3anicotinamide 3acytochemistry 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 0aderivatives 0aphosphatidic acids 0aphosphatidylbutanol1 aRitchie, S.1 aAssmann, S.M.1 aGilroy, S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1999 Oct. 12, v. 96, no. 21 p.12192-12197x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.21.121923Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03085naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001200129245009600141300001600237500001500253520201500268650002402283650002502307650001102332650001702343650001902360650003002379650003202409653001702441653001302458653001702471700002302488700001602511700002102527773009602548852000902644939003302653946001302686655001202699IND9102907920221120064114.0910719e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910290792DNAL7 a163484342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, B.10aBiodegradation of degradable plastic polyethylene by Phanerochaete and Streptomyces species  ap. 678-685.  a2019-12-04  aThe ability of lignin-degrading microorganisms to attack degradable plastics was investigated in pure shake flask culture studies. The degradable plastic used in this study was produced commercially by using the Archer-Daniels-Midland POLYCLEAN masterbatch and contained pro-oxidant and 6% starch. The known lignin-degrading bacteria Streptomyces viridosporus T7A, S. badius 252, and S. setonii 75Vi2 and fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium were used. Pro-oxidant activity was accelerated by placing a sheet of plastic into a drying oven at 70 degrees C under atmospheric pressure and air for 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 days. The effect of 2-, 4-, and 8-week longwave UV irradiation at 365 nm on plastic biodegradability was also investigated. For shake flask cultures, plastics were chemically disinfected and incubated-shaken at 125 rpm at 37 degrees C in 0.6% yeast extract medium (pH 7.1) for Streptomyces spp. and at 30 degrees C for the fungus in 3% malt extract medium (pH 4.5) for 4 weeks along with an uninoculated control for each treatment. Weight loss data were inconclusive because of cell mass accumulation. For almost every 70 degrees C heat-treated film, the Streptomyces spp. demonstrated a further reduction in percent elongation and polyethylene molecular weight average when compared with the corresponding uninoculated control. Significant (P < 0.05) reductions were demonstrated for the 4- and 8-day heat-treated films by all three bacteria. Heat-treated films incubated with P. chrysosporium consistently demonstrated higher percent elongation and molecular weight average than the corresponding uninoculated controls, but were lower than the corresponding zero controls (heat-treated films without 4-week incubation). The 2- and 4-week UV-treated films showed the greatest biodegradation by all three bacteria. Virtually no degradation by the fungus was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating bacterial degradation of these oxidized polyethylenes in pure culture. 3aStreptomyces badius 3aStreptomyces setonii 3astarch 3apolyethylene 3abiodegradation 3aStreptomyces viridosporus 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 0apro-oxidants 0aplastics 0aStreptomyces1 aPometto, A.L.

The HML and HMR loci in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are transcriptionally silent chromosome domains. Each locus is bracketed by two cis-acting sequences, designated E and I, that serve to establish and maintain repression of genes within each locus. We show that repression at HML is uniformly high between E and I but decreases sharply beyond I. The region of repression at HML generally correlates with the domain of histone hypoacetylation. Despite the sharp definition of the boundaries of HML, no sequence capable of blocking the spread of heterochromatin resides in the sequences flanking HML. We find, though, that inverting the orientation of I increases silencing outside of HML while weakening silencing within HML. These results indicate that the HML I silencer establishes a boundary between active and inactive chromatin at HML, but does so by organizing inactive chromatin in only one direction. This represents a different mechanism for delimiting the boundaries of a eukaryotic chromosome domain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aheterochromatin 3aloci 3aregulatory sequences 3agene expression 3ahistones 3aacetylation 3agene silencing 2aAcetylation 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHeterochromatinxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0ahml locus 0atranscriptional silencing 0atranscriptional repression 0ahistone hypoacetylation1 aBraunstein, M.1 aShei, G.J.1 aBroach, J.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1999 Oct. 12, v. 96, no. 21 p.11934-11939x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.21.119343Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01846naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245005300162300001600215500001900231520092700250650001701177650002401194650002101218650001001239650001101249650001801260650002301278773016701301856004601468961000901514852000901523655001201532IND60723487920221120055701.0210114e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072348792DNAL7 a10.22004/ag.econ.3024972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, Kevin10aImmersive Virtual Reality and Willingness to Pay  ap. 484-495.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper illustrates how to improve the immersiveness of an environmental valuation study using virtual reality (VR) headsets and real video footage. Recent research has used Òvirtual environmentsÓ to study this issue, but technological advances in VR headsets allow for a far greater degree of immersion. In this study, subjects were randomly shown either a VR video or static pictures of a polluted lake, before and after cleanup. They were then asked to indicate whether they would be willing to pay a random amount to improve lake water quality to the level shown. A discrete choice model is used to estimate and compare the willingness to pay for both groups. In this case study, there was no detectable effect on willingness to pay estimates. However, the technology may be beneficial for other valuation scenarios, particularly when the environmental change is complex or difficult for participants to evaluate. 3acase studies 3acomputer simulation 3aecological value 3alakes 3amodels 3awater quality 3awillingness to pay0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2020 Sept., v. 45, no. 3 p.484-495dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.22004/ag.econ.302497  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245012600170300001400296500024800310520128700558650002301845650002501868650002301893650001601916650001501932650001601947700002101963700001701984700002502001773014302026856005502169852000902224655001202233IND60549806320221120025340.0160909e20160225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054980632DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1110.142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScharff, C.10aInfluence of different light irradiation regimes on growth of the green algae Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus  ap. 91-98.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC2014): International Symposium on Molecular Biology in Horticulture held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  aMicroalgae are considered to be promising production organisms for biomass and specific high value compounds. Currently the commercial use is limited by the yield efficiencies, extraction of sensitive products and high process costs. Intensive research efforts are needed to tap the full potential in the direction of optimized growth parameters and operating conditions. It is well known that the growth of algae is a function created by many factors and light is one of the main influencing parameters. The investigation of different photoperiods is necessary to determine the most efficient regime for an industrial use of microalgae products. The objective of the presented study is the influence of different light:dark regimes (14:10, 16:8, 18:6, 20:8, 22:2, 24:0 h) to enhance biomass production, as well as gaining knowledge about different growth patterns of investigated species. Both species were grown photoautotroph and in batch mode operated lab scale bubble column photo-bioreactors at 27°C. Results obtained from the study indicated species specific response to different light regimes on growth profile and biomass production. Biomass production was increased with day length to a maximum of 2.70 g L-1 (24:0) for C. vulgaris and 2.56 g L-1 for S. obliquus (24:0). 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aScenedesmus obliquus 3abiomass production 3airradiation 3amicroalgae 3aphotoperiod1 aSchroeder, F.

Research on the effect of such imposed flood stress on roots is crucial to avoid permanent root damage of these perennial trees. Therefore, it is fundamental to study wax apple root response to flooding since tree vigor and steady production highly depend on maintaining a healthy root system. The present study used an anatomical approach to record histological changes occurring in maturing root cells of three-year-old wax apple trees grown in flooded conditions and compared it with normal conditions. Wax apples belong to Myrtaceae, a plant family known to develop a protective root tissue called polyderm. In older roots of normal batches, up to 5 layers of polyderm, composed of alternating layers of suberized endodermis-like cell and lignin encrusted thick-walled cell layers, were observed whereas in flooded batches, this number was restricted to 2-3 layers. In addition, lignin accumulation in epidermis and cortex together with suberin accumulation in endodermis and exodermis was observed in both normal and flooded batches. In younger roots of flooded batches, aerenchyma developed more dramatically than in normal batches. The results of the present study indicated that aerenchyma and polyderm layer formation were directly affected by soil moisture availability. The aerenchyma increased but polyderm layers decreased under flooded batch. Such results generate further interest on flood-induced structural changes occurring as root-response to flooding in commercial wax apple cultivation. 3aMalus domestica 3aSyzygium samarangense 3aaerenchyma 3aapples 3acortex 3aendodermis 3aflooded conditions 3aflowering 3alignin 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asoil water 3asuberin 3asuberization 3atrees 3avigor1 aOhtsuka, S.1 aNii, N.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Feb. 25, , no. 1110 p.85-90dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1110.13  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245009400170300001600264500024800280520088900528650004701417650004201464650002001506650002501526650001201551650002501563650001901588650002201607650001301629650002401642650001001666650001101676650001801687650002401705650001001729650005201739700001801791773014501809856005501954852000902009655001202018IND60549806720221120025245.0160909e20160225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054980672DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1110.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Haiyan12aA pear 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase gene preferentially expressed in leaves  ap. 113-120.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC2014): International Symposium on Molecular Biology in Horticulture held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  a1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase (ACS) catalyzes the conversion of S-adenosyl-L-methionine to ACC in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway. A cDNA clone encoding a putative ACS protein was isolated from a cDNA library produced using mRNA from pear (Pyrus pyrifolia). The cDNA clone, designated PpACS (GenBank accession No. JQ284383), comprised an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,341 bp encoding a protein of 446 amino acids that shares high similarity with the known plant ACSs. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the PpACS gene was preferentially expressed in pear leaves. The transcript of PpACS gene was accumulated at relatively high levels in anthers. Expression was detected in shoot at relatively low levels, but was not detected in fruit of pear. These results suggested that the PpACS may participate in the regulation of ethylene production in pear leaves and anthers. 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aPyrus pyrifolia 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3aanthers 3abiochemical pathways 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3agenes 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3aopen reading frames 3apears 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction1 aZhang, Yuxing0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Feb. 25, , no. 1110 p.113-120dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1110.17  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003400131040001800165100001700183245010500200300002000305506007600325520125400401506003701655650001401692650001901706650001401725650001801739650002501757650002201782650002501804650002501829650001101854650002301865650001501888650001901903650001201922650002501934650002401959650001201983650002401995650003102019650002502050650002802075650002402103650002502127653001502152653002402167653002802191653002202219653002402241653002902265653001902294700001902313700001502332700001702347700001402364773014502378852000902523856008402532930003302616945001302649946001302662655001202675IND2206174920221207132413.0000802e19991221dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220617492DNAL7 a106113802pmid7 aPMC248152pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.96.26.153042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarden, J.H.10aAlternative splicing, muscle calcium sensitivity, and the modulation of dragonfly flight performance  ap. 15304-15309.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCalcium sensitivity of myosin cross-bridge activation in striated muscles commonly varies during ontogeny and in response to alterations in muscle usage, but the consequences for whole-organism physiology are not well known. Here we show that the relative abundances of alternatively spliced transcripts of the calcium regulatory protein troponin T (TnT) vary widely in flight muscle of Libellula pulchella dragonflies, and that the mixture of TnT splice variants explains significant portions of the variation in muscle calcium sensitivity, wing-beat frequency, and an index of aerodynamic power output during free flight. Two size-distinguishable morphs differ in their maturational pattern of TnT splicing, yet they show the same relationship between TnT transcript mixture and calcium sensitivity and between calcium sensitivity and aerodynamic power output. This consistency of effect in different developmental and physiological contexts strengthens the hypothesis that TnT isoform variation modulates muscle calcium sensitivity and whole-organism locomotor performance. Modulating muscle power output appears to provide the ecologically important ability to operate at different points along a tradeoff between performance and energetic cost.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLibellula 3aflight muscles 3atroponins 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aflight 3amuscle contraction 3ametabolism 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 2aAlternative Splicing 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aFlight, Animalxphysiology 2aInsectaxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMusclesxphysiology 2aTroponin Txgenetics 0aregulation 0alibellula pulchella 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af1335221 0awing beat frequency 0aaerodynamic power output 0ametabolic rate1 aFitzhugh, G.H.1 aWolf, M.R.1 aArnold, K.D.1 aRowan, B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1999 Dec. 21, v. 96, no. 26 p.15304-15309x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.96.26.153043Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03009naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012300186300001600309520152500325650001401850650002401864650001201888650001801900650001101918650002301929650002301952650000901975650002501984650001102009650000902020650002802029650002102057650002302078650003502101653001302136653001402149653002102163653002002184653001002204700002302214700001902237773010902256852000902365856008502374930003302459946001102492655001202503IND4437790120221123025934.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443779012DNAL7 a203836342pmid7 a10.1007/s00251-010-0443-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReimer, Jenny M. 10aHigh degree of conservation of the multigene tryptase locus over the past 150-200 million years of mammalian evolution  ap. 369-382.  aActivated mast cells release a number of potent inflammatory mediators including histamine, proteoglycans, cytokines, and serine proteases. The proteases constitute the majority of the mast cell granule proteins, and they belong to either the chymase or the tryptase family. In mammals, these enzymes are encoded by two different loci, the mast cell chymase and the multigene tryptase loci. In mice and humans, a relatively large number of tryptic enzymes are encoded from the latter locus. These enzymes can be grouped into two subfamilies, the group 1 tryptases, with primarily membrane-anchored enzymes, and the group 2 tryptases, consisting of the soluble mast cell tryptases. In order to study the appearance of these enzymes during vertebrate evolution, we have analyzed the dog, cattle, opossum, and platypus genomes and sought orthologues in the genomes of several bird, frog, and fish species as well. Our results show that the overall structure and the number of genes within this locus have been well conserved from marsupial to placental mammals. In addition, two relatively distantly related group 2 tryptase genes and several direct homologues of some of the group 1 genes are present in the genome of the platypus, a monotreme. However, no direct homologues of the individual genes of either group 1 or 2 enzymes were identified in bird, amphibian, or fish genomes. Our results indicate that the individual genes within the multigene tryptase locus, in their present form, are essentially mammal-specific. 3aevolution 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDogs 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOpossumsxgenetics 2aTryptasesxanalysisxgenetics. 0aTryptase 0aMast cell 0aGranule protease 0aSerine protease 0aLocus1 aSamollow, Paul B. 1 aHellman, Lars 0 tImmunogenetics.g2010 June, v. 62, no. 6 p.369-382dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0093-77117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00251-010-0443-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03013naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245010500192300001600297520139300313650001901706650001301725650001901738650001701757650001401774650001001788650003101798650007801829650003201907650001101939650001101950650006001961650000902021650002802030650001602058650001702074651001302091651002802104653002502132653002302157653001502180653001802195700002802213773011602241852000902357856008502366930003302451946001102484655001202495IND4437488920221123025856.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443748892DNAL7 a201865712pmid7 a10.1007/s11096-010-9373-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPongwecharak, Juraporn 10aScreening for pre-hypertension and elevated cardiovascular risk factors in a Thai community pharmacy  ap. 329-333.  aObjectives To identify subjects with pre-hypertension and elevated cardiovascular risk factors in a community pharmacy and to assess their readiness to adopt lifestyle changes. Setting An accredited community pharmacy in Songkla province, Thailand. Method Subjects aged ≥ 35 years old and reporting no hypertension or other cardiovascular disease were included. Blood pressure was measured using the Microlife BP 3AC1-1. Those with pre-hypertension or hypertension defined by the JNC 7, and reporting no diabetes and/or dyslipidemia, were checked for blood glucose and/or total cholesterol with the Accutrend GCT monitor. Other risk factors were collected. Their readiness to adopt healthy lifestyles was evaluated. Main outcome measure The prevalence of pre-hypertension and elevated cardiovascular risk factors. Results 350 subjects met the study criteria. Approximately 36 and 29% were pre-hypertensive and hypertensive, respectively. Two of these had blood glucose > 200 mg/dl but about 47% had total cholesterol > 200 mg/dl. Most common modifiable cardiovascular risks were inadequate exercise and elevated body mass index (~52% each). Almost 40% were ready to adopt healthy lifestyles within 1-6 months. Conclusion Subjects at risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease can be identified by community pharmacists, with the use of point-of-care devices and careful interview. 3ablood pressure 3adiabetes 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3ascreening 2aAdult 2aBlood Pressurexphysiology 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxetiologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aCommunity Pharmacy Services 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMass Screeningxmethods 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 3aThailand 0aThailandxepidemiology. 0aCardiovascular risks 0aCommunity pharmacy 0aPharmacist 0aPoint-of-care1 aTreeranurat, Tarakamon 0 tPharmacy world & science.g2010 June, v. 32, no. 3 p.329-333dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0928-12317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11096-010-9373-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02377naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245022900161300001800390520087300408650002101281650002501302650001501327650002601342650001501368650002401383650002101407650001201428650001801440650002901458653005101487653002601538653003101564700001901595700001601614700001901630700001801649700002001667773010601687852000901793856008501802930003301887946001101920655001201931IND4437408120221123030017.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443740812DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-010-1572-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNan, Yefei 10aDetermination of Jasminoidin in Rabbit Plasma for the Pharmacokinetic Investigation after Single Dose Oral Administration of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis and Gardenia jasminoides Ellis Coupling Coptis chinensis Franch Extracts  ap. 1031-1037.  aA simple, sensitive and rapid method for the analysis of jasminoidin in rabbit plasma by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry was developed.

Though its effect on pain has been well studied, it is not clear how it affects the articular cartilage. This is a preliminary study to evaluate the kinetics of urinary collagen type-II C-telopeptide (CTX-II) as a biomarker of collagen breakdown in response to intra-articular hyaluronic acid injection in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Intra-articular injections of hyaluronan were administered to ten patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Urine collection for urinary CTX-II was obtained at baseline, before each injection and once every other week for a total of 6 months. Urine CTX-II was measured using a CartiLaps© ELISA kit. There was a statistically significant increase (p = 0.0136) in CTX-II a week after the third intra-articular injection of hyaluronic acid (6,216 ng/mmol ± 4,428) compared with baseline (2,233 ng/mmol ± 1,220). This increase in CTX-II was sustained throughout the entire 6 months follow-up period (repeated measures ANOVA, p < 0.015). This is the first study of changes in an osteoarthritis biomarker after intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. Contrary to our initial hypothesis that CTX-II levels should decrease after intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections, we found a significant increase in urinary CTX-II levels that was sustained throughout the study. These observations suggest that intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections may accelerate cartilage breakdown in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. The responsible mechanisms are unknown and warrant further study. 3ahyaluronic acid 3aosteoarthritis 2aAged 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBiomarkersxurine. 2aCartilage, Articularxmetabolism 2aCollagen Type IIxurine 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHyaluronic Acidxtherapeutic use 2aInjections, Intra-Articular 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOsteoarthritis, Kneexmetabolismxtherapy. 2aPatient Selection 2aPilot Projects 0aCollagen type-II C-telopeptide 0aKnee1 aGreen, David M. 1 aRossen, Roger D. 1 aNg, Bernard 0 tClinical rheumatology.g2010 June, v. 29, no. 6 p.619-624dLondon : Springer-Verlagx0770-31987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10067-010-1376-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03678naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002400186245012200210300001600332520155100348650002101899650001401920650001401934650005501948650002302003650002502026650004002051650007302091650002102164650003702185650001802222650004902240650001102289650002502300650001102325650007002336650004402406650007802450650002102528650003102549650003402580650003802614650001702652653001602669653002002685653000902705700002802714700002202742700002402764700002102788773011702809852000902926856008502935930003303020946001103053655001203064IND4438799820221123025839.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443879982DNAL7 a198210252pmid7 aPMC34623462pmcid7 a10.1007/s10549-009-0571-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurrow, Lyndsay M. 10aIdentification of WEE1 as a potential molecular target in cancer cells by RNAi screening of the human tyrosine kinome  ap. 347-357.  aBreast cancers can be classified into those that express the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors, those with ERBB2 (HER-2/Neu) amplification, and those without expression of ER, PR, or amplification of ERBB2 (referred to as triple-negative or basal-like breast cancer). In order to identify potential molecular targets in breast cancer, we performed a synthetic siRNA-mediated RNAi screen of the human tyrosine kinome. A primary RNAi screen conducted in the triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231 followed by secondary RNAi screens and further studies in this cell line and two additional triple-negative/basal-like breast cancer cell lines, BT20 and HCC1937, identified the G2/M checkpoint protein, WEE1, as a potential therapeutic target. Similar sensitivity to WEE1 inhibition was observed in cell lines from all subtypes of breast cancer. RNAi-mediated silencing or small compound inhibition of WEE1 in breast cancer cell lines resulted in an increase in γH2AX levels, arrest in the S-phase of the cell cycle, and a significant decrease in cell proliferation. WEE1-inhibited cells underwent apoptosis as demonstrated by positive Annexin V staining, increased sub-G1 DNA content, apoptotic morphology, caspase activation, and rescue by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK. In contrast, the non-transformed mammary epithelial cell line, MCF10A, did not exhibit any of these downstream effects following WEE1 silencing or inhibition. These results identify WEE1 as a potential molecular target in breast cancer. 3abreast neoplasms 3aapoptosis 2aApoptosis 2aBreast Neoplasmsxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aCaspase Inhibitors 2aCaspasesxmetabolism 2aCell Cyclexdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Survival 2aCysteine Proteinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aNuclear Proteinsxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinase Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aProtein-Tyrosine Kinasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA Interference 2aReceptor, ErbB-2xanalysis 2aReceptors, Estrogenxanalysis 2aReceptors, Progesteronexanalysis 2aTime Factors 0aRNAi screen 0aTyrosine kinase 0aWEE11 aGarimella, Sireesha V. 1 aJones, Tamara L. 1 aCaplen, Natasha J. 1 aLipkowitz, Stan.0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2010 July, v. 122, no. 2 p.347-357dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-009-0571-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04495naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001900164245006800183300001600251500001500267520305700282650001903339650001703358650000903375650001203384650002903396650001403425650002803439650003203467650001103499650002803510650002703538650001903565650002503584650001003609650002403619653001403643653001803657700001903675700001703694700001603711773009803727852000903825856008603834939003303920946001303953990002303966655001203989IND9305117820221121054153.0930830e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930511782DNAL7 a84529252pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod48.3.4952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrannian, J.D.10aIsolation of ovine luteal cell subpopulations by flow cytometry  ap. 495-502.  a2019-12-04  aDifferences in the characteristics of small and large luteal cells, as reported by various laboratories, may be due to species diversity and/or methodological differences in cell preparation. To evaluate whether the method of cell separation affects the properties of luteal cell subpopulations, we sorted and characterized sheep luteal cells by flow cytometry via methods previously used to investigate luteal cell subtypes from the macaque corpus luteum. Corpora lutea were obtained from superovulated ewes on Day 10 after hCG injection and enzymatically dissociated. Dispersed cells were shipped overnight on ice from the University of Arizona to the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center. Viability of cells upon arrival was greater than or equal to 80%. When dispersed cells were analyzed by flow cytometry based on forward and 90 degree light scatter, three distinct subpopulations (P1, P2, P3) were identified. In P1, 35.5 +/- 2.1% of cells, most (97.0 +/- 0.6%; n = 3) of which were 15-22 micrometers in diameter, stained positive (+) for 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) activity. The remainder of P1 cells were 3 beta-HSD negative and less than or equal to 22 micrometers. The size distribution of P2 was similar to that of P1, but P2 contained more (53.3 +/- 4.2%; n = 4) 3 beta-HSD (+) cells. P3 consisted mostly (88.5 +/- 4.6%; n = 3) of 3 beta-HSD (+) cells > 25 micrometers in diameter. Cell subpopulations were incubated (n = 6) at 37 degrees C for 3 h with or without hCG (0.1-100 ng/ml), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2; 500 ng/ml), or dibutyryl (db)-cAMP (5 mM). Unstimulated progesterone (P) production by P3 (large) cells (41.6 +/- 10.9 ng/ml/10(4) cells/3 h) was nearly 10-fold greater (p < 0.05) than that by P2 (small) cells (4.6 +/- 1.0 ng/ml/10(4) cells/3 h). Secretion of P by small cells was increased (p < 0.05) greater than or equal to 10-fold by hCG (1-100 ng/ml) and db-cAMP. Conversely, hCG (10-100 ng/ml) slightly stimulated (1.5-fold; p < 0.05) P production by large cells, whereas db-cAMP caused a greater (approximately 2-fold; p < 0.05) increase. PGE2 modestly elevated (approximately 2-fold; p < 0.05) P secretion in small but not in large cells. The small P1 cells were steroidogenically similar to P2 cells. In summary, data on the size distribution, steroidogenic activity, and agonist sensitivity of ovine small and large luteal cells isolated by flow cytometry were, for the most part, similar to previously published data obtained from sheep cells separated by elutriation. However, the isolation, based on light scatter, of two subpopulations containing steroidogenic cells less than or equal to 25 micrometers suggests the existence of subtypes of small luteal cells. We conclude that the reported differences in the characteristics of luteal cell subpopulations from the sheep and macaque are due primarily to interspecies variation rather than to methodological differences in cell preparation. Furthermore, flow cytometry may be useful in identifying additional subtypes of ovine luteal cells. 3aflow cytometry 3aluteal cells 3aewes 2aAnimals 2aCell Separationxmethods 2aCell Size 2aCorpus Luteumxcytology 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometryxmethods 2aLuteal Cellsxcytology 2aMacaca mulatta 2aMicroscopy, Electron 2aSheep 2aSpecies Specificity 0aisolation 0acorpus luteum1 aStouffer, R.L.1 aShiigi, S.M.1 aHoyer, P.B.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1993 Mar., v. 48, no. 3 p.495-502wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod48.3.4953Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02771naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001500146245018900161300001600350500001500366520148000381650002201861650001701883650001701900650002401917650002801941650000901969650001901978653001301997653001802010700001502028700001802043700002202061700001602083773009802099852000902197856008602206939003302292946001302325990002302338655001202361IND9305118220221121054156.0930830e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930511822DNAL7 a10.1095/biolreprod48.3.6622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFitz, T.A.10aEffects of individual and combined treatment with prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha on progestrone secretion by ovine luteal cells supplemented with homologous serum lipoproteins in vitro  ap. 662-668.  a2019-12-04  aProstaglandin F2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)) is a potent luteolysin, whereas prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is generally luteotropic in vivo. To establish a model system for investigations of the mechanisms involved in these actions, we examined the effects of individual and combined treatment with PGE2 and PGF(2 alpha) on basal and ovine LH-stimulated progesterone secretion during long-term incubations conducted with and without supplemental homologous low-density lipoprotein (LDL) as substrate. Effects of both PGE2 and PGF(2 alpha) were concentration- and time-dependent and were further influenced by the presence of LDL and/or LH in medium. Neither of the prostaglandins exerted any significant effect before 48 h in culture, but distinctly different patterns of response to PGE2 and PGF(2 alpha) emerged thereafter. Low, but not high, concentrations of PGE2 increased progesterone secretion in the absence of LH, whereas PGF(2 alpha) (alone and in combination with PGE2) inhibited progesterone production in all medium formulations. The transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin effectively blocked the actions of PGF(2 alpha) but had no effect on response to LH or PGE2. These data demonstrate that both the putative luteotropic actions of PGE2 and the potent, luteolytic effects of PGF(2 alpha) in vivo can be reproduced in long-term cultures of ovine luteal cells in vitro, and they suggest that the mechanism of PGF(2 alpha)-induced luteolysis may involve new protein synthesis. 3ahormone secretion 3aluteal cells 3aprogesterone 3aluteinizing hormone 3alow density lipoprotein 3aewes 3aprostaglandins 0ain vitro 0acorpus luteum1 aMarr, M.M.1 aContois, D.F.1 aRexroad, C.E.

IND200357579 in which the volume and issue were inadvertently left off.  a2019-12-04  aAsparaginyl endopeptidase was highly purified from mature seeds of the jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis). The final enzyme preparation showed a single peak in high-performance liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column, and the material in the peak gave the following NH2-terminal amino acid sequence on Edman degradation for 25 cycles: H-Glu-Val-Gly-Thr -Arg-Trp-Ala-Val-Leu-Val-Ala-Gly-Ser-Asn-Gly-Tyr -Gly-Asn-Tyr-Arg-His-Gln-Ala-Asp-Val-. Behavior of the enzyme toward various protease inhibitors suggested that it belongs to a family of cysteine proteases. Strict substrate specificity of this enzyme was verified by the use of 14 polypeptide substrates including those derived from proteins. Almost all the peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of Asn residues were susceptible to the enzyme. The exceptions were cases where the residue was at the NH2 terminus or the second position from the NH2 terminus of substrates and where it was N-glycosylated Asn. Peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of any other amino acid residues were not cleaved. These properties promise the high utility of this novel endopeptidase in protein sequence analysis. Identity of jack bean asparaginyl endopeptidase with a processing enzyme responsible for maturation of concanavalin A from its precursor is also discussed. 3apolypeptides 3aCanavalia ensiformis 3aamino acid sequences 3ahydrolysis 3aenzyme activity 3acysteine proteinases 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChromatography, Affinity 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aHormonesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aKinetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteins 2aProtease Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aProteinsxgenetics 2aSeedsxenzymology 2aSubstrate Specificity 0aprotein sequencing 0agenbank/l05515 0amolecular sequence data 0apeptidases 0aprotein analysis1 aShirane, K.1 aYokosawa, H.1 aMatsushita, H.1 aMitta, M.1 aKato, I.1 aIshii, S.I.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1993 Feb. 15, v. 268, no. 5 p.3525-3529x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02398naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009600126300001600222500001500238520149100253650001501744650001201759650002301771650001401794650002701808651001501835653001001850700001701860773012701877852000902004930003302013945001302046946001302059655001202072IND2035757620221121050008.0931109e199301  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203575762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, D.P.10aWater-holding characteristics of weathered granitic rock in Chaparral and forest ecosystems  ap. 256-261.  a2019-12-04  aMany chaparral and conifer species in California have root systems that penetrate to > 6 m below the lower boundary of soil into fractured bedrock. Because soils in these ecosystems often are coarse textured, shallow, and extremely dry during much of the year, the underlying weathered rock is a potentially important source of plant-available water. We measured the water retention characteristics of weathered granite rocks from the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mountains to assess their capacity to hold plant-available water. Rock samples were segregated by weathering class (WC), ranging from WC 2 (very weakly weathered) to WC 6 (well weathered). After saturating the samples on a wet sand table, volumetric water contents at potentials to -1500 J/kg were determined using a pressure plate apparatus. Vapor equilibration was used to evaluate volumetric water contents at -5000 J/kg. Available water capacity (AWC) was considered to be the water retained between matric potentials of -10 and -1500 J/kg. Rocks in WC 2 to 4 (cannot be broken by hand) had AWCs of approximately 0.01 m3/m3, while rocks in WC 5 and 6 (can be broken in bare hands) had mean AWCs of 0.04 and 0.07 m3/m3, respectively. Soils in the area have similar AWCs, but are often < 0.3 m thick, while the zone of weathered rock is generally several meters thick. Thus, weathered rock mantle is often capable of holding more water within a matric potential range accessible to plants than are the overlying soils. 3aweathering 3agranite 3aconiferous forests 3achaparral 3awater holding capacity 3aCalifornia 0arocks1 aGraham, R.C.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1993 , v. 57, no. 1 p.256-261aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03338naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001700164245013800181300001600319520181900335650001202154650002102166650001402187650001502201650002402216650001202240650003102252650001102283650002002294650001802314650001102332650002602343650002402369650003802393650006102431650002602492650001702518653001502535653001302550700001902563773009802582852000902680856008602689939003302775946001302808990002302821655001202844IND9304697920221121010828.0930809e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930469792DNAL7 a84852462pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod48.4.8152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuelke, K.A.10aIncreased glutamine metabolism in bovine cumulus cell-enclosed and denuded oocytes after in vitro maturation with luteinizing hormone  ap. 815-820.  aThe effects of LH on tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity within denuded and cumulus cell-enclosed bovine oocytes were investigated by measuring the metabolism L-[14C(U)]glutamine and [2-14C]pyruvate to 14CO2 after in vitro maturation (IVM) with LH in serum-free, defined culture conditions. Initially, intact cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes or oocytectomized cumulus cell complexes were incubated for 24 h for IVM in control medium alone or supplemented with LH (10 microgram/ml) before assessment of glutamine metabolism. Glutamine oxidation was increased (p < 0.01) only after IVM of intact cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes with LH when compared to either intact untreated controls, untreated oocytectomized controls, or oocytectomized cumulus cell complexes after LH treatment (0.23 +/- 0.02 vs, 0.13 +/- 0.01, 0.12 +/- 0.01, and 0.12 +/- 0.01 nmol 14CO2/microgram protein/3 h, respectively). Glutamine metabolism was greater (p < 0.001) in denuded oocytes from cumulus cell complexes that were exposed to LH during IVM versus nontreated controls (6.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.1 +/- 0.2 pmol 14CO2/oocyte/3 h, respectively). Glutamine metabolism was increased (p < 0.05) in cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes after LH exposure during IVM but was unchanged after exposure to either FSH or thyroid-stimulating hormone when compared to control treatments (0.23 +/- 0.01, 0.20 +/- 0.02, 0.19 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.16 +/- 0.02 nmol 14CO2/microgram protein/3 h, respectively). Pyruvate metabolism was not different between LH and control treatments. Evidence demonstrated that LH acts via the cumulus cells to increase glutamine metabolism within intact cumulus cell-enclosed oocytes and in mature oocytes denuded after LH exposure. It is likely that this represents a means by which LH enhances oocyte quality during the maturation process. 3aBovidae 3acumulus oophorus 3aglutamine 3ametabolism 3aluteinizing hormone 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCell Separation 2aCulture Media 2aFemale 2aGlutaminexmetabolism 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLuteinizing Hormonexpharmacology 2aOocytesxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPyruvatesxmetabolism 2aPyruvic Acid 0amaturation 0ain vitro1 aBrackett, B.G.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1993 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.815-820wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod48.4.8153Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle04365naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001800164245011700182300001600299520267800315650001002993650002503003650001103028650001803039650002203057650001403079650001203093650002103105650007403126650007703200650001103277650002303288650007303311650002903384650002503413650003903438650001003477650001703487650006003504700001603564700001703580773009803597852000903695856008603704939003303790946001303823990002303836655001203859IND9304697620221121010443.0930809e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930469762DNAL7 a84852382pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod48.4.7412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpencer, T.E.10aNeonatal age and period of estrogen exposure affect porcine uterine growth, morphogenesis, and protein synthesis  ap. 741-751.  aTo determine whether neonatal age and estrogen exposure affect uterine growth, morphogenesis, and protein synthesis, crossbred gilts were randomly assigned at birth (Day 0) to receive either corn oil vehicle (CO) or estradiol-17 beta valerate (EV; 50 micrograms/kg BW/day). Gilts were treated for 7 days, chosen to coincide with specific periods of uterine development, prior to hysterectomy on Day 7, 14, or 49. Uteri were weighed, and tissues were fixed for histology or explanted with L-4,5-[3H]leucine (3H-leu) for 24 h. Endometrial and myometrial thicknesses were measured in uterine wall cross sections. Radiolabeled proteins produced by uterine wall tissues from 3H-leu and released into explant medium were identified by fluorography of two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins for which fluorographic spot intensities were consistently affected by age and/or treatment were excised from gels, and associated radioactivity was quantified. Normal growth and histogenesis were observed in uteri from CO-treated gilts. Exposure to EV increased (p < 0.01) uterine wet weight on all days examined, although effects were most pronounced on Day 49 (day X treatment, p < 0.01). Histologically, uteri of EV-treated gilts exhibited precocious or altered patterns of development of endometrial glands and folds. Endometrial thickness was greater (p < 0.01) in EV-treated gilts, and response was most pronounced on Day 49 (day X treatment, p < 0.01). Treatment with EV increased (p < 0.01) myometrial thickness on Day 49 only. Twenty-five uterine proteins were identified to be affected consistently by neonatal age, EV, or both. Production of four of these proteins was affected by age alone, while six were affected exclusively by treatment with EV alone, and 15 were affected differentially by both age and EV. Treatment with EV affected production of three of these 25 proteins on Day 7, 8 of 25 on Day 14, and 14 of 25 on Day 49. Results indicate that uterine growth and development of the porcine uterine wall during early neonatal life are accompanied by predictable alterations in patterns of uterine protein synthesis. Data also demonstrate that the neonatal porcine uterus is estrogen-sensitive and that both physical and biochemical responses of uterine tissues to estrogen vary with period of exposure. It is suggested that EV may be useful as a tool with which to induce developmental lesions in neonatal porcine uterine tissues. Identification of EV-induced lesions in adult uterine tissues and of the neonatal periods associated with their induction will represent an important step toward identification of developmental determinants of porcine uterine capacity. 3aswine 3aneonatal development 3auterus 3amorphogenesis 3aprotein synthesis 3aestradiol 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aEndometriumxanatomy & histologyxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aEstradiolxadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacology. 2aFemale 2aMuscle Development 2aMyometriumxanatomy & histologyxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aProteinsxisolation & purification 2aSwine 2aTime Factors 2aUterusxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aWiley, A.A.1 aBartol, F.F.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1993 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.741-751wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod48.4.7413Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02196naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005500129300001600184520130000200650001701500650001901517650002301536650001501559650001501574650001501589651001301604700001601617700001601633700001401649773012701663852000901790930003301799945001301832946001301845655001201858IND2035756820221121010453.0931109e199301  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203575682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrubaker, S.C.10aSoil properties associated with landscape position  ap. 235-239.  aYield differences among landscape positions have been attributed to soil erosion and differences in plant-available water, soil texture, bulk density, and surface soil thickness. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which soil chemical properties and soil texture varied among landscape positions. Soil samples were taken to a depth of 120 cm from the upper interfluve, lower interfluve, shoulder, upper linear, lower linear, and footslope positions at each of four sites located in eastern Nebraska. Significant differences among landscape positions were found for 13 soil properties. Sand, silt, pH, CaCO3, extractable Ca and Mg, exchangeable Ca, and base saturation generally increased downslope, while clay, organic matter, cation-exchange capacity, and available K generally decreased downslope. Highest concentrations of available K occurred on the upper interfluve, lower interfluve, and footslope; lowest concentrations were found on the upper and lower linear slopes. Management practices appear to have influenced pH, electrical conductivity, available P and K, and exchangeable K, particularly in the upper 30 cm. Drought conditions during the 1988 growing season resulted in carryover of NO3-N in the upper 30 cm. Nitrate-N in 1990 was leached to deeper depths. 3asoil texture 3asoil chemistry 3asoil heterogeneity 3atopography 3asoil depth 3alandscapes 3aNebraska1 aJones, A.J.1 aLewis, D.T.1 aFrank, K.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1993 , v. 57, no. 1 p.235-239aSoil Science Society of America.x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03507naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100002400164245009900188300001600287520178800303650001202091650001302103650001402116650001802130650001402148650001702162650001202179650002102191650003302212650003002245650003702275650002802312650001102340650003702351650002402388650003602412650002102448650002502469650003102494650002402525650002602549650001702575650005802592650002602650700001502676773009802691852000902789856008602798939003302884946001302917990002302930655001202953IND9303337720221121003655.0930601e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930333772DNAL7 a84396292pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod48.2.4032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcinkiewicz, J.L.10aIdentification and preliminary characterization of luteotropic activity in the rabbit placenta  ap. 403-408.  aThe corpus luteum of the rabbit requires estradiol (E2) and the conceptus to maintain progesterone (P4) during the second half of pregnancy. The factor produced by the fetal placenta that is responsible for maintaining P4 production has not yet been identified. Therefore, the goal of these experiments was to determine whether the rabbit placenta contained luteotropic activity and to begin preliminary characterization of this factor. A bioassay system utilizing corpora lutea explants incubated with placental extracts and other treatments was developed and validated. Neither pooled placental extracts (200 microgram) nor E2 alone affected P4 production (p > 0.05). However, the combination of placental extracts plus E2 significantly stimulated P4 production approximately 1.5-fold (p < 0.05). Skeletal muscle (200 microgram) + E2 also had no effect on P4 production, indicating that the effect of placental extracts was tissue-specific. Carboxymethyl-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography of placental extracts yielded four separate fractions, which were examined individually at three doses for activity in the bioassay system. The first and most acidic fraction (Fraction 1) significantly stimulated P4 production at 10 and 100 microgram when incubated in combination with E2 (p < 0.05). Both heat and trypsin treatment abolished the ability of placental Fraction 1 to stimulate P4 production in the presence of E2. Size fractionation of Fraction 1 using dialysis membranes with 3500, 6000-8000, and 12000-14000 molecular weight cutoff points had no effect on bioactivity of Fraction 1. These results indicate that the rabbit placenta contains a potential luteotropin with the characteristics of an acidic, heat-sensitive protein greater than 12000-14000 in molecular weight. 3arabbits 3aplacenta 3aprolactin 3acorpus luteum 3aestradiol 3aprogesterone 2aAnimals 2aBiological Assay 2aChromatography, Ion Exchange 2aCorpus Luteumxmetabolism 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aHot Temperaturexadverse effects 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aLuteinizing Hormonexphysiology 2aMolecular Weight 2aPlacentaxphysiology 2aProgesteronexbiosynthesis 2aRabbitsxphysiology 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aTissue Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aTrypsinxpharmacology1 aBahr, J.M.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1993 Feb., v. 48, no. 2 p.403-408wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod48.2.4033Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03296naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245013000204300001800334506007600352520153800428506003701966650001702003650002002020650001102040650002002051650001002071650001602081650001402097650001002111650000902121650001002130650001302140650002002153650002302173650002502196650002002221650001602241651003702257700002402294700002502318700001902343700002002362700002502382700002302407773017402430852000902604856008302613939003302696946001302729655001202742IND4459132920221207121904.0110617e20110614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445913292DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10185021082doi7 aPMC31164042pmcid7 a216285642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOelze, Vicky M.10aExploring the contribution and significance of animal protein in the diet of bonobos by stable isotope ratio analysis of hair  ap. 9792-9797.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn primates, age, sex, and social status can strongly influence access to food resources. In Pan, these criteria are assumed to influence access to vertebrate meat. However, the significance of meat in terms of its role in the nutrition of Pan is still debated. Here we present a study using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in hair samples from habituated, wild bonobos (Pan paniscus) to explore these issues. Over a period of 5 mo hair samples were collected from fresh bonobo nests at LuiKotale, Democratic Republic of Congo. Hair samples were assigned to known individuals and were of sufficient length to allow the evaluation of isotopic variation over several months. Samples of plant foods and sympatric fauna were also analyzed. The δ¹³C and δ¹⁵N results of the bonobo hair were remarkably homogeneous over time and for the group as a whole. There are no differences in diet between the sexes. Within the group of males, however, there was a positive correlation between dominance status and δ¹⁵N. The isotopic data indicate that the contribution of fauna to bonobo diet is marginal and that plant food is the dietary protein source. In only some cases did elevated δ¹⁵N hair values correlate with observed faunivory and not correspond to the δ¹⁵N measured in the dominant plant foods. Given the large variation in hunting and meat eating of Pan across the African continent, the detection of seasonal changes in faunivory by elevated δ¹⁵N values in sectioned ape hair is a promising approach.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPan paniscus 3aanimal proteins 3acarbon 3adietary protein 3afauna 3afood plants 3aingestion 3amales 3ameat 3anests 3anitrogen 3aprotein sources 3aseasonal variation 3asocioeconomic status 3astable isotopes 3avertebrates 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo1 aFuller, Benjamin T.1 aRichards, Michael P.1 aFruth, Barbara1 aSurbeck, Martin1 aHublin, Jean-Jacques1 aHohmann, Gottfried0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 14, v. 108, no. 24 p.9792-9797dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10185021083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110617  aOther US 7aarticle03805naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245013800201300001800339506007600357520186400433506003702297650002602334650001002360650002102370650001802391650002202409650002102431650001102452650001202463650001902475650001502494650001402509650001902523650001402542700002102556700002602577700001802603700002202621700002102643700002602664700002102690700001902711700001902730700002202749700002202771700002502793700002002818700002602838700001502864773017402879852000903053856008303062939003303145946001303178655001203191IND4459134220221207132420.0110617e20110614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445913422DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10189271082doi7 aPMC31164362pmcid7 a216285892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Wilson10aMinimal requirements for actin filament disassembly revealed by structural analysis of malaria parasite actin-depolymerizing factor 1  ap. 9869-9874.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMalaria parasite cell motility is a process that is dependent on the dynamic turnover of parasite-derived actin filaments. Despite its central role, actin's polymerization state is controlled by a set of identifiable regulators that is markedly reduced compared with those of other eukaryotic cells. In Plasmodium falciparum, the most virulent species that affects humans, this minimal repertoire includes two members of the actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilin (AC) family of proteins, P. falciparum actin-depolymerizing factor 1 (PfADF1) and P. falciparum actin-depolymerizing factor 2. This essential class of actin regulator is involved in the control of filament dynamics at multiple levels, from monomer binding through to filament depolymerization and severing. Previous biochemical analyses have suggested that PfADF1 sequesters monomeric actin but, unlike most eukaryotic counterparts, has limited potential to bind or depolymerize filaments. The molecular basis for these unusual properties and implications for parasite cell motility have not been established. Here we present the crystal structure of an apicomplexan AC protein, PfADF1. We show that PfADF1 lacks critical residues previously implicated as essential for AC-mediated actin filament binding and disassembly, having a substantially reduced filament-binding loop and C-terminal α4 helix. Despite this divergence in structure, we demonstrate that PfADF1 is capable of efficient actin filament severing. Furthermore, this severing occurs despite PfADF1's low binding affinity for filaments. Comparative structural analysis along with biochemical and microscopy evidence establishes that severing is reliant on the availability of an exposed basic residue in the filament-binding loop, a conserved minimal requirement that defines AC-mediated filament disassembly across eukaryotic cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aactin 3abinding capacity 3acell movement 3acrystal structure 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahumans 3amalaria 3amicrofilaments 3amicroscopy 3aparasites 3apolymerization 3avirulence1 aSkau, Colleen T.1 aMarapana, Danushka S.1 aHanssen, Eric1 aTaylor, Nicole L.1 aRiglar, David T.1 aZuccala, Elizabeth S.1 aAngrisano, Fiona1 aLewis, Heather1 aCatimel, Bruno1 aClarke, Oliver B.1 aKershaw, Nadia J.1 aPerugini, Matthew A.1 aKovar, David R.1 aGulbis, Jacqueline M.1 aBaum, Jake0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 14, v. 108, no. 24 p.9869-9874dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10189271083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110617  aOther US 7aarticle03222naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100003200184245005400216300001800270500001500288506007600303520139900379506003701778650001901815650004401834650002001878650002101898650001101919650002401930650001101954650001101965650002601976650001702002650001602019650000802035650002202043653001802065700002402083700003502107700002202142700002402164700001802188700001802206700001702224700001602241700001802257700002202275700002302297773017402320852000902494856008302503939003302586946001302619655001202632IND4459133720221207132409.0110617e20110614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445913372DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11032701082doi7 aPMC31164142pmcid7 a216135692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Malene Ringkjøbing10aIntrinsic disorder in measles virus nucleocapsids  ap. 9839-9844.  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe genome of measles virus is encapsidated by multiple copies of the nucleoprotein (N), forming helical nucleocapsids of molecular mass approaching 150 Megadalton. The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of N (NTAIL) is essential for transcription and replication of the virus via interaction with the phosphoprotein P of the viral polymerase complex. The molecular recognition element (MoRE) of NTAIL that binds P is situated 90 amino acids from the folded RNA-binding domain (NCORE) of N, raising questions about the functional role of this disordered chain. Here we report the first in situ structural characterization of NTAIL in the context of the entire N-RNA capsid. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, small angle scattering, and electron microscopy, we demonstrate that NTAIL is highly flexible in intact nucleocapsids and that the MoRE is in transient interaction with NCORE. We present a model in which the first 50 disordered amino acids of NTAIL are conformationally restricted as the chain escapes to the outside of the nucleocapsid via the interstitial space between successive NCORE helical turns. The model provides a structural framework for understanding the role of NTAIL in the initiation of viral transcription and replication, placing the flexible MoRE close to the viral RNA and, thus, positioning the polymerase complex in its functional environment.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anucleoproteins 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphoproteins 3amolecular weight 3acapsid 3aelectron microscopy 3agenome 3amodels 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3anucleocapsid 3aamino acids 3aRNA 3avirus replication 0aMeasles virus1 aCommunie, Guillaume1 aRibeiro, Euripedes Almeida Jr.1 aMartinez, Nicolas1 aDesfosses, Ambroise1 aSalmon, Loïc1 aMollica, Luca1 aGabel, Frank1 aJamin, Marc1 aLonghi, Sonia1 aRuigrok, Rob W.H.1 aBlackledge, Martin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 14, v. 108, no. 24 p.9839-9844dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11032701083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110617  aOther US 7aarticle02994naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245015100203300001800354506007600372520148600448506003701934650001501971650002001986650001102006650002402017650003002041650004902071650002302120650002902143650002902172650001902201650001602220700002402236773017402260852000902434856008302443939003302526946001302559655001202572IND4459134520221207132421.0110617e20110614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445913452DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10175481082doi7 aPMC31164372pmcid7 a216285962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwarup, Sharan10aDrosophila homeodomain-interacting protein kinase inhibits the Skp1-Cul1-F-box E3 ligase complex to dually promote Wingless and Hedgehog signaling  ap. 9887-9892.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDrosophila Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (Hipk) has been shown to regulate in vivo, the stability of Armadillo, the transcriptional effector of Wingless signaling. The Wingless pathway culminates in the stabilization of Armadillo that, in the absence of signaling, is sequentially phosphorylated, polyubiquitinated and degraded. Loss-of-function clones for hipk result in reduced stabilized Armadillo, whereas overexpression of hipk elevates Armadillo levels to promote Wingless-responsive target gene expression. Here, we show that overexpression of hipk can suppress the effects of negative regulators of Armadillo to prevent its degradation in the wing imaginal disc. Hipk acts to stabilize Armadillo by impeding the function of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF)Slimb, thereby inhibiting Armadillo ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Vertebrate Hipk2 displays a similar ability to prevent β-catenin ubiquitination in a functionally conserved mechanism. We find that Hipk's ability to inhibit SCFSlimb-mediated ubiquitination is not restricted to Armadillo and extends to other substrates of SCFSlimb, including the Hedgehog signaling effector Ci. Thus, similar to casein kinase 1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3, Hipk dually regulates both Wingless and Hedgehog signaling by controlling the stability of their respective signaling effectors, but it is the first kinase to our knowledge identified that promotes the stability of both Armadillo and Ci.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aadverse effects 3aclones 3agene overexpression 3aloss-of-function mutation 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3atau-protein kinase 3atranscription (genetics) 3aubiquitin-protein ligase 3aubiquitination 3avertebrates1 aVerheyen, Esther M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 14, v. 108, no. 24 p.9887-9892dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10175481083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110617  aOther US 7aarticle02055naa a2200217 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245004300127300001400170500006100184520140300245655002701648773009501675852000901770939003301779946001301812655001201825IND4482838120221120161840.0140701s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448283812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerrish, Jim10aUtilizing forage diversity in pastures  ap. 78-84.  aConference held April 26-30, 2003, Lafayette, Louisiana.  aDiversity in pasture can improve forage yield, yield distribution, quality, and stand persistence compared to mono culture pastures. Diverse pastures may also produce forage dry matter at a lower cost per unit than mono culture pastures. Individual species and specie groups compete for resources at several levels. Plants that respond similarly to available resources are classified into a common functional group. Species within a functional group are generally competitive with one another. Species in separate functional groups may be competitive, non-competitive, or complementary. Functional diversity among the components of a pasture is more important than number of species, per se. The objective of planned pasture diversity is to optimally utilize the environmental resources available across both space and time. Because of the competitive nature among plant species, grazing management to create or maintain diversity can be quite challenging. Species diversification can help extend grazing during periods that may have been slump periods with mono culture pastures. Pasture species diversity has been observed to increase when grazing management has been used to provide canopy management of specific functional groups. Understanding the basis of functional group response to specific environmental and management factors is the key to managing pastures for stable, diverse mixtures. 7aconference publication0 tProceedings.g2003, v. 12 p.78-84aAmerican Forage and Grassland Council.x0886-68997nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20140701  aOther US 7aarticle02749naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001800159245016000177300001600337500002400353520132700377650002101704650002301725650001801748650001101766650001501777650001901792650002601811650001901837650002101856650002101877650001501898650001801913651001101931700001701942700001801959700001401977700001701991773010302008852000902111856009002120930003302210945002502243946001102268655001202279IND4423841220221121192413.0090731e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442384122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2009.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK2501 aSprintsin, M.10aRelationships between stand density and canopy structure in a dryland forest as estimated by ground-based measurements and multi-spectral spaceborne images  ap. 955-962.  aIncludes references  aThis paper describes evaluation of forest stand density combining satellite imagery with forest inventory data set. The degree of canopy cover is described in terms of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) obtained by a linear mixture model applied on multi-spectral IKONOS image and canopy cover (CC). CC was calculated from field measurements of crown width of 646 standing trees sited within 72 circular (200 m2) plots. A comparison between CC and FVC shows that the former can be accurately represented by the latter linking in-situ measured forest characteristics with surface reflectance measured by a satellite. Stand density expressed as an absolute term (number of trees per unit area) showed high and significant positive correlation to FVC (R2 = 0.96) and to relative density measure (Crown Competition Factor; R2 = 0.89). In order to show the applicability of the presented approach for managerial practices, a map of the spatial distribution of stand density within the forest was produced using the above-mentioned correlations. Its quality was verified against an independent data set of ground measurements. The correlation between field- and map-based number of trees per unit area was found to be satisfactory (R2 = 0.4; p < 0.05), even though a slight lack of sensitivity was evident for low-density stands. 3aPinus halepensis 3aconiferous forests 3astand density 3acanopy 3asatellites 3aremote sensing 3amultispectral imagery 3aimage analysis 3aforest inventory 3avegetation cover 3atopography 3athematic maps 3aIsrael1 aKarnieli, A.1 aSprintsin, S.1 aCohen, S.1 aBerliner, P.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2009 Oct., v. 73, no. 10 p.955-962dAcademic Pressx0140-19637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2009.04.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b20091002c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/08/07  aNon-US 7aarticle02269naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245011400157300001600271500002400287520128600311650001001597650001601607650001501623650002501638651001601663653001901679653002201698700002301720700002601743700002001769773009501789852000901884856003801893655001201931IND4439362520221121235129.0100702s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443936252DNAL7 a10.1071/IS090472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCook, Lorraine D.10aStatus of the New Zealand cave weta (Rhaphidophoridae) genera Pachyrhamma, Gymnoplectron and Turbottoplectron  ap. 131-138.  aIncludes references  aThe New Zealand Rhaphidophoridae Walker, 1869 comprise 18 endemic genera (including 8 that are monotypic). Although there are many new species to be described, rationalisation at the genus level is also required due to inconsistencies in their current systematics. Even the largest and best known taxa, including those that occupy cave systems and are the most frequently encountered by people, require taxonomic revision. These cave weta include species assigned to three poorly differentiated genera, Pachyrhamma Brunner v. Wattenwyl, 1888, Gymnoplectron Hutton, 1897 and Turbottoplectron Salmon, 1948, that are best known from North Island New Zealand. We used mitochondrial DNA sequence data to examine their relationships using representatives of each genus. The results indicate that a single genus Pachyrhamma would be appropriate for all, as Gymnoplectron and Turbottoplectron nest phylogenetically within it. There are insufficient morphological, spatial or ecological reasons to justify retention of all three. However, we also note that species level diversity does not correlate with genetic or spatial diversity; some species are genetically well partitioned and widespread while others have narrow ranges in single cave systems and are closely related to one another. 3anests 3anew species 3anew status 3anucleotide sequences 3aNew Zealand 0aphylogeography 0aspecies radiation1 aTrewick, Steven A.1 aMorgan-Richards, Mary1 aJohns, Peter M.0 tInvertebrate systematics.g2010, v. 24, no. 2 p.131-138dCSIRO Publishingx1445-52267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/IS09047 7aarticle01910naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010500172300001600277500002400293520086800317650001501185650001401200650001001214650001401224650001301238650001201251650001901263650001801282700002601300700002001326700002301346773012701369852000901496856005501505655001201560IND4393350520221121234949.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439335052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2007.00139.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGOWEN, AOIFE A.10aCharacteristics of cooked chickpeas and soybeans during combined microwave-convective hot air drying  ap. 433-453.  aIncludes references  aMoisture content, shrinkage, water activity (Aw), color and texture of cooked chickpeas and soybeans during convective, microwave and combined microwave-convective drying were studied.

In progeny with the a2 mating type, mitochondria were almost exclusively (94%) from the a2 parent. 3aUstilago violacea 3amitochondrial DNA 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3agenomics 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aExtrachromosomal Inheritance 2aGenetic Markers 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aReproductionxdrug effects 2aUstilagoxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aVitamin Expharmacology1 aWard, S.1 aCastle, A.0 tCurrent genetics.g1992, v. 22, no. 2 p.135-140x0172-80837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02562naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245008300121300001600204520156100220650004301781650002801824650003101852650002601883650002201909650002801931650001301959650001401972650002801986650001602014650002002030650001302050700001502063773006902078852000902147939003302156946001102189655001202200IND9300155220221121042456.0930108s1992    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930015522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Y.10aCell type determines plastid transmission in tomato intergenic somatic hybrids  ap. 167-171.  aMesophyll (M)- and suspension culture (S)-derived protoplasts of both Lycopersicon esculentum, tomato, and its wild relative Solanum lycopersicoides were fused as S + M, M + M and S + S combinations, respectively, to resolve the role of parental cell types in determining cpDNA transmission to intergeneric somatic hybrid plants. The mesophyll cpDNA was preferentially transmitted to 96% of the plants, each regenerated from a separate callus, in M + S and S + M fusion combinations. In contrast, for the M + M combination there was an equable distribution of either tomato cpDNA or that of S. lycopersicoides among the 34 hybrid plants. The number of plastids or proplastids in mesophyll or suspension protoplasts was not a factor regulating cpDNA transmission. Mesophyll or suspension protoplasts of both fusion partners had comparable frequencies of either plastid type with a mean of 23. The biased transmission of plastids from the mesophyll parent in somatic hybrid plants of S + M and M + S combinations appears to be due to differential multiplication of plastids, possibly conditioned by an unequal input of the nucleoids found in plastids versus proplastids. In the M + M fusion, plastid and nucleotid input and subsequent plastid multiplication are apparently equal, and when combined with random sorting out leads to an equal distribution of parental cpDNAs in the regenerated somatic hybrid plants. For the S + S combination, 22 somatic hybrid plants have exclusively tomato cpDNA, an outcome that is not readily explained by donor cell input. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSolanum lycopersicoides 3aintergeneric hybridization 3asomatic hybridization 3aprotoplast fusion 3acytoplasmic inheritance 3aplastids 3amesophyll 3acell suspension culture 3aprotoplasts 3achloroplast DNA 3agenomics1 aSink, K.C.0 tCurrent genetics.g1992, v. 22, no. 2 p.167-171x0172-80837nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03165naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245012300142300001600265500001500281520100400296650002701300650003501327650001601362650002101378650002101399650002301420650002201443650002501465650002001490650001101510650002501521650001901546650001901565650002101584650001001605650001001615650001801625650001101643650001901654650002401673650001801697650003201715650002301747650000801770650002001778650004101798650002801839650002101867650003201888650002901920650003001949650002401979650003602003650004502039653002802084653001902112653002502131700001702156700001702173700001602190700001502206700001502221700001802236700001902254773008102273852000902354939003302363946001102396655001202407IND9300156320221121042548.0930111e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930015632DNAL7 a14503832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNap, J.P.10aAnalysis of the region in between two closely linked patatin genes: class II promoter activity in tuber, root and leaf  ap. 683-694.  a2019-12-04  aFrom a potato genomic library a phage lambda clone was isolated that carried nucleotide sequences of two patatin genes, thus demonstrating a close physical linkage between these two members of the patatin gene family. Sequence and restriction analysis showed the genes to be oriented in tandem. The more upstream gene was a pseudogene truncated at the 3' end, whereas the downstream gene was a class II patatin gene. In addition to a 208 bp fragment also present in patatin class I promoters, the region in between both genes contained various direct repeats also found in other patatin genes. To study the promoter activity of this intergenic region, a 2.78 kb fragment was transcriptionally fused to the beta-glucuronidase gene and reintroduced into potato cultivar Bintje. Histochemical analysis revealed expression in the outermost layer of cells of the cortex, in the tuber phellogen, in or around the root vascular system, and also in the abaxial phloem layer of the vascular bundle in leaves. 3agenetic transformation 3agenetically modified organisms 3apseudogenes 3apromoter regions 3astructural genes 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atubers 3arepetitive sequences 3ahistochemistry 3areporter genes 3amultigene family 3aexons 3aroots 3aglycoproteins 3aleaves 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCarboxylic Ester Hydrolases 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGlucuronidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOrgan Specificityxgenetics 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSolanum tuberosumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data 0amultiple genes 0anucleotide sequences1 aDirkse, W.G.1 aLouwerse, J.1 aOnstenk, J.1 aVisser, R.1 aLoonen, A.1 aHeidekamp, F.1 aStiekema, W.J.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1992 Nov., v. 20, no. 4 p.683-694x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04193naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182100002200191245012900213300001600342500002400358500001500382520163100397650001902028650000802047650002302055650003002078650001002108650002302118650001602141650001402157650002002171650001802191650001602209650001802225650002402243650002102267650002502288650001702313650001902330650001502349650001002364650001802374650002602392650004602418650002802464650001102492650001102503650004602514650005302560650003402613650000902647650001602656650001502672650002302687650002102710650004502731650005202776650001602828651002502844653001402869700002502883700001902908700001902927700002802946700001802974700001702992700002003009700002003029773011503049852000903164856008503173930003303258945002503291946001103316655001203327IND4423849820221121022433.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442384982DNAL7 a192034202pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145092208242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aGoswami, Ravinder10aPrevalence of vitamin D deficiency and its relationship with thyroid autoimmunity in Asian Indians: a community-based survey  ap. 382-386.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a25-Hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency is linked with predisposition to autoimmune type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Our objective was to assess the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and thyroid autoimmunity. Subjects included students, teachers and staff aged 16-60 years (total 642, 244 males, 398 females). Serum free thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOAb), intact parathyroid hormone and 25(OH)D were measured by electrochemiluminescence and RIA, respectively. Thyroid dysfunction was defined if (1) serum TSH >or= 5 μU/ml and TPOAb>34 IU/ml or (2) TSH >or= 10 μU/ml but normal TPOAb. The mean serum 25(OH)D of the study subjects was 17·5 (sd 10·2) nmol/l with 87 % having values <or= 25 nmol/l. TPOAb positivity was observed in 21 % of subjects. The relationship between 25(OH)D and TPOAb was assessed with and without controlling for age and showed significant inverse correlation (r - 0·08, P = 0·04) when adjusted for age. The prevalence of TPOAb and thyroid dysfunction were comparable between subjects stratified according to serum 25(OH)D into two groups either at cut-off of <or= 25 or >25 nmol/l or first and second tertiles. Serum 25(OH)D values show only weak inverse correlation with TPOAb titres. The presence of such weak association and narrow range of serum 25(OH)D did not allow us to interpret the present results in terms of quantitative cut-off values of serum 25(OH)D. Further studies in vitamin D-sufficient populations with wider range of serum 25(OH)D levels are required to substantiate the findings of the current study. 3ahuman diseases 3amen 3anutritional status 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3awomen 3adisease prevalence 3athyrotropin 3athyroxine 3ahuman nutrition 3aAsian Indians 3aperoxidases 3athyroid gland 3aparathyroid hormone 3athyroid diseases 3avitamin deficiencies 3aautoimmunity 3aautoantibodies 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAsian People. 2aAutoantibodiesxblood 2aAutoimmune Diseasesxbloodxepidemiology. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHyperparathyroidismxbloodxepidemiology. 2aHypothyroidismxbloodxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aIodide Peroxidaseximmunology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrevalence 2aThyrotropinxblood 2aThyroxinexblood 2aVitamin Dxanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aYoung Adult 0aIndiaxepidemiology. 0avitamin D1 aMarwaha, Raman Kumar1 aGupta, Nandita1 aTandon, Nikhil1 aSreenivas, Vishnubhatla1 aTomar, Neeraj1 aRay, Debarti1 aKanwar, Ratnesh1 aAgarwal, Rashmi0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2009 Aug., v. 102, no. 3 p.382-386dCambridge University Pressx0007-11457nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145092208243Available from publisher's Web site  a20090916b20091002c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/08/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03040naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245010800184300001200292500002400304520127900328650002101607650001501628650002101643650002501664650001801689650000901707650001501716650002001731650001601751650005201767650002801819650001201847650004901859650002201908650002901930650002601959650003101985650004702016650000902063650000902072650002102081650003102102650005202133650002202185650002802207700001102235700001302246700001302259700001302272773011302285852000902398856005502407655001202462IND4399951820221121003217.0080113e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439995182DNAL7 a180702392pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00827.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, D.Y.10aExpression and Immunohistochemical Localization of Aquaporin-1 in Male Reproductive Organs of the Mouse  ap. 1-8.  aIncludes references  aAquaporin-1 (AQP-1), a six-transmembrane domain protein, is found to be responsible for water transport. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of AQP-1 mRNA and protein in the testis, epididymis, vas deferens, ventral prostate, and seminal vesicle from mature mice by using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, and the cellular localization of AQP-1 by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR revealed that AQP-1 mRNA was expressed in all organs we examined. Western blotting displayed a 29-kDa band and a 35- to 45-kDa band corresponding to non-glycosylated and/or glycosylated AQP-1 in those organs. The immunohistochemical evidence showed that AQP-1 was mainly located on the plasma membrane of epithelial cells of the rete testis, vas deferens, ventral prostate, seminal vesicle and the non-ciliated cells of the proximal and distal efferent ducts. However, AQP-1 was absent from spermatogenic cells lining the seminiferous epithelium and from the spermatozoa in the lumen of the distal efferent duct. These findings provide valuable information on the expression of AQP-1 in male reproductive organs and suggest that AQP-1 is involved in water transport to regulate water homeostasis in male reproductive physiology. 3aWestern blotting 3aepididymis 3aepithelial cells 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aphysiology 3aplasma membrane 3arete testis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aseminiferous epithelium 2aAnimals 2aAquaporin 1xanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Membranexchemistry 2aEpididymisxchemistry 2aGenitalia, Malexchemistry 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTestisxchemistry 2aVas Deferensxchemistry1 aLi, Y.1 aBi, Z.W.1 aYu, H.M.1 aLi, X.J.0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2008 Feb., v. 37, no. 1 p.1-8dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0340-20967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0264.2007.00827.x 7aarticle02200naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245006200175300001800237500002400255520119400279650002201473650001101495650000901506650002301515650002001538650001801558650002901576650002001605650003401625773011601659852000901775856007801784655001201862IND4397472720221120222025.0071104e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439747272DNAL7 a178984202pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erm2042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLew, Roger R.10aIonic currents and ion fluxes in Neurospora crassa hyphae  ap. 3475-3481.  aIncludes references  aVoltage dependence of ionic currents and ion fluxes in a walled, turgor-regulating cell were measured in Neurospora crassa. The hyphal morphology of the model organism Neurospora simplifies cable analysis of ionic currents to determine current density for quantitative comparisons with ion fluxes. The ion fluxes were measured directly and non-invasively with self-referencing ion-selective microelectrodes. Four ions (H⁺, Ca²⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻) were examined. H⁺ net uptake and Ca²⁺ net release were small (10.2 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹ and 1.1 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹, respectively) and voltage independent. K⁺ and Cl⁻ fluxes were larger and voltage dependent. Maximal K⁺ net release (~1440 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹) was observed at positive voltages (+15 mV), while maximal Cl⁻ net release (~905 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹) was observed at negative voltage (-210 mV). A possible function of the net outward K⁺ and Cl⁻ fluxes is regulation of the plasma membrane potential. Total ion fluxes were 37-58% of the total ionic current density (about ±244 mA m⁻², equivalent to ±2500 nmol m⁻² s⁻¹, at 0 mV and -200 mV) so other ions must contribute significantly to the ionic currents. 3aNeurospora crassa 3ahyphae 3aions 3amembrane potential 3aplasma membrane 2aIon Transport 2aIon-Selective Electrodes 2aMicroelectrodes 2aNeurospora crassaxmetabolism0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2007 Oct., v. 58, no. 12 p.3475-3481dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erm2043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02696naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245012900166300001600295500002400311520134900335650001801684650002101702650002301723650001401746650002101760650002101781650001401802650001501816650001901831650001301850650001401863650001801877650000901895650001301904650000901917650001901926650001701945650001101962651001001973700002201983700002002005700001902025700002102044773008002065852000902145856004802154655001202202IND4415151120221120211255.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441515112DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-008-0263-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKayama, Masazumi10aGrowth characteristics of Sakhalin spruce (Picea glehnii) planted on the northern Japanese hillsides exposed to strong winds  ap. 145-157.  aIncludes references  aSakhalin spruce (Picea glehnii), a native species typically found in northern Japan, has been used in reforestation on hillsides exposed to strong winds. In the reforestation areas, there are south-facing (S-slope) and northwest-facing slopes (NW-slope). Climatic conditions are contrasting between the two slopes, with shallower snow cover on the S-slopes. We compared growth responses of the spruce to micro-environment between the S- and NW-slopes through soil nutrients, needle longevity, water status, photosynthesis, and nutrients in the needles. These parameters were measured in needles exposed above the snow in winter and in lower needles protected by snow cover. High-position needles suffered from drought stress, especially in winter, and needles were shed early in the year on both slopes. Low-position needles did not suffer from drought stress, and maintained a high photosynthetic rate on both slopes. However, needle longevity was reduced on the S-slope, and concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the needles decreased with needle age. Soil nutrient concentrations were low on the S-slope, which suggests that the needles on the S-slope may remobilize nutrients from aged needles to younger needles prior to shedding. This characteristic is probably an adaptation in Sakhalin spruce to poor soil conditions. 3aPicea glehnii 3aclimatic factors 3aindigenous species 3alongevity 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aplanting 3apotassium 3areforestation 3asnow 3asnowpack 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3awater stress 3awinter 3aJapan1 aMakoto, Kobayashi1 aNomura, Mutsumi1 aSasa, Kaichiro1 aKoike, Takayoshi0 tTrees.g2009 Feb., v. 23, no. 1 p.145-157dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-008-0263-2 7aarticle03882naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245015900199300001400358500002400372500001500396506007600411520200500487506003702492650001802529650001102547650003402558650001502592650001102607650002202618650001302640650002002653650001602673650001002689650001102699650002102710650003102731650003902762650003902801650001202840650004502852650001602897650001702913650006002930653001002990700002003000700002003020700002103040700002103061700002503082773009803107852000903205856007803214655001203292IND4459356520221207134959.0110625e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445935652DNAL7 a215620282pmid7 aPMC31196082pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcr0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChien, Ching-Te10aDeep simple epicotyl morphophysiological dormancy in seeds of two Viburnum species, with special reference to shoot growth and development inside the seed  ap. 13-22.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: In seeds with deep simple epicotyl morphophysiological dormancy, warm and cold stratification are required to break dormancy of the radicle and shoot, respectively. Although the shoot remains inside the seed all winter, little is known about its growth and morphological development prior to emergence in spring. The aims of the present study were to determine the temperature requirements for radicle and shoot emergence in seeds of Viburnum betulifolium and V. parvifolium and to monitor growth of the epicotyl, plumule and cotyledons in root-emerged seeds. METHODS: Fresh and pre-treated seeds of V. betulifolium and V. parvifolium were incubated under various temperature regimes and monitored for radicle and shoot emergence. Growth of the epicotyl and cotyledons at different stages was observed with dissecting and scanning electron microscopes. KEY RESULTS: The optimum temperature for radicle emergence of seeds of both species, either kept continuously at a single regime or exposed to a sequence of regimes, was 20/10 °C. GA₃ had no effect on radicle emergence. Cold stratification (5 °C) was required for shoot emergence. The shoot apical meristem in fresh seeds did not form a bulge until the embryo had grown to the critical length for radicle emergence. After radicle emergence, the epicotyl-plumule and cotyledons grew slowly at 5 and 20/10 °C, and the first pair of true leaves was initiated. However, the shoot emerged only from seeds that received cold stratification. CONCLUSIONS: Seeds of V. betulifolium and V. parvifolium have deep simple epicotyl morphophysiological dormancy, C₁bB (root)-C₃ (epicotyl). Warm stratification was required to break the first part of physiological dormancy (PD), thereby allowing embryo growth and subsequently radicle emergence. Although cold stratification was not required for differentiation of the epicotyl-plumule, it was required to break the second part of PD, thereby allowing the shoot to emerge in spring.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aseed dormancy 3awinter 3ascanning electron microscopes 3acotyledons 3aspring 3adormancy breaking 3aViburnum 3ashoot meristems 3atemperature 3aroots 3aleaves 3aseed development 2aPlant Dormancyxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & development 2aSeasons 2aSeedsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTemperature 2aTime Factors 2aViburnumxembryologyxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 0aseeds1 aChen, Shun-Ying1 aTsai, Ching-Chu1 aBaskin, Jerry M.1 aBaskin, Carol C.1 aKuo-Huang, Ling-Long0 tAnnals of botany.g2011 July, v. 108, no. 1 p.13-22dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcr0963Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02530naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002200155245010800177300001600285500002400301520082800325650001701153650001601170650002701186650002801213650001901241650000901260650001201269650002901281650005501310650001601365650002801381650004001409650004901449650006701498650000901565650003401574650004401608650001701652650000901669650002501678650003701703650003401740700001501774700001601789700001801805700001301823773010401836852000901940856003901949655001201988IND4399715720221120202553.0080106e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439971572DNAL7 a176853902pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.22572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoon, Michel K.T.12aA 'Yang-Invigorating' Chinese herbal formula protects against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats  ap. 131-133.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of VI-28 (a Yang-invigorating Chinese herbal formula) treatment on the renal mitochondrial antioxidant system and susceptibility to gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity were investigated in rats.

VI-28 treatment protected against nephrotoxicity induced by gentamicin administration (100 mg/kg/day x 8) and the nephroprotection was associated with an enhancement in the renal mitochondrial antioxidant system.

Molecular and genetic analysis in tomato has revealed a series of regulatory genes involved in fruit development and ripening, including MADS box and SPB box transcription factors and genes involved in ethylene synthesis, signalling and response. Volatile metabolites represent a significant part of the plant metabolome, playing an important role in plant signalling, defence strategies and probably in regulatory mechanisms. They also play an important role in fruit quality. In order to acquire a better insight into the biochemical and genetic control of flavour compound generation and links between these metabolites and the central regulators of ripening, five pleiotropic mutant tomato lines were subjected to volatile metabolite profiling in comparison with wild-type Ailsa Craig. One hundred and seventeen volatile compounds were identified and quantified using SPME (Solid Phase Microextraction) headspace extraction followed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) and the data were subjected to multivariate comparative analysis. We find that the different mutants each produce distinct volatile profiles during ripening. Through principal component analysis the volatiles most dramatically affected are those derived from fatty-acids. The results are consistent with the suggestion that specific isoforms of lipoxygenase located in the plastids and the enzymes that provide precursors and downstream metabolites play a key role in determining volatile composition. 3atomatoes 3apleiotropy 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3amutation 3avolatile organic compounds 3aplastids 3aflavor 3aripening 3aflavor compounds 3afruiting 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 2aBase Sequence 2aFruitxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aLipoxygenasexmetabolism 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aTastexphysiology 2aVolatilization 0alipoxygenase1 aFray, Rupert G.1 aTikunov, Yury1 aGraham, Neil1 aBradley, Glyn1 aSeymour, G.

After treatment with 100 μM apocynin, strongly increased amounts of NO were detected in the leaves. This NO production was reduced by more than 70% by NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor, but there was no reduction in NO production when apocynin was applied in combination with diphenylene iodonium (a plant NOX inhibitor). When maize seedlings were UV-B-irradiated, cellular damage occurred and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were found widely distributed in chloroplasts and mesophyll cells. Pre-treatment with apocynin and coinciding NO accumulation prevented this damage. However, the protective effect was averted by L-NAME application. Leaf discs placed in 1 M H2O2 for 24 h showed a reduction in chlorophyll content that could also be avoided by apocynin treatment. 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aseedlings 3anitric oxide 3aantioxidant activity 3aoxidative stress 3anitric oxide synthase 3aenzyme inhibition 3aultraviolet radiation 3ahydrogen peroxide 2aAcetophenonesxpharmacology 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxmetabolism 2aHydrogen Peroxidexpharmacology 2aNitric Oxidexbiosynthesis 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexmetabolism 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aUltraviolet Rays 2aZea maysxdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolismxradiation effects. 0aPicrorrhiza kurroa 0aapocynin1 aCassia, Raul1 aLamattina, Lorenzo0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2009 Aug. 15, v. 166, no. 12 p.1336-1341dUrban & Fischerx0176-16177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2009.02.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02951naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245013200163300001800295520113600313650002501449650002101474650001401495650002501509650002501534650002001559650002001579650001901599650002401618650002401642650002401666650005001690650002301740650002201763650001701785650001901802650002801821650006701849650006801916650007601984650002202060653002802082653001902110653002502129700001902154700002002173700001502193700002102208700001902229773007002248852000902318939003302327946001302360655001202373IND9300092520221120141440.0930106e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930009252DNAL7 a13327952pmid7 aPMC1602132pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, C.14aThe TMK1 gene from Arabidopsis codes for a protein with structural and biochemical characteristics of a receptor protein kinase  ap. 1263-1271.  aGenomic and cDNA clones that code for a protein with structural and biochemical properties similar to the receptor protein kinases from animals were obtained from Arabidopsis. Structural features of the predicted polypeptide include an amino-terminal membrane targeting signal sequence, a region containing blocks of leucine-rich repeat elements, a single putative membrane spanning domain, and a characteristic serine/threonine-specific protein kinase domain. The gene coding for this receptor-like transmembrane kinase was designated TMK1. Portions of the TMK1 gene were expressed in Escherichia coli, and antibodies were raised against the recombinant polypeptides. These antibodies immunodecorated a 120-kD polypeptide present in crude extracts and membrane preparations. The immunodetectable band was present in extracts from leaf, stem, root, and floral tissues. The kinase domain of TMK1 was expressed as a fusion protein in E. coli, and the purified fusion protein was found capable of autophosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. The possible role of the TMK1 gene product in transmembrane signaling is discussed. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3astructural genes 3areceptors 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme activity 3aphosphorylation 3acell membranes 3aimmunocytochemistry 3arestriction mapping 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aChromosome Walking 2aEnzyme Activation 2aGenes, Plant 2aImmunoblotting 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aProtein Kinasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSequence Analysis 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l00670 0atransmembrane kinase1 aSchaller, G.E.1 aPatterson, S.E.1 aKwok, S.F.1 aMeyerowitz, E.M.1 aBleecker, A.B.0 tPlant cell.g1992 Oct., v. 4, no. 10 p.1263-1271x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03767naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245015700182300001800339520164500357650001402002650001302016650005202029650002802081650002602109650003602135650001502171650004002186650002202226650003002248650001102278650002902289650005202318650005202370650002402422650004402446650004702490650004602537650003802583653001302621653002502634700001702659700002002676700001702696700002002713700001902733700001902752700001902771700001402790700002002804700001702824700001202841700002002853773011802873852000902991856008503000930003303085946001103118655001203129IND4442634420221120141300.0100917e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444263442DNAL7 a205125742pmid7 a10.1007/s00277-010-0996-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jia-Jun 10aInactivation of PI3k/Akt signaling pathway and activation of caspase-3 are involved in tanshinone I-induced apoptosis in myeloid leukemia cells in vitro  ap. 1089-1097.  aTanshinone I (Tan I), a diterpene quinone extracted from herbal medicine Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge, has recently been reported to have antitumor effects. As the mechanism of its proapoptotic effects on human myeloid leukemia cells has not been extensively studied, we performed an in-depth evaluation of the effects of Tan I on apoptosis in human K562 and HL-60 cells. The results revealed that Tan I could inhibit the growth of leukemia cells and cause apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was observed clearly by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33258 staining, as well as DNA fragmentation analysis. After treatment by Tan I for 48 h, the percentage of disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting analysis demonstrated the cleavage of caspase-3 zymogen protein and a dose-dependent cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Tan I-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a significant decrease in survivin and an increase in Bax. Moreover, Tan I treatment remarkably downregulated the phosphorylation of both P85/PI3K and Akt in a time-dependent manner, and the PI3K/AKT-specific inhibitor (LY294002) mimicked the apoptosis-inducing effects of Tan I. We therefore conclude that the induction of apoptosis by Tan I in these leukemia cells is mainly related to the disruption of Δψm, the upregulation of Bax expression, and the activation of caspase-3. This process is highly correlated with the inactivation of PI3K/Akt/survivin signaling pathways. The results indicate that Tan I may serve as an effective adjunctive reagent in the treatment of leukemia. 3aapoptosis 3aleukemia 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase 3xmetabolism 2aDNA Fragmentationxdrug effects 2aAbietanes. 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbalxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aHL-60 Cellsxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aK562 Cellsxdrug effects 2aLeukemia, Myeloidxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aMembrane Potential, Mitochondrialxdrug effects 2aMolecular Structure 2aPhenanthrenesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPhosphatidylinositol 3-Kinasesxmetabolism 2aProto-Oncogene Proteins c-aktxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 0aPI3K/Akt 0aTanshinone I (Tan I)1 aLiu, Wen-Da 1 aYang, Hong-Zhi 1 aZhang, Yong 1 aFang, Zhi Gang.1 aLiu, Pei-Qing 1 aLin, Dong-Jun 1 aXiao, Ruo-Zhi 1 aHu, Yuan 1 aWang, Chun-Zhi 1 aLi, Xu-Dong 1 aHe, Yi 1 aHuang, Ren-Wei 0 tAnnals of hematology.g2010 Nov., v. 89, no. 11 p.1089-1097dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0939-55557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00277-010-0996-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01762naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008100163300001600244520085700260650001101117653002401128653002001152653003001172653001501202773011701217852000901334856008501343930003301428946001101461655001201472IND4445555320221120125920.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444555532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10834-010-9230-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Calvin 10aDaughter Exclusion in Family Business Succession: A Review of the Literature  ap. 475-484.  aIn family businesses, succession is very much biased by gender and daughters are almost always excluded as candidates. This paper provides a review of the literature on daughter succession. It finds that daughter exclusion results from an interaction of macro (societal/cultural attitudes toward women) and micro (individual and family) factors that both stereotype and discriminate against the daughter, and ensures that her capabilities and contributions in the business remain largely invisible. However, ascension to leadership and control for daughters can occur under “special circumstances” such as in the absence of male heirs or when the family business encounters a crucial transition or crisis event. Notwithstanding, daughter succession is defined by “complementarity” rather than conflict and offers potential advantages over sons. 3agender 0aDaughter succession 0aFamily business 0aInter-generational change 0aSuccession0 tJournal of family and economic issues.g2010 Dec., v. 31, no. 4 p.475-484dBoston : Springer USx1058-04767nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10834-010-9230-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20101126b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01691naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007400129300001400203520091600217650002001133650002601153650001501179650001701194650001101211651001201222700001801234700001501252773006701267852000901334939003301343946001301376655001201389IND9300093420221120125921.0930106e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930009342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, P.G.10aRelationship of sweetpotato yield and quality to amount of irrigation  ap. 23-26.  aA line-source irrigation design was used to provide continuously increasing amounts of irrigation at each application to sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.)

With respect to T cells, the efficiency of immunization, or "immunogenicity," is improved by targeting vaccine proteins to maturing dendritic cells (DCs) within mAbs to DC receptors. Here, we compared the capacity of Langerin/CD207, DEC205/CD205, and Clec9A receptors, each expressed on the CD8⁺ DC subset in mice, to bring about immunization of microbial-specific T cells from the polyclonal repertoire, using HIV gag-p24 protein as an antigen. α-Langerin mAb targeted splenic CD8⁺ DCs selectively in vivo, whereas α-DEC205 and α-Clec9A mAbs targeted additional cell types. When the mAb heavy chains were engineered to express gag-p24, the α-Langerin, α-DEC205, and α-Clec9A fusion mAbs given along with a maturation stimulus induced comparable levels of gag-specific T helper 1 (Th1) and CD8⁺ T cells in BALB/c x C57BL/6 F1 mice. These immune T cells were more numerous than targeting the CD8⁻ DC subset with α-DCIR2-gag-p24. In an in vivo assay in which gag-primed T cells were used to report the early stages of T-cell responses, α-Langerin, α-DEC205, and α-Clec9A also mediated cross-presentation to primed CD8⁺ T cells if, in parallel to antigen uptake, the DCs were stimulated with α-CD40. α-Langerin, α-DEC205, and α-Clec9A targeting greatly enhanced T-cell immunization relative to nonbinding control mAb or nontargeted HIV gag-p24 protein. Therefore, when the appropriate subset of DCs is targeted with a vaccine protein, several different receptors expressed by that subset are able to initiate combined Th1 and CD8⁺ immunity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3adendritic cells 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3amice 3apathogens 3areceptors 3avaccines1 aLubkin, Ashira1 aFiorese, Christopher1 aLahoud, Mireille H.1 aCaminschi, Irina1 aHuang, Yaoxing1 aRodriguez, Anthony1 aClausen, Björn E.1 aPark, Chae Gyu1 aTrumpfheller, Christine1 aSteinman, Ralph M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Feb. 8, v. 108, no. 6 p.2384-2389dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10195471083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01714naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002800145245009500173300001600268500002400284500001500308520068200323650003001005650002101035650001301056650001301069650001501082650001101097650001801108651001001126653001601136700002801152700001601180773009901196852000901295856004801304655001201352IND4409137620221120121258.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440913762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-008-0196-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirkendall, Lawrence R.10aFirst record of the ambrosia beetle, Monarthrum mali (Curculionidae, Scolytinae) in Europe  ap. 175-178.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDuring research conducted in northern Italy for the State Forestry Service LIFE Nature project, a single male specimen of the scolytine ambrosia beetle Monarthrum mali (Fitch) was collected in an ethanol-baited window flight trap.

Plant mitochondria contain several antioxidant systems that are not only able to scavenge ROS and limit their production but also to repair damages to macromolecules and possibly to serve as redox sensors. They comprise ascorbate- and glutathione-dependent pathways as well as systems based on thioredoxin (TRX)- and glutaredoxin (GRX)-like molecules. This review describes the various mitochondrial redox pathways for ROS control in plants with special emphasis on the poorly studied GRX and TRX systems and provides perspectives for future research in this area. 3areactive oxygen species 3amitochondria 0aantioxidants1 aRouhier, Nicolas1 aGelhaye, Eric1 aJacquot, Jean-Pierre0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2007 Jan., v. 129, no. 1 p.185-195dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2006.00777.x 7aarticle02894naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245010200169300001800271520195600289653003702245653000802282653001902290700001902309700001702328700001502345700001302360773010702373852000902480856009202489946001102581655001202592IND4442192420221120104108.0100910e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444219242DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2010.02367.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aȚurcanu, V.10aIgE-mediated facilitated antigen presentation underlies higher immune responses in peanut allergy  ap. 1274-1281.  aTo cite this article: Turcanu V, Stephens AC, Chan SMH, Rancé F, Lack G. IgE-mediated facilitated antigen presentation underlies higher immune responses in peanut allergy. Allergy 2010; 65: 1274-1281. Peanut allergy poses significant healthcare problems, because its prevalence is increasing in many countries, and it is rarely outgrown. To explore the immunological mechanisms that underlie peanut allergy and tolerance, we compared the peanut-specific responses of peanut-allergic (PA) and nonallergic (NA) individuals. We measured peanut-specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proliferation using tritiated thymidine. The frequency of peanut-specific T cells amongst PBMC was determined by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labelling. The role of IgE-dependent facilitated antigen presentation (FAP) in modulating proliferation was investigated by depleting IgE from plasma with anti-IgE-coated beads and then assessing PBMC proliferation in the presence of IgE-depleted or nondepleted plasma. We found that peanut-specific PBMC proliferation is higher and peaks earlier in PA than in NA donors. We investigated the immunological mechanisms that could underlie these differences. We found that both PA and NA have memory responses to peanut, but the frequency of peanut-specific T cells is higher in PA than in NA. Facilitated antigen presentation could cause both the higher proliferation and precursor frequency in PA. Facilitated antigen presentation activity in vitro was confirmed by showing that IgE depletion decreases proliferation, while adding IgE back restores it. Our results identify FAP as a mechanism that underlies higher responses to peanut in PA. In these individuals, high levels of peanut-specific IgE could furthermore maintain long-term allergic T-cell responses. We raise the question whether, in the future, therapies targeting IgE such as anti-IgE antibodies may be used to suppress these T-cell responses. 0afacilitated antigen presentation 0aIgE 0apeanut allergy1 aStephens, A.C.1 aChan, S.M.H.1 aRancé, F.1 aLack, G.0 tAllergy.g2010 Oct., v. 65, no. 10 p.1274-1281dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2010.02367.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03300naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001300135245009800148300001600246520155000262650001501812650004401827650003701871650002101908650002301929650001201952650001201964650001101976650001701987650001502004650002602019650001502045650004402060650001402104650003102118650001902149650001402168650003302182650000902215650001702224650001802241653002602259653002302285700001502308700002402323700002402347700002502371700001802396700001602414700001602430700001702446773010702463852000902570856007502579930003302654946001102687655001202698IND4443100220221120095913.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444310022DNAL7 a10.1071/SR100152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHina, K.10aProducing biochars with enhanced surface activity through alkaline pretreatment of feedstocks  ap. 606-617.  aSurface-activated biochars not only represent a useful carbon sink, but can also act as useful filtering materials to extract plant nutrients (e.g. NH₄⁺) from wastes (e.g. animal or municipal waste streams) and added thereafter to soils. Biochars produced by low-temperature pyrolysis of fibrous debarking waste from pine (PI) and eucalyptus (EU) were pre-treated with either diluted (L) or undiluted (S) alkaline tannery waste (L-PI, S-PI, L-EU, S-EU). Biochars produced from untreated feedstock were used as controls. Samples were characterised by FT-IR, solid-state CP MAS ¹³C NMR, XPS, SEM microphotographs, and BET specific surface area. Elemental composition, carbon recovery, yield, surface charge, and NH₄⁺ sorption/desorption properties were also studied. Carbon recovery was lower in biochars prepared from L-EU and S-EU (43 and 42%, respectively) than in control EU (45%) but these biochars showed greater changes in their chemical characteristics than those made from L-PI and S-PI, which showed minimal decrease in recovered carbon. The specific surface area of the biochars decreased with treatments, although acidic surface groups increased. In subsequent sorption experiments, treated biochars retained more NH₄⁺ from a 40mg N/L waste stream (e.g. 61% retention in control EU and 83% in S-EU). Desorption was low, especially in treated biochars relative to untreated biochars (0.1-2% v. 14-27%). The results suggest that surface activated biochars can be obtained with negligible impairment to the carbon recovered. 3aEucalyptus 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalkali treatment 3aammonium compounds 3aanimals 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3adesorption 3aelemental composition 3afeedstocks 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3anutrients 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplant extracts 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asoil 3asurface area 3atannery waste 0aacidic surface groups 0aammonium retention1 aBishop, P.1 aArbestain, M.

Recently, several cases of "upstream" colonization (from islands to continents) have been documented, challenging the traditional view. However, all these cases have involved individual island species that have colonized mainland regions. Here, using molecular phylogenetic data, divergence time estimates, lineage diversity distributions, and ancestral area analyses, we reconstruct the spread of a species-rich (>700 species) passerine bird radiation (core Corvoidea) from its late Eocene/Oligocene origin in the emerging proto-Papuan archipelago north of Australia, including multiple colonizations from the archipelago to Southeast Asia. Thus, islands apparently provided the setting for the initiation of a major songbird radiation that subsequently invaded all other continents. Morphological and behavioral adaptations of the core Corvoidea as generalist feeders in open habitats, which facilitated dispersal and colonization, apparently evolved in the descendants of sedentary forest birds that invaded the proto-Papuan archipelago. The archipelago evidently provided islands of the right size, number, and proximity to continental areas to support the adaptation and diversification of vagile colonizers that went on to increase avian diversity on a global scale.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPasseriformes 3abiogeography 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aislands 3aphylogeny 3asongbirds 3aAustralia 3aSouth East Asia1 aFabre, Pierre-Henri1 aRicklefs, Robert E.1 aFjeldså, Jon0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Feb. 8, v. 108, no. 6 p.2328-2333dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10189561083Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02333naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245019200171300001800363520103300381650003901414650001401453650001101467650001901478650001601497650001401513650001401527653002201541700002301563700001801586700002201604700002501626700002701651773013101678852000901809856008501818930003301903946001101936655001201947IND4444323820221120090224.0101029e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444432382DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-010-9621-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdesiyun, Abiodun A. 10aComparative study on responses of cattle and water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) to experimental inoculation of Brucella abortus biovar 1 by the intraconjunctival route—a preliminary report  ap. 1685-1694.  aThe preliminary study was conducted to assess the virulence of a strain of Brucella abortus (1969D) and to compare the susceptibility of water buffalo and cattle calves to infection by the intraconjunctival route. Seven of each cattle and water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) calves aged 3-6 months were inoculated intraconjunctivally with counts ranging from 1.5 × 10⁷ to 1.7 × 10¹⁰ colony forming units of B. abortus. Animals were monitored over an 8-week period for clinical manifestations and serological and hematological evidence of infection. At slaughter, eight lymph nodes from each animal were sampled for bacteriological and histopathological assessments. Lymph nodes from three water buffalo (43%) and five cattle (71%) yielded B. abortus (P = 0.048). Parotid/prescapular lymph nodes were most sensitive in detecting B. abortus. Our data suggest that B. abortus strain 1969D may be used as challenge strain, and water buffalo appeared to have a lower susceptibility to B. abortus infection than cattle. 3aBrucella melitensis biovar Abortus 3abuffaloes 3acalves 3ahistopathology 3alymph nodes 3aslaughter 3avirulence 0aIntraconjunctival1 aFosgate, Geoff T. 1 aPersad, Anil 1 aCampbell, Mervyn 1 aSeebaransingh, Ravi 1 aStewart-Johnson, Alva 0 tTropical animal health and production.g2010 Dec., v. 42, no. 8 p.1685-1694dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-010-9621-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20101029b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02399naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245008800172300001600260520144700276653001501723653002101738653002401759653002001783653003001803653001701833700002801850773011201878852000901990856008501999946001302084655001202097IND4448814420221120090225.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444881442DNAL7 a10.1007/s10439-010-0188-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoutzouri, Antonia G. 10aAttachment, Spreading, and Adhesion Strength of Human Bone Marrow Cells on Chitosan  ap. 730-741.  aThe successful integration of an orthopedic implant into bone depends on the mechanisms at the tissue-implant interface and mostly on the osteoblast attachment phenomenon. Chitosan has emerged as an attractive biomacromolecule favoring osseointegration. In this study highly deacetylated chitosan coatings, with roughness of about 1 nm, were bonded to glass surfaces via silane-glutaraldehyde molecules. Human osteoblasts were used to study the development of attachment during the first 60 min. Chitosan favored the number of the attached cells compared to the uncoated surfaces for 30 min seeding time (t s). For t s up to 60 min the attached cell area was almost 210% significantly higher on the chitosan surfaces, indicating an enhanced spreading process. To determine the cell attachment strength, a micropipette aspiration method was used, where the value of the term I = ∫Fdt is representative of the single cell attachment-adhesion procedure and quantitatively reflects the strength evolution during attachment: F equals the detaching force applied on the cell. The results showed higher strength values on the chitosan surfaces. The findings reinforce the favorable environment of the biomacromolecule for the osteoblast and the new approach regarding the quantitatively evaluation of adhesion provides important contribution for the study of cell-material interaction, especially during the crucial first phase of cell attachment. 0aOsteoblast 0aBiomacromolecule 0aMicropipette method 0aCell detachment 0aCell-material interaction 0aBiomaterials1 aAthanassiou, George M. 0 tAnnals of biomedical engineering.g2011 Feb., v. 39, no. 2 p.730-741dBoston : Springer USx0090-69647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10439-010-0188-y3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01035naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245005700170300001400227500002400241520022700265650001000492650001100502650001500513700002000528700002000548700002100568773009900589852000900688856004800697655001200745IND4457292020221120090216.0110429e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445729202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-011-9832-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiniyatullina, G.

To determine whether the CRE could be elicited when each of the delivered stimuli were on non-continuous skin areas, we developed a new electrotactile stimulation paradigm attempting to induce the CRE across the fingertips. Though our stimulation paradigm differed from classic reduced CRE paradigms through the use of electrotactile stimuli, focusing the subject attention to a ‘likely' illusory site, and the inclusion of a fourth stimulation site (two stimuli after the illusory stimulus), these factors were not the cause of the illusory effect we observed. Experiments conducted on the forearm validated that our paradigm elicited similar results to those reported in previous CRE studies that used either 3-stimulation-point mechanical or electrotactile stimuli with subject attention focused on the ‘likely' illusory site. Across the fingertips, we observed an increase in stimulus mislocalization onto the middle fingertip, the ‘likely' perceived location of the illusory stimuli, under Illusory Rabbit Trains compared to the Motion Bias Trains. Because the Motion Bias Trains should not induce a perceived location shift of the illusory stimulus but stimulates the adjacent digits in a similar way to the Illusory Rabbit Trains, differences observed between their mislocalization rates between these trains indicate that the CRE can be induced across the fingertips. These results provide the first evidence that the CRE can ‘jump' when the stimuli occur across non-continuous skin areas. 0aCutaneous Rabbit Effect 0aElectrotactile 0aElectrocutaneous 0aTactile illusion 0aFingertips1 aSantello, Marco 1 aHelms Tillery, Stephen I. 0 tExperimental brain research.g2010 Oct., v. 206, no. 4 p.419-426dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0014-48197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00221-010-2422-03Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01771naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009100165300001600256520072800272650001901000650000901019650001901028653002001047653001101067653001901078653002601097653001601123700001901139773013501158852000901293856008501302930003301387946001301420655001201433IND4442376620221120090302.0100910e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444237662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-009-9219-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoeminne, Gert 14aThe concept of ecological debt: some steps towards an enriched sustainability paradigm  ap. 691-712.  aIn this paper, we elaborate on the concept of ecological debt.

The feasibility of using respiratory input impedance (Z rs) and computed tomographic (CT) image registration for assessing parenchymal mechanical heterogeneity was evaluated. In six dogs, measurements of Z rs before and after oleic acid injury at various distending pressures were obtained, followed by whole lung CT scans. Each Z rs spectrum was fit with a model incorporating variable distributions of regional compliances. CT image pairs at different inflation pressures were matched using an image registration algorithm, from which distributions of regional compliances from the resulting anatomic deformation fields were computed. Under baseline conditions, average model compliance decreased with increasing inflation pressure, reflecting parenchymal stiffening. After lung injury, these average compliances decreased at each pressure, indicating derecruitment, alveolar flooding, or alterations in intrinsic tissue elastance. However, average compliance did not change as inflation pressure increased, consistent with simultaneous recruitment and strain stiffening. Image registration revealed peaked distributions of regional compliances, and that small portions of the lung might undergo relative compression during inflation. The authors conclude that assessments of lung function using Z rs combined with the structural alterations inferred from image registration provide unique but complementary information on the mechanical derangements associated with lung injury. 3adogs 3acomputed tomography 0aAcute lung injury 0aRespiratory mechanics 0aInput impedance1 aCao, Kunlin 1 aChristensen, Gary E. 1 aBates, Jason H.

CSLD2 is required for normal root hair growth but has a different role from that previously described for CSLD3 (KOJAK). CSLD2 is required during a later stage of hair development than CSLD3, and CSLD2 mutants produce root hairs with a range of abnormalities, with many root hairs rupturing late in development. Remarkably, though, it was often the case that in CSLD2 mutants, tip growth would resume after rupturing of root hairs. In silico, semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and promoter-reporter construct analyses indicated that the expression of both CSLD2 and CSLD3 is elevated at reduced temperatures, and the phenotypes of mutants homozygous for insertions in these genes were partially rescued by reduced temperature growth. However, this was not the case for a double mutant homozygous for insertions in both CSLD2 and CSLD3, suggesting that there may be partial redundancy in the functions of these genes. Mutants in CSLD1 and CSLD4 had a defect in male transmission, and plants heterozygous for insertions in CSLD1 or CSLD4 were defective in their ability to produce pollen tubes, although the number and morphology of pollen grains was normal. We propose that the CSLD family of putative glycosyltransferases synthesize a polysaccharide that has a specialized structural role in the cell walls of tip-growing cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acell walls 3acellulose 3acellulose synthase 3adevelopmental stages 3agenes 3amutants 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3aroot growth 3aroot hairs 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxenzymologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCytoskeletonxultrastructure 2aDNA Primers 2aGenes, Plant 2aGermination 2aGlucosyltransferasesxgenetics 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPlant Rootsxultrastructure 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSubcellular Fractionsxenzymology1 aYoo, Cheol-Min1 aMutwil, Marek1 aJensen, Jakob Krüger1 aHou, Guichuan1 aBlaukopf, Claudia1 aSørensen, Iben1 aBlancaflor, Elison B.1 aScheller, Henrik Vibe1 aWillats, William G.T.0 tPlant physiology.g2008 Nov., v. 148, no. 3 p.1238-1253dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.108.1219393Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02811naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008600169300001600255520154900271650001401820650002301834650001501857650002501872650001201897650001701909650000901926650003801935650001901973650001601992650001202008650002002020650002002040650001502060650001602075653001502091653002302106773010802129852000902237856008502246930003302331946001302364655001202377IND4444714820221120063452.0101105e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444471482DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-009-9094-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiaz-Amigo, Carmen 10aTowards a Comprehensive Validation of ELISA Kits for Food Allergens: Case 1—Egg  ap. 344-350.  aThere are several enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in the market that have been proven to be useful for the determination of egg in foods. However, inconsistent results that are obtained when different kits are used make the selection of one kit over another very difficult. Two different approaches were used to help understand why results vary among kits. Different kits were used to analyze spiked egg material [NIST reference material (RM) 8445] in wheat flour (raw ingredients) and cookies containing egg as an ingredient baked for different periods of time (processed food). These results were compared with immunoblotting using conjugated antibodies from the commercial kits to determine the antibody specificity and sample extraction efficiency. ELISA results can be difficult to compare because reporting units differ among kits. Results from both ELISA and immunoblotting are in agreement regarding the decreased detection of proteins in baked cookie extracts. Moreover, immunoblotting showed that this reduction is due to reduced protein content in these extracts. However, a properly selected extraction solution may help improve the solubility of certain egg proteins in processed foods. Harmonization of the reporting unit system along with the use of a common reference material is recommended as the path forward in the standardization of detection methods for food allergens. This would assist the end user in making an informed decision regarding the selection of the most appropriate kit for his or her purpose. 3aallergens 3aanalytical methods 3aantibodies 3aantibody specificity 3acookies 3aegg proteins 3aeggs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmunoblotting 3aingredients 3amarkets 3aprocessed foods 3aprotein content 3asolubility 3awheat flour 0aValidation 0aReference Material0 tFood analytical methods.g2010 Dec., v. 3, no. 4 p.344-350dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-009-9094-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101105b20101204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04283naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100001700200245012400217300001800341500002400359520279900383650002503182650001803207650001003225650002303235650001803258650001103276650001603287650002203303650001803325650002403343650001403367650001603381700001803397700001503415700001903430773009303449852000903542856007203551856008503623930003303708945002503741946001103766655001203777IND4423820520221120063550.0090729e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442382052DNAL7 a224448412pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311090045462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL100 0aL500 0aL600 0aX1001 aBrossard, L.10aModelling the variation in performance of a population of growing pig as affected by lysine supply and feeding strategy  ap. 1114-1123.  aIncludes references  aConsiderable progress has been made in the nutritional modelling of growth. Most models typically predict (or analyse) the response of a single animal. However, the response to nutrients of a single, representative animal is likely to be different from the response of the herd. To address the variation in response between animals, a stochastic approach towards nutritional modelling is required. In the present study, an analysis method is presented to describe growth and feed intake curves of individual pigs within a population of 192 pigs. This method was developed to allow end-users of InraPorc (a nutritional model predicting and analysing growth in pigs) to easily characterise their animals based on observed data and then use the model to test different scenarios. First, growth and intake data were curve-fitted to characterise individual pigs in terms of BW (Gompertz function of age) and feed intake (power function of BW) by a set of five parameters, having a biological or technico-economical meaning. This information was then used to create a population of virtual pigs in InraPorc, having the same feed intake and growth characteristics as those observed in the population. After determination of the mean lysine (Lys) requirement curve of the population, simulations were carried out for each virtual pig using different feeding strategies (i.e. 1, 2, 3 or 10 diets) and Lys supply (ranging from 70% to 130% of the mean requirement of the population). Because of the phenotypic variation between pigs and the common feeding strategies that were applied to the population, the Lys requirement of each individual pig was not always met. The percentage of pigs for which the Lys requirement was met increased concomitantly with increasing Lys supply, but decreased with increasing number of diets used. Simulated daily gain increased and feed conversion ratio decreased with increasing Lys supply (P < 0.001) according to a curvilinear-plateau relationship. Simulated performance was close to maximum when the Lys supply was 110% of the mean population requirement and did not depend on the number of diets used. At this level of Lys supply, the coefficient of variation of simulated daily gain was minimal and close to 10%, which appears to be a phenotypic characteristic of this population. At lower Lys supplies, simulated performance decreased and variability of daily gain increased with an increasing number of diets (P < 0.001). Knowledge of nutrient requirements becomes more critical when a greater number of diets are used. This study shows the limitations of using a deterministic model to estimate the nutrient requirements of a population of pigs. A stochastic approach can be used provided that relationships between the most relevant model parameters are known. 3alivestock production 3aswine feeding 3aswine 3aanimal performance 3aanimal growth 3alysine 3afeed intake 3afeed requirements 3agrowth models 3amathematical models 3aequations 3aweight gain1 aDourmad, J.Y.1 aRivest, J.1 aMilgen, J. van0 tAnimal.g2009 Aug., v. 3, no. 8 p.1114-1123dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journals.cambridge.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311090045463Available from publisher's Web site  a20090924b20091002c00000000  aINDd9CTe2009/08/29  aNon-US 7aarticle01888naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010700163300001400270520085800284650001801142653003601160653001801196653002901214653002001243700002301263700001601286700002001302773010201322852000901424856008501433939003301518946001101551655001201562IND4449574420221120053631.0110225e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444957442DNAL7 a10.1007/s15010-010-0067-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKampitak, T. 10aAnti-interferon-γ autoantibody and opportunistic infections: case series and review of the literature  ap. 65-71.  aImmune defects in interleukin-12-dependent interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) pathways are associated with disseminated infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) and Salmonella.

The first half of the 20th century produced a considerable number of more or less episodic studies often focusing on behavioral biology of (short-term) captive observations. A systematic collection of tarsiers in the 1940 s by Wharton, transported to the United States, and several tarsiers brought to Germany by Harrisson led to the first long-term field study in Borneo. This study investigated the functional anatomy of the skin, biometry and corresponding evolutionary interpretations, anatomy, and locomotion in Bornean tarsiers as well as many aspects of their behavior. It also recorded diseases and traumatological data and interpreted these with regard to fitness and the survival of the species. I close this abbreviated history of tarsier research before the last 20 yr with 2 studies, 1 on the physiology and evolution of brown adipose tissue and 1 on convergent evolution with owls. 3alocomotion 3aevolution 3aembryology 3abiometry 3akinematics 3abrown adipose tissue 0aField study 0aTarsius 0aanatomy and morphology0 tInternational journal of primatology.g2010 Dec., v. 31, no. 6 p.941-957dBoston : Springer USx0164-02917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10764-010-9454-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101211b20110101c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02859naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245010700162300001500269520166000284650001301944650002201957650001101979650001901990650001802009650002302027650003002050653003202080653001602112653001702128653001402145653001602159653003802175700002202213773013302235852000902368856008502377946001102462655001202473IND4447303720221120041957.0110107e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444730372DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-010-4276-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Shuyan 10aRecent developments and applications of hybrid surface plasmon resonance interfaces in optical sensing  ap. 91-101.  aNanostructured noble metals exhibit an intense optical near field due to surface plasmon resonance, therefore promising widespread applications and being of interest to a broad spectrum of scientists, ranging from physicists, chemists, and materials scientists to biologists. A wealth of research is available discussing the synthesis, characterization, and application of noble metal nanoparticles in optical sensing. However, with respect to the sensitivity of the frequency and width of these surface plasmon resonance modes to the particle's shape, size, and environment, in nearly every case, success strongly depends on the availability of highly stable, adhesive, and sensitive nanoparticles. This undoubtedly presents a challenging task to nanofabrication. The past decade has witnessed fascinating advances in this field, in particular, the construction of oxide-based hybrid plasmonic interfaces to overcome the problem addressed above by (1) coating the metallic nanostructures with thin overlayers to form sandwiched structures or (2) embedding metallic nanostructures in a dielectric matrix to obtain metal/dielectric matrix nanocomposite films. In this critical review, we focus on recent work related to this field, beginning with a presentation of hybrid films with enhanced structural and optical stability, readily and selectively designed using chemical and physical techniques. We then illustrate their interesting optical properties and demonstrate exciting evidence for the postulated application in surface plasmon sensing fields. Finally, we survey the work remaining to be done for that potential to be realized.

Of the major human pathogenic species, Cryptosporidium parvum and Cryptosporidium hominis predominate in the UK. Cryptosporidium hominis is a human-adapted species, while C. parvum has many animal hosts and is particularly common in preweaned farmed ruminants. Evaluation of zoonotic risks has been provided mainly by descriptive and analytical epidemiological studies and enhanced recently by genetic typing of isolates. The robust nature of the transmissive oocyst stage, multiple transmission routes, lack of antiparasitic treatment options and vaccines, and resistance to chlorine disinfection present challenges for control. Subtyping C. parvum isolates has been used to link human cases and suspected sources of infection in sporadic cases and outbreaks. Although it is possible that all C. parvum isolates are potentially zoonotic, populations with and without farm animal linkage have been identified. New zoonotic risks have emerged in at least one outbreak, caused by the Cryptosporidium sp. rabbit genotype. This re-enforces the need to characterize infecting and contaminating isolates to ensure appropriate interventions. This study describes the risks of zoonotic cryptosporidiosis by detailing the hosts providing a potential reservoir, the risks of transmission to humans, outbreaks in animal-associated settings and guidance for control with special emphasis on the UK. 3aCryptosporidium hominis 3aCryptosporidium parvum 3aantiparasitic agents 3achlorine 3acryptosporidiosis 3adisease incidence 3adisinfection 3aepidemiological studies 3afarmed animal species 3agenotype 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aoocysts 3aparasites 3arabbits 3arisk 3aruminants 3avaccines 2aAnimals 2aCryptosporidiosisxepidemiologyxparasitologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aCryptosporidiumxphysiology 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & control 2aDisease Reservoirsxparasitology 2aHumans 2aRisk Assessment 2aZoonosesxepidemiologyxparasitologyxtransmission. 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britainxepidemiology. 0adisease(s)1 aGiles, M.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2010 Nov., v. 109, no. 5 p.1487-1497dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04764.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101015b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03122naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245013000189300001800319520136800337650001301705650001101718650002101729650001901750650001801769650001901787650001201806650001101818650001901829650002301848650001201871650002301883650001901906650001801925650002201943650002501965650001301990650002702003650002102030653002102051653001402072653001002086653002802096653002102124653003002145700001702175700002002192700001302212700001702225700001602242773011702258852000902375856009202384930003302476946001102509655001202520IND4442778120221117180317.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444277812DNAL7 a208542712pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04814.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLedoux, J.-B.10aFine-scale genetic structure and inferences on population biology in the threatened Mediterranean red coral, Corallium rubrum  ap. 4204-4216.  aIdentifying microevolutionary processes acting in populations of marine species with larval dispersal is a challenging but crucial task because of its conservation implications. In this context, recent improvements in the study of spatial genetic structure (SGS) are particularly promising because they allow accurate insights into the demographic and evolutionary processes at stake. Using an exhaustive sampling and a combination of image processing and population genetics, we highlighted significant SGS between colonies of Corallium rubrum over an area of half a square metre, which sheds light on a number of aspects of its population biology. Based on this SGS, we found the mean dispersal range within sites to be between 22.6 and 32.1 cm, suggesting that the surveyed area approximately corresponded to a breeding unit. We then conducted a kinship analysis, which revealed a complex half-sib family structure and allowed us to quantify the level of self-recruitment and to characterize aspects of the mating system of this species. Furthermore, significant temporal variations in allele frequencies were observed, suggesting low genetic drift. These results have important conservation implications for the red coral and further our understanding of the microevolutionary processes acting within populations of sessile marine species with a larval phase. 3abreeding 3acorals 3afamily structure 3agene frequency 3agenetic drift 3aimage analysis 3akinship 3alarvae 3amating systems 3atemporal variation 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoaxgenetics 2aGene Frequency 2aGenetic Drift 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGenotype 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aSpatial Analysis 0aCorallium rubrum 0adispersal 0adrift 0aheterozygote deficiency 0akinship analysis 0aspatial genetic structure1 aGarrabou, J.1 aBianchimani, O.1 aDrap, P.1 aFeral, J.-P.1 aAurelle, D.0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 Oct., v. 19, no. 19 p.4204-4216dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04814.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120114b20120203c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01650naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245011800168300001600286520058800302653002300890653002700913653002000940653002300960700002300983700002601006700002001032700002201052700001901074773012601093852000901219856008501228946001101313655001201324IND4443176020221117180402.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444317602DNAL7 a10.1007/s10517-010-0985-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeledtsova, G.

This unequal division of the zygote is a putative first step for formation of the apical-basal axis of plants and is a fundamental feature of early embryogenesis and morphogenesis in angiosperms. Because fertilization and subsequent embryogenesis occur in embryo sacs, which are deeply embedded in ovular tissue, in vitro fertilization of isolated gametes is a powerful system to dissect mechanisms of fertilization and post-fertilization events. Rice is an emerging molecular and experimental model plant, however, profile of the first zygotic division within embryo sac and thus origin of apical-basal embryo polarity has not been closely investigated. Therefore, in the present study, the division pattern of rice zygote in planta was first determined accurately by observations employing serial sections of the egg apparatus, zygotes and two-celled embryos in the embryo sac. The rice zygote divides asymmetrically into a two-celled embryo consisting of a statistically significantly smaller apical cell with dense cytoplasm and a larger vacuolated basal cell. Moreover, detailed observations of division profiles of zygotes prepared by in vitro fertilization indicate that the zygote also divides into an asymmetric two-celled embryo as in planta. Such observations suggest that in vitro-produced rice zygotes and two-celled embryos may be useful as experimental models for further investigations into the mechanism and control of asymmetric division of plant zygotes. 3arice 3aembryo sac 3agerm cells 3amorphogenesis 3amodels 3acell division 3azygote 3acytoplasm 3aAngiospermae 3aembryogenesis 3aeggs 3ain vitro fertilization 2aBotanyxmethods 2aCell Division 2aOryzaxcytologyxembryology. 2aSeedsxcytology 0aEgg cell 0aAsymmetric cell division 0aMagnoliophyta1 aToyooka, Kiminori 1 aOkamoto, Takashi 0 tSexual plant reproduction.g2010 Sept., v. 23, no. 3 p.211-217dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0934-08827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-009-0129-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100827b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01867naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245006900171300001400240520055900254650002200813653004100835653007700876653002800953653002700981700002301008700002101031700002301052700002201075700001901097700002201116700002201138700002301160700002401183773012401207852000901331856008501340930003301425946001101458655001201469IND4446011220221117180333.0101203e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444601122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10517-010-1057-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aProskurjakov, S.

The antihypotensive effect was more pronounced in compounds with high NO inhibitory activity containing the isopropyl radical. 3ahypovolemic shock 0ainhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis 0ain vivo electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy with a NO spin trap 0aisothiourea derivatives 0aantihypotensive effect1 aFilimonova, M.

In this study we have examined the abilities of 58 SLTEC isolates to survive at pH 2.5 and found 13 of these isolates to be defective in acid resistance. Introduction of rpoS on a plasmid conferred acid resistance to the majority of the acid-sensitive isolates. The rpoS genes from two of these isolates were sequenced; both isolates contained lesions in the rpoS gene resulting in a nonfunctional RpoS. These results show that mutant rpoS alleles exist in natural populations of E. coli. Such mutations may play an important role in determining the infective dose of SLTEC and suggest that isolates may vary in infectivity. 3aEscherichia coli 3aacid tolerance 3aalleles 3aenteropathogens 3amutants 3amutation 3apH 3apathogenicity 3aphenotype 3aplasmids 2aAlleles 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Toxinsxbiosynthesis 2aBase Sequence 2aColitisxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aSigma Factorxgenetics 2aVirulence1 aSmall, P.L.C.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 July, v. 64, no. 7 p.2808-2811x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle02034naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001200149245006500161300001800226520068700244650003900931650002100970650001600991650001801007650000901025650002601034650002101060650002001081650001501101650001401116650001401130650001201144650003301156650002201189650003301211650001101244650003001255650001101285650000901296650001201305650001601317700001601333700001601349773008301365852000901448930003301457945001301490946001301503655001201516IND2057899220221117155951.0970621e199610  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205789922DNAL7 a89261202pmid7 aPMC1743882pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, J.10aImmunological response to the Brucella abortus GroEL homolog  ap. 4396-4400.  aWestern blot (immunoblot) analysis of sera from cattle vaccinated with Brucella abortus S19 exhibit an elevated serologic response to Hsp62, the GroEL homolog (BaGroEL).

The factors effecting entry of L. monocytogenes into hepatic cells remain to be determined. Others have shown that the protein products of the inlAB (internalin) operon are required for maximum entry of L. monocytogenes into a number of cell lines in vitro. Likewise, we report here that expression of the inlAB operon was required for maximum uptake of L. monocytogenes by primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes. Uptake of an inlAB mutant strain of L. monocytogenes was approximately 10-fold less than that of the isogenic wild-type control. In contrast, inlAB expression was not a factor in (i) clearance of L. monocytogenes injected intravenously into mice and taken up in the liver, (ii) the distribution of L. monocytogenes among hepatocytes and nonparenchymal cells in the liver, or (iii) internalization of L. monocytogenes by hepatic cells in vivo. These latter findings suggest that infection of hepatic cells by L. monocytogenes in vivo does not require the protein products of the inlAB operon. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3acell lines 3ahepatocytes 3aintravenous injection 3aliver 3amice 3amutants 3aoperon 3aprotein products1 aSagnimeni, A.J.1 aWing, E.J.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 Oct., v. 64, no. 10 p.3983-3986x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03191naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001900149245006500168300001800233520151100251650002801762650001301790650001701803650002201820650002001842650002101862650001601883650000901899650001201908650001301920650001101933650001301944650002201957650003301979650001302012650001602025650001302041650001402054650001202068650005002080650001802130650002802148650000902176650002402185650002102209650002802230650001302258650004602271650001402317650004302331700001702374700002402391773008202415852000902497930003302506945001302539946001302552655001202565IND2056876920221123041221.0970505e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205687692DNAL7 a86753422pmid7 aPMC1740712pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartland, E.L.10aContribution of YopB to virulence of Yersinia enterocolitica  ap. 2308-2314.  aThe 70-kb virulence plasmid, pYV, of Yersinia enterocolitica encodes a number of secreted proteins (Yops) which are essential for virulence. YopD, the 33-kDa product of the lcrGVHyopBD operon, appears to be involved in delivering YopE and YopH (the Yersinia protein tyrosine phosphatase) into target cells. These proteins then act in concert to cause cytotoxicity in host cells. Previously, we reported that bacteria carrying transposon insertions in yopD are not cytotoxic for macrophages, show impaired tyrosine phosphatase activity in host cells, and are avirulent for mice (E. L. Hartland, S. P. Green, W. A. Phillips, and R. M. Robins-Browne, Infect. Immun. 62:4445-4453, 1994). trans complementation of yopD mutants of Y. enterocolitica with the yopD gene restores all these properties. In this study, we show that polar mutations in proximal genes of the lcrGVHyopBD operon also abrogated bacterial virulence and the capacity to induce cytotoxicity in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and HEp-2 epithelial cells. Moreover, bans complementation of a yopBD mutant with the yopD gene alone was not sufficient to restore the ability of the bacteria to cause cytotoxicity. Further work showed that YopB was required for cytotoxicity, dephosphorylation of host proteins, and virulence for mice. These findings indicate that YopB and YopD may serve a related function in Y. enterocolitica and that they may act together to deliver intracellularly acting Yops to their respective targets in host cells. 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3abacteria 3acytotoxicity 3adephosphorylation 3aenzyme activity 3aepithelial cells 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3aoperon 3aplasmids 3aprotein secretion 3aprotein-tyrosine-phosphatase 3aproteins 3atransposons 3atyrosine 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxphysiology 2aBase Sequence 2aMacrophagesxenzymology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred CBA 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aProtein Tyrosine Phosphatasesxmetabolism 2aVirulence 2aYersinia enterocoliticaxpathogenicity1 aBordun, A.M.1 aRobins-Browne, R.M.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 June, v. 64, no. 6 p.2308-2314x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle02723naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003400145245009500179300001400274520156500288653004501853653001501898653002901913653003801942653002201980700003302002700003202035700002302067700002402090700002902114773013702143852000902280856008502289946001102374655001202385IND4447672320221123041404.0110121e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444767232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11517-010-0663-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCharleston-Villalobos, Sonia 10aAcoustic thoracic image of crackle sounds using linear and nonlinear processing techniques  ap. 15-24.  aIn this study, a novel approach is proposed, the imaging of crackle sounds distribution on the thorax based on processing techniques that could contend with the detection and count of crackles; hence, the normalized fractal dimension (NFD), the univariate AR modeling combined with a supervised neural network (UAR-SNN), and the time-variant autoregressive (TVAR) model were assessed. The proposed processing schemes were tested inserting simulated crackles in normal lung sounds acquired by a multichannel system on the posterior thoracic surface. In order to evaluate the robustness of the processing schemes, different scenarios were created by manipulating the number of crackles, the type of crackles, the spatial distribution, and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) at different pulmonary regions. The results indicate that TVAR scheme showed the best performance, compared with NFD and UAR-SNN schemes, for detecting and counting simulated crackles with an average specificity very close to 100%, and average sensitivity of 98 ± 7.5% even with overlapped crackles and with SNR corresponding to a scaling factor as low as 1.5. Finally, the performance of the TVAR scheme was tested against a human expert using simulated and real acoustic information. We conclude that a confident image of crackle sounds distribution by crackles counting using TVAR on the thoracic surface is thoroughly possible. The crackles imaging might represent an aid to the clinical evaluation of pulmonary diseases that produce this sort of adventitious discontinuous lung sounds. 0aDiscontinuous adventitious sound imaging 0aLung sound 0aFine and coarse crackles 0aTime-variant autoregressive model 0aFractal dimension1 aDorantes-Méndez, Guadalupe 1 aGonzález-Camarena, Ramón 1 aChi-Lem, Georgina 1 aCarrillo, José G. 1 aAljama-Corrales, Tomás 0 tMedical & biological engineering & computing.g2011 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.15-24dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0140-01187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11517-010-0663-53Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle03398naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245017900166300001800345520154100363650002301904650001301927650002101940650002901961650001301990650002102003650001502024650000902039650002602048650001302074650001202087650002002099650002302119650001402142650001002156650002502166650001302191650003502204650001202239650003802251650003902289650002302328650003502351650003202386650003002418650001702448650000902465650002402474650002102498650002502519650003502544700001602579700001402595773008302609852000902692930003302701945001302734946001302747655001202760IND2057411420221123041156.0970602e199609  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205741142DNAL7 a87519142pmid7 aPMC1742782pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTikkanen, K.14aThe galactosyl-(alpha 1-4)-galactose-binding adhesin of Streptococcus suis: occurrence in strains of different hemagglutination activities and induction of opsonic antibodies  ap. 3659-3665.  aThe occurrence of the galactose-(alpha1-4)-galactose-specific adhesin in Streptococcus suis, a pig and human pathogen causing sepsis, meningitis, and other serious infections, was studied. Poly- and monoclonal antibodies to the purified adhesin, as well as pigeon ovomucoid, a specific probe for the adhesin activity, detected one single protein band in extracts of S. suis. The adhesin was detected in all 23 strains studied, representing pathogenic serotypes (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and nontypeable) and including several weakly hemagglutinating or nonhemagglutinating strains and phase variants. The amount of adhesin detected was not correlated with the hemagglutination activity of the intact bacteria. Extraction of cells showing no binding of pigeon ovomucoid by ultrasonic treatment resulted in extracts with pigeon ovomucoid binding activity, suggesting that the adhesin was not accessible to the probe on the intact cells. Analysis of the amount of capsular polysaccharide revealed an inverse relationship between the hemagglutination activity and expression of capsular polysaccharide, thus suggesting a factor influencing adhesin accessibility. The purified adhesin was highly immunogenic and induced in preliminary experiments bactericidal activity in mice. Thus, the adhesin, with its specific binding mechanism to host cells and a proposed pathogenic role, is widely expressed among strains of different serotypes and therefore appears to represent a novel promising candidate for the development of a vaccine against S. suis. 3aStreptococcus suis 3aadhesins 3aanimal pathogens 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3ahemagglutination 3ameningitis 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aovomucin 3apigeons 3apolysaccharides 3asepsis (infection) 3aserotypes 3aswine 3aultrasonic treatment 3avaccines 2aAdhesins, Bacterialxchemistry 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialximmunology 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBacterial Capsulesximmunology 2aBlood Bactericidal Activity 2aHemagglutininsxchemistry 2aImmunization 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aOpsonin Proteins 2aOvomucinxmetabolism 2aStreptococcus suisximmunology1 aHaataja, S.1 aFinne, J.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 Sept., v. 64, no. 9 p.3659-3665x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03659naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245014800166300001800314520208800332650002402420650002902444650002502473650001002498650002302508650001002531650001202541650001002553650001002563650001102573650001302584650001202597650001202609650001202621650002102633650007002654650005502724650002102779650001402800650002702814650001102841650004602852650001402898650001002912700001602922700001702938773008202955852000903037930003303046945001303079946001303092655001203105IND2056876720221123041410.0970505e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205687672DNAL7 a86753402pmid7 aPMC1740692pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWesley, I.V.10aInfection of cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived 1-day-old piglets with Arcobacter butzleri, Arcobacter cryaerophilus, and Arcobacter skirrowii  ap. 2295-2299.  aNeonatal piglets have been used as models to study human campylobacteriosis and helicobacteriosis. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative pathogenicities, on the basis of the duration of fecal shedding and colonization of tissues, of three Arcobacter species in 1-day-old cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived piglets. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, two piglets each were infected per os with either Arcobacter butzleri ATCC 49616, Arcobacter cryaerophilus 1B ATCC 43159, Arcobacter skirrowii CCUG 10374, or the three field strains of A. butzleri (approximately 5 X 10(9) CFU per piglet). Rectal swab samples were taken prior to infection and daily thereafter for up to 7 days. Arcobacter spp. were detected at least once in rectal swab samples of all but one of the experimentally infected piglets but not in the control. At necropsy, A. butzleri was recovered from the lung, kidney, ileum, or brain tissues of the four infected piglets which had received either the field strain or the ATCC type strain of A. butzleri. A. cryaerophilus 1B was detected in rectal swab samples for up to 7 days postinfection but was not cultured from tissues at necropsy. Arcobacters were detected in the rectal swab sample of the A. skirrowii-infected piglet only on day 3 postinfection; no isolates were obtained from tissues at necropsy. No gross pathological lesions were consistently noted in the experimentally infected piglets. In experiment 2. two piglets each were infected per os with A. butzleri ATCC 49616, A. cryaerophilus 1A ATCC 43158, A. skirrowii CCUG 10374, or the single A. butzleri field strain Yard J/c (approximately 5 X 10(9) CFU per piglet). Arcobacter spp. were cultured from rectal swab samples of all but one of the experimentally infected piglets at least once. At necropsy Arcobacter spp. were cultured from the liver, kidney, ileum, or brain tissues of two of the four A. butzleri-infected piglets. However, no severe gross pathology was noted. These data suggest that Arcobacter spp., especially A. butzleri, can colonize neonatal pigs. 3aArcobacter butzleri 3aArcobacter cryaerophilus 3aArcobacter skirrowii 3abrain 3acampylobacteriosis 3aileum 3akidneys 3aliver 3alungs 3amodels 3anecropsy 3apiglets 3atissues 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCampylobacterxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aCampylobacter Infectionsxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aCesarean Section 2aColostrum 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFemale 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPregnancy 2aSwine1 aBaetz, A.L.1 aLarson, D.J.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 June, v. 64, no. 6 p.2295-2299x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle01821naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245005800186300001600244500001500260520034500275650001400620650002800634650003100662650002200693650002200715650002100737650001100758650001000769650001100779650002200790650001600812650002200828650001500850650001400865650004000879650004100919653002200960653001300982653002300995653001101018653002201029773012601051852000901177856008501186930003301271946001101304655001201315IND4440429620221123041154.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444042962DNAL7 a205827302pmid7 a10.1007/s11017-010-9147-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoemaker, David 10aPersonal identity and bioethics: the state of the art  ap. 249-257.  a2019-12-04  aIn this introduction to the special issue of Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics on the topic of personal identity and bioethics, I provide a background for the topic and then discuss the contributions in the special issue by Eric Olson, Marya Schechtman, Tim Campbell and Jeff McMahan, James Delaney and David Hershenov, and David DeGrazia. 3abioethics 2aAbortion, Legalxethics 2aAdvance Directivesxethics 2aAlzheimer Disease 2aBioethical Issues 2aEthical Analysis 2aFemale 2aFetus 2aHumans 2aMental Competency 2aMetaphysics 2aPersonal Autonomy 2aPersonhood 2aPregnancy 2aTissue and Organ Harvestingxethics 2aTissue and Organ Procurementxethics 0aOrgan procurement 0aAbortion 0aAdvance directives 0aethics 0aPersonal identity0 tTheoretical medicine and bioethics.g2010 Aug., v. 31, no. 4 p.249-257dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1386-74157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11017-010-9147-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03811naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245011800166300001800284520175600302650002102058650001302079650001602092650001302108650001102121650001302132650001602145650003702161650001302198650001102211650002402222650001802246650001202264650001202276650001402288650001402302650001902316650002102335650002202356650004102378650002402419650001202443650003402455650003202489650002302521650005602544650001802600650002302618650003102641650002202672650002102694650001102715650002802726650001202754650001002766651001402776653002802790653001902818653001902837700001502856700002102871700002302892773008202915852000902997930003303006945001303039946001303052655001203065IND2056833920221123041150.0970501e199604  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205683392DNAL7 a86060842pmid7 aPMC1739092pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViboud, G.I.14aThe structural gene encoding human enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli PCFO20 is homologous to that for porcine 987P  ap. 1233-1239.  aPutative colonization factor PCFO20 was recently identified in an enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strain of serogroup O20 isolated from a child with diarrhea in Argentina. The gene encoding the structural subunit of PCFO20 fimbriae, fotA, was cloned from strain ARG-2 in the expression phage vector lambda ZAP Express. One positive clone, pGV29, that carried a 3.3-kb fragment was identified on the basis of fimbrillin production by using a monospecific rabbit anti-PCFO20 serum. Nucleotide sequencing of a 1.3-kb Sau3A-ClaI fragment of the subclone pGV292 containing the region coding for PCFO20 fimbrillin revealed two open reading frames of which one was complete. A Western blot (immunoblot) showed that the cloned protein, FotA, migrated like the PCFO20 fimbrial subunit protein did. Fimbriae were not detected on the surface of E. coli host bacteria containing pGV292 or pGV29, suggesting that the genes needed for assembly of PCFO20 fimbriae are lacking in both clones. The fotA gene encodes a 20,574-Da prefimbrillin protein which contains a 21-aminoacid signal sequence; the mature protein has a size of 18.1 kDa. The subunit protein FotA was found to be more homologous to the subunit of porcine 987P than to any fimbrial subunit produced by human ETEC. Alignments of the amino acid sequences of the two proteins indicate that they are partly identical, with an overall similarity of 82%. FotA fimbrillin was shown to be transported and assembled by the fimbria assembly machinery in porcine ETEC strain 987. PCFO20 and 987P may have evolved from a common ancestral gene. They are immunologically related but have affinity for different host cell receptors, since PCFO20-producing bacteria do not bind to neonatal piglet enterocytes. 3aWestern blotting 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3achildren 3aclones 3adiarrhea 3aenterocytes 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3afimbriae 3ahumans 3aopen reading frames 3aphage vectors 3apiglets 3arabbits 3areceptors 3aserotypes 3asignal peptide 3astructural genes 3atoxigenic strains 2aAdhesins, Escherichia colixgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialxgenetics 2aAntigens, Surfacexgenetics 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysisxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aFimbriae Proteins 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRabbits 2aSwine 3aArgentina 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u31413 0agenbank/u314141 aJonson, G.1 aDean-Nystrom, E.1 aSvennberholm, A.M.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 Apr., v. 64, no. 4 p.1233-1239x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03925naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002100193245006600214300001800280506007600298520160100374506003701975650000802012650001702020650001202037650001702049650001602066650001002082650001802092650002002110650001502130650000902145650001302154650002502167650001202192650001702204650001302221650002202234650001302256650002002269650001002289650001402299650001202313650003402325650002502359650002502384650001702409650002502426650001502451650002502466650001302491650002102504650002702525650003202552650002002584650002702604651001802631651001802649653002402667653002102691653001702712653002102729700002002750700001802770700002002788700001502808700002202823773011702845852000902962856009202971930003303063946001103096655001203107IND4440899820221207131334.0100806e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444089982DNAL7 a205841332pmid7 aPMC29210152pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04707.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGross, Briana L.10aSeeing red: the origin of grain pigmentation in US weedy rice  ap. 3380-3393.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWeedy forms of crop species infest agricultural fields worldwide and are a leading cause of crop losses, yet little is known about how these weeds evolve. Red rice (Oryza sativa), a major weed of cultivated rice fields in the US, is recognized by the dark-pigmented grain that gives it its common name. Studies using neutral molecular markers have indicated a close relationship between US red rice and domesticated rice, suggesting that the weed may have originated through reversion of domesticated rice to a feral form. We have tested this reversion hypothesis by examining molecular variation at Rc, the regulatory gene responsible for grain pigmentation differences between domesticated and wild rice. Loss-of-function mutations at Rc account for the absence of proanthocyanidin pigments in cultivated rice grains, and the major rc domestication allele has been shown to be capable of spontaneous reversion to a functional form through additional mutations at the Rc locus. Using a diverse sample of 156 weedy, domesticated and wild Oryzas, we analysed DNA sequence variation at Rc and its surrounding 4 Mb genomic region. We find that reversion of domestication alleles does not account for the pigmented grains of weed accessions; moreover, we find that haplotypes characterizing the weed are either absent or very rare in cultivated rice. Sequences from genomic regions flanking Rc are consistent with a genomic footprint of the rc selective sweep in cultivated rice, and they are compatible with a close relationship of red rice to Asian Oryzas that have never been cultivated in the US.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3acommon names 3acrop losses 3acrops 3adomestication 3agenetic markers 3ahaplotypes 3aloci 3amutation 3anucleotide sequences 3apaddies 3apigmentation 3apigments 3aproanthocyanidins 3ared rice 3aregulator genes 3aweeds 3awild rice 2aAlleles 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetics, Population 2aHaplotypes 2aLikelihood Functions 2aMutation 2aOryzaxgenetics. 2aPigmentationxgenetics 2aProanthocyanidinsxgenetics 2aSeedsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0acrop-weed evolution 0ade-domestication 0agrain colour 0aproanthocyanidin1 aReagon, Michael1 aXu, Shizhong.1 aCaicedo, Ana L.1 aJia, Yulin1 aOlsen, Kenneth M.0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 Aug., v. 19, no. 16 p.3380-3393dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04707.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20111218b20120106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03272naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245013500162300001800297520152300315650002001838650002401858650001401882650001101896650002001907650001901927650002001946650001001966650002001976650001701996650001402013650001302027650002202040650001602062650002102078650001702099650001302116650002402129650001202153650003302165650004702198650001802245650001102263650002002274650002802294650004602322650003202368650003602400651001102436700001502447700001702462700001702479773008202496852000902578930003302587945001302620946001302633655001202646IND2056874520221123041159.0970505e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205687452DNAL7 a86753072pmid7 aPMC1740362pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNene, V.10aConservation of the sporozoite p67 vaccine antigen in cattle-derived Theileria parva stocks with different cross-immunity profiles  ap. 2056-2061.  aImmunity to Theileria parva infection in cattle is often parasite stock specific. The antigenic diversity which is expressed at the schizont stage of the parasite together with a wild reservoir of the organism in buffalo has complicated the development of effective disease control by immunization. We have previously shown that about 70% of cattle inoculated with recombinant forms of p67, a sporozoite stage-specific surface antigen from the cattle-derived Muguga stock of the parasite, are immune to a homologous challenge. Thus, immune responses to p67 can play a role in immunity. The genes encoding this protein in five other parasite stocks have been sequenced. Here, we report that the p67 molecule encoded by four cattle-derived parasite stocks (Boleni, Uganda, Mariakani, and Marikebuni) that fall into different cross-immunity groups is identical in sequence to Muguga p67. The protein encoded by a buffalo-derived parasite exhibits 95% sequence identity with Muguga p67, the major difference being the presence of a 43-residue peptide insert. As predicted by these data, cattle inoculated with recombinant p67 can resist a heterologous cattle-derived parasite challenge. Seven of 12 cattle receiving a homologous Muguga challenge and 6 of 11 cattle receiving a heterologous Marikebuni challenge were immune to East Coast fever. These results extend earlier data suggesting that p67 is a conserved molecule and confirm its potential as a broad-spectrum vaccine antigen for the control of T. parva infection. 3aTheileria parva 3aantigenic variation 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3across immunity 3adisease control 3agenes 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aparasites 3apeptides 3asequence analysis 3asporozoites 3asurface antigens 3atheileriosis 3avaccines 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aAntigens, Protozoanxgeneticsximmunology. 2aBase Sequence 2aCattle 2aCross Reactions 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aProtozoan Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aTheileria parvaximmunology 2aVaccines, Syntheticximmunology 3aUganda1 aMusoke, A.1 aGobright, E.1 aMorzaria, S.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 June, v. 64, no. 6 p.2056-2061x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03204naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245017300164300001800337520126500355650001801620650002201638650001401660650001301674650001601687650001001703650002301713650001801736650002001754650001701774650002101791650002101812650001801833650001801851650002601869650000901895650001601904650001801920650003101938650001201969650003301981650003602014650003002050650002802080650001102108650001702119650002802136650002602164650000902190650002102199650006102220650002702281650005002308700002102358700001302379773008202392852000902474930003302483945001302516946001302529655001202542IND2056875520221123041219.0970505e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205687552DNAL7 a86753212pmid7 aPMC1740502pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebard, N.10aIntranasal immunization with SAG1 protein of Toxoplasma gondii in association with cholera toxin dramatically reduces development of cerebral cysts after oral infection  ap. 2158-2166.  aSAG1 protein of Toxoplasma gondii was evaluated as a protective antigen in mucosal immunization with cholera toxin as an adjuvant. CBA/J mice intranasally immunized with a combination of SAG1 and cholera toxin exhibited significantly fewer cysts in the brain after oral infection with the 76K strain of T. gondii than control mice. This acquired protection lasted at least 5 months. Protected mice developed high levels of serum anti-SAG1 immunoglobulin G antibodies as well as an enhanced systemic cellular response, as assessed by the proliferation of splenocytes in response to SAG1 restimulation in vitro. This cellular proliferation was associated with an increase of interleukin-2 and interleukin-5 synthesis and with barely detectable gamma interferon production. Splenic immune T cells were shown to convey modest protection to recipients against development of brain cysts following oral infection with T. gondii. Significant production of anti-SAG1 immunoglobulin A was induced in intestinal secretions of protected mice. These results indicate that intranasal immunization with SAG1 and cholera toxin can induce mucosal and systemic immune responses and affords partial and long-lasting resistance against the establishment of chronic toxoplasmosis. 3aT-lymphocytes 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aadjuvants 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3abrain 3acell proliferation 3acholera toxin 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-5 3aintestinal secretions 3amice 3asplenocytes 3atoxoplasmosis 2aAdministration, Intranasal 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aAntigens, Protozoanximmunology 2aCholera Toxinximmunology 2aCytokinesxbiosynthesis 2aFemale 2aImmunization 2aImmunotherapy, Adoptive 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred CBA 2aProtozoan Proteinsxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aToxoplasmaximmunology 2aToxoplasmosis, Cerebralxprevention & control1 aBuzoni-Gatel, D.1 aBout, D.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 June, v. 64, no. 6 p.2158-2166x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03527naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245015100167300001800318520155200336650002101888650002701909650002801936650002801964650002901992650001802021650001602039650001502055650001502070650002102085650002102106650001902127650001202146650001102158650002802169650001402197650001302211650003202224650001402256650002402270650006202294650001802356650003202374650001102406650002802417650001302445650001902458650004202477650005502519650003602574650001402610700002002624700001102644700001602655700001502671700001702686773008202703852000902785930003302794945001302827946001302840655001202853IND2056874020221123041239.0970505e199606  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205687402DNAL7 a86753022pmid7 aPMC1740312pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCirillo, D.M.10aIdentification of a domain in Rck, a product of the Salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid, required for both serum resistance and cell invasion  ap. 2019-2023.  aRck is encoded on the Salmonella typhimurium virulence plasmid and is a member of a family of related 17- to 19-kDa outer membrane proteins of Enterobacteriaceae, including Ail (Yersinia enterocolitica) and PagC (S. typhimurium). Structural models for these proteins predict eight membrane-spanning domains alternating with hydrophilic inner and outer loops. When expressed in Escherichia coli, Rck and Ail, but not PagC, confer high-level resistance to the bactericidal activity of complement as well as the ability to adhere to and invade mammalian cell lines. To identify functional domains of Rck, we made and screened random mutations in Rck for decreased bioactivity. We found that a single amino acid substitution (glycine to aspartic acid) in the putative third outer loop greatly reduced Rck-mediated serum resistance and eukaryotic cell invasion. We then constructed two chimeric proteins between Rck and PagC. Substitution of the C-terminal half of Rck with the corresponding PagC fragment containing both the third and the fourth outer loops abolishes the Rck-mediated serum resistance and invasion phenotypes. Substitution of Rck with a smaller C-terminal portion of PagC containing the fourth outer loop did not affect the invasive phenotype or serum resistance. These data reveal that the third putative outer membrane loop region is important for the virulence-associated properties of the Rck protein and suggest a similarity between the mechanism of serum resistance and epithelial cell invasion involving the same domain of Rck. 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aYersinia enterocolitica 3aamino acid substitution 3aantibacterial properties 3aaspartic acid 3ablood serum 3acell lines 3acomplement 3aepithelial cells 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahydrophilicity 3amammals 3amodels 3aouter membrane proteins 3aphenotype 3aplasmids 3arecombinant fusion proteins 3avirulence 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlood Bactericidal Activity 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmids 2aPoint Mutation 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgenetics 2aSalmonella typhimuriumximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aVirulence1 aHeffernan, E.J.1 aWu, L.1 aHarwood, J.1 aFierer, J.1 aGuiney, D.G.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 June, v. 64, no. 6 p.2019-2023x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle02922naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245017500125300001800300520150200318650002701820650001801847650002901865650001601894650003801910650002001948650002101968650001901989650001802008650001002026650001802036650000902054650002602063650001402089650005202103650001102155700001802166700001502184700001402199700001402213700001702227700001702244700001702261773008202278852000902360930003302369945001302402946001302415655001202428IND2056834220221123041209.0970501e199604  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205683422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakane, A.10aEndogenous interleukin-4, but not interleukin-10, is involved in suppression of host resistance against Listeria monocytogenes infection in gamma interferon-depleted mice  ap. 1252-1258.  aThe production and roles of endogenous interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 in a sublethal infection with Listeria monocytogenes were studied in normal mice and anti-gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) monoclonal antibody (MAb)-pretreated mice. In normal mice, the expression of mRNAs for IL-4 and IL-10, which was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR, was induced in the spleens and livers either early or late in infection, although the serum IL-4 and IL-10 were not detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In vivo administration of anti-IL-4 MAb showed no effect on antilisterial resistance, whereas anti-IL-10 MAb partially diminished the defense. In anti-IFN-gamma MAb-pretreated mice, a delay in the bacterial elimination from the spleens and livers was observed and high titers of serum IL-4 and IL-10 were induced late in infection. Production of endogenous IL-4 and IL-10 was suppressed in both CD4+ cell- and CD8+ cell-depleted mice. The suppression of antilisterial resistance in anti-IFN-gamma MAb-pretreated mice was canceled when anti-IL-4 MAb was injected late in infection, whereas anti-IL-10 MAb showed no effect. These results suggest that the host immune responses were polarized into the T-helper 2 phenotype in anti-IFN-gamma MAb-pretreated mice and that inhibition of host resistance against L. monocytogenes by depletion of IFN-gamma might be attributable to IL-4 produced by T cells polarized into the T-helper 2 phenotype as well as the inhibition of the IFN-gamma effects. 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aantibacterial properties 3ablood serum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-4 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aphenotype 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen1 aNishikawa, S.1 aSasaki, S.1 aMiura, T.1 aAsano, M.1 aKohanawa, M.1 aIshiwata, K.1 aMinagawa, T.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 Apr., v. 64, no. 4 p.1252-1258x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle03217naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001400149245012000163300001800283520163700301650002001938650001501958650001301973650002701986650002002013650003102033650002102064650001902085650002402104650001602128650001802144650000902162650002402171650001402195650001202209650001102221650001702232650004402249650002802293650000902321650002402330650002102354650003202375650003302407650002702440700001502467700001902482773008202501852000902583930003302592945001302625946001302638655001202651IND2056833020221123023240.0970501e199604  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205683302DNAL7 a86060722pmid7 aPMC1738972pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChong, C.10aDifferential production of interleukin-12 mRNA by murine macrophages in response to viable or killed Salmonella spp  ap. 1154-1160.  aThe use of attenuated Salmonella spp. as live oral vaccines and as vaccine carriers for foreign antigens has been extensively studied. We have shown that appropriately prepared nonviable organisms are as effective as viable organisms in eliciting humoral immune responses against a foreign antigen delivered by these vectors. It is not clear how strain viability affects the development of a cell-mediated immune response. In the present study, we demonstrate that BALB/c mice orally immunized with viable attenuated Salmonella spp. were protected against subsequent challenge while animals immunized with killed organisms were not. Protection was correlated with increased production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) p40 mRNA in the Peyer's patches within hours of oral administration. Peritoneal macrophages from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-responsive and LPS-unresponsive mice were also examined for production of IL-12 p40 mRNA following exposure to the viable or killed attenuated Salmonella carrier. There was dramatic upregulation of IL-12 p40 mRNA following exposure of macrophages to either viable or killed organisms. By 4 h postexposure, viable organisms had induced a 27-fold increase in IL-12 p40 mRNA levels while killed organisms had induced a 9-fold increase in IL-12 p40 mRNA levels. This was observed in macrophages isolated from both LPS-responsive and unresponsive mice. The higher levels of IL-12 induced by viable Salmonella spp. may result in the development of a Th1 response and cell-mediated immunity, while the lower levels of IL-12 induced by killed Salmonella spp. may not be sufficient to promote a Th1 response. 3aPeyer's patches 3aSalmonella 3aantigens 3acell-mediated immunity 3aedible vaccines 3agene expression regulation 3ahumoral immunity 3ainterleukin-12 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aoral administration 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aImmunization 2aInterleukin-12xbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMacrophagesxmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C3H 2aPeyer's Patchesxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aSalmonellaximmunology1 aBost, K.L.1 aClements, J.D.0 tInfection and immunity.g1996 Apr., v. 64, no. 4 p.1154-1160x0019-95677nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdCD1  aOther US 7aarticle02573naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008400128300001800212520126300230650002501493650002101518650003201539650002301571650002001594650002001614650001401634650001501648650001701663650001801680650002101698650001001719650003301729653002301762653003001785653001401815653001301829653001301842653001301855700001801868700001701886700001801903700001501921700001801936773007001954852000902024939003302033946001302066655001202079IND9300092220221123023048.0930106e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930009222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubasek, W.L.10aRegulation of flavonoid biosynthetic genes in germinating Arabidopsis seedlings  ap. 1229-1236.  aMany higher plants, including Arabidopsis, transiently display purple anthocyanin pigments just after seed germination. We observed that steady state levels of mRNAs encoded by four flavonoid biosynthetic genes, PAL1 (encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase 1), CHS (encoding chalcone synthase), CHI (encoding chalcone isomerase), and DFR (encoding dihydroflavonol reductase), were temporally regulated, peaking in 3-day-old seedlings grown in continuous white light. Except for the case of PAL1 mRNA, mRNA levels for these flavonoid genes were very low in seedlings grown in darkness. Light induction studies using seedlings grown in darkness showed that PAL1 mRNA began to accumulate before CHS and CHI mRNAs, which, in turn, began to accumulate before DFR mRNA. This order of induction is the same as the order of the biosynthetic steps in flavonoid biosynthesis. Our results suggest that the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway is coordinately regulated by a developmental timing mechanism during germination. Blue light and UVB light induction experiments using red light- and dark-grown seedlings showed that the flavonoid biosynthetic genes are induced most effectively by UVB light and that blue light induction is mediated by a specific blue light receptor. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3astructural genes 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3achalcone isomerase 3aoxidoreductases 3agene expression 3aseedlings 3aflavonoids 3abiosynthesis 3amessenger RNA 3aseed germination 3alight 3anaringenin-chalcone synthase 0agenetic regulation 0adihydroflavonol reductase 0apal1 gene 0achs gene 0achi gene 0adfr gene1 aShirley, B.W.1 aMcKillop, A.1 aGoodman, H.M.1 aBriggs, W.1 aAusubel, F.M.0 tPlant cell.g1992 Oct., v. 4, no. 10 p.1229-1236x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03238naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001800149245014000167300001800307500001500325520116000340650002501500650002101525650002201546650002501568650001801593650002501611650002101636650001601657650002401673650003801697650001801735650010001753650002501853650002301878650007801901650003101979650001702010650003202027650002802059650003002087650007202117650003902189650007902228653001602307653000802323653002802331653001602359653002502375653003302400653001902433700001602452700001902468773007002487852000902557939003302566946001302599655001202612IND9300092920221122225034.0930106e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930009292DNAL7 a14461712pmid7 aPMC1602172pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchindler, U.10aTGA1 and G-box binding factors: two distinct classes of Arabidopsis leucine zipper proteins compete for the G-box like element TGACGTGG  ap. 1309-1319.  a2019-12-04  aRegulatory elements containing the sequence ACGT are found in several plant promoters and are recognized by various basic/leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins. The Arabidopsis G-box binding factor 1 (GBF1), initially identified by its ability to bind to the palindromic G-box (CCACGTGG), also interacts with the TGACGT motif if this hexamer sequence is followed by either the dinucleotide GG--as found in the Hex motif of the wheat histone 3 promoter--or GT. Here we describe the isolation of an Arabidopsis bZIP protein, denoted TGA1, that also recognizes ACGT-containing sequences. However, TGA1 differs from members of the GBF family in the spectrum of base pair permutations flanking the ACGT sequence that are required for DNA binding. TGA1 primarily requires a TGACG motif and preferentially binds to those pentamers that are followed by a T residue, We show that although both TGA1 and GBF1 bind to the Hex motif (TGACGTGG), this binding can be distinguished on the basis of their specific DNA-protein contacts. Furthermore, TGA1 also differs from members of the GBF family in that it apparently does not form heterodimers with any member of this family. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3apromoter regions 3atransposons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aBasic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factorsxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBinding, Competitive 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Plant 2aLeucine Zippersxphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPlant Proteinsxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aRegulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aTranscription Factorsxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 0aembl/x68053 0aDNA 0amolecular sequence data 0addbj/x68053 0anucleotide sequences 0abasic/leucine zipper protein 0agenbank/x680531 aBeckman, H.1 aCashmore, A.R.0 tPlant cell.g1992 Oct., v. 4, no. 10 p.1309-1319x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04189naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001300149245018200162300001800344500001500362520200000377650001802377650002102395650002202416650002202438650002702460650002102487650002002508650001102528650002502539650001902564650002102583650004102604650001402645650002302659650002402682650003302706650001802739650003602757650002102793650004402814650001702858650007002875650002802945650002102973650004102994650002903035650001803064650003603082650005903118653001903177653002303196653001903219653000803238653002803246653001903274653004003293700001503333700001803348773007003366852000903436939003303445946001303478655001203491IND9300093120221122224902.0930106e199210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930009312DNAL7 a12833542pmid7 aPMC1602192pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, D.10aDifferential induction and suppression of potato 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase genes in response to Phytophthora infestans and to its elicitor arachidonic acid  ap. 1333-1344.  a2019-12-04  aInduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) is essential for the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoid phytoalexins and steroid derivatives in Solanaceous plants following stresses imposed by wounding and pathogen infection. To better understand this complex step in stress-responsive isoprenoid synthesis, we isolated three classes of cDNAs encoding HMGR (hmg1, hmg2, and hmg3) from a potato tuber library using a probe derived from an Arabidopsis HMGR cDNA. The potato cDNAs had extensive homology in portions of the protein coding regions but had low homology in the 3' untranslated regions. RNA gel blot analyses using gene-specific probes showed that hmg1 was strongly induced in tuber tissue by wounding, but the wound induction was strongly suppressed by treatment of the tissue with the fungal elicitor arachidonic acid or by inoculation with an incompatible or compatible race of the fungal pathogen Phytophthora infestans. The hmg2 and hmg3 mRNAs also accumulated in response to wounding, but in contrast to hmg1, these mRNAs were strongly enhanced by arachidonic acid or inoculation. Inoculation with a compatible race of P. infestans resulted in similar patterns in HMGR gene expression of hmg2 and hmg3 except that the magnitude and rate of the changes in mRNA levels were reduced relative to the incompatible interaction. The differential regulation of members of the HMGR gene family may explain in part the previously reported changes in HMGR enzyme activities following wounding and elicitor treatment. The suppression of hmg1 and the enhancement of hmg2 and hmg3 transcript levels following elicitor treatment or inoculation with the incompatible race parallel the suppression in steroid and stimulation of sesquiterpenoid accumulations observed in earlier investigations. The results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that there are discrete organizational channels for sterol and sesquiterpene biosynthesis in potato and other Solanaceous species. 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aarachidonic acid 3agene expression 3atubers 3anucleotide sequences 3aabiotic stress 3amultigene family 3ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductases 3ainfection 3adefense mechanisms 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArachidonic Acidxphysiology 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Single-Strandedxchemistry 2aEnzyme Induction 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Plant 2aHydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductasesxbloodxchemistryxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxchemistry 2aPhytophthoraxphysiology 2aRNAxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSolanum tuberosumxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 0agenbank/l01401 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/l01400 0aDNA 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l01402 0ahydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase1 aWard, B.L.1 aBostock, R.M.0 tPlant cell.g1992 Oct., v. 4, no. 10 p.1333-1344x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03797naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245013300189300001600322500002400338520143800362650002501800650002101825650002001846650002001866650003001886650001201916650001801928650001601946650002401962650003201986650002002018650002602038650001602064650003002080650001302110650001102123650003902134650005902173650003302232650004002265650007202305650007202377650006502449650001902514650001002533650003302543650005402576650005602630650006602686650005202752650007002804650003002874650005902904700002602963773010602989852000903095856005503104655001203159IND4410091020221122224925.0080912e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441009102DNAL7 a184948582pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01133.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Dong-Ping10aLight enhances the unfolded protein response as measured by BiP2 gene expression and the secretory GFP-2SC marker in Arabidopsis  ap. 360-368.  aIncludes references  aDisruption of the protein-folding capacity in the ER induces the accumulation of unfolded proteins and ER stress, which activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). Although UPR has been extensively studied in yeast and mammals, much less is known about UPR and its relationship with light in plants. Here, we examined the effects of chemically induced UPR and light on a molecular marker of UPR (binding protein, BiP2, gene expression) and a secretory green fluorescent protein marker (GFP-2SC) that is trafficked from the ER to vacuole in Arabidopsis thaliana (L). UPR, which was induced by DTT and tunicamycin (TM), increased Bip2 mRNA levels and decreased the levels of microsomal and vacuolar forms of GFP-2SC. Treatment with protease inhibitors lessened the effects of DTT and TM on GFP-2SC, indicating the decrease in GFP levels partially involved protein degradation. Light treatments synergistically enhanced the decrease in GFP levels in both the ER and vacuole and induced the expression of UPR marker genes for BiP2 and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1). DTT and TM treatments required light for maximal induction of the UPR. Light-induced UPR occurred during the daily dark to light cycle and when dark-adapted plants were exposed to light. We propose that light activates the UPR to increase the protein folding capacity in the ER to accommodate an increase in translation during dark to light transitions. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3abinding proteins 3agene expression 3agenetic markers 3agreen fluorescent protein 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3aphotoperiod 3aprotein degradation 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase 3aprotein folding 3aproteinase inhibitors 3atunicamycin 3aunfolded protein response 3avacuoles 3ayeasts 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDithiothreitolxpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aImmunoblotting 2aLight 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Foldingxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aProtein Transportxdrug effectsxradiation effects. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effectsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aTunicamycinxpharmacology 2aVacuolesxdrug effectsxmetabolismxradiation effects.1 aChristopher, David A.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2008 Oct., v. 134, no. 2 p.360-368dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2008.01133.x 7aarticle02357naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011000167300001600277500002400293500001500317520123300332650001701565650001201582650002401594650002101618650001601639650002101655650001901676650002101695650002101716653002501737700001501762700001501777700001501792773010001807852000901907856005501916655001201971IND4413081820081206000000.0081128e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441308182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0329.2008.00558.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Y.

Pinus densiflora, Pinus thunbergii, Pinus x rigitaeda (Pinus rigida x Pinus taeda), P. rigida x P. x rigitaeda, Pinus echinata and Pinus virginiana were inoculated with three spore loads (50, 500 and 5000 per tree) of F. circinatum. External symptoms, lesion length, and the frequency of reisolation of the fungus were investigated. External symptoms were greatest in P. echinata, followed by P. virginiana, however, P. densiflora was not susceptible to F. circinatum. Based on mean lesion lengths, the six pine species or hybrids differed significantly (p < 0.01) in susceptibility to pitch canker. Pinus echinata sustained the longest lesions, whereas P. densiflora sustained the shortest lesions. The effect of inoculum density was not significant among three spore treatments within species (p = 0.17), although lesion length was slightly greater at higher spore loads over all pine species. The fungus was reisolated from inoculated stems of all pine species tested, even on trees showing little or no damage from the disease. Additional studies are needed to further explore the basis for resistance to pitch canker. 3aPinus rigida 3ahybrids 3aFusarium circinatum 3aPinus thunbergii 3aPinus taeda 3ainoculum density 3aPinus echinata 3aPinus virginiana 3aPinus densiflora 0aGibberella circinata1 aWoo, K.-S.1 aKoo, Y.-B.1 aYeo, J.-K.0 tForest pathology.g2008 Dec., v. 38, no. 6 p.419-428dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1437-47817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0329.2008.00558.x 7aarticle02784naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001500172245006200187300001600249500002400265520122900289650002301518650002001541650001101561650001101572650001201583650001901595650002001614650002601634650001801660650001701678650001901695650001001714650002601724650001901750651001901769653002301788700001601811700001801827700001801845700001601863700002101879700001601900700001401916700001501930773009801945852000902043856008502052930003302137945002502170946001102195655001202206IND4382968320221122225017.0060821e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438296832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2005.12.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aJ500 0aQ1041 aZhao, F.J.10aEffects of sulphur on yield and malting quality of barley  ap. 369-377.  aIncludes references  aEight field experiments were conducted at four sites in the UK in 2003 and 2004 to investigate the effects of sulphur (S) application on yield and malting quality of barley. Significant yield responses to S additions were obtained in five out of the eight experiments, with yield increases ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 t/ha (4.7-22.5%). At the two most S-deficient sites, S application significantly increased malt diastatic power, alpha-amylase activity, friability and homogeneity, and decreased (1to3,1to4)-β-glucan concentration in the wort, indicating an improved endosperm modification during malting. Sulphur applications also significantly increased the concentration of S-methylmethionine (the precursor of dimethylsulphide) in kilned malt, which could impact on beer flavour. When the supply of N was limiting, S applications decreased grain N concentration due to a dilution effect as a result of increased grain yield. In some cases, S applications resulted in decreased grain size. At sites non-deficient or marginally deficient in S, applications of S had little effect on grain or malting quality parameters. The need to maintain an adequate S supply to barley for both yield and malting quality was demonstrated. 3asulfur fertilizers 3aHordeum vulgare 3asulfur 3ayields 3amalting 3amalting barley 3amalting quality 3afield experimentation 3aalpha-amylase 3abeta-glucans 3awort (brewing) 3akilns 3anutrient deficiencies 3asoil nutrients 3aUnited Kingdom 0aS-methylmethionine1 aFortune, S.1 aBarbosa, V.L.1 aMcGrath, S.P.1 aStobart, R.1 aBilsborrow, P.E.1 aBooth, E.J.1 aBrown, A.1 aRobson, P.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2006 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.369-377dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2005.12.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080124b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03156naa a2200469 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115245010100133300001600234500001500250520163500265650001701900650002101917650002401938650001301962650002801975650003802003650001902041650003102060650004502091650002202136650001102158650005202169650003702221650002802258650002402286650007502310650007402385651001802459653001302477653001502490773009302505852001302598939003302611945000802644946001302652852000902665655001202674991607592630742620221122213142.0930209e19930121xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930005942DNAL7 a84173842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL10aEffects of tocopherol and deprenyl on the progression of disability in early Parkinson's disease  ap. 176-183.  a2019-12-05  aBackground and Methods. In 1987 we began a multicenter controlled clinical trial of deprenyl (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) and tocopherol (a component of vitamin E that traps free radicals) in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease. We randomly assigned 800 patients to one of four treatments: placebo, active tocopherol and deprenyl placebo, active deprenyl and tocopherol placebo, or both active drugs. The primary end point was the onset of disability prompting the clinical decision to begin administering levodopa. An interim analysis showed that deprenyl was beneficial. We report the results of tocopherol treatment after a mean (+/-SD) follow-up of 14+/-6 months, as well as the follow-up results for deprenyl. Results. There was no beneficial effect of tocopherol or any interaction between tocopherol and deprenyl. The beneficial effects of deprenyl, which occurred largely during the first 12 months of treatment, remained strong and significantly delayed the onset of disability requiring levodopa therapy (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.62; P<0.001). The difference in the estimated median time to the end point was about nine months. The ratings for Parkinson's disease improved during the first three months of deprenyl treatment; the motor performance of deprenyl-treated patients worsened after the treatments were withdrawn. Conclusions. Deprenyl (10 mg per day) but not tocopherol (2000 IU per day) delays the onset of disability associated with early, otherwise untreated Parkinson's disease. The action of deprenyl that accounts for its beneficial effects remains unclear. 3adrug therapy 3aalpha-tocopherol 3avitamin supplements 3apatients 3anervous system diseases 3aamine oxidase (flavin-containing) 3adisease course 2aActivities of Daily Living 2aArrhythmias, Cardiacxchemically induced 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHumans 2aParkinson Diseasexcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aPsychiatric Status Rating Scales 2aPsychomotor Performance 2aRegression Analysis 2aSelegilinexadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 2aVitamin Exadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxtherapeutic use. 3aUnited States 0asymptoms 0ainhibitors0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1993 Jan. 21, v. 328, no. 3 p.176-183x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle03905naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002900171245014100200300001600341500002400357520173900381650001902120650002502139650002002164650002802184650000802212650001702220650001902237650001402256650002302270650001002293650001802303650001402321650001502335650001302350650001002363650002002373650001902393650002602412650004702438650003802485650003702523650003402560650002702594650004402621650002902665650005602694650002702750650003302777650003202810650002302842650002102865650003502886650001402921700001702935700002202952700001902974700003202993700002103025773010903046852000903155856005503164655001203219IND4431623220221122213137.0100122e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443162322DNAL7 a204472772pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2009.00599.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBORHAN, MOHAMMAD HOSSEIN10aWRR4, a broad-spectrum TIR-NB-LRR gene from Arabidopsis thaliana that confers white rust resistance in transgenic oilseed brassica crops  ap. 283-291.  aIncludes references  aWhite blister rust caused by Albugo candida (Pers.) Kuntze is a common and often devastating disease of oilseed and vegetable brassica crops worldwide. Physiological races of the parasite have been described, including races 2, 7 and 9 from Brassica juncea, B. rapa and B. oleracea, respectively, and race 4 from Capsella bursa-pastoris (the type host). A gene named WRR4 has been characterized recently from polygenic resistance in the wild brassica relative Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Columbia) that confers broad-spectrum white rust resistance (WRR) to all four of the above Al. candida races. This gene encodes a TIR-NB-LRR (Toll-like/interleukin-1 receptor-nucleotide binding-leucine-rich repeat) protein which, as with other known functional members in this subclass of intracellular receptor-like proteins, requires the expression of the lipase-like defence regulator, enhanced disease susceptibility 1 (EDS1). Thus, we used RNA interference-mediated suppression of EDS1 in a white rust-resistant breeding line of B. napus (transformed with a construct designed from the A. thaliana EDS1 gene) to determine whether defence signalling via EDS1 is functionally intact in this oilseed brassica. The eds1-suppressed lines were fully susceptible following inoculation with either race 2 or 7 isolates of Al. candida. We then transformed white rust-susceptible cultivars of B. juncea (susceptible to race 2) and B. napus (susceptible to race 7) with the WRR4 gene from A. thaliana. The WRR4-transformed lines were resistant to the corresponding Al. candida race for each host species. The combined data indicate that WRR4 could potentially provide a novel source of white rust resistance in oilseed and vegetable brassica crops. 3aAlbugo candida 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica juncea 3aCapsella bursa-pastoris 3aRNA 3ablister rust 3abreeding lines 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3aoilseed crops 3aparasites 3apathotypes 3aproteins 3araces 3avegetable crops 3awild relatives 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBrassicaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aChromosome Segregationxgenetics 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innatexgeneticsximmunology. 2aOomycetesxpathogenicity 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProteinsxgenetics 2aRNA Interference 2aSeedsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aVirulence1 aHolub, E.

For weevil control, alpha-amylase inhibitors and their genes could be used to genetically engineer weevil resistant seeds. Thirty genes encoding dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors were isolated from Triticum aestivum L. 'Chinese Spring' and characterized by nucleotide and amino acid sequence analysis. Eleven representative alpha-amylase inhibitor genes were identified, and the deduced amino acid sequences of these genes were of high coherence (95.1%). These inhibitors and others obtained from the wheat EST database were clustered into three groups, the genes from 'Chinese Spring' were present in each group. Specific primer sets were designed for each group, based on the SNPs of these genes, and the chromosome locations of each group of inhibitor genes investigated by amplification of the 'Chinese Spring' ditelosomic lines. There were two and one groups of inhibitor genes on chromosomes 3BS and 3DS, respectively, whereas no group of inhibitor genes was found on chromosome 3AS. Thus, the primer set for each group of inhibitor genes was genome allele-specific. The two known inhibitors, 0.53 and 0.19, were located on chromosomes 3BS and 3DS, respectively. The validity of the three genome allele-specific primer sets was confirmed by amplifications in 15 accessions of Triticum urartu, Triticum monococcum, Aegilops tauschii and Triticum dicoccoides. These results gave further support at the molecular level, that the 24 kDa dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors in cultivated wheat are encoded by a multigene family. 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aplant genetics 3aalleles 3aAegilops tauschii 3achromosomes 3aDNA primers 3awheat 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aTriticum aestivum 3apest resistance 3ainsect control 3amultigene family 3aalpha-amylase 3aCurculionidae 0agenome 0achromosome 3DS 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0achromosome 3BS1 aYan, Z.H.1 aWei, Y.M.1 aNevo, E.1 aBaum, B.R.1 aZheng, Y.L.0 tJournal of cereal science.g2006 May, v. 43, no. 3 p.360-368dAcademic Pressx0733-52107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2005.12.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080124b20080202c00000000  aINDd3CTe2007/12/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02169naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100001500172245010700187300001600294500002400310500001500334520075900349650001401108650000901122650002101131650001001152650002101162650001701183650001401200650001001214650001201224650003601236650002101272653002001293653002701313653001101340653002401351700001301375700001401388773009801402852000901500856008501509930003301594945002501627946001101652655001201663IND4382968820221122213123.0060821e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438296882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcs.2006.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF600 0aQ5041 aAshida, K.10aLack of 26 kDa globulin accompanies increased free amino acid content in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grains  ap. 387-392.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeed nitrogen content, protein composition and free amino acid content were determined in rice mutant lines with altered storage protein composition and their parental cultivars.

It has been suggested that vitamin A may be of benefit in the treatment of measles. We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial involving 189 children who were hospitalized at a regional center in South Africa because of measles complicated by pneumonia, diarrhea, or croup. The children (median age, 10 months) were assigned to receive either vitamin A (total dose, 400,000 IU of retinyl palmitate, given orally; n = 92) or placebo (n = 97), beginning within five days of the onset of the rash. At base line, the characteristics of the two groups were similar. Although clinically apparent vitamin A deficiency is rare in this population, the children's serum retinol levels were markedly depressed (mean [+/- SEM], 0.405 +/- 0.021 micromole per liter [11.6 +/- O.6 microgram per deciliter]), and 92 percent of them had hyporetinemia (serum retinol level <0.7 micromole per liter [20 microgram per deciliter]). Serum concentrations of retinol-binding protein (mean, 30.1 +/- 2.0 mg per liter) and albumin (mean, 33.4 +/- O.5 g per liter) were also low. As compared with the placebo group, the children who received vitamin A recovered more rapidly from pneumonia (mean, 6.3 vs. 12.4 days, respectively; P<0.001) and diarrhea (mean, 5.6 vs. 8.5 days; P<0.001), had less croup (13 vs. 27 cases; P = 0.03), and spent fewer days in the hospital (mean, 10.6 vs. 14.8 days; P = 0.01). Of the 12 children who died, 10 were among those given placebo (P = 0.05). For the group treated with vitamin A, the risk of death or a major complication during the hospital stay was half that of the control group (relative risk, 0.51; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.35 to 0.74). Treatment with vitamin A reduces morbidity and mortality in measles, and all children with severe measles should be given vitamin A supplements, whether or not they are thought to have a nutritional deficiency. 3avitamin A 3aclinical trials 3avitamin supplements 3amorbidity 3amortality 3ainfants 3achildren 2aAdministration, Oral 2aChild, Preschool 2aCroupxdrug therapy 2aDiarrheaxdrug therapy 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aMale 2aMeaslesxbloodxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aPneumoniaxdrug therapy 2aRandomized Controlled Trials as Topic 2aRetinol-Binding Proteinsxanalysis 2aSerum Albuminxanalysis 2aVitamin Axadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivativesxbloodxtherapeutic use. 0atreatment 0ameasles1 aKlein, M.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1990 July 19, v. . 323, no. 3 p.160-164x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02925naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245007200192300001600264500002400280520135100304650001601655650001701671650001401688650002401702650001301726650002401739650001201763650001901775650001701794650001401811650001001825650003901835650004801874650005001922650007301972650001002045650001302055650004302068650002902111650003002140650003002170650001702200700002702217773011102244852000902355856005502364655001202419IND4405406520221122213215.0080509e200806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440540652DNAL7 a182668982pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01797.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMOLAS, MARIA LIA10aPKS1 plays a role in red-light-based positive phototropism in roots  ap. 842-849.  aIncludes references  aAerial parts of plants curve towards the light (i.e. positive phototropism), and roots typically grow away from the light (i.e. negative phototropism). In addition, Arabidopsis roots exhibit positive phototropism relative to red light (RL), and this response is mediated by phytochromes A and B (phyA and phyB). Upon light stimulation, phyA and phyB interact with the phytochrome kinase substrate (PKS1) in the cytoplasm. In this study, we investigated the role of PKS1, along with phyA and phyB, in the positive phototropic responses to RL in roots. Using a high-resolution feedback system, we studied the phenotypic responses of roots of phyA, phyB, pks1, phyA pks1 and phyB pks1 null mutants as well as the PKS1-overexpressing line in response to RL. PKS1 emerged as an intermediary in the signalling pathways and appears to promote a negative curvature to RL in roots. In addition, phyA and phyB were both essential for a positive response to RL and act in a complementary fashion. However, either photoreceptor acting without the other results in negative curvature in response to red illumination so that the mode of action differs depending on whether phyA and phyB act independently or together. Our results suggest that PKS1 is part of a signalling pathway independent of phyA and phyB and that PKS1 modulates RL-based root phototropism. 3aArabidopsis 3aaerial parts 3acytoplasm 3agene overexpression 3alighting 3amechanism of action 3amutants 3aphotoreceptors 3aphototropism 3ared light 3aroots 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLight 2aMutation 2aPhosphoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhototropismxphysiology 2aPhytochrome Axmetabolism 2aPhytochrome Bxmetabolism 2aTime Factors1 aKiss, J.

As trees encroach into previously open habitat, the movement and population dynamics of above-treeline alpine species may be disrupted. This process is well documented in studies of the Rocky Mountain apollo butterfly (Parnassius smintheus). However, subtler consequences of treeline rise remain poorly understood. In this study, we examine whether treeline proximity affects feeding behaviour of P. smintheus larvae, due to altered habitat affecting the distribution and availability of their host plant, lance-leaved stonecrop (Sedum lanceolatum). Understanding differential larval exploitation of food resources in relation to the treeline is an important step in predicting the consequences of continued treeline rise. Parnassius smintheus larvae feed more intensively on S. lanceolatum away from the treeline despite the relative paucity of hosts in these areas, and despite higher fitness penalties associated with the plant's herbivory-induced chemical defenses. Sedum lanceolatum growing near the treeline is less attractive, and therefore represents a less significant resource for P. smintheus larvae than its abundance might imply. If treeline rise continues, we suggest that this pattern of altered resource exploitation may represent a mechanism by which larvae are adversely affected even while adult movement among and within meadows appears sufficient for maintaining population health, and total host availability seems ample. 3aParnassius smintheus 3aSedum 3aalpine meadows 3abutterflies 3afeeding behavior 3afoods 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3alarvae 3apopulation dynamics 3atreeline 3atrees 2aAltitude 2aAnimals 2aButterflies 2aClimate Change 2aEcosystem 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aLarva 2aMale 2aSedumxparasitology 2aTrees 3aRocky Mountain region 0aAlberta1 aRoland, Jens0 tOecologia.g2011 May, v. 166, no. 1 p.151-159dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1822-y 7aarticle03812naa a2200673 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245008000150300001600230520196600246650001902212650001202231650001302243650001502256650001902271650002302290650001402313650001702327650001602344650001202360650001302372650001602385650001102401650001302412650003802425650001502463650001002478650001002488650004002498650002202538650003802560650001102598650002602609650002902635650001102664650001902675650002802694650000902722650002402731650003702755650003802792650002202830650003202852653001602884653001802900653002402918700001602942773009202958852001303050939003303063945000803096946001303104852000903117655001203126991607591130742620221122175220.0910705e19910207xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910020192DNAL7 a18247922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaller, R.G.10aGlucose-induced exertional fatigue in muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency  ap. 364-369.  aBackground. The exercise capacity of patients with muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency is low and fluctuates from day to day. The basis of this variable exercise tolerance is unknown, but our patients with this disorder report that fatigue of active muscles is more rapid after a high-carbohydrate meal. Methods and Results. To determine the effect of carbohydrate on exercise performance, we asked four patients with muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency to perform cycle exercise under conditions of differing availability of substrate -- i.e., after an overnight fast, and during an infusion of glucose or triglyceride (with 10 U of heparin per kilogram of body weight) after an overnight fast. As compared with fasting and the infusion of triglyceride with heparin, the glucose infusion lowered plasma levels of free fatty acids and ketones, reduced maximal work capacity by 60 to 70 percent, and lowered maximal oxygen consumption by 30 to 40 percent. Glucose also increased the relative intensity of submaximal exercise, as indicated by a higher heart rate at a given workload during exercise. The maximal cardiac output (i.e., oxygen delivery) was not affected by varying substrate availability, but the maximal systemic arteriovenous oxygen difference was significantly lower during glucose infusion (mean +/- SE, 5.5 +/- 0.3 ml per deciliter) than after fasting (7.6 +/- 0.4 ml per deciliter, P < 0.05) or during the infusion of triglyceride with heparin (8.9 +/- 1.3 ml per deciliter, P < 0.05). Conclusions. In muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency, the oxidative capacity of muscle and the capacity for aerobic exercise vary according to the availability of bloodborne fuels. We believe that glucose infusion lowers exercise tolerance by inhibiting lipolysis and thus depriving muscle of oxidative substrate (plasma free fatty acids and ketones); this impairs the capacity of working muscle to extract oxygen and lowers maximal oxygen consumption. 3amuscle fatigue 3aglucose 3aexercise 3aheart rate 3acardiac output 3aoxygen consumption 3abreathing 3ablood plasma 3afatty acids 3aketones 3achildren 3aadolescents 3aadults 3apatients 3acarbohydrate metabolism disorders 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aFatiguexetiology 2aFatty Acids, Nonesterifiedxblood 2aFemale 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aHumans 2aKetonesxblood 2aLipolysisxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMusclesxenzymology 2aOxygen Consumptionxdrug effects 2aPhosphofructokinase-1xdeficiency 2aPhysical Exertion 2aTriglyceridesxpharmacology 0arespiration 0awork capacity 0aphosphofructokinase1 aLewis, S.F.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1991 Feb. 7, v. 324, no. 6 p.364-369x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL FNC  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aOther US  aDNAL 7aarticle02491naa a2200589 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001700097040001800114100002900132245017600161300001600337300002100353500001500374520061600389650001101005650002001016650001901036650001601055650002401071650002801095650001701123650001001140650005201150650003601202650001901238650002801257650002101285650001101306650003001317650001101347650001101358650005101369650000901420650003001429650001301459650006001472650004801532653003201580653002101612653002701633653002701660700002401687700002201711773009301733852000901826939003301835945000801868946001301876655001201889991607591120742620221122175206.0790830e19780817xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI794845232DNAL7 a6832642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHigginbottom, Marilyn C.12aA syndrome of methylmalonic aciduria, homocystinuria, megaloblastic anemia and neurologic abnormalities in a vitamin B12-deficient breast-fed infant of a strict vegetarian  ap. 317-323.  ap. 317-323. ill.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: A six-month-old infant with severe megaloblastic anemia, coma and hyperpigmentation of the extremities was studied.

This severe nutritional deficiency was a consequence of inadequate intake, for the infant was exclusively breast-fed by a strictly vegetarian mother who manifested methylmalonic aciduria. The importance of educating strict vegetarians about the deficiency of vitamin B12 in their diets and the importance of vitamin B12 supplementation is emphasized. 3aanemia 3avegetarian diet 3abreast feeding 3avitamin B12 3adeficiency diseases 3anervous system diseases 3acase studies 2aAdult 2aAmino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errorsxdiagnosis 2aAnemia, Megaloblasticxetiology 2aBreast Feeding 2aDiagnosis, Differential 2aDiet, Vegetarian 2aFemale 2aHomocystinuriaxdiagnosis 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Nutrition Disordersxetiologyxtherapy. 2aMale 2aMethylmalonic Acidxurine 2aSyndrome 2aVitamin B 12xadministration & dosagextherapeutic use. 2aVitamin B 12 Deficiencyxetiologyxtherapy. 0aInborn errors in metabolism 0aanemia (disease) 0amethylmalonic aciduria 0aSupplements (Nutrient)1 aSweetman, Laurence.1 aNyhan, William L.0 tNew England journal of medicine.g1978 Aug. 17, v. 299, no. 7 p.317-323x0028-47937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19790830c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02612naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002500158245014600183300001800329500002400347520146100371650002001832650004301852650002201895650002301917650002401940650002001964650001301984651001801997700001802015700002502033773011602058852000902174856007902183655001202262IND4408249320221122153050.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440824932DNAL7 a216324212pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.20071962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchönswetter, Peter10aTrans-Atlantic dispersal and large-scale lack of genetic structure in the circumpolar, arctic-alpine sedge Carex bigelowii s. l. (Cyperaceae)  ap. 1006-1014.  aIncludes references  aParadoxically, several of the ecologically most important plant groups in the Arctic are little understood in terms of taxonomy and biogeographic history. The circumpolar Carex bigelowii s. l. (Cyperaceae) is abundant in the Arctic and is one of the most complicated arctic plant groups. While its ecology and population genetics have been extensively studied, its taxonomy is largely unexplored. We analyzed the large-scale geographical structuring of amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) covering most of the distribution range. We detected high levels of genetic variation, most (66%) within populations, and a fairly weak genetic structure. Only the Central Asian populations, referred to as C. orbicularis, were strongly divergent. For the remaining populations, Bayesian clustering separated three distinct clusters (one European, one amphi-Atlantic, and one broadly amphi-Beringian), probably reflecting different major glacial refugia and recent transoceanic dispersal. The isolated central European populations were most closely related to those from a larger distribution area in northern Europe. Differences in genetic diversity suggest that the Alpine and Tatra populations have experienced strong bottlenecks, whereas the Krkonoše population may have been part of a continuous distribution area during the cold stages of the Pleistocene. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our results for a uniform, range-wide taxonomic concept. 3aCarex bigelowii 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic variation 3apopulation ecology 3apopulation genetics 3arefuge habitats 3ataxonomy 3aArctic region1 aElven, Reidar1 aBrochmann, Christian0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2008 Aug., v. 95, no. 8 p.1006-1014dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.20071963Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02647naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002000136245010500156300001800261500002400279520161400303650001401917650001201931650002001943650001901963650001001982650001001992650001502002650002102017651001802038651002702056700002302083700002002106773011102126852000902237856003902246655001202285IND4438877520221122114220.0100619e20100630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443887752DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.76192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhang, Kon Joon10aEstimating historic lake stages from one-time snapshot, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission of 2000  ap. 1834-1843.  aIncludes references  aLake studies play an important role in water management, ecology and other environmental issues. Monitoring lake stages is typically the first step on the lake studies. However, for the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America with millions of small lakes and potholes, onsite measurements for lake stages are almost impossible with the conventional gage stations due to the limited accessibility to lakes and the requirement of economical and human resources. To overcome this limitation, we employed the remote-sensing approach to extract lake stages in PPR for bulk processing. To estimate lake stages, several image-processing techniques were used with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data in January, 2000, a one-time snapshot useful in historic lake level reconstruction. In this research, image processing techniques, for example, averaging, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Lee-Sigma filtering were applied and masking with Canny Edge Detector (CED) and semi-automated contouring were developed for lake stage estimation. In terms of simplicity, averaging might be useful if 1·5 m of the local bias for the study area in stage estimates. However, the FFT and Lee-Sigma methods were slightly better than averaging. Masking with CED and semi-automated contouring provided outstanding accuracy in the estimation. The masking and contouring methods provided ± 0·5 m of stage differences for relatively large lakes greater than 10 km² when compared with stage reading in spite of their calculation complexities and was shown as the best approaches among implemented methods in this study. 3adetectors 3aecology 3ahuman resources 3aimage analysis 3alakes 3aradar 3atopography 3awater management 3aNorth America 3aPrairie Pothole region1 aSchwartz, Frank W.1 aPark, Seok-Soon0 tHydrological processes.g2010 June 30, v. 24, no. 13 p.1834-1843dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7619 7aarticle03155naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245011300186300001600299520095000315650001301265650001301278650001301291650001301304650002001317650001401337650001801351650001701369650001501386650001901401650002001420650002601440650001601466650002201482650002401504650001201528650005201540650003601592650003601628650006301664650002801727650004201755650003201797650001501829650002501844650002801869650001401897650002701911650002401938650002301962650001601985653001302001653001802014653001602032700002202048700002202070700003002092700001902122700002402141700002202165773010602187852000902293856008502302930003302387946001302420655001202433IND4440724420221122114248.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444072442DNAL7 a197899232pmid7 a10.1007/s10126-009-9226-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkamura, Yoshiko 10aIsolation and Characterization of a GDSL Esterase from the Metagenome of a Marine Sponge-associated Bacteria  ap. 395-402.  aUsing a metagenome library constructed from a bacterial associated with a marine sponge Hyrtios erecta, we identified a novel esterase that belongs to the SGNH hydrolase superfamily of esterases. The substrate specificity of EstHE1 was determined using p-nitrophenyl (pNP) ester (C2: acetate, C4: butylate, C6: caproate, C12: laurate, C16: palmitate). EstHE1 exhibited activity against C2 (5.6 U/mg), C4 (5.1 U/mg), and C6 (2.8 U/mg) substrates. The optimal temperature for EstHE1 esterase activity of the pNP acetate substrate was 40°C, and EstHE1 retained 60% of its enzymatic activity in the 30-50°C range. This esterase showed moderate thermostability, retaining 58% of its activity even after preincubation for 12 h at 40°C. EstHE1 also maintained activity in high concentrations of NaCl, indicating that this esterase is salt-tolerant. Thus, EstHE1 has the thermal stability and salt tolerance necessary for use as an industrial enzyme. 3aPorifera 3aacetates 3abacteria 3abutylate 3aenzyme activity 3aesterases 3ahexanoic acid 3ametagenomics 3apalmitates 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3asubstrate specificity 3atemperature 3athermal stability 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxclassificationxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aEnzyme Activationxdrug effects 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aEsterasesxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenome, Bacterialxgenetics 2aHydrolysis 2aMetagenomexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPoriferaxmicrobiology 2aSaltsxpharmacology 2aSequence Alignment 2aTemperature 0aEsterase 0aMarine sponge 0aGDSL family1 aKimura, Tomonori 1 aYokouchi, Hiroko 1 aMeneses-Osorio, Macarena 1 aKatoh, Masaya 1 aMatsunaga, Tadashi 1 aTakeyama, Haruko 0 tMarine biotechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 12, no. 4 p.395-402dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-009-9226-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03282naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245008600186300001600272520154700288650002401835650001301859650001301872650001401885650001001899650001001909650001501919650001001934650001101944650002301955650001201978650002101990650002002011650002602031650001202057650002102069650005702090650002402147650005702171650002402228653002602252653001502278653002302293653001402316700002102330700002402351700002602375700002502401700002302426773010502449852000902554856008502563930003302648946001102681655001202692IND4442575120221122114245.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444257512DNAL7 a205858102pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-010-1682-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPöykkö, Heikki 10aHost use of a specialist lichen-feeder: dealing with lichen secondary metabolites  ap. 423-430.  aHost use by herbivores is largely determined by host properties such as nutrient content and chemical defence against foragers. The impacts of these attributes on a herbivore may largely depend on its life cycle stage. Lichen species are known to differ in nutritional quality and level of chemical defence and, consequently, vary as fodder for herbivores. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of several lichen species and the presence of their secondary metabolites on their use as hosts by a specialist lichen-feeder, Cleorodes lichenaria. This study also addressed, for the first time, how a specialist lichen-feeder deals with different lichen secondary metabolites. In the beginning of their development, larvae grew better on Xanthoria parietina than on the other host lichens, whereas older larvae grew best on Ramalina fraxinea. Lichen secondary chemicals in R. fraxinea and Parmelia sulcata hindered larval growth in the beginning but after 75 days lichen secondary chemicals had no impact on the mass of larvae. Physodic acids in Hypogymnia physodes were lethal to larvae. In general, larvae metabolized 70-95% of ingested lichen secondary chemicals and the rest of these were excreted in frass. Lichen secondary metabolites in P. sulcata restrict and in H. physodes prevent their use as a host for C. lichenaria larvae. Our main finding, the ability of larvae to metabolize several lichen secondary metabolites, indicates digestive adaptation to these chemicals. No signs of sequestration of these chemicals were found. 3aHypogymnia physodes 3aParmelia 3aRamalina 3aXanthoria 3aacids 3afrass 3aherbivores 3ahosts 3alarvae 3alarval development 3alichens 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3asecondary metabolites 2aAnimals 2aFeeding Behavior 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aLichensxmetabolism 2aMothsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aSpecies Specificity 0aEvolution of host use 0aMetabolize 0aSecondary chemical 0aSequester1 aBačkor, Martin 1 aBencúrová, Elena 1 aMolcanová, Viktoria 1 aBačkorová, Miriam 1 aHyvärinen, Marko 0 tOecologia.g2010 Oct., v. 164, no. 2 p.423-430dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1682-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03232naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002900145245010200174300001600276500001500292520168700307650001401994650002302008650001402031650001102045650001302056650002002069650002802089650002802117650001302145650001102158650001602169650002802185650001202213650001802225650001402243650001102257650002302268653001702291700002802308700004402336700002902380700003802409700002702447773010202474852000902576856008502585930003302670946001102703655001202714IND4442649720221122231207.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444264972DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-010-9277-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMascarin, Gabriel Moura 10aPotential of a granulovirus isolate to control Phthorimaea operculella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae)  ap. 657-671.  a2019-12-04  aIn this study a Brazilian granulovirus strain, PhopGV, isolated from the potato tuber moth (PTM) Phthorimaea operculella, was investigated regarding its potential for biological control and in vivo production. The relationship between mortality of P. operculella larvae and virus concentration was determined at different temperatures on potato tubers and susceptibility of P. operculella to PhopGV was also determined on potato leaves. Virulence of PhopGV to P. operculella was not affected by temperatures from 18 to 30°C. The median lethal concentration (LC₅₀) of larvae fed on potato foliage treated with PhopGV was not higher than that verified with larvae fed on treated tubers. Optimal conditions for production of virus-infected larvae were obtained by using the virus suspensions of 41 × 10⁵, 6.3 × 10⁵ and 62 × 10⁵ OBs ml⁻¹ at 18, 24 and 30°C, which resulted in 32.0, 31.4 and 34.8% of infected larvae collected, respectively. The maximum percentage of infected larvae recovered from tubers was not affected by temperature. However, time for production of virus-infected larvae was longer at 18°C and shorter at 30°C. Persistence of PhopGV was determined on stored tubers and we observed that the virus remained effective for at least two months, causing up to 84.2% mortality of P. operculella at 1 × 10⁷ OBs ml⁻¹. The pathogen was also highly virulent to tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta, inflicting high percentage of mortality, delaying larval growth and inhibiting pupation. This Brazilian PhopGV strain has potential to control PTM larvae on potato tubers at a broad range of temperature and can be produced in vivo using virus-treated tubers. 3avirulence 3alarval development 3apathogens 3atubers 3apotatoes 3aBetabaculovirus 3aPhthorimaea operculella 3aKeiferia lycopersicella 3apupation 3alarvae 3atemperature 3alethal concentration 50 3aviruses 3aTuta absoluta 3amortality 3aleaves 3abiological control 0aGranulovirus1 aAlves, Sérgio Batista 1 aRampelotti-Ferreira, Fátima Teresinha 1 aUrbano, Mariana Ragassi 1 aDemétrio, Clarice Garcia Borges.1 aDelalibera, Italo Jr. 0 tBioControl.g2010 Oct., v. 55, no. 5 p.657-671dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1386-61417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10526-010-9277-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02725naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245017100172300001600343520128300359650002201642650001101664650001001675650000901685650001501694650001801709650001001727650001301737650001801750650002001768651001101788653002401799653001201823700001601835700001901851700001601870700001801886700002101904700001601925700001601941700001701957773012401974852000902098856009202107930003302199946001102232655001202243IND4440869520221122230958.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444086952DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01163.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMbabazi, Dismas10aIntra-lake stable isotope ratio variation in selected fish species and their possible carbon sources in Lake Kyoga (Uganda): implications for aquatic food web studies  ap. 667-675.  aThe stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ¹⁵N) and carbon (δ¹³C) provide powerful tools for quantifying trophic relationships and carbon flow to consumers in food webs; however, the isotopic signatures of organisms vary within a lake. Assessment of carbon and nitrogen isotopic signatures in a suite of plants, invertebrates, and fishes in Lake Kyoga, indicated significant variation between two sites for δ¹³C (paired t = 6.305; df = 14, P < 0.001 and δ¹⁵N paired t = 1.292; df = 14; P < 0.05). The fish fauna in Bukungu was generally more ¹³C enriched (mean δ¹³C = -16.37 ± 1.64[per thousand]) than in Iyingo (mean δ¹³C = -20.80 ± 2.41[per thousand]) but more δ¹⁵N depleted (mean δ¹⁵N = 5.57 ± 0.71[per thousand]) than in Iyingo (mean δ¹⁵N = 6.92 ± 0.83[per thousand]). The simultaneous shifts in phytoplankton and consumer signatures confirmed phytoplankton as the major source of carbon for the food chain leading to fish. Limited sampling coverage within lakes may affect lake wide stable isotope signatures, and the same error is transferred into trophic position estimation. Consideration of potential intra-lake spatial variability in isotope ratios and size is essential in evaluating the spatial and trophic structure of fish assemblages. 3aaquatic food webs 3acarbon 3afauna 3afish 3afood chain 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3anitrogen 3aphytoplankton 3astable isotopes 3aUganda 0aspatial variability 0atrophic1 aMakanga, B.1 aOrach-Meza, F.1 aHecky, R.E.1 aBalirwa, J.S.1 aOgutu-Ohwayo, R.1 aVerburg, P.1 aChapman, L.1 aMuhumuza, E.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2010 Sept., v. 48, no. 3 p.667-675dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01163.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02603naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245005200194300001800246520097600264650001701240650002601257650002301283650001501306650001401321650001501335650002101350650001401371650001201385650001201397650001701409650003801426650002701464650001501491650002301506650002401529650002301553653002401576653002301600653003001623653002801653653002701681653004901708700001801757700002601775773011501801852000901916856009201925930003302017946001102050655001202061IND4442502720221122212848.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444250272DNAL7 a206026262pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01511.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmitz, Oswald J.10aPredator control of ecosystem nutrient dynamics  ap. 1199-1209.  aPredators are predominantly valued for their ability to control prey, as indicators of high levels of biodiversity and as tourism attractions. This view, however, is incomplete because it does not acknowledge that predators may play a significant role in the delivery of critical life-support services such as ecosystem nutrient cycling. New research is beginning to show that predator effects on nutrient cycling are ubiquitous. These effects emerge from direct nutrient excretion, egestion or translocation within and across ecosystem boundaries after prey consumption, and from indirect effects mediated by predator interactions with prey. Depending on their behavioural ecology, predators can create heterogeneous or homogeneous nutrient distributions across natural landscapes. Because predator species are disproportionately vulnerable to elimination from ecosystems, we stand to lose much more from their disappearance than their simple charismatic attractiveness. 3abiodiversity 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aexcretion 3alandscapes 3apredator control 3apredators 3atourism 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aExtinction, Biological 2aFood Chain 2aPopulation Density 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPredatory Behavior 0aConsumptive effects 0aecosystem function 0aindirect predator effects 0anon-consumptive effects 0anutrient translocation 0apredator behaviour and nutrient distribution1 aHawlena, Dror1 aTrussell, Geoffrey C.0 tEcology letters.g2010 Oct., v. 13, no. 10 p.1199-1209dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01511.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03102naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001800158245014800176300001600324500002400340500001500364520160400379650001601983650001801999650003002017650002102047650001302068650001302081650002602094650001902120650001302139651001302152653003402165653003502199653002902234653003002263653002502293700001602318700002502334773009402359852000902453856008902462930003302551945002502584946001102609655001202620IND4383037220221122113849.0060824e20060820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438303722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aStigter, T.Y.10aApplication of a groundwater quality index as an assessment and communication tool in agro-environmental policies - Two Portuguese case studies  ap. 578-591.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA simple methodology based on multivariate analysis is developed to create a groundwater quality index (GWQI) and a composition index (GWCI), with the aim of monitoring the joint influence of agriculture on several key parameters of groundwater chemistry and potability. The methodology is based on the definition of two standard water samples of high and low quality that, together with the actual data, are run through a statistical algorithm known as correspondence factor analysis. The applicability of the constructed indices as an assessment and communication tool is evaluated in two case studies in the south of Portugal. Index maps are created, providing a comprehensive picture of the contamination problem and easily interpretable for people outside the scientific domain. Such maps could be particularly useful in agro-environmental policies such as Nitrates Directive 91/676/EEC. Drawn up in order to reduce the environmental load of nutrients from agriculture, its implementation continues to be very problematic in most EU member states. In the case studies, the GWQI maps reveal that groundwater quality in the upper aquifers is extremely low, with an almost complete absence of potable water. However, the impact of agricultural activity on the groundwater composition shows a large spatial variability, which is accurately depicted by the GWCI maps and mainly related to crop type and aquifer lithology. In addition, contamination-freshening sequences occur and are displaced by groundwater flow, partly affected by faults that form either preferential flow paths or flow barriers. 3acartography 3awater quality 3agroundwater contamination 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3aaquifers 3amultivariate analysis 3ahydrochemistry 3anitrates 3aPortugal 0agroundwater composition index 0acorrespondence factor analysis 0anitrate vulnerable zones 0agroundwater quality index 0astatistical analysis1 aRibeiro, L.1 aCavalho Dill, A.M.M.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2006 Aug. 20, v. 327, no. 3-4 p.578-591dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.12.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20070821b20070902c00000000  aINDdRHFe2007/08/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02408naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245009400145300001400239500001500253520097800268650001301246650001701259650001701276650001601293650001301309650001201322650001601334650001201350650001601362650004601378650002701424650001101451650001801462650001101480650003901491650002601530650001501556650002601571650000901597650005501606650001201661653003201673700001801705700001801723773009401741852000901835939003301844946001301877655001201890IND8904147120221122090017.0890801e198907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890414712DNAL7 a25020052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAusman, L.M.10aProtein-calorie malnutrition in squirrel monkeys: adaptive response to calorie deficiency  ap. 19-29.  a2019-12-04  aControl, low protein, low-calorie, and low-protein-plus-low-calorie diets were fed to 37, 14, 8, and 16 infant squirrel monkeys, respectively, from ages 2-8 wk. The deficient diets were planned to prevent growth and were designed to examine the short- and long-term effects of defined nutritional restrictions on body weight, food intake, hematocrit, plasma albumin, growth hormone, and cortisol concentrations. During the restriction period, plasma albumin levels were significantly decreased in both groups with a protein restriction component; plasma cortisol levels were significantly increased only in the low protein and low calorie groups. No significant group differences were observed for hematocrit or plasma growth hormone. Results of this study indicate that 1) energy restriction did not seem to modify the protein requirement for weight maintenance and 2) animals fed low-protein diets, even in the face of growth failure, have a mechanism for wasting energy. 3aalbumins 3asomatotropin 3ablood plasma 3akwashiorkor 3acortisol 3aSaimiri 2aAge Factors 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEating 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aGrowth Disordersxbloodxetiology. 2aGrowth Hormonexblood 2aHematocrit 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aMale 2aProtein-Energy Malnutritionxbloodxcomplications. 2aSaimiri 0aprotein energy malnutrition1 aGallina, D.L.1 aHegsted, D.M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g1989 July, v. 50, no. 1 p.19-29x0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03457naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100001300181245010200194300001600296500018400312500002400496500001500520520170600535650002902241650001602270650001802286650001902304650002302323650001902346650002002365650002102385650003002406650001302436650001502449650001202464650002402476653002702500700001302527700001402540700001602554773019402570852000902764856008502773930003302858945002502891946001102916655001202927IND4383041920221122090025.0060824e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438304192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-005-0039-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aF500 0aW000 0aJ5001 aChen, Y.10aMolecular evidence of genetic modification of Sinorhizobium meliloti: enhanced PCB bioremediation  ap. 561-566.  aIn the special issue: Environmental Biotechnology.

It has the well-known ability to interact specifically with the leguminous alfalfa plant, Medicago sativa. Our previous work has shown enhanced degradation of the nitroaromatic compound 2,4-dinitrotoluene (DNT) when a plasmid containing degradative genes was introduced in it. In this study we report molecular evidence of the transfer of a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-biodegradative plasmid pE43 to S. meliloti strain USDA 1936. Several standard analytical tests and plant growth chamber studies were conducted to test the ability of S. meliloti to degrade 2',3,4-PCB congener. Alfalfa plant alone was able to degrade 30% of PCBs compared with control. No enhanced dechlorination was noted when alfalfa plant was grown with wild-type S. meliloti, and when alfalfa plant was grown with the S. meliloti electrotransformants (genetically modified) dechlorination of PCBs was more than twice that when alfalfa plant was grown with wild-type S. meliloti. When alfalfa plant was grown with uncharacterized mixed culture (containing nodule formers), almost equally significant PCB degradation was observed. The significance of this work is that the naturally occurring nitrogen-fixing soil bacterium S. meliloti (genetically modified) has the ability to enhance fertility of soil in association with the leguminous alfalfa plant while simultaneously enhancing bioremediation of PCB-contaminated soils. Enhanced bioremediation of PCB and robust alfalfa plant growth was also noted when uncharacterized mixed cultures containing alfalfa plant nodule formers were used. 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3arhizosphere 3asoil bacteria 3asoil pollution 3aaromatic compounds 3abioremediation 3aMedicago sativa 3aEnsifer meliloti 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aplasmids 3apollutants 3aalfalfa 3agenetic engineering 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aAdam, A.1 aToure, O.1 aDutta, S.K.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2005 Dec., v. 32, no. 11-12 p.561-566dPublished by Stockton Press on behalf of the Society for Industrial Microbiologyx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-005-0039-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/09/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02844naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245010900171300001600280500002400296500001500320520128600335650001601621650001001637650002801647650001001675650001501685650001101700650001201711650002001723650001301743650001001756650002501766650001601791650001501807650001401822650002101836650001301857650001701870650002401887650001401911653003101925653001401956700001801970773014701988852000902135856007702144930003302221945002502254946001102279655001202290IND4383008320221122055531.0060822e20060415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438300832DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.24252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aYalla, S.R.10aEffect of semolina and absorption level on extrusion of spaghetti containing non-traditional ingredients  ap. 841-848.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSpecific mechanical energy (SME), mechanical energy, extrusion rate and temperature of extruded spaghetti were monitored to determine the effects of semolina, hydration level and non-traditional ingredients on pasta extrusion using a semi-commercial pasta press with a fixed screw speed of 25 rpm.

Environment pollution by toxic metals occurs globally through military, industrial, and agricultural processes and waste disposal. Bioremediation processes are the target of recent research and are considered low-cost, ecofriendly methods to alleviate the current problems of water decontamination, particularly for remote and rural areas. The present piece of work reports the unexploited sorption properties of the powdered seed of the plant Moringa oleifera (SMOS) for the removal of Arsenic [As(III) and As(V)] from aqueous solutions. Sorption studies, using standard practices, result in the standardization of optimum conditions such as biomass dosages (2.0 g), metal concentrations (25 ppm), contact time (60 min) and volume of the test solutions (200 ml) at pH 7.5, for As(III) and pH 2.5 for As(V). Maximum sorption for As(III) and As(V) species is 60.21 and 85.6%, respectively. Protein/Amino acid-Arsenic interactions are found to play an important role in the biosorption process using plant biomass SMOS. 3aMoringa oleifera 3aphytoremediation 3abiomass 3aarsenic 3apollutants 3awater pollution 3aaqueous solutions1 aSharma, P.1 aSrivastava, S.1 aSrivastava, M.M.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2005 Dec., v. 32, no. 11-12 p.521-526dPublished by Stockton Press on behalf of the Society for Industrial Microbiologyx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-005-0042-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/09/26  aNon-US 7aarticle04064naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001500164245016700179300001600346500002400362520254200386650001602928650001502944650001202959650003202971650001303003650001103016650001403027650002503041650001303066650002003079650001103099650002203110650001503132650001703147650001603164700001503180700001803195700001603213700001503229773014703244852000903391856007703400930003303477945002503510946001103535655001203546IND4383007920221122055744.0060822e20060415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438300792DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.24192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL2101 aBiswas, P.10aEfficiency of nutrient utilization and reproductive performance of pre-pubertal anestrous dairy heifers supplemented with inorganic and organic chromium compounds  ap. 804-815.  aIncludes references  aAn on-farm trial was conducted to ascertain the effects of chromium supplementation on the nutrient utilization and reproductive performance of cross-bred (Bos taurus x Bos indicus) pre-pubertal anestrous dairy heifers. Chromium was supplemented (0, 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg-1 diet dry matter) as chromium chloride hexahydrate or chromium-yeast complex. The intake of the total digestible nutrients (P < 0.01) and body weight gain (P < 0.05) increased with supplementation of chromium. Chromium-yeast supplementation resulted in a dose-dependent increment (P < 0.01) in the total digestible nutrient intake. Intake and apparent absorption of chromium increased linearly (P < 0.001) with the dose. Chromium chloride tended to be better absorbed (P < 0.10) than the chromium-yeast complex. The source of supplemental chromium did not affect the plasma concentrations of glucose, cholesterol, total protein and albumin. The postprandial plasma glucose concentration in the control group increased by 38% versus 0.27 and 1.1% in the heifers supplemented with 1.0 mg Cr kg-1 dry matter as chromium chloride and chromium-yeast complex, respectively. The postprandial increment in the plasma cholesterol was also generally lower in the supplemented heifers. The plasma chromium concentration varied (P < 0.05) between the groups, although it was difficult to correlate these changes with the sources and doses of supplemental chromium. Chromium chloride and chromium-yeast supplementation resulted in similar changes in the plasma concentrations of copper, zinc, iron and manganese (P > 0.05). Plasma concentrations of copper and zinc, which increased (P < 0.001) with chromium supplementation, declined quadratically (P < 0.05) as the dose of supplemental chromium increased. At the end of the supplementation, two, four and three heifers fed with 0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg Cr kg-1 dry matter (as chromium chloride), respectively, developed Graffian follicles and showed estrus; the numbers were one, three and four in the corresponding groups fed with chromium-yeast complex and one, two and three heifers amongst them showed estrus. All the supplemented animals showing estrus conceived and no abortion was reported during the first trimester of their pregnancy. It was concluded that chromium supplementation could appreciably enhance the nutrient utilization and the reproductive performance in anestrous dairy heifers and inorganic trivalent chromium (CrCl3.6H2O) supplementation might be as useful as a chromium-yeast complex for this purpose. 3acow feeding 3adairy cows 3aheifers 3adietary mineral supplements 3achromium 3ayeasts 3achlorides 3anutrient utilization 3aanestrus 3anutrient uptake 3aestrus 3apregnancy outcome 3abiomarkers 3ablood plasma 3ametabolites1 aHaldar, S.1 aPakhira, M.C.1 aGhosh, T.K.1 aBiswas, C.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2006 Apr. 15, v. 86, no. 5 p.804-815dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.24193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/12/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02828naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001800146245012700164300001600291500002400307500001500331520115900346650001701505650001401522650002201536650004301558650001801601650002001619650001201639650001301651650001901664650001701683650002501700650001701725653001701742653002801759653002501787653001201812653002001824653001601844653001501860700002001875700001301895700001801908700001501926700001901941773014701960852000902107856007702116930003302193945002502226946001102251655001202262IND4383007220221122055717.0060822e20060415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438300722DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.24112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aMulinacci, N.10aEvaluation of lignans and free and linked hydroxy-tyrosol and tyrosol in extra virgin olive oil after hydrolysis processes  ap. 757-764.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe describe chemical hydrolytic procedures to evaluate the total amount of tyrosol and hydroxy-tyrosol free and/or linked to secoiridoidic molecules (acid hydrolysis). At the same time a rapid determination of the lignans in complex minor polar compound (MPC) extracts is proposed (alkaline hydrolysis). High-performance liquid chromatography/diode array detection (HPLC/DAD) and HPLC/MS were applied as reference methods to evaluate the quantitative results from the hydrolysis experiments. The optimized acid hydrolysis procedures were first applied to an oleuropein standard and then to MPC fractions extracted from several commercial extra virgin olive oils. The results confirm the applicability of the method, consisting in the acid hydrolysis of complex mixtures of secoiridoidic derivatives, to determine the antioxidant potential in terms of MPC. These data can contribute to forecasting the potential ageing resistance of an extra virgin olive oil in terms of antioxidant potency. Finally, alkaline hydrolysis allows confirmation and easy determination of the amount of lignans, especially in those MPC fractions which are particularly complex. 3acrosslinking 3aolive oil 3achemical analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3arapid methods 3aacid hydrolysis 3alignans 3aresinols 3aalkalinization 3asecoiridoids 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 0aoptimization 0asecoiridoidic molecules 0aacvetoxy-pinoresinol 0atyrosol 0ahydroxy-tyrosol 0apinoresinol 0ahydrolysis1 aGiaccherini, C.1 aIeri, F.1 aInnocenti, M.1 aRomani, A.1 aVincieri, F.F.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2006 Apr. 15, v. 86, no. 5 p.757-764dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.24113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/12/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02843naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245007100171300001600242500002400258500001500282520145800297650001701755650001401772650001101786650002701797650002001824650002501844650001201869650001501881650001301896650001801909650001301927650003601940650001101976651001101987653001501998653002002013700001402033773014702047852000902194856007702203930003302280945002502313946001102338655001202349IND4383007320221122055550.0060822e20060415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438300732DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.24122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF1201 aSéguin, P.10aPhytoestrogen content of alfalfa cultivars grown in eastern Canada  ap. 765-771.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAlfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) contains several phytoestrogens that may have health-promoting effects in humans. In this study, the concentrations of three phytoestrogens (apigenin, coumestrol, and luteolin) of ten field-grown alfalfa cultivars were determined in the seeding and post-seeding year at two sites in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC, Canada. Herbage and phytoestrogen yield per hectare were concurrently determined. Differences between cultivars were only observed for apigenin concentration and yield and coumestrol yield. There was a 37% variation between cultivars in apigenin concentration. Site-by-harvest interactions and harvest main effects were observed for the concentration and yield of all three phytoestrogens. There was a 2- and 2.5-fold variation in coumestrol and luteolin concentrations, respectively, between harvests of both sites. Coumestrol concentration was lower in harvests of the seeding than of the post-seeding year. Luteolin concentration fluctuated during the five harvests at one site, but was greater in the seeding than in the post-seeding year at the other site. There was a 5.4-fold variation in apigenin concentration between harvests of both sites, concentrations being lower in the seeding (avg. 173 micrograms g-1 DM) than in the post-seeding year. Results suggest that choice of cultivars have limited impact on alfalfa phytoestrogen concentration, which, however, greatly differ between harvests and sites. 3aharvest date 3acultivars 3asowing 3ageographical variation 3aMedicago sativa 3alongitudinal studies 3aalfalfa 3acoumestrol 3aluteolin 3aplant density 3aapigenin 3achemical constituents of plants 3ayields 3aQuebec 0aharvesting 0aplant estrogens1 aZheng, W.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2006 Apr. 15, v. 86, no. 5 p.765-771dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.24123Available from publisher's Web site  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd4CTe2007/12/01  aNon-US 7aarticle
