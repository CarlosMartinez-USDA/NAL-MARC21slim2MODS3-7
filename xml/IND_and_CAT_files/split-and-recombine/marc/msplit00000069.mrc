An industrial spray wash cabinet was used to deliver water (W), 1.5 and 3.0% lactic (LA) or acetic (AA) acid, or 12% trisodium phosphate (TSP) washes. Fresh unaltered bovine feces spiked with antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria innocua, and Clostridium sporogenes were used to inoculate BCT prior to all treatments. The effect of treatments on bacterial populations was tracked by monitoring levels of specific-antibiotic-resistant (marked) bacteria along with mesophilic aerobic bacteria (APC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and pseudomonads for up to 21 days of storage at 5 degrees C. Initial APC levels of approximately 5.6 log CFU/cm2 were reduced by 1.3 to 2.0 log CFU/cm2 by LA, AA, and TSP treatments. Marked bacteria were reduced to <1.3 log CFU/cm2, remaining that way throughout the 21-day storage. TSP treatments were not different in effectiveness from acids for controlling growth of E. coli O157:H7 and C. sporogenes, but were less effective for APC, L. innocua, or LAB. The aerobic bacteria, L. innocua, and LAB had counts greater than or equal to 7 log CFU/cm2 by 7 days in all but one case and by 14 days all had counts >7 log CFU/cm2 on the untreated controls and water-washed samples. Treatments generally added a degree of safety regarding the foodborne pathogens and pathogen models used for the present study when beef tissue was stored up to 21 days and in no case did the treatments appear to offer any competitive advantage to select microorganisms on BCT. 3abeef 3acattle 3ameat carcasses 3amicrobial contamination1 aCutter, C.N.1 aSiragusa, G.R.0 tJournal of food protection.g1997 June, v. 60, no. 6 p.619-624x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02703naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009000125300001600215520190200231650002102133650001902154650002102173653002402194700001302218700001602231773009802247852000902345930003302354945001302387946001302400655001202413IND2163501820221119035256.0980820e199706  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216350182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, G.D.10aSurvival and growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in unpasteurized and pasteurized milk  ap. 610-613.  aEscherichia coli O157:H7, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome, has been responsible for several outbreaks associated with consumption of unpasteurized and improperly processed pasteurized milk, and yogurt. Studies were conducted to determine the survival and growth characteristics of this pathogen in unpasteurized milk and pasteurized milk (3.5% fat, 2% fat, skim) at 5, 8, 15, and 22 degrees C for up to 28 days. Two levels of inocula (10(3) and 10(5) CFU/ml) of a mixture of five nalidixic acid-resistant E. coli O157:H7 strains were used. E. coli O157:H7 did not grow at 5 degrees C and decreased by 1.6 to 2.0 log CFU/ml in 28 days. Growth occurred at 8 degrees C, with an approximately 1- to 2-log CFU/ml increase within the first 4 days. About a 3- to 5-log CFU/ml increase in E. coli O157:H7 populations was observed at 15 degrees C within the first 3 days. In 3 pasteurized milk samples, E. coli O157:H7 continued to grow to populations of greater than 1.0 X 10(8) CFU/ml at day 7 and remained constant during the remainder of the incubation period. At 22 degrees C, the pH decreased rapidly to less than 4.0 within 4 days and E. coli O157:H7 decreased to undetectable populations within 14 days. E. coli O157:H7 grew more slowly (P < 0.01) in unpasteurized milk, which had a higher initial microbial population, than in pasteurized milks at 8, 15, or 22 degrees C, likely because of antagonistic activity from preexisting bacteria. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in survival or growth of E. coli O157:H7 were observed among the pasteurized milk samples, regardless of fat concentration, at all temperatures throughout the study. The data indicate that temperature abuse during shipping and handling can result in significant growth of E. coli O157:H7. Holding milk at less than or equal to 5 degrees C is recommended to prevent growth of this pathogen. 3apasteurized milk 3apasteurization 3aEscherichia coli 0ahemorrhagic colitis1 aZhao, T.1 aDoyle, M.P.0 tJournal of food protection.g1997 June, v. 60, no. 6 p.610-613wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01543naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009500129300001600224520074700240650002700987650001301014650001401027650001801041650002601059650001601085773008401101852000901185930003301194945001301227946001301240655001201253IND2163483820221119035230.0980818e199704  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216348382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarthy, S.A.10aEvaluation of the Listertest method for quantitation of Listeria monocytogenes in seafoods  ap. 424-425.  aThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration most probable number (MPN) method and the Listertest (immunomagnetic capture) were used to enumerate Listeria monocytogenes on laboratory-inoculated cooked crabmeat (Callinectus sapidus) and cold-smoked salmon (Salmo salar).

Mangoes are large vigorous tropical trees that are traditionally grown at low density as suitable vigour reducing technologies are not commercially available. The aim of this work was to identify rootstock cultivars for mango that reduced scion vigour while maintaining or boosting yields. Ninety rootstocks are being evaluated for their ability to reduce vigour in two Australian mango scion cultivars from the National Mango Breeding Program (NMBP); ‘NMBP-1243’ and ‘NMBP-4069’. The evaluated rootstocks were sourced from a wide genetic range within Mangifera indica and related Mangifera spp. from the Australian National Mango Gene Bank and the Australian Mango Breeding Program. Rootstock-scion combinations were field planted at Walkamin, Queensland, Australia over three years, from May 2014 in randomised incomplete blocks. Tree height, canopy depth, canopy length (along the row), canopy width (across the row), rootstock trunk diameter (10 cm above the ground and 10 cm below the graft point) and scion diameter (10 cm above the graft) were measured every six months as indicators of tree growth and vigour. This is a report on the progress of 29 rootstocks from the May 2014 planting. There was a significant (p<0.05) effect of rootstock on tree height, canopy size and trunk diameter at 24 months. Seven rootstocks were consistently among the 13 lowest vigour trees for tree height, canopy length, canopy width and scion/rootstock trunk diameters, when ranked from lowest to highest vigour.

Cytotoxic benzophenanthridine alkaloids are accumulated in certain species of Papaveraceae and Fumariaceae in response to pathogenic attack and, therefore, function as phytoalexins. The berberine bridge enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from elicited cell-suspension cultures of Eschscholtzia californica, and partial amino acid sequences have been determined. A cDNA, isolated from a lambda-gt11 cDNA bank of elicited E. californica cell-suspension cultures, coded for an open reading frame of 538 amino acids. The first 22 amino acids constitute the putative signal peptide. The mature protein has a Mr of 57,352, excluding carbohydrate. The berberine bridge enzyme was heterologously expressed in a catalytically active form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Southern hybridization with genomic DNA suggests that there is only one gene for the enzyme in the E. californica genome. Hybridized RNA blots from elicited E. californica cell-suspension cultures revealed a rapid and transient increase in poly(A)+ RNA levels that preceded both the increase in enzyme activity and the accumulation of benzophenanthridine alkaloids, emphasizing the integral role of the berberine bridge enzyme in the plant response to pathogens. 3abiosynthesis 3afungal diseases of plants 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aoxidoreductases 3anucleotide sequences 3aEschscholzia californica 3aenzyme activity 3aphytoalexins 2aAlkaloidsxpharmacology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEnzyme Induction 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotides 2aOxidoreductases, N-Demethylatingxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhenanthrenesxpharmacology 2aPlantsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 0acloning 0agenbank/m77150 0amolecular sequence data 0amolecular genetics1 aKutchan, T.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1991 Nov. 15, v. 88, no. 22 p.9969-9973x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03313naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001800148245011300166300002000279520152600299650002001825650002501845650002201870650001301892650002501905650001401930650002301944650002301967650002001990650002002010650001702030650003002047650003402077650002402111650001802135650003802153650001802191650001902209650003802228650002802266650003102294650003002325650001802355650001302373650002802386650003502414650002502449700001602474700001802490700001502508773014502523852000902668939003302677946001302710655001202723IND9202361720221119035212.0920429e19911115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920236172DNAL7 a19464572pmid7 aPMC529282pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeuhaus, J.M.12aA short C-terminal sequence is necessary and sufficient for the targeting of chitinases to the plant vacuole  ap. 10362-10366.  aTobacco contains different isoforms of chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14), a hydrolase thought to be involved in the defense against pathogens. Deduced amino acid sequences for putatively vacuolar, basic chitinases differ from the homologous extracellular, acidic isoforms by the presence of a C-terminal extension. To examine the role of this C-terminal extension in protein sorting, Nicotiana silvestris plants were stably transformed with chimeric genes coding for tobacco basic chitinase A with and without the seven C-terminal amino acids. In plants expressing unmodified chitinase A, the enzyme activity was low in the intercellular wash fluid but high in protoplasts and isolated vacuoles. In contrast, in plants expressing mutant chitinase lacking the C terminus, the activity was high in the intercellular wash fluid but low in protoplasts. N. silvestris plants were also transformed with similar constructions coding for a structurally unrelated, extracellular cucumber chitinase. In plants expressing unmodified cucumber chitinase, its activity was present in the intercellular wash fluid and absent from protoplasts. In plants expressing cucumber chitinase with the C-terminal extension from tobacco chitinase A, activity was low in intercellular wash fluids but high in protoplasts and vacuoles. These results demonstrate that the C-terminal extension of tobacco chitinase A is necessary and sufficient for the vacuolar localization of chitinases and, therefore, that it comprises a targeting signal for plant vacuoles. 3aCucumis sativus 3aNicotiana sylvestris 3aNicotiana tabacum 3avacuoles 3aamino acid sequences 3achitinase 3adefense mechanisms 3adisease resistance 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3apolypeptides 3afungal diseases of plants 3aplant secretions and exudates 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aChitinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNAxgenetics 2aImmunoblotting 2aIsoenzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotides 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPlasmids 2aProtoplastsxenzymology 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aVacuolesxenzymology1 aSticher, L.1 aMeins, F.

A dietician who spoke Asian languages interviewed patients using a questionnaire designed to ascertain whether carbohydrates, artificial sweeteners, meat, fish, and herbal remedies were used. Patients received dietary advice according to recommendations of the British Diabetic Association (1982) and modified to suit an Asian diet, with special reference to foods consumed by Asians. Patients were given a diet sheet in the appropriate language with recommendations on limitation for sugar, butter, and margarine consumption. It was found that patients continued to take simple sugar in the form of "gur" and sweets such as gulab jamans and burfi, which contain 17 to 50% of carbohydrate--mainly sugar. The amount of milk consumed per person per day estimated to be between 1 and 2 pints. It was concluded that a more detailed evaluation of dietary habits is needed and emphasis should be placed on specific foods and an understanding of sociocultural implications of eating practices. 3atraditional foods 3adiabetes 3adiet counseling 3adietary surveys 3aAsians 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDiabetes Mellitusxpsychology 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 3aUnited Kingdom 0aAsiaxethnology. 0aEngland 0afeeding habits1 aCampbell, J.E.1 aSpalding, D.L.1 aPanja, K.K.1 aNeogi, S.K.1 aBurden, A.C.0 tHuman nutrition : applied nutrition.g1987 June, v. 41A, no. 3 p.160-163x0308-43297nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19881014c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01711naa a2200313 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001900115245008700134300001400221300002800235520084000263650001101103650001201114650002301126650002201149650001201171650001201183653002401195700001801219773008701237852000901324939003301333945000801366946001101374655001201385991583118040742620221119035229.0821209s1982    xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820013282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClugston, G.A.14aThe response of protein and energy metabolism to food intake in lean and obese man  ap. 57-70.  ap. 57-70. ill., charts.  aContinuous 24 hour intravenous infusions of radioactive leucine were given to 10 obese and 5 lean subjects to study protein turnover in relation to food intake. Food was consumed in equal hourly meals during the initial 12 hours; no food was allowed for the remaining 12 hours. Rates of protein synthesis and leucine oxidation were higher during the feeding phase, and protein breakdown was higher during fasting. This response did not appear dependent on sex or body weight. Although changes in protein synthesis with feeding paralleled those in oxygen consumption, there was no correlation between oxygen consumption and whole body protein turnover within homogenous groups of fed or fasted subjects.

Either a C16:2 or a C16:3 acyl chain is attached to the nonreducing end subunit, whereas the sulfate group is bound to the reducing glucosamine. One of the tetrasaccharides is identical to the previously described NodRm-1 factor. The two pentasaccharides as well as NodRM-1 were purified and tested for biological activity. In the root hair deformation assay the pentasaccharides show similar activities on the host plants Medicago sativa and Melilotus albus and on the non-host plant Vicia sativa at a dilution of up to 0.01-0.001 micromoles in contrast to NodRM-1, which displays a much higher specific activity for Medicago and Melilotus than for Vicia. The active concentration range of the pentasaccharides is more narrow on Medicago than on Melilotus and Vicia. In addition to root hair deformation, the different Nod factors were shown to induce nodule formation on M. sativa. We suggest that the production of a series of active signal molecules with different degrees of specificity might be important in controlling the symbiosis of R. meliloti with several different host plants or under different environmental conditions. 3asymbiosis 3aplant growth substances 3aVicia sativa 3aMedicago sativa 3aEnsifer meliloti 3agene expression 3anodulation 3aoligosaccharides 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aCarbohydrate Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aLipopolysaccharidesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgenetics 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSinorhizobium melilotixchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSymbiosis 0amelilotus alba 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aQuiclet-Sire, B.1 aKondorosi, E.1 aVirelizier, H.1 aGlushka, J.N.1 aEndre, G.1 aGero, S.D.1 aKondorosi, A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 Jan. 1, v. 89, no. 1 p.192-196x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02706naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245010200178300001600280500001500296520133300311650004701644650001001691650000901701650001901710650003401729650002301763650003601786650001501822650002001837650002401857653003001881653004401911653003701955700001701992700001702009773009002026852000902116856007802125930003302203945001302236946001102249655001202260IND2053477520221119035143.0961010e199606  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205347752DNAL7 a241666212pmid7 a10.1007/BF002240342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanhuanpaa, P.K.10aMapping of a QTL for oleic acid concentration in spring turnip rape (Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera)  ap. 952-956.  a2019-12-05  aBulk segregant analysis was used to search for RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) markers linked to gene(s) affecting oleic acid concentration in an F2 population from the Brassica rapa ssp. oleifera cross Jo4002 X a high oleic acid individual from line Jo4072. Eight primers (= 8 markers) out of 104 discriminated the 'high' and 'low' bulks consisting of extreme individuals from the oleic acid distribution. These markers were analysed throughout the entire F2 population, and their association with oleic acid was studied using both interval mapping and ANOVA analysis. Six of the markers mapped to one linkage group. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) affecting oleic acid concentration was found to reside within this linkage group with a LOD score > 15. The most suitable marker for oleic acid content is OPH-17, a codominant marker close (< 4cM) to the QTL. The mean seed oleic acid content in the F2 individuals carrying the larger allele of this marker was 80.14 +/- 9.76%; in individuals with the smaller allele, 54.53 +/- 6.83%; in the heterozygotes, 65.47 +/- 8.15%. To increase reproducibility, the RAPD marker was converted into a SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) marker with specific primers. Marker OPH-17 can be used to select spring turnip rape individuals with the desired oleic acid content. 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aseeds 3aloci 3alinkage groups 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 3achromosome mapping 3achemical constituents of plants 3aoleic acid 3agenetic markers 3aquantitative traits 0abulked segregant analysis 0asequence characterized amplified region 0agenetic techniques and protocols1 aVilkki, J.P.1 aVilkki, H.J.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1996 June, v. 92, no. 8 p.952-956x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002240343Available from publisher's Web site  a19961101b19961107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02739naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001400148245009600162300001600258500001500274520100000289650002501289650002001314650001601334650001601350650003701366650002501403650002401428650001201452650001801464650004401482650002301526650001801549650002001567650002001587650002501607650003001632650002001662650001001682650002801692650004101720650001401761650002301775653001901798653001201817653001901829653002801848653002301876700001601899700001301915700001501928773013901943852000902082939003302091946001302124655001202137IND9203506620221119035044.0920602e19920101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920350662DNAL7 a13460652pmid7 aPMC481972pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHui, C.C.10aMolecular characterization and silk gland expression of Bombyx engrailed and invected genes  ap. 167-171.  a2019-12-05  aGenetic analysis in Drosophila has shown that engrailed (en) plays an important role in segmentation and neurogenesis. A closely related gene, invected (in), is coexpressed with en in the posterior developmental compartments where en is known to specify cell state. We report here the isolation of two en-like cDNAs from the middle silk glands of Bombyx mori larvae. Sequence analysis revealed that they are the counterparts of Drosophila en and in. Four highly conserved domains, including the homeodomain, were identified in these En and In proteins from Bombyx and Drosophila. In addition, two en-specific and one in-specific domains could also be found. These structurally homologous genes might share a similar role in Bombyx development. They were found to be coexpressed in the middle silk gland but not in the posterior silk gland during the fourth molt/fifth intermolt period. We speculate that these Bombyx en-like genes might be involved in the compartmentalization of the silk gland. 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3asilk glands 3aBombyx mori 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBombyxxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNAxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Homeobox 2aHomeodomain Proteins 2aInsect Hormonesxgenetics 2aInsect Proteins 2aLarva 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxchemistry 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Alignment 0agenbank/m64335 0acloning 0agenbank/m64336 0amolecular sequence data 0amolecular genetics1 aMatsuno, K.1 aUeno, K.1 aSuzuki, Y.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 Jan. 1, v. 89, no. 1 p.167-171x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02457naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245009700162300001600259520152100275650002201796650000901818650001101827650002201838650001301860650001501873700001801888773020801906856004402114852000902158655001202167IND60638554020221119035105.0190430e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063855402DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.54.5.8722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMicovic, Zoran10aInvestigation of the model complexity required in runoff simulation at different time scales  ap. 872-885.  aThe “optimal” model complexity is defined as the minimum watershed model structure required for realistic representation of runoff processes. This paper examines the effects of model complexity at different time scales, daily and hourly. Two watershed models with different levels of complexity were constructed and their capability to simulate runoff from a watershed was evaluated. Both models were tested on the same watershed using identical meteorological input, thereby assuring that any difference between model outputs is due only to their model structure. It is demonstrated that, at a daily time scale, a simple model gives good results. For the mountain situation, in which snowmelt is a dominant influence, the nonlinearity of the runoff processes is moderate, and therefore a simple model works well. The model produced good results over a period of 28 years of continuous simulation. However, this simpler model was inadequate when tested on an hourly time scale due to greater nonlinear effects, especially when modelling high-intensity rainfall events. Therefore, the hourly simulation benefited from the more complex model structure. These model results show that optimal watershed model complexity depends on temporal resolution, namely the simulation period and the computational time step. It was shown that certain process representations and model parameters that appeared unimportant during the long-term simulation had significant effects on the short-term extreme event model simulation. 3ahydrologic models 3arain 3arunoff 3asimulation models 3asnowmelt 3awatersheds1 aQuick, M.

After being exposed to periods of low (chill units, CU) and high temperatures (growing degree hours, GDH), the tree is able to break its dormancy, flower and sprout. Chill requirements are calculated according to Richardson and Dynamic models. Heat requirements are estimated as the mean hourly temperatures minus 4.5°C, between the breaking of dormancy and the full flowering time (when 50% of flowers are open, F50). For a suitable flowering, vegetative growth, and fruit set, chilling requirements have to be fully satisfied. In the cold areas, where the new almond orchards are being stablished, late-flowering is an obligatory trait to avoid late frosts. 'Tardona', bred in CEBAS-CSIC, is the latest flowering almond cultivar released in the world up to now. In this work, chilling requirements for breaking dormancy and heat requirements for flowering of 'Tardona' were calculated by two methods for two seasons. 3aPrunus dulcis 3aPrunus jacquemontii 3aalmonds 3acold 3acold treatment 3acultivars 3adormancy 3adormancy breaking 3adynamic models 3aflowering date 3afruit set 3agenotype 3aheat 3aplant breeding 3atemperature 3atrees 3avegetative growth1 aMartinez-Gomez, P.1 aDicenta, F.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019 Jan. 31, , no. 1231 p.7-10dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1231.2  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245019300164300001800357520129900375650001601674650001401690650001901704650001601723650001101739650001301750650001801763650000701781650001801788650001601806650001101822700002001833773010601853852000901959856008501968930003302053946001102086655001202097IND4413442320221119034138.0081205e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441344232DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-008-0856-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhushan, Ravi 10aDirect TLC Resolution of (±)-Ketamine and (±)-Lisinopril by Use of (+)-Tartaric Acid or (-)-Mandelic Acid as Impregnating Reagents or Mobile Phase Additives.

Enantiomerically pure tartaric acid and mandelic acid were used as chiral impregnating reagents and as mobile phase additives. When (-)-mandelic acid was used as chiral impregnating reagent use of ethyl acetate-methanol-water 3:1:1 (v/v) as mobile phase enabled successful resolution of the enantiomers of both compounds. For lisinopril, the mobile phase acetonitrile-methanol-water-dichloromethane 7:1:1:0.5 (v/v) was successful when (+)-tartaric acid was used as impregnating agent. When (+)-tartaric acid was used as mobile phase additive the mobile phase acetonitrile-methanol-(+)-tartaric acid (0.5% in water, pH 5)-glacial acetic acid 7:1:1.1:0.7 (v/v) enabled successful resolution of the enantiomers of lisinopril. The effects on resolution of temperature, pH, and the amount of chiral selector were also studied. The separated enantiomers were isolated and identified. Spots were detected with iodine vapour. LODs were 0.25 and 0.27 μg for each enantiomer of ketamine with (+)-tartaric acid and (-)-mandelic acid, respectively, whereas for lisinopril LODs were 0.14 and 0.16 μg for each enantiomer with (+)-tartaric acid (both conditions) and (-)-mandelic acid, respectively. 3aacetic acid 3aadditives 3achromatography 3aenantiomers 3aiodine 3aketamine 3amandelic acid 3apH 3atartaric acid 3atemperature 3avapors1 aAgarwal, Charu 0 tChromatographia.g2008 Dec., v. 68, no. 11-12 p.1045-1051dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-008-0856-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20081205b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01965naa a2200457 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245006600150300001400216300001900230520071000249650001800959650001500977650001200992650002301004650002001027650001001047650000901057650004301066650003101109650002201140650001101162650001101173650002001184650002601204650004201230650000901272650001601281650001901297650002501316773009301341852000901434939003301443945000801476946001101484655001201495991583105150742620221119033825.0861118e198601  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860114562DNAL7 a39577092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallance, S.10aPlatelets, leucocytes and buffy layer vitamin C after surgery  ap. 35-41.  ap. 35-41. ill.  aA 10-day study examined post-operative changes in buffy layer ascorbic acid (BLAA) with respect to leucocyte and platelet counts in 107 surgical patients.

The importance of monitoring the PLR in BLAA measurements is pointed out.(wz) 3aascorbic acid 3aleukocytes 3asurgery 3aanalytical methods 3ablood platelets 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAscorbic Acidxbloodxtherapeutic use. 2aBlood Plateletsxanalysis. 2aBlood Transfusion 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLeukocytesxanalysis. 2aLeukocytosisxdrug therapyxetiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPlatelet Count 2aPostoperative Period0 tHuman nutrition : clinical nutrition.g1986 Jan., v. 40C, no. 1 p.35-41x0308-43297nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19861118c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03064naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001300148245012500161300002000286500001500306520122100321650002401542650001701566650001701583650001001600650002501610650002101635650002501656650001301681650003501694650002401729650003301753650001801786650002301804650004501827650003501872650003101907650002401938650001101962650003401973650002302007650002802030650002702058650002102085650001302106650002402119650003602143653002802179653002302207653001902230700001402249773014402263852000902407939003302416946001302449655001202462IND9203017720221119033855.0920515e19911201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920301772DNAL7 a19617452pmid7 aPMC530152pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, S.14aThe plastid genome of Cryptomonas phi encodes an hsp70-like protein, a histone-like protein, and an acyl carrier protein  ap. 10783-10787.  a2019-12-05  aThe plastid genome of Cryptomonas phi, a cryptomonad alga, contains three genes that have not previously been found in any organellar genome. Each of these genes encodes a functional class of organellar gene product not previously reported. The first gene, dnaK, encodes a polypeptide of the hsp70 heat shock protein family. The predicted amino acid sequence of the DnaK protein is 54% identical to that of the Escherichia coli hsp70 protein (DnaK), 50-53% identical to that of two nucleus-encoded mitochondrial hsp70 proteins, and 43-46% identical to that of several eukaryotic cytoplasmic members of the hsp70 protein family. The second gene, hlpA, encodes a polypeptide resembling bacterial histone-like proteins. The predicted amino acid sequence of the HlpA protein is 25-53% identical to that of several bacterial histone-like proteins, and the identity increases to 39-76% over a conserved region corresponding to the long arm that binds DNA. The third gene, acpA, encodes an acyl carrier protein, which is a key cofactor in the synthesis and metabolism of fatty acids. Its predicted amino acid sequence is 36-59% identical to that of eubacterial and plant chloroplast (nucleus-encoded) acyl carrier proteins. 3aheat shock proteins 3apolypeptides 3agenetic code 3aalgae 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3agenomics 2aAcyl Carrier Proteinxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNAxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aEukaryotaxgenetics 2aGenome 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgenetics 2aHistonesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOrganellesxphysiology 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPlasmids 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0amolecular sequence data 0aalgae and seaweeds 0agenbank/m765471 aLiu, X.Q.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1991 Dec. 1, v. 88, no. 23 p.10783-10787x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02174naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245012000160300001600280520114700296650002001443650001101463650001501474650001601489650001501505651001401520700001401534700002101548700003001569773020801599856004401807852000901851655001201860IND60638551420221119033803.0190430e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063855142DNAL7 a10.1623/hysj.54.3.6062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShao, Quanxi12aA new method for modelling flow duration curves and predicting streamflow regimes under altered land-use conditions  ap. 606-622.  aThe impact of changes in land-use/cover on streamflow at short time scales is evaluated by examining the changes in the flow duration curve (FDC) before and after land-use/cover change. The FDC characterizes the relationship between the magnitude and frequency and hence provides the complete range of streamflow over time. Two issues need to be considered in predicting the FDC due to land-use changes: (a) the appropriate parametric form of the FDC that enables application of the same expression of FDCs before and after the changes; and (b) the ability of parameters to capture and characterize the effect of land-use changes. In this paper, we propose a model which is a four-parameter double power form as a function of the FDC, where the two hydrological parameters represent the mean annual flow ([Qbar]) and the cease-to-flow point (τ expressed as a percentage), while the other two parameters (α and β) determine the shape of the FDC. The properties of this function are investigated in order to assign parameters to cope with the land-use changes. The model is used for several typical catchments in Australia for demonstration. 3aland use change 3amodels 3aprediction 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3aAustralia1 aZhang, Lu1 aChen, Yongqin D.1 aSingh, V.

The second backcross progeny showed greater recombination frequencies for 75% of the pairs of adjacent markers, but there was no obvious indication that this effect was localised to particular regions of the chromosomes. Four chromosomes increased in genetic length more than twofold, while overall, the total map was 66% longer. The possible causes of this discrepancy are analysed. A sex difference in chiasma distribution and/or frequency at meiosis is thought to be the most likely explanation. The implications of this finding for mapping and map-based applications are discussed. 3aBrassica oleracea var. alboglabra 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3abackcrossing 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aloci 3alinkage groups 3aBrassica oleracea var. italica 3amales 3agender differences 3aisozymes 3achromosome morphology 3afrequency 3achromosome mapping 3alength 3ainterspecific hybridization 3afemales 3agenetic markers 3agenetic recombination 0achromosomes 0aBrassica oleracea 0agenetic length 0amale meiosis1 aRamsay, L.D.1 aJennings, D.E.1 aLydiate, D.J.1 aBohuon, E.J.R.1 aMarshall, D.F.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1996 Mar., v. 92, no. 3/4 p.363-367x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL  a19960801b19960808c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01845naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245006800142300001800210500001500228520053100243650001600774650002500790650002300815650001900838650002200857650002300879650002600902650005300928650005300981650002301034650001301057650003601070650002801106650002401134650002201158651001001180653002001190653001501210700001201225700001501237773007001252852000901322939003301331946001101364655001201375IND9200432420221119033604.0920130s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920043242DNAL7 a13678412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Z.J.10aPhenylpropanoid and iridoid glycosides from Pedicularis spicata  ap. 3745-3747.  a2019-12-04  aOne new phenylpropanoid glycoside, pedicularioside H, and five known glycosides, gardoside methyl ester, shanzhiside methyl ester, 5-deoxypulchelloside 1, verbascoside and pedicularioside A, were isolated from whole plants of Pedicularis spicata.

Twenty-five F1 hybrids and their parents were studied for their organogenesis ability in a randomized block design with four replications. Each replication per genotype consisted of ten petri dishes with four explants. Regeneration medium consisted of full MS medium modified by the addition of hormones and solidified with 6g/l agar. Statistical analysis showed that both general and specific combining abilities were significant for all of the organogenesis parameters studied, and both showed several significant positive or negative values. General combining ability values were usually higher than those of specific combining ability, indicating the importance of additive genetic control for organogenesis parameters in sunflower. Narrow-sense heritability for the number of explants producing shoots and roots was 65.8%, which suggests that organogenesis of currently inferior inbred lines in sunflower should be improved in a crossing program. 3aorganogenesis 3acytoplasmic male sterility 3atissue culture 3aHelianthus annuus 3ashoots 3aexplants 3acotyledons 3ageneral combining ability 3acrossing 3ainbred lines 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3aroots 3aspecific combining ability 0aregeneration 0aembryo (plant) 0anarrow sense heritability1 aRoustan, J.P.1 aFallot, J.1 aAlibert, G.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1996 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.225-229x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002233793Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01464naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005800127300001800185520065400203650002400857650001300881650002200894650002500916650001200941650002300953653001600976700001800992700001701010773007001027852000901097939003301106946001101139655001201150IND9200430820221119033229.0920128s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920043082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikuzaki, H.10aDiarylheptanoids from rhizomes of Zingiber officinale  ap. 3647-3651.  aSix new diarylheptanoids, 5-hydroxy-7-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-heptanone, 3,5-diacetoxy-7-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)heptane, 5-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl) -7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-heptanone, 5-hydroxy-7-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) -3-heptanone,(3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxy-1,7-bis (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)heptane and (3S,5S)-3,5-diacetoxy-1,7-bis(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)heptane were isolated from the rhizomes of Zingiber officinale, together with two known diarylheptanoids.

All of the shoot primordia sampled just after the colcemid treatment were cytochimeras that were mixoploids of 2x, 4x and 8x cells. However, when they were allowed to recover in a colcemid-free medium, the frequency of 4x cells spontaneously increased in most of the shoot primordia. Thirty days after the recovery, chimeric masses containing shoot primordia, each of which consisted uniformly of 4x or 2x cells, were observed. In order to obtain a completely homogeneous tetraploid mass, we then cut these primordia into small pieces, each of which had approximately one meristematic dome. Subsequent to this homogeneous tetraploid masses were easily obtained. Tetraploid shoot primordia could propagate with chromosomal stability over a year, and plants regenerated from these tetraploid shoot primordia were also completely tetraploid. These results show that nonchimeric masses can be easily isolated from artificially induced cytochimeras using masses of shoot primordia as material. 3amixoploidy 3ashoot primordia 3adiploidy 3achromosome number 3aHaplopappus 3atetraploidy 3achimerism 3agenetic stability 3aantineoplastic agents 3atissue culture 0acolcemid 0astability 0aartificial tetraploidy 0acytochimeras 0ashoots1 aTanaka, R.1 aTaniguchi, K.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1996 Feb., v. 92, no. 2 p.157-162x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002233703Available from publisher's Web site  a19960709b19960712c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01173naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245004800125300001800173520028000191650002600471650002200497650002500519650002300544650001700567650002500584650001400609650002300623651001200646700001300658700001400671700001500685773007000700852000900770939003300779946001100812655001200823IND9200430720221119033314.0920128s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920043072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiegel, U.12aA cyclohexenone from Plagiochila longispina  ap. 3643-3646.  aA new natural cyclohexenone, 4-(P-methoxyphenethyl)-cyclohex-2-en-1-one, has been isolated from gametophytic tissues of the foliose liverwort Plagiochila longispina.

The present study was conducted to map broad-based SCN resistance loci from the cultivar 'Hartwig'. Two-hundred F2:3 lines derived from the cross 'Williams 82' X 'Hartwig' were screened with a fourth-generation SCN inbred and 56 polymorphic molecular markers. Allele states and phenotypes were analyzed using stepwise regression and the model selection was made at P less than or equal to 0.01. Four unlinked RFLP markers (A006, A567, A487, A112) were associated with SCN resistance and the partial coefficient of determinations (R2) were 91%, 1%, 1%, and 1%. We have mapped a new, major SCN resistance locus (A006) and three minor loci (A567, A487, A112). This complete mapping will accelerate the transfer of broad-based resistance without linkage drag and aid in the determination of relationships among various SCN-resistant germplasm sources. 3aGlycine max 3aloci 3agenes 3apest resistance 3agenetic resistance 3aHeterodera glycines 3agenetic markers 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3alinkage (genetics)1 aFaghihi, J.1 aFerris, V.R.1 aFerris, J.M.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1996 Jan., v. 92, no. 1 p.83-86x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002229553Available from publisher's Web site  a19960331b19960404c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01994naa a2200529 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245009300151300001600244300003000260500001500290520055000305650001600855650002000871650002100891650001500912650001000927650002000937650001700957650003600974650003101010650001101041650001801052650001101070650002201081650001101103650002501114650000901139650002201148650001201170651001901182653002101201653001901222700001901241700002001260700001701280773009401297852000901391939003301400945000801433946001101441655001201452991583113370742620221119035112.0861121e198506  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860114872DNAL7 a40442832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHackett, A.F.10aSome influences on the measurement of food intake during a dietary survey of adolescents  ap. 167-177.  ap. 167-177. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aA longitudinal study of food intakes of English children in young adolescence (ages 11-13) concluded that a variety of factors, although each exerting a minor but variable individual effect on intake, makes dietary survey methodology difficult to simplify.

Despite its wide popularity, little has been published regarding its pharmacokinetic properties in mice. We made use of a routine mite control treatment in a conventional animal unit to gain some knowledge of these properties. Numerous inbred, outbred, and transgenic lines of mice were being treated with ivermectin in the drinking water (32 mg/L) for a chronic Myocoptes infestation. A sample of mice from different cages and rooms was culled at various time intervals to check levels of ivermectin in blood. In addition, cellophane tape impressions of fur were obtained from mice undergoing treatment to monitor the effectiveness of ivermectin in controlling the mite infestation. Results showed that ivermectin levels rose sharply in the serum of treated mice and gradually fell once treatment was discontinued. Maximum levels detected at the end of a 10-day period of treatment were 90 ng/ml. Once treatment was discontinued, serum levels of the drug were undetectable after 7 days. In addition, treatment with ivermectin proved very effective in reducing parasite burdens in the colony. Results were in line with known pharmacological properties of ivermectin in other species. Nevertheless, it was worth noting that serum levels can vary markedly depending on various factors, something to be taken into account when considering treatment of mice, especially transgenics. 3aMyocoptes 3ablood serum 3acages 3acellophane 3adrinking water 3adrugs 3afur 3agenetically modified organisms 3aivermectin 3amedicinal properties 3amice 3amite control 3amites 3aparasites 3aparasitoses 3apharmacokinetics1 aWilkinson, Michael J.1 aMcKellar, Quintin A.0 tJournal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.g2003 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.42-45x1060-05587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20121130  aOther US 7aarticle03180naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245012100173300001600294500001500310520166200325650004701987650001902034650002302053650000902076650001702085650002002102650000802122650001602130650001402146650001302160650002502173650001002198650002502208650002302233650002002256650002002276653003002296653001402326653002802340700001402368700002102382700001402403773008902417852000902506856007802515930003302593945001302626946001102639655001202650IND2053062720221119033412.0960917e199605  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205306272DNAL7 a241663882pmid7 a10.1007/BF002260862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNāyar, Es.10aPCR-based DNA markers linked to a gall midge resistance gene, Gm4t, has potential for marker-aided selection in rice  ap. 660-665.  a2019-12-05  aRice DNAs from a gall midge resistant variety, 'Abhaya', a susceptible variety, 'Tulsi' and their F3 progeny were screened using 500 random primers in conjunction with bulked-segregant analysis in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a view to detecting random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) linked to the gene, Gm4t, which confers resistance to gall midge, a dipteran insect pest of rice. A total of 454 primers were able to produce a distinct amplification pattern, and 3695 bands/loci were amplified between the phenotypically different parents. Of these, 304 bands were polymorphic between the parents, with 19 being phenotype-specific. One of these primers, E20, amplified 2 bands, E20(570) and E20(583), which are tightly linked to resistance and susceptibility, respectively. These specific bands were cloned and sequenced, and a 94% sequence homology was found between the two fragments. Two specific 20-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized, based on the sequence information of E20(583), for use in PCR amplification directly from genomic DNAs. These PCR primers were able to amplify phenotype-specific bands, a 583-bp fragment in susceptible F3 lines and a 570-bp fragment in resistant F3 lines that had been derived from a cross between the parents, indicating their potential and utility for marker-aided selection of the Gm4t gene in rice. Its use would facilitate the early and efficient selection of resistant genes in plant breeding programmes and even in those areas where the insect is not known to occur. These phenotype-specific bands are single-copy sequences and are being mapped to ascertain their chromosomal location in rice. 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aplant breeding 3agenetic resistance 3aloci 3aOryza sativa 3aOrseolia oryzae 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3avarieties 3acrossing 3aartificial selection 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3alinkage (genetics) 3apest resistance 3agenetic markers 0apolymerase chain reaction 0agm4t gene 0amolecular sequence data1 aKumar, A.1 aSrivastava, M.N.1 aMohan, M.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1996 May, v. 92, no. 6 p.660-665x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002260863Available from publisher's Web site  a19961002b19961007c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02613naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245010900131300001800240520164000258650004301898650001701941650002101958650001901979650003801998650002902036653003602065700001402101773014102115852000902256939003302265946001302298655001202311IND9204905620221119033557.0920803e19920501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920490562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartino-Catt, S.10aLow temperature interrupts circadian regulation of transcriptional activity in chilling-sensitive plants  ap. 3731-3735.  aImpaired chloroplast function is responsible for nearly two-thirds of the inhibition to net photosynthesis caused by dark chilling in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), yet it has not been possible to localize the dysfunction to specific chloroplast reactions. We report here on an effect that low-temperature exposure has in tomato on the expression of certain nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins, which may be directly related to the chilling sensitivity of photosynthesis. Transcriptional activity of genes for both the chlorophyll a/b binding protein of photosystem II (Cab) as well as for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase was found to be controlled by an endogenous rhythm. For Cab this rhythm was also visible at the level of newly synthesized protein, indicating that the circadian control of transcriptional activity normally ensures that this protein is synthesized only during daylight hours. However, low-temperature treatment suspended the timing of the rhythm in tomato so that, upon rewarming, the circadian control was reestablished but was displaced from the actual time of day by the length of the chilling exposure. In addition, we found that the normal turnover of Cab and Rubisco activase mRNA was suspended during the low-temperature treatment, but, upon rewarming, this stabilized message was not translated into protein. We believe that the low-temperature-induced mistiming of gene expression together with its effect on the translatability of existing transcripts may be an important clue in unraveling the basis for the chilling sensitivity of photosynthesis in tomato. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3abiosynthesis 3acircadian rhythm 3aphotosynthesis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atranscription (genetics) 0achlorophyll a/b binding protein1 aOrt, D.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 May 1, v. 89, no. 19 p.3731-3735x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02804naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007300144300001800217500001500235520135900250650001501609650002401624650001301648650001601661650001501677650000901692650001101701650000701712650002001719650001201739650002401751650001101775650002701786650001701813650004001830650003901870650001101909650003101920650002701951650002801978650004102006650003202047650002802079653001002107700001802117773008402135852000902219939003302228946001302261655001202274IND9200444020221119033615.0920131e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920044402DNAL7 a18948062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerdi, R.J.10aProperties of proteases from milk somatic cells and blood leukocytes  ap. 2077-2081.  a2019-12-04  aProteolytic activity of proteases associated with somatic cells isolated from high SCC milk and proteases associated with leukocytes isolated from bovine blood was assayed at pH 6.6 and 5.2 in a model system consisting of a beta-casein (.96%) substrate in Jenness/Koops buffer. Intact beta-casein and casein proteolysis products were measured by densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE gels. Relative proteolytic activity was expressed as percentage degradation of beta-casein after 24 h at 37 degrees C per 1 X 10(6) cells/ml. Proteolytic activity associated with somatic cells isolated from bovine milk was 27.5 and 13.6% at pH 6.6 and 5.2, respectively. Proteolytic activity associated with leukocytes isolated from bovine blood was 16.0 and 8.4% at pH 6.6 and 5.2, respectively. Proteolytic activity at pH 6.6 was significantly higher for the somatic cells isolated from milk than for leukocytes isolated from blood. The reason for the difference in proteolytic activity of leukocytes isolated from blood of a healthy cow versus somatic cells isolated from milk produced by a cow with mastitis is not known. Further work is needed to determine whether the difference may be caused by a higher proportion of activated macrophages in somatic cells isolated from milk produced by cows with mastitis than in the leukocytes isolated from blood of healthy cows. 3adairy cows 3aprotein degradation 3amastitis 3aproteinases 3aleukocytes 3amilk 3acasein 3apH 3aenzyme activity 2aAnimals 2aCaseinsxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCell Countxveterinary 2aDensitometry 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEndopeptidasesxbloodxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLeukocytesxenzymology 2aMacrophagesxenzymology 2aMastitis, Bovinexbloodxenzymology. 2aMilkxcytologyxenzymology. 2aNeutrophilsxenzymology 0ablood1 aBarbano, D.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1991 July, v. 74, no. 7 p.2077-2081x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02754naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245010100175300001600276500001500292520087000307650002201177650004701199650001901246650002201265650001201287650001401299650003101313650002601344650002301370650001501393650002301408650001601431650002001447650002001467650001201487650001401499650002101513650001101534653002701545653001101572653004201583653002501625653002401650653002401674700002201698700002201720700001801742700001401760700001601774700001501790700001701805700001701822700001901839773009001858852000901948856007801957930003302035945001302068946001102081655001202092IND2052448320221119033353.0960805e199604  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205244832DNAL7 a241663262pmid7 a10.1007/BF002245612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrosser, J.W.10aAllotetraploid hybrids between citrus and seven related genera produced by somatic hybridization  ap. 577-582.  a2019-12-05  aWe have developed an efficient protoplast-fusion method to produce somatic hybrid allopolyploid plants that combine Citrus with seven related genera, including four that are sexually incompatible.

All hybrids were confirmed by cytological and RAPD analyses. If fertile, the attributes of these hybrids may be amenable to further genetic manipulation by breeding at the tetraploid level. Wide somatic hybridization of Citrus via protoplast fusion bypasses biological barriers to the natural allopolyploidization of Citrus, and creates new evolutionary opportunities that would be difficult or impossible to achieve by natural or conventional hybridization. 3aCitrus reticulata 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aplant breeding 3aprotoplast fusion 3ahybrids 3aSeverinia 3aintergeneric hybridization 3asomatic hybridization 3awide hybridization 3aFortunella 3aCitrus ichangensis 3atetraploidy 3aCitrus sinensis 3agenetic markers 3aLimonia 3aAtalantia 3aplant morphology 3aleaves 0afortunella crassifolia 0aCitrus 0acitrus paradisi x poncirus trifoliata 0acitropsis gilletiana 0amicrocitrus papuana 0aseverinia distichia1 aMourao-Fo, F.A.A.1 aGmitter, F.G.

A measuring system that permits the detection of area-specific current-voltage curves was used. These current-voltage curves, obtained from the inward current regions of Chara, underwent a parallel shift when the alkaline region was inverted by means of an acid pH treatment. In this situation the reversal potential of this area shifted from -120 mV to -340 mV. Together with data obtained from experiments using a divided chamber system, these results suggest that a common transport protein generates inward and outward current regions of Chara. On the basis of these experimental findings, a reaction kinetic model is proposed that assigns two operational modes to the proposed transport protein. Switching between these modes generates either acid or alkaline behavior. Since the observed pH dependence of the postulated transporter is rather complex, a reaction kinetic saturation mechanism had to be incorporated into the model. This final 10-state reaction kinetic model provides an appropriate set of mathematical relations to fit the measured current-voltage curves by computer. 3aChara 3ahydrogen ions 3aion transport 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3aelectric current 3aelectrophysiology 3asimulation models 3aplasma membrane 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aChlorophytaxmetabolism 2aHydrogenxmetabolism 2aIon Channelsxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMathematics 2aModels, Biological 2aProton-Translocating ATPasesxmetabolism 0aelectric potential1 aHansen, U.P.1 aLucas, W.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 Apr. 15, v. 89, no. 8 p.3261-3265x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03175naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245007700173300001600250500001500266520180600281650001902087650001102106650002102117650001002138650001402148650002102162650001302183650001502196650003902211650002302250650002802273650002002301651001002321653001602331653001402347653001002361653001902371653001302390653001602403700001602419773009002435852000902525856007802534930003302612945001302645946001102658655001202669IND2052446820221119033619.0960805e199604  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205244682DNAL7 a241663172pmid7 a10.1007/BF002245522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, K.B.10aImproving chickpea yield by incorporating resistance to ascochyta blight  ap. 509-515.  a2019-12-05  aAscochyta blight [Ascochyta rabiei (Pass.) Lab.] is the most destructive disease of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), but it can be managed effectively by the use of resistant cultivars. Therefore, a breeding programme was initiated during 1977-78 at ICARDA, Syria, to breed blight-resistant, high-yielding chickpeas with other desirable agronomic traits. Crosses were made in main season at Tel Hadya, Syria, and the F1s were grown in the off season at Terbol, Lebanon. The F2, F4 and F5 generations were grown in a blight nursery in the main season where blight epidemic was artificially created. The plants and progenies were scored for blight resistance and other traits. The F3 and F6 generations were grown in the off season under normal day length to eliminate late-maturing plants. The pedigree method of breeding was followed initially, but was later replaced by the F4-derived family method. The yield assessment began with F7 lines, first at ICARDA sites and later internationally. A total of 1584 ascochyta blight-resistant chickpea lines were developed with a range of maturity, plant height, and seed size not previously available to growers in the blight-endemic areas in the Mediterranean region. These included 92 lines resistant to six races of the ascochyta pathogen, and 15 large-seeded and 28 early maturity lines. New cultivars produced 33% more seed yield than the original resistant sources. The yield of chickpea declined by 340 kg ha-1, with an increase in blight severity by one class on a 1-9 scale, reaching zero yield with the 8 and 9 classes. Development of blight-resistant lines made the introduction of winter sowing possible in the Mediterranean region with the prospect of doubling chickpea production. Twenty three cultivars have been released so far in 11 countries. 3aplant breeding 3ablight 3aline differences 3aseeds 3alandraces 3aAscochyta rabiei 3acrossing 3acrop yield 3aagricultural programs and projects 3adisease resistance 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aCicer arietinum 3aSyria 0aperformance 0acultivars 0alines 0aflowering date 0abreeding 0aseed weight1 aReddy, M.V.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1996 Apr., v. 92, no. 5 p.509-515x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002245523Available from publisher's Web site  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02363naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245008600174300001600260520098800276650002201264650002201286650001101308650002001319650001901339650002301358650004101381650002101422650002501443650002601468653002301494653001401517653002501531653001301556653001501569653003501584653002501619700001501644773009001659852000901749856007801758930003301836945001301869946001101882655001201893IND2052446620221119033523.0960805e199604  wb |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205244662DNAL7 a241663162pmid7 a10.1007/BF002245512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConner, A.J.10aReconsideration of pollen dispersal data from field trials of transgenic potatoes  ap. 505-508.  aDuring the initial field evaluation of transgenic plants, it is usual to isolate them genetically from other plants of the same species. Several field experiments on potatoes, using transgenes as markers, have shown that transgene dispersal by pollen to other potato plants is limited and very unlikely at distances over 10 m. In a recent study in Sweden, a frequency of transgene-containing progeny of over 30% is reported from non-transgenic potato plants grown at distances of 10-1000 m from transgenic plants containing nptII and gus marker genes. Data from the Swedish study is discussed along with other relevant observations, and it is concluded that the high frequency of gene dispersal in that study results from a high frequency of false positives during PCR analysis of the nptII gene. From the data available in potato, it is concluded that a distance of 20 m is generally adequate for the initial field evaluation of transgenic potatoes containing novel gene constructs. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3atransgenic plants 3apollen 3agenetic markers 3areporter genes 3abeta-glucuronidase 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3aopen pollination 3aspatial distribution 3afield experimentation 0aexperimental plots 0adispersal 0atransgenic dispersal 0agus gene 0anptii gene 0aneomycin phosphotransferase ii 0apollination distance1 aDale, P.J.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g1996 Apr., v. 92, no. 5 p.505-508x0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002245513Available from publisher's Web site  a19960903b19960911c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02093naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001600149245010700165300001800272500001500290520108500305650002201390650002901412650002001441650002901461650001801490653001901508700001301527700001901540773014101559852000901700939003301709946001301742655001201755IND9204102920221119033635.0920629e19920401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920410292DNAL7 a116072862pmid7 aPMC487112pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamska, I.10aSynthesis of the early light-inducible protein is controlled by blue light and related to light stress  ap. 2610-2613.  a2019-12-05  aThe early light-inducible proteins (ELIPs) am expressed in developing plants in the first hours of the greening process. Here we report that strong light causing photoinhibition of photosynthesis also induces ELIP transcription and accumulation of the protein in mature green pea plants. Accumulation of ELIP transcript is induced in plants exposed to light intensities above 500 microEinsteins/m2.s and is maximal at approximately 1500 microEinsteins/m2.s. The ELIP mRNA level increases in correlation with the degree of photoinhibition increase in ELIP level in the thylakoid membranes parallels the decrease in the amount of D1 protein of the photosystem II reaction center. Examination of ELIP induction as a function of light quality demonstrates that ELIP transcription is specifically induced by blue (410-480 nm) but not by red or far-red light. The level of blue light-induced ELIP transcript is significantly repressed by low-intensity red light. However, the accumulation of ELIP translation product is related to the total amount of blue and red light energy absorbed. 3aprotein synthesis 3alight harvesting complex 3aphotoinhibition 3atranscription (genetics) 3aPisum sativum 0aphotosynthesis1 aOhad, I.1 aKloppstech, K.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 Apr. 1, v. 89, no. 7 p.2610-2613x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02418naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245007000168300001600238520136500254650001201619650001101631650001201642650002701654650001301681653003101694653002101725653002501746653001701771653001501788773011701803852000901920856009301929930003302022946001302055655001202068IND4391596120221119033650.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439159612DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00219.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNuttle, Tim10aEvaluation of Restoration Practice Based on Environmental Filters  ap. 330-333.  aEnvironmental filter models have been proposed as conceptual organizing frameworks for comparing and contrasting restoration practices. I evaluate two such environmental filter models, one proposed by Fattorini and Halle (2004) and the other by Hobbs and Norton (2004) . These models were developed by abstracting restoration practice into what the authors viewed as the essential features restoration practitioners target for control or manipulation. In so doing, these conceptual frameworks hope to be able to transfer insights between different kinds of ecosystems. Here, I take the opposite approach: given an environmental filter model, I asked how well its filters could characterize restoration practices reported in the literature. I found that it was easier to characterize specific restoration practice using the more detailed filters described by Hobbs and Norton. I found that manipulation of biotic filters was most common in terrestrial ecosystems, whereas manipulation of abiotic filters was more common in wetland and stream ecosystems. Fattorini and Halle's model appears most useful for evaluating the current status of degraded ecosystems compared to nondegraded ones, but Hobbs and Norton's model is better for evaluating what particular restoration activities might be undertaken to move that system from a degraded to a nondegraded state. 3afilters 3amodels 3astreams 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3awetlands 0aabiotic and biotic filters 0aconceptual model 0arestoration practice 0aspecies pool 0avalidation0 tRestoration ecology.g2007 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.330-333dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00219.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02128naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006500171300001600236520078700252650001901039650002601058650001501084650001201099650001401111650001501125650001901140650001101159650002701170650001401197650000901211653002601220653001601246653001401262700002001276700002101296700002001317700001601337700001901353700002101372773011701393852000901510856009301519930003301612946001301645655001201658IND4391595620221119033415.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439159562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00214.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanke, Verena14aThe Power of Regeneration: Lessons from a Degraded Grassland  ap. 307-311.  aTo gain insight into mechanisms controlling ecosystem regeneration, we investigated a grassland that was heavily polluted by a phosphate fertilizer factory between 1960 and 1990.

We examined the role of microhabitat use, individual color, and length, in explaining within-population variation in survival for an intertidal snail, Nucella lima. We used a multi-state capture-mark-recapture approach to determine survival and movement rates and found that favored models constrained survival to be a function of microhabitat. Survival estimates from the best-fit model were different between habitat types, despite the fact that habitats were immediately adjacent. Fidelity and disproportionate movement into the habitat with the highest survival suggested possible adaptive habitat choice. This study highlights the importance of small-scale variation in influencing population vital rates, as well as the need for quantifying within-population heterogeneity in survival. 3acolor 3ahabitat preferences 3alittoral zone 3amicrohabitats 3amodels 3aphenotype 3asnails 0aMicrohabitat 0aWithin-population heterogeneity 0aNucella lima 0aMovement1 aTallmon, David A. 0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 Sept., v. 652, no. 1 p.49-56dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0317-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100723b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01794naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245002300127300001800150520093500168650002001103650002201123650000901145650002501154650001501179650003101194653002001225653002501245700001601270773013901286852000901425939003301434946001301467655001201480IND9203716120221119033355.0920610e198404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920371612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChurch, G.M.10aGenomic sequencing  ap. 1991-1995.  aUnique DNA sequences can be determined directly from mouse genomic DNA.

Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) recognises a large number of lipid-containing molecules and transduces inflammatory signalling in a variety of cell types, including insulin-responsive cells. Considering the contribution of the fatty acid composition in TLR2-depedent signalling, we hypothesised that the inflammatory signals transduced by TLR2 contribute to insulin resistance. Methods Mice deficient in TLR2 were used to investigate the in vivo roles of TLR2 in initiating and maintaining inflammation-associated insulin resistance and energy homeostasis. Results We first recapitulated the observation with elevated expression of TLR2 and inflammatory cytokines in white adipose tissue and liver of ob/ob mice. Aged or high-fat-fed TLR2-deficient mice were protected from obesity and adipocyte hypertrophy compared with wild-type mice. Moreover, mice lacking TLR2 exhibited improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity regardless of feeding them regular chow or a high-fat diet. This is accompanied by reductions in expression of inflammatory cytokines and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in a liver-specific manner. The attenuated hepatic inflammatory cytokine expression and related signalling are correlated with increased insulin action specifically in the liver in TLR2-deficient mice, reflected by increased insulin-stimulated protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation and IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and increased insulin-suppressed hepatocyte glucose production. Conclusions/interpretation The absence of TLR2 attenuates local inflammatory cytokine expression and related signalling and increases insulin action specifically in the liver. Thus, our work has identified TLR2 as a key mediator of hepatic inflammation-related signalling and insulin resistance. 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 0aToll-like receptor 21 aTsai, P.-J. 1 aJiang, M.-J. 1 aChuang, Y.-L. 1 aYu, L. 1 aLai, K.-T.

Linkage groups were correlated to the classical genetic map by inclusion of nine phenotypic markers in the mapping cross. We also applied a technique for local mapping that allows targeting of markers to a selected genome region by pooling DNA from recombinant inbred fines based on their genotype. We conclude that random amplified polymorphic DNAs, used in conjunction with a recombinant inbred population, can facilitate the genetic and physical characterization of the Arabidopsis genome and that this method is generally applicable to other organisms for which appropriate populations either are available or can be developed. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agenome 3achromosome walking 3ainbred lines 3agenetic recombination 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aGenetic Linkage 2aOligonucleotides 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 0achromosome mapping1 aWilliams, J.G.K.1 aFeldmann, K.A.1 aRafalski, J.A.1 aTingey, S.V.1 aScolnik, P.A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 Feb. 15, v. 89, no. 4 p.1477-1481x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01834naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001700092024002100109040001800130100001600148245003600164300001600200520061400216650002200830650001400852650000800866650002100874650001600895650002200911650001800933650002600951650001700977650002300994650000801017650002801025650002201053650001501075650001201090650003101102650002201133653001301155700001601168773013701184852000901321939003301330946001301363655001201376IND9203703120221119033422.0920610e197702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920370312DNAL7 a2655212pmid7 aPMC3923302pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaxam, A.M.12aA new method for sequencing DNA  ap. 560-564.  aDNA can be sequenced by a chemical procedure that breaks a terminally labeled DNA molecule partially at each repetition of a base. The lengths of the labeled fragments then identify the positions of the base. We describe reactions that cleave DNA preferentially at guanines, at adenines, at cytosines and thymines equally, and at cytosines alone. When the products of these four reactions are resolved by size, by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel, the DNA sequence can be read from the patterns of radioactive bands. The technique will permit sequencing of a least 100 bases from the point of labeling. 3asequence analysis 3ahydrazine 3aDNA 3adimethyl sulfate 3apiperidines 2aAdeninexanalysis 2aBase Sequence 2aBiochemical Phenomena 2aBiochemistry 2aCytosinexanalysis 2aDNA 2aDNA Restriction Enzymes 2aGuaninexanalysis 2aHydrazines 2aMethods 2aNucleic Acid Hybridization 2aThyminexanalysis 0acleavage1 aGilbert, W.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1977 Feb., v. 74, no. 2 p.560-564x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02326naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245008200169300001800251520120600269650001401475650001201489650001001501650002601511650001401537650001101551653001401562653002501576653002101601700001901622700001901641700002201660773013201682852000901814856008501823930003301908946001101941655001201952IND4440087320221119033625.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444008732DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-010-0949-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSearcy, William A. 10aFemale response to song reflects male developmental history in swamp sparrows  ap. 1343-1349.  aOne explanation for why female songbirds attend to male song is that the quality of a male's song is associated with the quality of his developmental history. We tested this hypothesis by playing back to female swamp sparrows (Melospiza georgiana) songs recorded from males of either inferior or superior developmental histories, as assessed by their rates of mass gain during the first 18 days post-hatching. Females showed significantly higher levels of courtship display in response to songs of males with superior growth than to songs of males with inferior growth. Out of nine song traits measured, only song duration correlated with variation in female response; duration was also the only trait that differed significantly in univariate comparisons between the superior growth songs and the inferior growth songs. In a multivariate analysis, however, inferior growth songs were best discriminated from superior growth songs by combining three song traits: trill rate, stereotypy, and the number of notes per syllable. We suggest that early developmental stress degrades song in many small ways, and that it is the cumulative effect of the resulting deficits that explains lower female response. 3acourtship 3afemales 3amales 3amultivariate analysis 3asongbirds 3aswamps 0aBird song 0aDevelopmental stress 0aSong development1 aPeters, Susan 1 aKipper, Silke 1 aNowicki, Stephen 0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2010 Aug., v. 64, no. 8 p.1343-1349dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-010-0949-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01927naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010500124300001800229520095100247650001301198650004301211650003701254650001701291650001401308650001701322650001701339650001301356700001601369700001901385773014201404852000901546939003301555946001301588655001201601IND9203633320221119033453.0920608e19920215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920363332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBroun, P.10aTelomeric assays display high levels of heritable polymorphism among closely related plant varieties  ap. 1354-1357.  aTomato telomeres are composed of a terminal 7-base-pair tandem repeat and a closely linked 162-base-pair subtelomeric repeat (TGRI). Together, these repeats account for 2% of the total chromosomal DNA. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis has been used to examine the long-range physical structure of these arrays in closely related varieties, and we report here that these arrays are undergoing heritable changes at a frequency as great as 2% per generation. Moreover, comparisons with other known hypervariable probes (e.g., human minisatellites and M13 sequences) revealed that telomeric sites are more variable than any other known region of the plant genome and can be used to distinguish closely related plant varieties (tomato and melon) that are otherwise very similar at the DNA level. The fact that the polymorphisms are inherited in a mendelian fashion suggests applications in genetic mapping of telomeres and identification of varieties. 3acrossing 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aSolanum pennellii var. pennellii 3aCucumis melo 3acultivars 3aheritability 3apolymorphism 3amutation1 aGanal, M.W.1 aTanksley, S.D.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 Feb. 15, v. 89, no. 4 p.1354-1357x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03379naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245016900132300001400301520208300315650002402398650001302422650001802435650002202453650001202475650001002487650001502497650001702512650001402529650001202543650003102555650002402586650001502610650000702625650001402632650001102646650002002657650002102677650001002698700001802708700002002726773012002746852000902866939003302875946001302908655001202921IND4464561320221119033525.0121130e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446456132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeekley, L.

In female cynomolgus macaques, baseline urine specific gravity ranged from 1.005 to 1.031, and urine osmolality ranged from 182 to 1081 mOsm/kg. A dose of 0.4 μg/kg desmopressin acetate resulted in a urine specific gravity that ranged from 1.019 to 1.043 and an osmolality that ranged from 432 to 1298 mOsm/kg. Desmopressin acetate administration increased urine specific gravity and osmolality in each animal evaluated. Baseline urine pH in these animals ranged from 6.4 to 8.2. A dose of orally administered ammonium chloride (0.1 g/kg) resulted in a urine pH that ranges from 4.1 to 7.1. Ammonium chloride administration decreased urine pH in each animal tested. Evaluation of glomerular filtration rate was accomplished through urine collection and timed blood and urine samples after oral hydration with 0.45% sodium chloride. Blood samples were analyzed for creatinine, osmolality, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Urine samples were analyzed for volume, creatinine, osmolality, sodium, potassium, and chloride. Creatinine clearance, osmolality clearance, and electrolyte fractional clearance were calculated from the values. Osmolality clearance ranged from 0.03 to 0.07 ml/kg/min, creatinine clearance ranged from 1.84 to 2.53 ml/kg/min, fractional excretion of sodium ranged from 0.17% to 0.77%, fractional excretion of potassium ranged from 4.46% to 19.87%, and fractional excretion of chloride ranged from 0.25% to 1.08%. The response to desmopressin acetate and ammonium chloride and the osmolality, creatinine concentration, and fractional electrolyte excretion were consistent in individual animals with repeat testing. No adverse events were associated with the tests. The results of these tests are consistent with repeat testing in individual animals. These tests likely can be used for clinical assessment of renal function in cynomolgus macaques or for collection of experimental data. 3aMacaca fascicularis 3aacetates 3aacidification 3aammonium chloride 3aanimals 3ablood 3acreatinine 3aelectrolytes 3aexcretion 3afemales 3aglomerular filtration rate 3aoral administration 3aosmolality 3apH 3apotassium 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3aspecific gravity 3aurine1 aDeldar, Ahmed1 aTapp, Elizabeth0 tJournal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.g2003 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.22-25x1060-05587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20121130  aOther US 7aarticle02662naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110040001800130100001500148245009900163300001800262520117000280650001501450650002501465650002601490650003201516650002901548650002001577650002401597650001201621650002801633650001101661650002801672650002101700650006001721650005901781650001701840650002501857650002301882653002801905700001701933700001801950700001501968773014201983852000902125930003302134946001302167655001202180IND9203633120221119033339.0920608e19920215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920363312DNAL7 a17413842pmid7 aPMC484372pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayeda, A.10aTwo members of a conserved family of nuclear phosphoproteins are involved in pre-mRNA splicing  ap. 1301-1304.  aMonoclonal antibody 104 recognizes a subset of amphibian nuclear granules (B-snurposomes) and active sites of RNA polymerase II transcription in vertebrates and invertebrates. Monoclonal antibody 104 reacts with a set of nuclear serine- and arginine-rich phosphoproteins (SR family) with strikingly conserved apparent molecular masses. The most abundant family members in human (SRp33) and Drosophila (SRp55) cell lines can replace-one another as essential splicing factors in a human cell-free system. Each of these polypeptides can functionally replace human SF2, an essential splicing factor that also regulates 5' splice site selection of alternatively spliced pre-mRNAs in vitro. Drosophila SRp55 also functions as an alternative splicing factor in the human cell-free system. Analysis of cloned cDNAs shows that SRp55 and SF2 are highly related and reveals regions of similarity to genetically defined regulators of alternative splicing in Drosophila. These results suggest that the conserved SR family of phosphoproteins, which includes SRp55 and SF2, is involved in constitutive pre-mRNA splicing and in the specificity of alternative splice site selection. 3aDrosophila 3aamino acid sequences 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3atranscription (genetics) 3aphosphoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aDrosophila melanogaster 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aNuclear Proteinsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aPhosphoproteinsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aRNA Splicing 2aRNA-Binding Proteins 2aSequence Alignment 0amolecular sequence data1 aZahler, A.M.1 aKrainer, A.R.1 aRoth, M.B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 Feb. 15, v. 89, no. 4 p.1301-1304x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02448naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001800149245010400167300001600271520145600287650002201743650001701765650001501782650002001797650001401817650002301831650002001854650002301874700001801897773014001915852000902055939003302064946001302097655001202110IND9203587320221119033332.0920605e19920115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920358732DNAL7 a116072502pmid7 aPMC482562pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCarty, G.W.10aRegulation of assimilatory nitrate reductase activity in soil by microbial assimilation of ammonium  ap. 453-456.  aIt is well established that assimilatory nitrate reductase (ANR) activity in soil is inhibited by ammonium (NH4(+)). To elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition, we studied the effect of L-methionine sulfoximine (MSX), an inhibitor of NH4(+) assimilation by microorganisms, on assimilatory reduction of nitrate (NO3(-)) in aerated soil slurries treated with NH4(+). We found that NH4(+) strongly inhibited ANR activity in these slurries and that MSX eliminated this inhibition. We also found that MSX induced dissimilatory reduction of NO3(-) to NH4(+) in soil and that the NH4(+) thus formed had no effect on the rate of NO3(-) reduction. We concluded from these observations that the inhibition of ANR activity by NH4(+) is due not to NH4(+) per se but to products formed by microbial assimilation of NH4(+). This conclusion was supported by a study of the effects of early products of NH4(+) assimilation (L amino acids) on ANR activity in soil, because this study showed that the biologically active, L isomers of glutamine and asparagine strongly inhibited ANR activity, whereas the D isomers of these amino acids had little effect on ANR activity. Evidence that ANR activity is regulated by the glutamine formed by NH4(+) assimilation was provided by studies showing that inhibitors of glutamine metabolism (azaserine, albizziin, and aminooxyacetate) inhibited ANR activity in soil treated with NO3(-) but did not do so in the presence of MSX. 3anitrate reductase 3asoil enzymes 3aasparagine 3aenzyme activity 3aglutamine 3amicrobial activity 3asoil properties 3aammonium compounds1 aBremner, J.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1992 Jan. 15, v. 89, no. 2 p.453-456x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01727naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245005600205300001600261520075900277650001701036653002201053653001601075653001601091700001601107700001901123773012101142852000901263856008501272930003301357946001101390655001201401IND4446779420221119033432.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444677942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10867-010-9204-62doi7 aPMC30064692pmcid7 a222109672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Li-Peng 10aReinfection induced disease in a spatial SIRI model  ap. 133-140.  aSpatial models are widely used in epidemiology to investigate persistence and extinction of disease as well as their spatial patterns. One of the most important issues in studying epidemic models is the role of infection on the persistence and extinction of the disease. In this paper, we investigate a spatial susceptible-infected-recovered-infected model using cellular automata. We show that, in the regime where disease disappears in the susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible model, spiral and target waves will emerge in the two-dimensional space due to the reinfection. The obtained results may point out that reinfection has great influence on the epidemic spreading, which enriches the findings of spatiotemporal dynamics in epidemic models. 3aepidemiology 0aCellular automata 0aReinfection 0aPersistence1 aJing, Zhen.1 aSun, Gui-Quan 0 tJournal of biological physics.g2011 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.133-140dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0092-06067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10867-010-9204-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03236naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002000171245018000191300001600371520150300387650001501890650001401905650002501919650001801944650001301962650006801975650002902043650002902072650002502101650003002126650002802156650007502184650001402259650003402273651001102307651001002318653002402328653001502352653002302367700002202390700002202412700002102434773012802455852000902583856009202592930003302684946001302717655001202730IND4441746720221119033415.0100827e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444174672DNAL7 a207078782pmid7 a10.1111/j.1550-7408.2010.00497.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUTZ, LAURA R.P.10aExpanded Phylogenetic Representation of Genera Opercularia and Epistylis Sheds Light on the Evolution and Higher-Level Taxonomy of Peritrich Ciliates (Ciliophora: Peritrichia)  ap. 415-420.  aWe have generated 18S rRNA sequences for peritrichs collected in Brazil, including four Opercularia species, two different populations of Epistylis plicatilis (one epibiont and another free-living), and one additional Epistylis species. Our Opercularia species clustered with the previously available Opercularia microdiscum, corroborating the monophyly of this genus. The Epistylis sampled here clustered with previously sequenced species of this genus. The two populations of E. plicatilis collected in Brazil clustered closely together despite their different ecological contexts, whereas both were very divergent from the sample assigned to the same species previously sampled in China. If affirmed by additional morphological corroboration of species assignment, this observation would indicate that samples from different continents morphologically allocated in the same species may in fact belong to distant evolutionary lineages. More broadly, our results support the recognition of two major clades within Peritrichia. Given the robustness of their support, we suggest that these two clades should be formally recognized as orders, and propose the names Vorticellida and Operculariida to designate them. Furthermore, Epistylis species occurred in both orders, tending to occupy basal positions. This suggests that characters used to define this genus may be plesiomorphic for Peritrichia, so that Epistylis may in fact represent an assemblage of basal species retaining ancestral features. 3aCiliophora 3amonophyly 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 3ataxonomy 2aCiliophoraxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Protozoanxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFresh Waterxparasitology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligohymenophoreaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 18Sxgenetics 3aBrazil 3aChina 0aCharacter evolution 0aperitrichs 0asmall subunit rRNA1 aSIMÃO, TAIZ L.L.1 aSAFI, LÚCIA S.L.1 aEIZIRIK, EDUARDO0 tJournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g2010 , v. 57, no. 5 p.415-420dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1066-52347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1550-7408.2010.00497.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100827b20100903c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01890naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245014600131300001400277520091300291650002001204650001701224650001201241650002201253650002201275650002901297650001201326651001101338700002001349700002001369773012001389852000901509939003301518946001301551655001201564IND4464561220221119033352.0121130e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446456122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKondo, Sylvia Y.12aA Novel Approach for Documentation and Evaluation of Activity Patterns in Owl Monkeys during Development of Environmental Enrichment Programs  ap. 17-21.  aDocumenting and evaluating the appropriateness of environmental enrichment programs has posed a challenge to many institutions. This paper describes a method for documenting and evaluating activity patterns for developing an environmental enrichment program. A colony of owl (or night) monkeys (Aotus lemurinus griseimembra) at the University of Hawaii were videotaped using infrared sensitive cameras and the duration and frequency of numerous activities were scored using an ethological analysis software program (Hindsight). A number of activity patterns could be observed by using this method, and a baseline was established for the current environmental enrichment for this colony. Videotaping and computer analysis is a convenient method for documenting and objectively evaluating activity patterns for use in the development of environmental enrichment programs for captive primates and other species. 3aAotus (Cebidae) 3aStrigiformes 3acameras 3acomputer analysis 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental enrichment 3amonkeys 3aHawaii1 aYudko, Errol B.1 aMagee, Linda K.0 tJournal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.g2003 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.17-21x1060-05587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20121130  aOther US 7aarticle02089naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245017500130300001400305520099600319650001101315650001101326650001501337650001701352650002801369650001301397650001701410650001901427650001201446650001301458650001501471650000901486700002301495700002101518773012101539852000901660939003301669946001301702655001201715IND4464562420221119033329.0121130e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446456242DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Francis J.10aComparison of Ketamine Versus Combination of Ketamine and Medetomidine in Injectable Anesthetic Protocols: Chemical Immobilization in Macaques and Tissue Reaction in Rats  ap. 32-37.  aThis study compared balanced anesthesia between ketamine alone and ketamine with medetomidine and assessed the repeated intramuscular use of ketamine and its potential for tissue damage. The combination of ketamine and medetomidine was tested in newly arrived macaques undergoing a period of quarantine in an animal facility. Results indicated that the medetomidine and ketamine combination induced a deeper, more level plane of anesthesia of longer duration than did ketamine alone. Furthermore, use of the medetomidine-reversing agent, atipamezole, permitted more rapid recovery. In addition, a preliminary study in adult rats was undertaken to assess tissue damage induced by intramuscular injection of ketamine versus the combination of ketamine and medetomidine. Histological evaluation of tissue inflammation and muscle necrosis in rats indicated that the lower dose of ketamine afforded by combination with medetomidine caused markedly less damage to muscle tissue at injection sites. 3aMacaca 3aadults 3aanesthesia 3ainflammation 3aintramuscular injection 3aketamine 3amedetomidine 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3anecrosis 3aquarantine 3arats1 aWright, Douglas E.1 aPinson, David M.0 tJournal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science.g2003 July, v. 42, no. 4 p.32-37x1060-05587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b00000000c20121130  aOther US 7aarticle02103naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002700152245011500179300001400294520110600308650002201414650001001436650001201446650001001458650002401468653000801492653002201500773013801522852000901660856007601669930003301745946001101778655001201789IND4386610720221119033337.0070107e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438661072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.2007.00587.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeldon, Christopher W.10aInfluence of male aggregation size on female visitation in Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 29-34.  aThe importance of male aggregation size for female visitation and initiation of male pheromone-calling was investigated in Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae) using artificial male aggregations in large laboratory cages. Female B. tryoni visited the largest aggregation more frequently than single males in association with a higher proportion of calling males, but there was no correlation between aggregation size and female visitation. Female B. tryoni had a limited capacity to perceive a difference between the number of calling males. Calling propensity of male B. tryoni was increased by the presence of conspecific males. Increased calling propensity in larger groups of male B. tryoni may be due to social facilitation of male calling behaviour. Female visitation at aggregations was only weakly associated with male calling, suggesting that aggregation size and the number of pheromone-calling males are not the only factors important in locating mates in B. tryoni, and it is possible that low-density populations could persist so long as females can encounter single males. 3aBactrocera tryoni 3acages 3afemales 3amales 3asocial facilitation 0alek 0apheromone-calling0 tAustralian journal of entomology.g2007 Feb., v. 46, no. 1 p.29-34dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1326-67567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2007.00587.x3electronic resource  a20070107b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02471naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001700144245007300161300001600234520156400250650001801814650002201832650001601854650001301870651001801883651001101901653001701912653001601929700001601945773008201961852000902043930003302052945002502085946001102110655001202121IND4374584920221119033318.0050922e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437458492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDuPuis, E.M.10aShould we go "home" to eat?: toward a reflexive politics of localism  ap. 359-371.  a“Coming home to eat” [Nabhan, 2002. Coming Home to Eat: The Pleasures and Politics of Local Foods. Norton, New York] has become a clarion call among alternative food movement activists. Most food activist discourse makes a strong connection between the localization of food systems and the promotion of environmental sustainability and social justice. Much of the US academic literature on food systems echoes food activist rhetoric about alternative food systems as built on alternative social norms. New ways of thinking, the ethic of care, desire, realization, and vision become the explanatory factors in the creation of alternative food systems. In these norm-based explanations, the “Local” becomes the context in which this type of action works. In the European food system literature about local “value chains” and alternative food networks, localism becomes a way to maintain rural livelihoods. In both the US and European literatures on localism, the global becomes the universal logic of capitalism and the local the point of resistance to this global logic, a place where “embeddedness” can and does happen. Nevertheless, as other literatures outside of food studies show, the local is often a site of inequality and hegemonic domination. However, rather than declaim the “radical particularism” of localism, it is more productive to question an “unreflexive localism” and to forge localist alliances that pay attention to equality and social justice. The paper explores what that kind of localist politics might look like. 3arural society 3afood availability 3afood policy 3apolitics 3aUnited States 3aEurope 0afood systems 0alocal foods1 aGoodman, D.0 tJournal of rural studies.g2005 July, v. 21, no. 3 p.359-371x0743-01677nnas  aDNAL  a20070517b20070602c00000000  aINDdRLGe2005/09/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02178naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245007900170300001600249520112300265650002301388650002701411650003101438650001101469650001601480653002501496653002301521653001901544653001201563773011701575852000901692856009301701930003301794946001301827655001201840IND4391595520221119033418.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439159552DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00213.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHalle, Stefan10aPresent State and Future Perspectives of Restoration Ecology--Introduction  ap. 304-306.  aAlthough the aim of and the need for ecological restoration, and restoration ecology as its scientific base, are obvious, the field is still struggling with defining its basics. This situation, reflected by the debate about alternative terms to replace "restoration," the ambiguous self-image as a movement, art, application, or science, and the lack of a unifying conceptual framework, results in an uncertainty about the future development of the field. In a 10-year project, an interdisciplinary Research Training Group in Jena followed the regeneration of one degraded terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem, respectively, and suggested a conceptual model for regeneration and restoration that was derived from the shared features of the two systems. As part of the scientific discussion of this new approach, an international workshop "Present State and Future Perspectives of Restoration Ecology" was organized in Jena in November 2004. The following collection of 12 opinion papers and 1 concluding chapter reflect the discussions at the workshop and contributes to the "self-finding" process of restoration ecology. 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aecological restoration 3ainterdisciplinary research 3amodels 3auncertainty 0aconceptual framework 0afuture development 0aopinion papers 0ascience0 tRestoration ecology.g2007 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.304-306dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2007.00213.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03206naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245009900174300001600273520185800289650001302147650001102160650002602171650001002197650002502207650001302232650001502245650002202260650001002282650001302292651001502305653001402320653002602334653002102360653001302381653001602394653001502410700002202425700001702447700002402464773011702488852000902605856007602614930003302690946001302723655001202736IND4387868120221119033350.0070213e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438786812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00198.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArmitage, Anna R.10aWintering Shorebird Assemblages and Behavior in Restored Tidal Wetlands in Southern California  ap. 139-148.  aHabitat restoration can partially compensate for the extensive loss of coastal wetlands, but creation of functional habitat and assessment of restoration success remain challenging tasks. To evaluate wintering shorebird use of restored coastal wetlands, we quantified shorebird assemblages and behavior of selected focal species at five restored sites and paired reference sites in Mugu Lagoon, southern California, United States. The Shannon-Wiener index of species diversity (for all birds in order Charadriiformes) was higher in the restored than in the reference portion of three of the five sites, higher in the reference portion of a fourth site, and similar between reference and restored areas of the fifth site. Species diversity was lower in sites closer to man-made structures. The four most abundant species groups across the five sites were selected for detailed analysis of site use and behavior: Willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus), Marbled Godwits (Limosa fedoa), Dowitchers (Limnodromus spp.), and Sandpipers (Calidris spp.) (Western, Least, and Dunlin). Each focal species group exhibited distinct site preferences, and densities in restored sites were often as high or higher than in reference sites. Willets and Dowitchers preferred habitats with more extensive tidal flats, a characteristic of restored sites. Godwits and Sandpipers preferred heterogeneous habitats with a mix of water and tidal flats. Most birds were engaged in feeding activities during the ebb tides surveyed, and there were no apparent differences in behavior between reference and restored sites. Though not all restored sites were used equally by all species, the creation of multiple restored sites with varied habitat characteristics attracted a diverse assemblage of shorebirds and may have contributed to the integrity of the regional wetland landscape. 3aCalidris 3aLimosa 3abiological assessment 3abirds 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3atides 3awetlands 3aCalifornia 0adiversity 0ahabitat heterogeneity 0alandscape matrix 0amudflats 0arestoration 0ashorebirds1 aJensen, Stacey M.1 aYoon, Joy E.1 aAmbrose, Richard F.0 tRestoration ecology.g2007 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.139-148dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00198.x3electronic resource  a20070213b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02702naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245011400168300001600282520148900298650001401787650002601801650001201827650001501839650003101854650002301885650002301908650002301931650000901954650001701963651003101980653002302011653001402034773013702048852000902185856007602194930003302270946001302303655001202316IND4387868320221119033249.0070213e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438786832DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00199.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Dea, M.E.10aInfluence of Mycotrophy on Native and Introduced Grass Regeneration in a Semiarid Grassland following Burning  ap. 149-155.  aPrescribed burning is used in the southwestern United States to restore grasslands by reducing the abundance of encroaching woody species. Yet, the use of this tool appears to have the unintended effect of favoring the regeneration of some introduced grasses. Although both native and introduced perennial grasses evolved under the influence of fire, it is their response to mycotrophy in the immediate postburn environment that appears to give some grasses such as Lovegrass the advantage. In an exploratory study, two greenhouse experiments were completed in conjunction with a larger field study. A bioassay of soil from the study site found that soil exposed to burning had a significantly (p≤ 0.0001) lower mycorrhizal infection percentage than soil not exposed to burning, results which could not be explained by postburn erosion losses of inoculum alone. Results of the second greenhouse study revealed that differential response to mycotrophy clearly separated the Lovegrass (Eragrostis spp.) from the other genera studied. Lovegrass not infected by mycorrhizal fungi produced greater shoot biomass and inflorescence before the other noninfected studied grasses. Yet, infected Lovegrass did not develop inflorescence before harvest as the other genera infected by the mycorrhizal fungi did. Study results suggest that the lack of dependence by Lovegrass on mycorrhizal infection for reestablishing itself in the postburn environment gives it an advantage over those that do. 3abioassays 3afield experimentation 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3aprescribed burning 3asoil 3awoody plants 3aSouthwestern United States 0aintroduced grasses 0aperennial0 tRestoration ecology.g2007 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.149-155dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00199.x3electronic resource  a20070213b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04100naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245006300166300001600229520248600245650002202731650001602753650001702769650001102786650002202797650001402819650002202833650002602855650002402881650001902905650001602924650001302940650001202953650001302965650001402978650001202992650001203004650002203016650001203038651001003050653002803060653002103088653003403109700002303143700001903166700002103185700001903206700001803225773015303243852000903396856008503405930003303490946001103523655001203534IND4448861820221119033220.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444886182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-010-0363-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRampazzi, Laura 10aMonuments as sampling surfaces of recent traffic pollution  ap. 184-191.  aBackground, aim and scope A new approach towards monuments, considering them as a passive sampler of pollution, is presented. Cultural Heritage objects suffer daily the damages of environmental pollution, especially in those areas interested by heavy traffic. Since monuments undergo only periodic conservation or maintenance works, surfaces are able to accumulate atmospheric deposit and to record changes in its composition. An optimised analytical protocol was developed in order to quantify platinum and rhodium at trace level on surfaces. The two elements have become tracers of automobile emissions in recent years, since the introduction of catalytic converters, and could have catalytic effects on the decay reactions of natural and artificial stone materials. As a first case study, the cement mortar surfaces of a twentieth century monument, the Camerlata Fountain, in Como (Italy) were investigated. Materials and methods The surfaces of the monument were scraped in areas both exposed to atmosphere and sheltered by the architectural elements of the building. The powders were dissolved by microwave-assisted mineralisation with a solution of HCl and HNO₃. The solution was filtered, irradiated and analysed by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry. The powders were also analysed by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction in order to determine the chemical and mineralogical composition. Results and discussion An analysis protocol was set up considering the matrix effect and the expected low concentrations of the two metals. The results enlightened variable concentration values and distribution areas of platinum (0.013-45 μg/kg) and rhodium (0.55-274.4 μg/kg), suggesting the ability of artificial stone surfaces to accumulate the two elements. The sample chemical and mineralogical composition was consistent with a typical cement plaster interested by decay phenomena. Conclusions This work investigated the relation between Cultural Heritage and pollution by another point of view. The analytical protocol presented in this paper was effective in determining platinum and rhodium in traces on the investigated stone surfaces with negligible matrix effects. Recommendation and perspectives The presence of platinum and rhodium on monument surfaces should be of significant interest when planning Cultural Heritage conservation. A better knowledge of the role of the two metals in decay phenomena could impact in a positive way artwork conservation. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aautomobiles 3acase studies 3acement 3acultural heritage 3aemissions 3ahydrochloric acid 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3amicrowave treatment 3amineralization 3anitric acid 3aplanning 3aplaster 3aplatinum 3apollution 3apowders 3arhodium 3atracer techniques 3atraffic 3aItaly 0aAtmospheric particulate 0aMonument surface 0aElectro-analytical techniques1 aGiussani, Barbara 1 aRizzo, Biagio 1 aCorti, Cristina 1 aPozzi, Andrea 1 aDossi, Carlo 0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2011 Feb., v. 18, no. 2 p.184-191dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-010-0363-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03318naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245007400170300001400244520189900258650001902157650002702176650002502203650001102228650000902239650000902248650001502257650002502272650001102297650001502308650001402323650001902337650001402356650001002370650002202380650001302402650001202415650001102427651001202438651001202450653001602462700001402478700001502492700001702507700001802524773011502542852000902657856007602666930003302742946001302775655001202788IND4387868620221119033315.0070213e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438786862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00187.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosatte, Rick14aThe Restoration of Elk (Cervus elaphus) in Ontario, Canada: 1998-2005  ap. 34-43.  aIn 1997, a plan to restore Elk (Cervus elaphus) to Ontario was approved by the provincial government. The objective of the Ontario elk restoration program, a multipartnered collaboration, was to restore a species that had been extirpated from the province during the 1800s. During 1998-2001, 460 elk were acquired from Elk Island National Park, Alberta, for release in four areas of Ontario. As greater than 90% of the elk were radio collared, monitoring provided detailed information on the dynamics of the four populations. Comprehensive research projects using graduate students were implemented to determine the environmental impact of releasing elk in Ontario. Those studies are in progress or have been completed and include the effect of wolf predation on restored elk, white-tailed deer and elk resource overlap, the development of genetic profiles for elk, and solutions for elk/human conflicts. Mortality of the released elk averaged 41% (190/460) during 1998-2004 with annual mortality generally declining over time in each release area. The primary causes of elk mortality included wolf predation (25% of mortalities), illegal shooting (13%), stress-related emaciation (13%) (partially due to the stress of relocation), bacterial infections (7%), and collisions with vehicles (6%). Productivity has been high in one of the release areas with 24-65% of the cows being observed with calves during late winter surveys. However, productivity has been low in two of the northern release areas due to a variety of factors including wolf predation. In some areas, dispersion of elk appeared to be related to the length of time animals were kept in pens prior to release. The precalving population estimate for Ontario in March 2004 was 375-440 elk. A comprehensive program review was conducted in 2003/2004 that included recommendations relating to the future management of elk in Ontario. 3aCervus elaphus 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3abacterial infections 3acalves 3acows 3aelks 3aemaciation 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3amortality 3anational parks 3apredation 3aradio 3aresearch projects 3astudents 3asurveys 3awolves 3aAlberta 3aOntario 0arestoration1 aHamr, Joe1 aYoung, Jim1 aFilion, Ivan1 aSmith, Howard0 tRestoration ecology.g2007 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.34-43dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00187.x3electronic resource  a20070213b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02849naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245012100181300001600302520120200318650001201520650001501532650002701547650001701574650002001591650001501611650002301626650003001649650001001679650001001689650000901699650001001708650001001718650001001728650001701738650001701755650001301772650001601785650001701801651002001818653001401838653002001852653001601872700002501888700001901913700001901932700002701951700002001978773014001998852000902138856009202147930003302239946001102272655001202283IND4395842020221119033442.0071007e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439584202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.2007.00608.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGámez-Virués, Sagrario10aArthropod prey of shelterbelt-associated birds: linking faecal samples with biological control of agricultural pests  ap. 325-331.  aThe value of insectivorous birds as agents for biological control of arthropod pests has been little studied, especially in Australia. This paper reports on the extent to which arthropods from various pest and non-pest taxa feature in the diets of birds captured in farm shelterbelts in central western New South Wales. The parameters examined were the types of arthropod fragments in bird faeces and percentage volume and frequency of occurrence of each component. The faecal data were compared with samples of the arthropod fauna trapped in shelterbelts during the period the birds were captured. In 26 of 29 faecal samples, arthropod fragments were the predominant components, the most common being from Coleoptera, Hymenoptera (especially Formicidae), Orthoptera and Araneae. The recognisable pest taxa in faecal samples were Scarabaeidae and wingless grasshopper Phaulacridium vittatum (Sjöstedt) (Orthoptera: Acrididae). The results indicate that the native bird species common in farm shelterbelts preyed on a range of arthropod taxa including several that are pests of crops and pastures. Accordingly, conservation of birds in farmlands could contribute to suppression of arthropod pests. 3aAraneae 3aFormicidae 3aPhaulacridium vittatum 3aScarabaeidae 3aarthropod pests 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abirds 3acrops 3adiet 3afarms 3afauna 3afeces 3agrasshoppers 3ainsectivores 3apastures 3aplant pests 3ashelterbelts 3aNew South Wales 0abird diet 0afaecal analysis 0ashelterbelt1 aBonifacio, Ronald S.1 aGurr, Geoff M.1 aKinross, Cilla1 aRaman, Anantanarayanan1 aNicol, Helen I.0 tAustralian journal of entomology.g2007 Nov., v. 46, no. 4 p.325-331dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1326-67567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2007.00608.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03741naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010300172300001800275520229800293650001802591650002602609650001902635650001302654650001302667650002202680650002302702650001402725650002202739650002402761650001102785653001602796653006002812653001402872653002702886653002502913653002902938653003002967653002302997773011803020852000903138856009203147930003303239946001103272655001203283IND4440856720221119033427.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444085672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01703.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlanderud, Kari10aSpecies recruitment in alpine plant communities: the role of species interactions and productivity  ap. 1128-1133.  a1. It is not clear how local and regional processes influence plant species recruitment. Local abiotic factors are predicted to constrain recruitment under harsh environmental conditions and low productivity, whereas the role of seed availability may be more important at intermediate productivity. The role of establishment limitation (local interactions) is predicted to increase under high productivity due to competition. 2. This study examined the effects of local biotic interactions, such as competition and facilitation from the resident vegetation, on alpine plant species recruitment, and investigated whether the role of species interactions depended on productivity. All naturally emerging seedlings were recorded in plots with intact vegetation and where vegetation had been removed, in a natural low-productivity alpine Dryas heath and in plots where productivity had increased after fertilizing. 3. Positive effects of vegetation removal on seedling emergence suggested that competition from neighbour vegetation may have an important role for recruitment in alpine plant communities. The role of competitive release increased with productivity. Productivity increased short-term, but not long-term seedling recruitment, likely due to increased competition from re-growth over time. There was no effect of productivity on species richness recovery after vegetation removal. 4. There was a positive relationship between neighbour species richness and seedling density in the low-productivity plots, but not in the high-productivity plots. Local seed production was the major seed source in both parts of the heath, but in the high-productivity plots, the high abundance of a few species in the species pool was more important for seedling recruitment than species richness. 5. Synthesis. Competition may play a significant role for plant species recruitment in environmentally harsh habitats of low productivity, where abiotic factors or facilitation traditionally are predicted to be more important ecological filters. Climate warming and increased nitrogen deposition may result in higher productivity of tundra plant communities, which may increase the role of competition, and the identity of neighbour species may become more important for recruitment than species richness. 3aalpine plants 3aenvironmental factors 3aglobal warming 3ahabitats 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3aspecies diversity 3aspecies recruitment 3atundra 0acompetition 0adeterminants of plant community diversity and structure 0adispersal 0aDryas octopetala heath 0aenvironmental change 0aestablishment limitation 0aspecies richness recovery 0avegetation removal0 tJournal of ecology.g2010 Sept., v. 98, no. 5 p.1128-1133dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2010.01703.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245009500175300001400270520180300284650001902087650002402106650001502130650002602145650001102171650001502182650001602197650001702213653001402230653002902244653002702273653003202300653001502332773011502347852000902462856007602471930003302547946001302580655001202593IND4387868020221119033317.0070213e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438786802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00185.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBowker, Matthew A.10aBiological Soil Crust Rehabilitation in Theory and Practice: An Underexploited Opportunity  ap. 13-23.  aBiological soil crusts (BSCs) are ubiquitous lichen-bryophyte microbial communities, which are critical structural and functional components of many ecosystems. However, BSCs are rarely addressed in the restoration literature. The purposes of this review were to examine the ecological roles BSCs play in succession models, the backbone of restoration theory, and to discuss the practical aspects of rehabilitating BSCs to disturbed ecosystems. Most evidence indicates that BSCs facilitate succession to later seres, suggesting that assisted recovery of BSCs could speed up succession. Because BSCs are ecosystem engineers in high abiotic stress systems, loss of BSCs may be synonymous with crossing degradation thresholds. However, assisted recovery of BSCs may allow a transition from a degraded steady state to a more desired alternative steady state. In practice, BSC rehabilitation has three major components: (1) establishment of goals; (2) selection and implementation of rehabilitation techniques; and (3) monitoring. Statistical predictive modeling is a useful method for estimating the potential BSC condition of a rehabilitation site. Various rehabilitation techniques attempt to correct, in decreasing order of difficulty, active soil erosion (e.g., stabilization techniques), resource deficiencies (e.g., moisture and nutrient augmentation), or BSC propagule scarcity (e.g., inoculation). Success will probably be contingent on prior evaluation of site conditions and accurate identification of constraints to BSC reestablishment. Rehabilitation of BSCs is attainable and may be required in the recovery of some ecosystems. The strong influence that BSCs exert on ecosystems is an underexploited opportunity for restorationists to return disturbed ecosystems to a desirable trajectory. 3aabiotic stress 3aecosystem engineers 3aecosystems 3amicrobial communities 3amodels 3amonitoring 3asoil crusts 3asoil erosion 0aaridlands 0acryptobiotic soil crusts 0adegradation thresholds 0astate-and-transition models 0asuccession0 tRestoration ecology.g2007 Mar., v. 15, no. 1 p.13-23dMalden, USA : Blackwell Publishing Incx1061-29717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1526-100X.2006.00185.x3electronic resource  a20070213b20070303c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02775naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012400169300001600293520138100309650001901690650002401709650001501733650001201748650001501760650001001775650000901785650001501794650001801809650001801827650001401845650001401859650001501873650001101888650001401899650001301913653001401926653001501940700001801955700001701973700001801990773014002008852000902148856009202157930003302249946001102282655001202293IND4392769320221119033335.0070701e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439276932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1440-6055.2007.00598.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManning, Rob10aLipid-enhanced pollen and lipid-reduced flour diets and their effect on the longevity of honey bees (Apis mellifera L.)  ap. 251-257.  aAs eucalypt pollens contain low concentrations of lipid, enhancing pollen diets with fatty acids was hypothesised to improve honey bee longevity. Different concentrations of linoleic and oleic acid added to eucalypt pollen were trialled in small cages containing approximately 1400 bees each. Bees fed diets of redgum (Corymbia calophylla (Lindl.) Hill & Johnson, formerly Eucalyptus calophylla) pollen had the lowest mortality of 22 diets tested for 6 weeks and had life spans (50%) greater than 42 days. Linoleic acid mixed with a redgum diet in concentrations >6% corresponded to life spans of 24-25 days. Bee longevity appeared to be more sensitive to oleic acid as life spans decreased to 15-21 days when diets had concentrations >2%. The life spans of bees fed soya bean flour were 26 days on low (0.6% lipid) fat, 19 days on defatted and 20 days on full-fat diets. Bees fed lupin flour had a life span of 23 days. Adding redgum pollen to lupin flour caused increased mortality, but addition of pollen to soya bean flour was beneficial. Thus, beekeepers who choose to utilise soya bean or lupin flours as protein substitutes to pollen will have bees with reduced longevity. Bees fed redgum pollen that had been dried, crushed, irradiated and hermetically stored in a cool room for several years had similar longevity to bees fed fresh-collected and frozen redgum pollen. 3aApis mellifera 3aCorymbia calophylla 3aEucalyptus 3aLupinus 3abeekeepers 3acages 3adiet 3ahoney bees 3alinoleic acid 3alipid content 3alongevity 3amortality 3aoleic acid 3apollen 3asoy flour 3asoybeans 0acaged bee 0afatty acid1 aRutkay, April1 aEaton, Linda1 aDell, Bernard0 tAustralian journal of entomology.g2007 Aug., v. 46, no. 3 p.251-257dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1326-67567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2007.00598.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070701b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01277naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245005800168300001400226520025900240650000900499650001700508650002400525650001400549653002700563653001600590653001700606653001400623700001900637700002600656773010700682852000900789856008500798930003300883946001100916655001200927IND4446017220221119033403.0101203e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444601722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10341-010-0112-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDaniel, Hannelore 10aProfiling Techniques in Nutritional and Food Sciences  ap. 65-69.  aHigh throughput profiling techniques are applied increasingly in nutritional sciences as tools for the identification of metabolic phenotypes in response to food as well as for identification of the modes of action of individual constituents of the diet. 3adiet 3afood science 3amechanism of action 3aphenotype 0aProfilierungstechniken 0aNährstoffe 0aStoffwechsel 0aDarmflora1 aRist, Manuela 1 aRubio-Aliaga, Isabel 0 tErwerbsobstbau.g2010 Nov., v. 52, no. 2 p.65-69dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0014-03097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10341-010-0112-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101203b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02812naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245008700183300001800270520122300288650001101511650001201522650001901534650000901553650002801562650000901590650002201599650003901621650001101660650001101671650002401682650002301706650000901729650001601738650006401754650003701818650003301855650002001888650001701908650003101925700002101956700001801977700001801995700002302013773010802036852000902144856008502153930003302238946001102271655001202282IND4442933420221119033355.0100924e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444293342DNAL7 a203492582pmid7 a10.1007/s10067-010-1429-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGandhi, Rajiv 14aThe synovial fluid adiponectin-leptin ratio predicts pain with knee osteoarthritis  ap. 1223-1228.  aThe relationship between adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, and cartilage degeneration is being increasingly recognized. We asked what the relationship is between these hormones and patient-reported knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain. We collected demographic data, Short Form McGill Pain scores, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scores, and synovial fluid (SF) samples from 60 consecutive patients with severe knee OA at the time of joint replacement surgery. SF samples were analyzed for leptin and adiponectin using specific ELISA. Non-parametric correlations and linear regression modeling were used to identify the relationship between the adipokines and pain levels. The correlations between the individual adipokines and the pain scales were low to moderate and consistently less than that for the corresponding adiponectin/leptin (A/L) ratio. Linear regression modeling showed that the A/L ratio was a significant predictor of a greater level of pain on the MPQ-SF (p = 0.03) but not the WOMAC pain scale (p = 0.77). A greater A/L ratio was associated with less pain with severe knee OA and this metabolic pathway may represent a target for novel therapeutics. 3aleptin 3aobesity 3aosteoarthritis 3apain 2aAdiponectinxmetabolism 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aArthroplasty, Replacementxmethods 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aKnee Jointxsurgery 2aLeptinxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aOsteoarthritis, Kneexcomplicationsxdiagnosisxmetabolism. 2aOutcome Assessment, Health Care. 2aPainxdiagnosisxmetabolism. 2aPain Management 2aRisk Factors 2aSynovial Fluidxmetabolism1 aTakahashi, Mark 1 aSmith, Holly 1 aRizek, Randy 1 aMahomed, Nizar N. 0 tClinical rheumatology.g2010 Nov., v. 29, no. 11 p.1223-1228dLondon : Springer-Verlagx0770-31987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10067-010-1429-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100924b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03067naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245015500211300001600366520156900382650002101951650004201972650003502014653002102049653004102070700002402111700002502135700002902160700002102189700002902210700001502239700001902254700002202273700002402295700002302319700002402342773011702366852000902483856008502492930003302577946001102610655001202621IND4448557220221119033718.0110128e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444855722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10549-010-1082-x2doi7 aPMC29920942pmcid7 a206767552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrasky, Theodore M. 10aGenetic variants in COX-2, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and breast cancer risk: the Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) Study  ap. 157-165.  aChronic inflammation has been consistently associated with cancers of several sites, including the breast, and inhibition of inflammation through the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been inversely associated with risk. As NSAIDs bind with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), genetic variation in COX-2 may influence breast cancer risk by affecting inflammatory response and response to NSAID use. We identified eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for COX-2 and examined their association with risk of breast cancer in a population-based case-control study in Western New York. Cases had incident, first primary, histologically confirmed breast cancer (n = 1077). Controls (n = 1910) were randomly selected from NY Department of Motor Vehicles records (<65) or Medicare rolls (≥65). Participants were queried on adult lifetime use of aspirin and recent use of ibuprofen. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). One SNP, rs2745559, was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.46). Associations with other variants were not evident. Significant interaction (P interaction = 0.04) between recent aspirin use and rs4648261 was also observed. Variation in COX-2 was modestly associated with breast cancer risk, indicating that COX-2 may play a role in breast carcinogenesis. Better understanding of the role of COX-2 genetic variation and interaction with NSAID use in breast carcinogenesis has potential to inform prevention strategies. 3abreast neoplasms 3anonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aCyclooxygenase-2 0aProstaglandinendoperoxide synthase 21 aBonner, Matthew R. 1 aMoysich, Kirsten B. 1 aOchs-Balcom, Heather M. 1 aMarian, Catalin 1 aAmbrosone, Christine B. 1 aNie, Jing 1 aTao, Meng Hua 1 aEdge, Stephen B. 1 aTrevisan, Maurizio 1 aShields, Peter G. 1 aFreudenheim, Jo L. 0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2011 Feb., v. 126, no. 1 p.157-165dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-010-1082-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110128b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02314naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245010900159300001600268520104000284650001401324650002601338650001901364650001301383650002301396650001401419650000901433650001501442650002801457650002001485653002701505653003401532700001501566700001801581700001701599700001601616773012001632852000901752856008501761930003301846946001301879655001201892IND4445404920221119033600.0101119e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444540492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10924-010-0208-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAres, A. 10aRheological, Mechanical and Thermal Behaviour of Wood Polymer Composites Based on Recycled Polypropylene  ap. 318-325.  aThe aim of this paper was to investigate the effect of recycled polypropylene (PP) on the rheological, mechanical and thermal properties of wood flour polypropylene composites. Beforehand, the influence of wood flour treated with a coupling agent on the rheological behaviour had been looked at. By analysing moduli and viscosity curves and studying the thermal and mechanical properties of samples with 10% filler it was possible to see that the recycled PP that was added change in either its physical properties or its rheology. In the other wood plastic composites (WPC) studied, slight changes in the rheology behaviour were observed. However, the same processing parameters may be used with and without recycled PP. Recycled PP is appropriate for these kinds of composites to maintain the optimal rheological properties that make it easier to process the material by extrusion. Furthermore, it is also possible to maintain the thermal and mechanical properties in comparison with the behaviour of virgin PP/wood flour composites. 3aextrusion 3amechanical properties 3apolypropylenes 3arheology 3athermal properties 3aviscosity 3awood 3awood flour 3awood plastic composites 3awood properties 0aRecycled polypropylene 0aWood plastic composites (WPC)1 aBouza, R. 1 aPardo, S.

For r(CACCUGGCGACAGGUG), the addition of Mg² ⁺ reveals two types of base-pairs: r(U⁵⁴⁵·A) and r(G⁵⁴⁶·C), in the first category, have lifetimes only slightly higher in the presence of Mg² ⁺ , whereas their dissociation constants are substantially reduced. This behavior has been termed proximal. The base-pairs r(G⁵⁵³·C) and r(G⁵⁵⁴·C), in the second category, have lifetimes substantially higher in the presence of Mg² ⁺ , whereas their dissociation constants remain almost constant. This behavior has been termed distal. Mg² ⁺ has a specific effect on r(CACCUGGCGACAGGUG), the magnitude of which is progressively modulated from the proximal region of the 16-mer towards its distal region. For r(GGCCAAAAGCC), an intermediate behavior is found for base-pairs r(G⁵⁶⁵·C) and r(G⁵⁷²·C). Their lifetimes are slightly higher in the presence of Mg² ⁺ and their dissociation constants are significantly lower, a behavior resembling that of the 16-mer proximal region. These results indicate that Mg² ⁺ diffusively moves around r(GGCCAAAAGCC). 0aBase-pair kinetics 0aEMCV IRES 0aGNRA tetraloop 0aImino proton exchange 0aMg²⁻⁺⁻ 0aNMR 0aRAAA hairpin motif1 aSnoussi, Karim 0 tJournal of biological physics.g2011 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.61-68dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0092-06067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10867-010-9198-03Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02813naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008300128300001400211500001500225520150900240650001801749650001201767650001501779650002201794650002801816650001701844650002001861650003501881653002601916653004401942653001101986653002701997653002802024653001002052653002502062653003702087653002502124700001802149700002002167700001702187773007302204852000902277930003302286945001302319946001102332655001202343IND2325463120221119033755.0020217e200108  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232546312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, K.10aSNP frequency and allelic haplotype structure of Beta vulgaris expressed genes  ap. 63-74.  a2019-12-05  aBased on EST sequences, fragments of 37 genes have been amplified and sequenced in two inbred lines of sugar beet. The rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) corresponded to 1 every 130 bp, with an average pi (nucleotide diversity) value of 7.6 x 10(-3). When extrapolated to the whole sugar beet genome, randomly compared lines differ at 5.4 x 10(6) SNPs in the genetic pool considered. In a wider search for SNP-related polymorphisms, 96 fragments of expressed genes were scanned with SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) and heteroduplex (HA) analyses in 8 inbred lines. One SSCP or HA polymorphism was found every 1,470 bp of amplified DNA, corresponding to 5 x 10(5) SSCP or HA loci in the whole genome. This frequency, 11 times lower than the SNP rate, was attributed to the high frequency of base pair substitution along the amplified fragment analysed electrophoretically. Therefore nucleotide variability was further studied by sequencing fragments of 10 genes in the same 8 lines. The results indicate that sugar beet alleles of expressed genes are very frequently organized as robust intragene haplotypes. In the 8 lines analysed, two haplotypes were identified for each of three gene fragments, three haplotypes for six gene fragments and four haplotypes for one gene fragment which is in good correspondence with the number of alleles detected by SSCP and HA analysis. In a cross between two lines, SSCP or HA alleles of expressed genes have 54% probability to be different. 3aBeta vulgaris 3aalleles 3ahaplotypes 3acomplementary DNA 3aexpressed sequence tags 3ainbred lines 3agenetic markers 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 0aheteroduplex analysis 0asingle strand conformation polymorphism 0agenome 0abiochemical techniques 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0agenetic polymorphism1 aWeisshaar, B.1 aBorchardt, D.C.1 aSalamini, F.0 tMolecular breeding.g2001 Aug., v. 8, no. 1 p.63-74x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02707naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245017100124300001400295520126600309650001701575650002201592650001801614650001301632650001701645650001001662650002201672650002001694650001401714650002001728650001801748650001101766650002101777650001001798650002001808650002001828650002101848650003601869653001401905653003501919700001401954700001401968700001401982700001401996700001402010700001402024773007302038852000902111930003302120945001302153946001102166655001202177IND2325463220221119033658.0020217e200108  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232546322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, S.I.10aConstitutive and seed-specific expression of a maize lysine-feedback-insensitive dihydrodipicolinate synthase gene leads to increased free lysine levels in rice seeds  ap. 75-84.  aIn order to improve the nutritional value of rice, we prepared transgenic rice plants with a lysine-feedback-insensitive maize dhps gene under the control of CaMV 35S and the rice glutelin GluB-1 promoter for over-expression and seed-specific expression. The transgenic plants were fertile and expressed the dhps gene abundantly or specifically in rice seeds. The transgenic lines (TC lines) containing mutated dhps controlled by CaMV 35S promoter possessed higher mutated DHPS transcript levels and in vitro DHPS activities in seeds than those of TS lines containing the mutated dhps gene driven by a seed-specific promoter, GluB-1. The content of free lysine in immature seeds of both TC and TS lines was higher than that of wild-type plants. The content of free lysine in mature seeds of TC lines was still higher than, but that of TS lines was similar to, that of wild-type plants. From a comparison of DHPS and lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (LKR) expression levels we conclude that the presence of the foreign dhps gene leads to an increase of LKR activity, resulting in enhanced lysine catabolism. However, over-expression of the mutant dhps gene in a constitutive manner overcomes lysine catabolism and sustains a high lysine level in mature rice seeds. 3aOryza sativa 3atransgenic plants 3agene transfer 3aZea mays 3ahydro-lyases 3agenes 3acomplementary DNA 3arecombinant DNA 3aglutelins 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3alysine 3afree amino acids 3aseeds 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidoreductases 3apromoter regions 3achemical constituents of plants 0adhps gene 0alysine ketoglutarate reductase1 aKim, H.U.1 aLee, Y.H.1 aSuh, S.C.1 aLim, Y.P.1 aLee, H.Y.1 aKim, H.I.0 tMolecular breeding.g2001 Aug., v. 8, no. 1 p.75-84x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02453naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245012800131300001600259520128300275650002201558650002201580650001801602650002701620650001001647650002601657650002001683650001801703650001201721650001701733650002001750650001801770650001501788650003201803653001301835700001701848700002401865773007601889852000901965930003301974945001302007946001102020655001202031IND2327803120221119033557.0020630e200109  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232780312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZiegelhoffer, T.10aDramatic effects of truncation and sub-cellular targeting on the accumulation of recombinant microbial cellulase in tobacco  ap. 147-158.  aThe economical bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol is dependent on the availability of large quantities of inexpensive cellulase enzymes. One way to reduce the cost of such enzymes is to produce them in crop plants at high levels. In order to assess factors that limit recombinant cellulase expression in plants, we have introduced the gene encoding E1 endo-1,4-beta-glucanase (cellulase) of Acidothermus cellulolyticus into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. Both the holoenzyme (E1) and catalytic domain (E1cd) were targeted to three sub-cellular compartments; the cytosol, chloroplast and apoplast. Accumulation of both E1 and E1cd was greatest in the apoplast, with levels more than 100-fold higher than observed for cytosolic accumulation. In all three compartments, E1cd accumulated to higher levels than the full-length enzyme. By combining truncation and apoplastic localization, an increase in expression of more than 500-fold was achieved, compared to cytosolic full-length E1. This effect is primarily post-transcriptional, since E1cd mRNA levels are very similar despite the range of E1cd accumulation observed. Recombinant E1cd, expressed at up to 1.6% total soluble protein, is extremely stable in both crude leaf extracts and dried leaf material. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atransgenic plants 3agene transfer 3agenetic transformation 3agenes 3athermophilic bacteria 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acytosol 3achloroplasts 3aenzyme activity 3acytochemistry 3acellulases 3aAcidothermus cellulolyticus 0aapoplast1 aRaasch, J.A.1 aAustin-Phillips, S.0 tMolecular breeding.g2001 Sept., v. 8, no. 2 p.147-158x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03702naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013700127300001600264500001500280520229400295650002702589650001802616650001802634650003902652650002202691650002302713650002002736650001602756650002502772650002002797650001402817650002002831653001302851653002102864700001302885700001402898700001202912700001802924700001202942700001702954700001702971700001802988700001703006700001903023773007603042852000903118930003303127945001303160946001103173655001203184IND2327802320221119033357.0020630e200109  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232780232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xunjing.10aBar-expressing peppermint (Mentha x Piperita L. var. Black Mitcham) plants are highly resistant to the glufosinate herbicide Liberty  ap. 109-118.  a2019-12-05  aWeed control is a substantial economic input for production of mint oils, the most commercially important of which are obtained from peppermint. The objective of this research is to obtain peppermint plants resistant to the broad-spectrum herbicide glufosinate, which can be used for development of economically efficacious weed control strategies and, perhaps, serve as a paradigm in perennial crops. The bar gene, which encodes phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) which inactivates glufosinate-ammonium or phosphinothricin (PPT), was constructed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens binary vectors under the nopaline synthase (NOS) or a chimeric promoter containing a trimer of the OCS-upstream-activating sequence (UAS) to a MAS promoter/activator region[(OCS)3MAS]. A total of 142 independent transgenic peppermint (cv. Black Mitcham) plants were obtained (107 and 35 were obtained with pGPTV (and pCAS1) and pATC940 vectors, respectively) and evaluated for herbicide resistance in the greenhouse after foliar application of glufosinate herbicide Liberty as the commercial product. All transgenic plants exhibited substantially less herbicide symptom development than non-transgenic Black Mitcham or untransformed tissue cultured-derived plants, albeit variation for herbicide resistance occurred amongst the transformed lines. Plants from 35 of the 142 lines were selected at random and all were PCR-positive for the presence of bar. Five lines, that were least affected, exhibited no injury symptoms to Liberty concentrations that are 4 times the standard level for control of weeds in peppermint fields. The most resistant transgenic plants had the greatest steady-state PAT mRNA levels and PAT activities. No experimental difference in herbicide resistance was evident between plant populations obtained with pGPTV (pCAS1)-bar or pATC940-bar vector. However, 4 of 35 lines transformed with (ocs)3MAS-bar exhibited maximal resistance while only 1 of 107 NOS-bar lines has comparable resistance. These herbicide resistant peppermint plants will facilitate development of post-emergent herbicide control strategies that use newer generation herbicides, like glufosinate, which have reduced environmental and product residual because of metabolism by microbes and the transgenic plants. 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3amessenger RNA 3aphosphinothricin acetyltransferase 3atransgenic plants 3afoliar application 3agene expression 3aglufosinate 3aherbicide resistance 3aMentha piperita 3abilanafos 3aenzyme activity 0abar gene 0aacyltransferases1 aGong, Z.1 aKoiwa, H.1 aNiu, X.1 aEspartero, J.1 aZhu, X.1 aVeronese, P.1 aRuggiero, B.1 aBressan, R.A.1 aWeller, S.C.1 aHasegawa, P.M.0 tMolecular breeding.g2001 Sept., v. 8, no. 2 p.109-118x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02805naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013200130300001600262500001500278520132100293650004501614650002701659650001201686650001201698650001101710650000901721650004301730650003001773650002201803650002701825650002401852650002301876650001301899650002301912650003201935650002001967653001601987653004302003653003702046653001802083700001602101700002202117700001902139773007502158852000902233930003302242945001302275946001102288655001202299IND2229957420221119033550.0010207e200004  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222995742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandbrink, J.M.10aTwo related genotypes of Solanum microdontum carry different segregating alleles for field resistance to Phytophthora infestans  ap. 215-225.  a2019-12-05  aSix F1 populations produced from crosses between two Solanum microdontum genotypes and three S. tuberosum genotypes have been assessed for resistance to Phytophthora infestans (late blight; LB) in the field and proved to segregate for P. infestans resistance. The six populations were subjected to genetic mapping using AFLP markers in combination with a core map consisting of RFLPs and a few PCR-based markers. The two S. microdontum parents MCD167 and MCD178 harbour different alleles contributing to resistance. In the MCD167 set of populations a major QTL contributing to resistance was located on chromosome 4. This locus was not detected in the MCD178 set of populations. In the latter set of populations, a major QTL for resistance was detected on chromosome 10. This locus for resistance was not detected in the MCD167 set of populations. A third QTL contributing strongly to resistance was detected on chromosome 5. However, this locus was not consistently detected in all populations. For the loci on chromosome 5 and 10, segregation for resistance alleles from the susceptible parents was also observed. The results provide a starting point for future combinations of genes, to predict the value of each combination and finally to obtain potato germplasm carrying high levels of durable resistance to LB. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3amicrosatellite repeats 3ahybrids 3aalleles 3ablight 3aloci 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3afungal diseases of plants 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aSolanum microdontum 3achromosome mapping 3agenotype 3adisease resistance 3ainterspecific hybridization 3agenetic markers 0asegregation 0acleaved amplified polymorphic sequence 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0agene location1 aColon, L.T.1 aWolters, P.J.C.C.1 aStiekema, W.J.0 tMolecular breeding.g2000 Apr., v. 6, no. 2 p.215-225x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02196naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011300127300001600240520106800256650002201324650002001346650002401366650000901390650001601399650001001415650001701425650001601442650000801458650001401466650001301480650002301493650004301516650001601559651001401575653002601589700001801615773007501633852000901708930003301717945001301750946001101763655001201774IND2229954820221119033548.0010207e200004  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND222995482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker, G.D.10aDevelopment of a STS marker linked to a major locus controlling flour colour in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)  ap. 169-174.  aFlour colour is an important quality trait in the production of bread, noodles and other related end products. Current screening for flour colour in breeding programs requires several grams of flour to be milled. In order to screen large numbers of plants, a rapid PCR-based assay is required. We report here the conversion of a codominant AFLP marker linked to a major locus controlling flour colour in hexaploid wheat, to a sequence tagged site (STS) marker for use in marker-assisted selection (MAS). The two-allelic AFLP bands were cloned and sequenced to allow specific primers to be designed. The primers amplified bands of the expected size in the parental varieties and co-segregated with the original AFLP marker in the mapping population. The primers also amplified alleles of the expected size from the DNA of parental lines of two other related mapping populations. Cultivars that contributed to the pedigree of the original parent 'Schomburgk' used to generate the mapping population were also screened to determine the origin of the 'yellow' allele. 3aTriticum aestivum 3agenetic markers 3aquantitative traits 3aloci 3awheat flour 3acolor 3afood quality 3amajor genes 3aDNA 3acultivars 3apedigree 3alinkage (genetics) 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aDNA primers 3aAustralia 0asequence tagged sites1 aLangridge, P.0 tMolecular breeding.g2000 Apr., v. 6, no. 2 p.169-174x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02156naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245007100165300001600236520126400252653001901516653002901535653002701564653001801591700002501609700001901634773010801653852000901761856008501770946001101855655001201866IND4441868620221119031926.0100827e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444186862DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-010-9517-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelcuk, Levent 10aProbabilistic seismic hazard assessment for Lake Van basin, Turkey  ap. 949-965.  aThe seismic hazard for the Lake Van basin is computed using a probabilistic approach, along with the earthquake data from 1907 to present. The spatial distribution of seismic events between the longitudes of 41-45° and the latitudes of 37.5-40°, which encompasses the region, indicates distinct seismic zones. The positions of these zones are well aligned with the known tectonic features such as the Tutak-Çaldıran fault zone, the Özalp fault zone, the Gevaş fault zone, the Bitlis fault zone and Karlıova junction where the North Anatolian fault zone and East Anatolian fault zone meet. These faults are known to have generated major earthquakes which strongly affected cities and towns such as Van, Muş, Bitlis, Özalp, Muradiye, Çaldıran, Erciş, Adilcevaz, Ahlat, Tatvan, Gevaş and Gürpınar. The recurrence intervals of M s ≥ 4 earthquakes were evaluated in order to obtain the parameters of the Gutenberg-Richter measurements for seismic zones. More importantly, iso-acceleration maps of the basin were produced with a grid interval of 0.05 degrees. These maps are developed for 100- and 475- year return periods, utilizing the domestic attenuation relationships. A computer program called Sistehan II was utilized to generate these maps. 0aLake Van Basin 0aPeak ground acceleration 0aProbabilistic approach 0aReturn period1 aSelcuk, Azad Saglam 1 aBeyaz, Turgay 0 tNatural hazards.g2010 Sept., v. 54, no. 3 p.949-965dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-010-9517-63Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01350naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245001100130300001600141300002100157520047600178650001100654650001400665650002500679650001200704650001700716650002300733650001300756650001200769650000900781700001700790700001600807773007700823852001300900939003300913945000800946946001300954852000900967655001200976991583055260742620221119031808.0860317e198508  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860099022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaal, H.M.10aYogurt  ap. 452-454.  ap. 452-454. ill.  aExtract: Vitamin D deficient rickets occurred in a 15-month-old black girl for whom yogurt had been substituted for milk products.

Estimates of global and Australian insect species richness are reviewed, and Australia's insect biodiversity is placed in its biogeographical context of Mesozoic, Gondwanan connectivity and Tertiary isolation. Some unique, relict faunal elements derived from Australia's long periods of isolation are highlighted. Examples of the dramatic insect evolutionary radiations are profiled that are the consequence of successful adaptation to new biomes made available by the environmental transformations in Australia in the latter half of the Tertiary. Then conservation of Australian forests and the major processes threatening Australian biodiversity are discussed: invasive species, habitat conversion and climate change. The four components necessary to build sustainability in Australia or throughout the world are discussed: description and understanding, direct action for conservation, promoting sustainable use in balance with conservation, and providing education and information to maintain the overall effort. 3abiogeography 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aeducation 3afauna 3aforests 3ahabitats 3ainsects 3ainvasive species 3aspecies diversity 3aAustralia 0aAustralian insect 0asustainability1 aYeates, David K.0 tAustralian journal of entomology.g2007 Aug., v. 46, no. 3 p.177-187dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1326-67567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-6055.2007.00601.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070701b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02701naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245008900161300001800250520124800268650002501516650000801541650002001549650001901569650001501588650001601603650001701619650002801636650001201664650001901676650002601695650002001721650002101741650001801762653002901780653002201809653000901831653000901840653000901849700002201858700002101880700001901901700002101920773011601941852000902057856008502066930003302151946001102184655001202195IND4445183120221119031703.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444518312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00299-010-0930-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Youli 10aDifferential sensitivity of Arabidopsis siRNA biogenesis mutants to genotoxic stress  ap. 1401-1410.  aPlant response to stress has been linked to different RNA-silencing processes and epigenetic mechanisms. Our recent results showed that Arabidopsis thaliana Dicer-like (DCL) mutants were impaired in transgenerational changes, recombination frequency and stress tolerance. We also found that transgenerational changes were dependent on changes in DNA methylation. Here, we hypothesized that plants deficient in the production of small RNAs would show an impaired abiotic stress response. To test this, we exposed A. thaliana dcl2, dcl3, dcl4, dcl2 dcl3 (d2d3), dcl2 dcl4 (d2d4), dcl2 dcl3 dcl4 (d2d3d4), nrpd1a, rdr2 and rdr6 mutants to methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). We found dcl4 and rdr6 to be more sensitive and dcl2, dcl3, d2d3 and rdr2 plants more resistant to MMS, as shown by fresh weight, root length and survival rate. The in vitro repair assay showed the lower ability of dcl2 and dcl3 to repair UV-damaged DNA. To summarize, we found that whereas mutants impaired in transactivating siRNA biogenesis were more sensitive to MMS, mutants impaired in natural antisense siRNA and heterochromatic siRNA biogeneses were more tolerant. Our data suggest that plant response to MMS is in part regulated through biogenesis of various siRNAs. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aabiotic stress 3abiogenesis 3aepigenetics 3agenotoxicity 3amethyl methanesulfonate 3amutants 3aplant response 3asmall interfering RNA 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3asurvival rate 0aMethyl methane sulfonate 0aDicer-like mutant 0adcl2 0adcl3 0adcl41 aBilichak, Andriy 1 aGolubov, Andrey 1 aBlevins, Todd 1 aKovalchuk, Igor 0 tPlant cell reports.g2010 Dec., v. 29, no. 12 p.1401-1410dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-010-0930-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02449naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245014600176300001600322520142800338653002601766653002501792653001601817700003301833700003301866700002801899700002301927773009001950852000902040856008502049946001302134655001202147IND4441041320221119031735.0100806e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444104132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11102-010-0222-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPortocarrero-Ortiz, Lesly 12aA modified protocol using half-dose gadolinium in dynamic 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging for detection of ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors  ap. 230-235.  aACTH-secreting tumors represent 10% of functioning pituitary adenomas, and most of them are microadenomas. It is generally accepted that only half of these tumors are correctly identified with current magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. The objective of the paper is to report a method for detecting suspected ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors undetectable by conventional dynamic MRI using dynamic 3-Tesla MRI (3T MRI) and half-dose gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.05 mmol/Kg). Eight patients were included (5 men and 3 women) with a mean age of 29.12 years. Each of them had a confirmed diagnosis of Cushing disease and a negative dynamic MRI for microadenoma using full-dose gadopentetate dimeglumine. A second MRI was then performed using only half the usual dose of contrast material. Images from the second MRI where compared with the first study. Microadenomas were detected in 100% of the patients using a half dose of the contrast. All were recognized on the basis of the presence of a hypointense nodular lesion surrounded by normal contrast-enhanced tissue. Six patients were submitted to surgery, and the results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry in all of them. The remaining subject had a sinus sample catheterization coincident with the MRI results. Conclusion: A half dose of dynamic resonance imaging contrast material increases the sensitivity of MRI detection of ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors. 0aACTH pituitary tumors 0aHalf-dose gadolinium 0aDynamic MRI1 aBonifacio-Delgadillo, Dulce 1 aSotomayor-González, Arturo 1 aGarcia-Marquez, Arturo 1 aLopez-Serna, Raul 0 tPituitary.g2010 Sept., v. 13, no. 3 p.230-235dBoston : Springer USx1386-341X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11102-010-0222-y3Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02503naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245015000164300001600314520114000330650001501470650002101485650002001506650001601526650002601542650000701568650001801575650002701593650002801620650002901648650001401677653002401691653003301715653005801748700001801806700001601824773010301840852000901943856008501952930003302037946001102070655001202081IND4441832720221119031751.0100827e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444183272DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-010-1687-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFang, Guozhen 10aMultiwalled Carbon Nanotubes as SPE Adsorbents for Simultaneous Determination of Seven Sulfonylurea Herbicides in Environmental Water by LC-MS-MS  ap. 403-409.  aAn effective and rapid method was developed for simultaneous determination of seven sulfonylurea herbicides in environmental water using multiwalled carbon nanotubes as solid-phase extraction sorbent coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Important parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as pH of the sample solution, flow rate of sample loading, the eluent and its volume were optimized. Under optimum conditions, good linearity was obtained for all herbicides (r ² > 0.99) over the range of 0.05-5,000 ng L⁻¹, and precisions (RSD) for nine replicate measurements of a standard mixture of 200 ng L⁻¹ were 1.9-7.4%. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.01-0.20 and 0.05-1.00 ng L⁻¹, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of tap water, spring water, ground water and well water, and mean recoveries for seven analytes at three spiked concentration levels were from 81.5 to 110.5% with RSDs between 0.3 and 7.0%. The results showed that the established method has wide application to analyze sulfonylurea herbicides at trace level in water. 3aadsorbents 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3agroundwater 3aliquid chromatography 3apH 3arapid methods 3asolid phase extraction 3asulfonylurea herbicides 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atap water 0aEnvironmental water 0aMultiwalled carbon nanotubes 0aColumn liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry1 aWang, Xuenan 1 aWang, Shuo 0 tChromatographia.g2010 Sept., v. 72, no. 5-6 p.403-409dWiesbaden : Vieweg Verlagx0009-58937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1365/s10337-010-1687-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20100827b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01381naa a2200373 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002200115245009200137300001600229300002100245500001500266520033600281650001300617650001700630650001300647650002400660650001800684650001700702650001500719653003000734700002100764700002400785700002100809700002400830773007800854852000900932939003300941945000800974946001300982655001200995991583048570742620221119031629.0800626e197910  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800013642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBujanover, Yoram.10aCholestyramine treatment of chronic diarrhea associated with immune deficiency syndrome  ap. 630-633.  ap. 630-633. ill.  a2019-12-05  aImmunodeficiency disease renders a patient susceptible to intestinal candidiasis, which results in chronic diarrhea and malabsorption.

Elderly patients have markedly less physiologic reserve than do younger patients, and comorbidity is common. Even with optimal care, the risk of mortality and morbidity remains high. Multidisciplinary care, including early orthogeriatric input, is recommended to anticipate and treat complications. This article explores modern treatment strategies for this challenging group of patients and provides guidance for systematically preparing and optimizing elderly patients before surgery, based on best available current evidence and recommendations by relevant health organizations. 3aosteoporosis1 aColvin, P.

It appears, therefore, that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells may be productively infected by FIV in vivo. 3asurface antigens 3aviability 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3acats 3asuppressor cells 3aenzyme activity 3aFeline immunodeficiency virus 3ainfection 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aCD4 Antigensximmunology. 2aCD8 Antigens. 2aAntigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyteximmunology 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aCells, Cultured 2aFeline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndromeximmunologyxpathology. 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aImmunodeficiency Virus, Felinexenzymologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aRNA-Directed DNA Polymerasexmetabolism 2aRetroviridae Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aSpecific Pathogen-Free Organisms 2aT-Lymphocytes, Regulatoryximmunologyxmicrobiology. 0aT-lymphocytes 0aviral immunosuppression 0ahelper cells1 aBissey, L.1 aLogan, K.S.1 aPedersen, N.C.1 aElder, J.H.1 aCollisson, E.W.0 tJournal of virology.g1991 June, v. 65, no. 6 p.3359-3364x0022-538X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02485naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001700149245012100166300001800287520069200305650002300997650002301020650001901043650000801062650002501070650002001095650001501115650001301130650001401143650001801157650001201175650003601187650001401223650002001237650001501257650001301272650002501285650003901310650003901349653001701388653002001405653003001425653001401455653001401469653002501483653002401508653002801532653002801560700001501588700001701603700001701620700001801637700001401655700001601669700001601685773007901701852000901780939003301789946001301822655001201835IND9103651820221119031550.0910923e199106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910365182DNAL7 a18518872pmid7 aPMC2410032pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosset, F.L.10aImprovement of avian leukosis virus (ALV)-based retrovirus vectors by using different cis-acting sequences from ALVs  ap. 3388-3394.  aProduction and expression of double-expression vectors which transduce both Neo(r) and lacZ genes and are based on the structure of avian leukosis virus were enhanced by using cis-acting sequences (long terminal repeats and noncoding sequences) from Rous-associated virus-1 and Rous-associated virus-2 rather than those of avian erythroblastosis virus previously used in our constructs.

However, the role of fluorine substitutions in their structure-activity relationship (SAR) has not been explored. We have synthesized a trifluoromethyl analog of verbenachalcone (VC), a pharmacologically active natural compound previously shown to potentiate NGF activity. This analog, designated C278, enhances neurite outgrowth and proliferation of NeuroScreen-1™ (NS-1) cells, a subclone of PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. C278 increases the percentage of neurite bearing cells in the presence of suboptimal doses of NGF in comparison with controls treated with NGF alone. In addition, C278 stimulates cell growth in reduced serum and serum-free cell culture conditions based on our observation of increases in cell number and metabolic assessment with MTT reduction and resazurin assays. The addition of C278 partially restored inhibition of NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. Short-term sequential exposure of cells to U0126, C278, and NGF enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in comparison with cells treated with only the MEK inhibitor and NGF. C278 also attenuated cell growth arrest caused by exposure to PD98059, U0126 and the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, LY294002 but did not alter phosphorylation of Akt, a classic downstream target of PI3K during cell survival. These data suggest that C278 promotes NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth in NS-1 cells through a MEK signaling pathway by a mechanism that alters short-term activation of ERK. In contrast, C278 promotes PI3K-mediated survival independently of Akt phosphorylation. 0aNeurite outgrowth 0aPotentiator 0aNGF 0aVerbenachalcone 0aTrifluoromethyl analog 0aNeuroScreen-1 0aNeuroprotective 0aNS-1 0aPC12 0aNatural product1 aGilyazova, Nailya 1 aHuh, Eun Young 1 aDandepally, Srinivasa R. 1 aOldham, Carla 1 aWilliams, Alfred 1 aIbeanu, Gordon 0 tCellular and molecular neurobiology.g2011 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.145-153dBoston : Springer USx0272-43407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10571-010-9563-33Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02065naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009300168300001600261520090900277650001601186650001201202650001101214650001801225650002201243650000901265650001201274650001301286650001201299650001701311650001301328653001101341653002601352700002101378773013001399852000901529856008501538930003301623946001101656655001201667IND4441647020221119031719.0100820e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444164702DNAL7 a10.1007/s11160-009-9145-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikorska, Justyna 10aCadmium and copper toxicity to tench Tinca tinca (L.) larvae after a short-term exposure  ap. 417-423.  aAt the onset of swimbladder inflation, Tinca tinca larvae were exposed for 24 h to cadmium or copper at 0.0 (control concentration), 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 mg dm⁻³ at 22°C. From then larvae were reared at 25°C for 9 days in un-supplemented water. Both metals resulted in a significantly reduced growth, survival, and retarded swimbladder inflation in a dose-response manner. The highest Cd and Cu concentration delayed the onset of exogenous feeding (live artemia nauplii) for 2 or 1 days, respectively, comparing to the control concentration. Our results demonstrate a highly toxic effect of Cd and Cu in the studied period of larval ontogeny, when fish seem especially sensitive. Although, at low concentrations and long exposure period, Cu is considered more toxic to fish than Cd, our study revealed the reverse effect for first-feeding larvae of both metals at high concentrations and short exposure. 3aTinca tinca 3acadmium 3acopper 3adose response 3aexposure duration 3afish 3anauplii 3aontogeny 3arearing 3aswim bladder 3atoxicity 0aGrowth 0aSwimbladder inflation1 aWolnicki, Jacek 0 tReviews in fish biology and fisheries.g2010 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.417-423dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0960-31667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11160-009-9145-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03028naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245010400169300001600273500001500289520155800304650000901862650002001871650001101891650001001902650001901912650001301931650001401944650001101958650001401969650001201983650001501995650001102010650001302021650001102034651001102045653003002056653001502086653001802101653001102119653001902130700001602149700001702165700002002182700002602202773013202228852000902360856008502369930003302454946001102487655001202498IND4442658420221119031857.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444265842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-010-0378-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStøen, Ole-Gunnar 14aThe effect of recreational homes on willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) in a mountain area of Norway  ap. 789-795.  a2019-12-04  aThe increasing development of recreational resorts and second homes in mountain regions worldwide require substantial infrastructure, and have large impact on habitats and ecosystems. We hypothesized that developed areas would attract predators and lead to higher predation on willow ptarmigan and lower their abundance. In a 500-km² study area in south-central Norway, we sampled the density of territorial cocks in spring and the breeding success of willow ptarmigan along a 3-km gradient extending out from clusters of cabins. We also sampled red fox scats and corvid birds and measured nest predation on artificial nests across this gradient. Densities of cocks in the spring and of adults and brood sizes in August did not vary along the gradient. However, the density of chicks in August was higher beyond 1.5 km from cabin areas, presumably because more hens lost their clutches in the vicinity of cabins. This was supported by the results from the artificial nest experiment where significantly more nests were depredated near cabin areas than further away. The number of scats of red fox along trails increased with distance from cabins, whereas more corvid birds were observed near cabins. We conclude that corvid birds were the main cause of higher loss of ptarmigan nests near cabin areas, which led to lower production of chicks. Breeding density, however, did not seem to vary along the gradient, presumably because of suitable habitat for breeding and little human activity in these areas during the period of pair formation and nesting. 3ahens 3aLagopus lagopus 3ahumans 3anests 3abreeding sites 3abreeding 3apredators 3aspring 3apredation 3anesting 3aecosystems 3achicks 3ahabitats 3aadults 3aNorway 0aAnthropogenic disturbance 0aSmall game 0aWillow grouse 0atrails 0aNest predation1 aWegge, Per 1 aHeid, Stian 1 aHjeljord, Olav 1 aNellemann, Christian 0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2010 Oct., v. 56, no. 5 p.789-795dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-010-0378-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01302naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245012200123300001800245500001500263520017600278650001900454650001200473650001700485650001700502650002700519650001000546650002200556650002900578651001000607653001600617653001600633653001300649653001400662653002300676700001400699700002800713700001700741773006900758852000900827939003300836946001100869655001200880IND9103655520221119031606.0910920s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910365552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTada, M.10aPhloroglucinol derivatives as competitive inhibitors against thromboxane A2 and leukotriene D4 from Hypericum erectum  ap. 2559-2562.  a2019-12-04  aNew antibacterial phloroglucinol derivatives were isolated from Hypericum erectum.

Excised defoliated stems incorporated up to 6.7% of radioactive acetate into these lipids in a three day incorporation period. The label from [2-14C]acetate proceeded mainly to the fatty acid moiety of the triterpene and steryl esters, the fatty acids of the triacylglycerols, the free sterols and the cardenolides. Optimal results were obtained with 10 cm stems from six-week-old plants. An increased supply of acetate (2.5-10 micromole stem-1) showed a saturated synthesis of cardenolides and triacylglycerols and caused an enhanced production of triterpenyl acetates. The highest yield of [14C]cardenolides was obtained after uptake of 5 micromole of acetate per stem. The cardenolide composition of the incubated stem tissue increased on the absorption of 10 micromole of acetate and major changes in organic acid composition were measured after uptake of 20 micromole of acetate. [13C]Uscharidin was biosynthesized from 0.5 mmol of [1,2-13C]acetate by 100 stem tips. 13CNMR spectroscopy showed an unequal relative enrichment in both the genin and the dideoxyhexosulose moiety. The construction of the butenolide ring by the condensation of a pregnane derivative with one molecule acetate as observed for 5 beta-cardenolides is not confirmed by these NMR data. 3aAsclepias curassavica 3astems 3alatex 3acardenolides 3abiosynthesis 3aacetates 0auscharidin1 aBinnekamp, A.1 aSeykens, D.0 tPhytochemistry.g1991, v. 30, no. 8 p.2577-2585x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02600naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011500128300001600243500001500259520122900274650001301503650002001516650002201536650002001558650003001578650001701608650002001625650002201645650001901667650002101686650003801707650001401745650002301759653002301782653000801805653003001813653002001843700001501863700001601878700001701894700001501911700001901926700001401945773006701959852000902026930003302035945001302068946001302081655001202094IND2042243020221119031548.0940926e199403  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204224302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMlynarova, L.10aReduced position effect in mature transgenic plants conferred by the chicken lysozyme matrix-associated region  ap. 417-426.  a2019-12-05  aMatrix-associated regions may be useful for studying the role of chromatin architecture in transgene activity of transformed plants.

Average GUS activity became somewhat higher, but the maximum attainable level of gene expression was similar for all three constructs. Transient gene expression assays showed that the A element did not contain general enhancer functions; therefore, its presence seemed to prevent the lower levels of transgene expression. The strongest reduction in variability was found in plants transformed with the construct carrying the A elements at the borders of the T-DNA. In this population, expression levels became copy number dependent. The presence of two A elements in the T-DNA did not interfere with meiosis. 3achickens 3arecombinant DNA 3atransgenic plants 3aplasmid vectors 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3atransfer DNA 3agene expression 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3aDNA conformation 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 3achromatin 3abeta-glucuronidase 0alysozyme a element 0aDNA 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0aposition effect1 aLoonen, A.1 aHeldens, J.1 aJansen, R.C.1 aKeizer, P.1 aStiekema, W.J.1 aNap, J.P.0 tPlant cell.g1994 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.417-426x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02513naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245017800166300001600344500001500360520108800375650002501463650003001488650001501518650001901533650001401552653001601566653003101582653002501613653001401638653002201652700002301674700002301697700002001720700002201740700002001762700002101782773013801803852000901941856008501950930003302035946001102068655001202079IND4447263820221119031633.0110107e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444726382DNAL7 a10.3103/S08914168100400512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedkova, A.

B. pertussis phenotypic phases that cause atypical and asymptomatic forms of pertussis, as well as persistent bacteria were suggested to be formed as a result of the integration of IS elements into the bvgAS operon and other virulence genes. A test system that allows one to detect IS elements integration into the bvgAS operon for in vitro bacterial cultures and bacteria isolated from humans was developed based on the RT-PCR technique. Different quantity of avirulent B. pertussis, containing IS element insertions in the virulence operon was found in patients with pertussis, acute and chronic respiratory infections of the upper and lower airways, as well as in apparently healthy people. 3aBordetella pertussis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation 3awhooping cough 3avirulence 0apersistence 0arespiratory tract diseases 0ainsertional elements 0apertussis 0aphenotypic phases1 aAlyapkina, Yu.

This region, which is located between coordinates -194 to -116 relative to the start codon of the Srglb3 gene, was named the nodule-infected cell expression (NICE) element. insertion of the NICE element into the truncated nopaline synthase promoter was found to confer a nodule-specific expression pattern on this normally root-enhanced promoter. Within the NICE element, three distinct motifs ([A]AAAGAT, TTGTCTCTT, and CACCC[T]) were identified; they are highly conserved in the promoter regions of a variety of plant (leg)hemoglobin genes. The NICE element and the adjacent AT-rich element (ATRE-BS2) were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. The expression patterns of nine selected Srglb3 promoter fragments carrying mutations in ATRE-BS2 and 19 with mutations in the NICE element were examined. Mutations in ATRE-BS2 had varying effects on Srglb3 promoter activity, ranging from a two- to threefold reduction to a slight stimulation of activity. Mutations in the highly conserved (A)AAAGAT motif of the NICE element reduced Srglb3 promoter activity two- to fourfold, whereas mutations in the TCTT portion of the TTGTCTCTT motif virtually abolished promoter activity, demonstrating the essential nature of these motifs for Srglb3 gene expression. An A-to-T substitution in the CACCC[T] motif of the NICE element also abolished Srglb3 promoter activity, while a C-to-T mutation at position 4 resulted in a threefold reduction of promoter strength. The latter phenotypes resemble the effect of similar mutations in the conserved CACCC motif located in the promoter region of mammalian beta-globin genes. The possible analogies between these two systems will be discussed. 3aleghemoglobin 3arecombinant DNA 3atransgenic plants 3aSesbania 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3areporter genes 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aLotus corniculatus 3apromoter regions 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aBase Sequence 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aFabaceaexgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGlucuronidase 2aLeghemoglobinxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Medicinal 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRhizobium 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSymbiosisxgenetics 0amutagenesis 0anucleotide sequences1 aSzabados, L.1 aFujimoto, S.Y.1 aSilver, D.1 aDe Bruijn, F.J.0 tPlant cell.g1994 Mar., v. 6, no. 3 p.317-332x1040-46517nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01957naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009000129300001800219500001500237520097800252650001101230650002001241650002601261650001601287650002001303650001701323650001801340650002401358653001701382700001601399700001501415700001601430700001501446773006901461852000901530939003301539946001101572655001201583IND9103654320221119031656.0910920s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910365432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBackhaus, R.A.10aPurification and characterization of an abundant rubber particle protein from guayule  ap. 2493-2497.  a2019-12-04  aGuayule rubber particles, which have high rubber transferase (RuT) activity, contain several characteristic proteins. The most abundant of these was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis and characterized. Designated the rubber particle protein (RPP), it is present in all guayule lines studied to date. RPP has an apparent Mr of 48 500 and an isoelectric point of pI 6.2 which corresponds to a pI of 6.17 predicted by amino acid analysis. Antibodies were raised successfully against RPP and used for immunological analysis. Concanavalin A binds to blotted RPP indicating that it is a glycoprotein. When concanavalin A is added to purified rubber particles, it results in their rapid agglutination. However, protease treatments of purified rubber particles indicate that RPP is positioned inside the particle. Thus, it appears that RPP is positioned within the rubber particle, but at the surface, and that its oligosaccharide moiety extends to the particle exterior. 3arubber 3aimmunochemistry 3aParthenium argentatum 3aamino acids 3aenzyme activity 3atransferases 3aglycoproteins 3aprotein composition 0apurification1 aCornish, K.1 aChen, S.F.1 aHuang, D.S.1 aBess, V.H.0 tPhytochemistry.g1991, v. 30, no. 8 p.2493-2497x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03335naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245010500164300001600269500002400285520177200309650001102081650002002092650001702112650001702129650001902146650002002165650001602185650001402201650001702215650001402232650002602246650002202272650001602294650002102310650001102331650002202342650002102364650001502385650002402400653002602424700002102450700002502471700002802496773011502524852000902639856008802648930003302736945002502769946001102794655001202805IND4439957020221118225300.0100716e20100815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443995702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSipka, Anja10aSubstance P alters the in vitro LPS responsiveness of bovine monocytes and blood-derived macrophages  ap. 219-226.  aIncludes references  aNeuromediators like substance P have a decisive influence on inflammatory processes via the neuroendocrine regulation circuit. The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the expression of the main substance P receptor NK-1R in cattle as well as the modulatory properties of substance P for bovine macrophages. The expression of NK-1R was detected in subsets of lymphocytes, granulocytes, monocytes and in vitro-generated macrophages (MdM). Stimulation of monocytes and MdM with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 3h did not alter the expression level of NK-1R. In vitro, the modulatory potential of substance P for monocytes and in vitro-generated blood-derived macrophages (MdM) was analysed. In MdM, generated in the presence of substance P, mRNA expression of chemokines, which are crucial for the attraction and activation of granulocytes and monocytes (CXCL8, CCL5) as well as the expression of IL-1β, a classically pro-inflammatory cytokine were significantly elevated. After stimulation with LPS, MdM generated in the presence of substance P showed an elevated expression of CXCL8 and IL-1β, while in SP-influenced monocytes only the expression of CCL5 was significantly upregulated after LPS stimulation. In addition, supernatants of MdM cultured in the presence of substance P induced neutrophil migration and inhibited both necrosis and apoptosis of neutrophil granulocytes. Thus, it has been shown that the modulation of the expression pattern of chemokines and cytokines in MdM by substance P has also functional relevance for the attraction and activation of other immune cells. In general, the modulation of sensor and effector functions by substance P suggests, that this neuromediator can alter the course of an inflammatory disease in cattle. 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3ainflammation 3apathogenesis 3adisease course 3aimmune response 3amacrophages 3amonocytes 3agranulocytes 3acytokines 3aneurosecretory system 3aneurotransmitters 3asubstance P 3aimmunostimulants 3akinins 3ahormone receptors 3ain vitro studies 3aendotoxins 3alipopolysaccharides 0aneurokinin-1 receptor1 aLangner, Kathrin1 aSeyfert, Hans-Martin1 aSchuberth, Hans-Joachim0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2010 Aug. 15, v. 136, no. 3-4 p.219-226dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.03.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20110512b20110603c00000000  aINDd4CTe2011/04/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02963naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245010200130300001400232520160700246650002501853650001601878650001601894650003101910650001001941650001301951650004301964650002502007650000702032650001302039650002302052650001702075650002502092650001602117700002102133700002202154700002002176700001702196700002302213773020902236856008702445852000902532655001202541IND60518349720160628000000.0160413e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051834972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFiore, Enrico10aMethaphylactic effect of tulathromycin treatment on rumen fluid parameters in feedlot beef cattle  ap. 60-65.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of tulathromycin as a bovine respiratory disease (BRD) metaphylactic treatment on rumen fluid parameters in feedlot cattle in an intensive livestock production farm. One hundred beef cattle, immediately after housing, were divided in 2 equal groups: 50 animals with metaphylactic treatment against BRD (treated group; tulathromycin at 2.5 mg/kg BW) and 50 animals with placebo treatment (control group). Rumen fluid samples were collected from each animal by rumenocentesis in 3 periods: 1 d (T1), 8 d (T8), and 15 d (T15) after treatment. Rumen pH was determined by ruminal fluid using portable pH meter. Total volatile fatty acids (total VFA) were evaluated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All animals were singularly weighed at T1 and T15. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to determine significant effects of treatment (treated group versus control group) and period (T1, T8, and T15) on rumen fluid parameters and body weight. No clinical signs of BRD or other related diseases were recorded during the periods of study from any animal. Statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were found between treated group and control group for mean values of ruminal pH (6.02 versus 5.89) and total VFA (5.84 versus 5.13) at 8 d after treatment. The weight gain (Δ) showed an average increase of 8.6 kg in treated group (P < 0.05). The trends of ruminal pH and VFA values suggest an effect of tulathromycin as BRD metaphylactic treatment on the modulation of rumen fermentation, particularly 8 d after administration. 3aanalysis of variance 3abeef cattle 3abody weight 3abovine respiratory disease 3afarms 3afeedlots 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alivestock production 3apH 3aplacebos 3arumen fermentation 3arumen fluids 3avolatile fatty acids 3aweight gain1 aArmato, Leonardo1 aMorgante, Massimo1 aMuraro, Michele1 aBoso, Matteo1 aGianesella, Matteo0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g2016 Jan., v. 80, no. 1 p.60-65dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttp://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/cvma/cjvr/2016/00000080/00000001/art00007  aDNAL 7aarticle02575naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001700146245007800163300001800241500002400259500001500283520118000298650001501478650002201493650001901515650001501534650002101549650001001570650001401580650001401594650002301608650001601631651001101647653002401658653002301682700001401705700001801719700002001737700001601757773016301773852000901936856007701945930003302022945002502055946001302080655001202093IND4401743520221118225357.0080221e20070725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440174352DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070038w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aDrinkine, J.10aEthylidene-Bridged Flavan-3-ols in Red Wine and Correlation with Wine Age  ap. 6292-6299.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCondensed tannins are responsible for astringency and bitterness and participate in the color stability of red wines. During wine making and aging, they undergo chemical changes including, for example, acetaldehyde-induced polymerization. Following this study, the ethylidene-bridged flavan-3-ols were monitored in different vintage wines made from grapes collected in the same vineyard in three wineries in Bordeaux, Pauillac, and Saint Julien. Flavan-3-ol ethylidene bridges were quantified by wine 2,2'-ethylidenediphloroglucinol (EDP) phloroglucinolysis. This method was based upon the analysis of EDP, a product formed after acid-catalyzed cleavage of wine flavan-3-ols in the presence of excess phloroglucinol. The flavan-3-ol ethylidene bridges were then compared to flavan-3-ol contents (phloroglucinolysis), phenolic contents, and color measurements. Low amounts of flavan-3-ol ethylidene bridges (0.8-2.5 mg L-1) were quantified in wines. Flavan-3-ol ethylidene bridges represent less than 4% of flavan-3-ol bonds, but the proportion of these linkages relative to native interflavan bonds increased with wine age. This proportion correlated with pigmented polymers. 3abitterness 3aproanthocyanidins 3apolymerization 3awine aging 3achemical bonding 3acolor 3aflavanols 3ared wines 3achemical structure 3aastringency 3aFrance 0aethylidene bridging 0aphenolic compounds1 aLopes, P.1 aKennedy, J.A.1 aTeissedre, P.L.1 aSaucier, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 25, v. 55, no. 15 p.6292-6299dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070038w3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090107b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/10  aOther US 7aarticle02964naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002400135245013300159300001600292520147800308650001901786650000801805650003401813650003801847650001001885650002501895650001401920650003001934650001501964650002201979650001202001650001302013650002302026650001202049651001502061653001602076653003302092653002102125700001802146700002002164700001902184700001702203773012202220852000902342856007502351930003302426946001102459655001202470IND4440921520221118225252.0100806s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444092152DNAL7 a10.1071/AP100832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Brunschot, S.L.10aTomato yellow leaf curl virus in Australia: distribution, detection and discovery of naturally occurring defective DNA molecules  ap. 412-423.  aTomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) was detected for the first time in Australia in March 2006 in field-grown tomatoes in Brisbane, Queensland. Surveys showed that the virus was confined to south-east Queensland. Virus transmission studies carried out using Bemisia tabaci (B biotype) verified that resistant tomato lines containing the Ty-1 or Ty-5 genes displayed tolerance to infection by TYLCV isolates from Australia. A PCR assay specific for TYLCV was designed and optimised to confirm the presence of the virus in samples that tested positive in begomovirus-specific double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Eight isolates of TYLCV from various sites were cloned and sequenced, and were shown to have near-identical sequences and a high nucleotide sequence similarity (≥98%) to the monopartite Tomato yellow leaf curl virus-Israel (TYLCV-IL). No DNA-B, DNA-1 nor DNA-β satellite molecules were detected using degenerate PCR assays. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Australian isolates of TYLCV separated into two sequence groups, TYLCV-IL[Au:Bri:06] and TYLCV-IL[Au:Bun:06], that showed a defined geographic segregation. Naturally occurring defective DNA molecules containing partial, rearranged segments of the native DNA-A, were present in one isolate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an incursion of a begomovirus into Australia, and the first report of the characterisation of naturally occurring defective DNAs of TYLCV. 3aBemisia tabaci 3aDNA 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asatellites 3asequence homology 3asurveys 3atomatoes 3avirus transmission 3aviruses 3aQueensland 0adiagnostics 0arolling-circle amplification 0avirus host range1 aPersley, D.M.1 aGeering, A.D.W.1 aCampbell, P.R.1 aThomas, J.E.0 tAustralasian plant pathology.g2010, v. 39, no. 5 p.412-423dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx0815-31917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/AP100833Available from publisher's Web site  a20100806b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02969naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245012900145300001600274500001500290520141900305650003201724650001401756650000801770650001001778650002501788650001901813650001701832650003101849650001801880650002001898650001801918650003101936650001701967650001701984650002802001650002702029650004202056650003402098650004002132650003602172653001102208653002302219653002802242700002602270773010002296852000902396939003302405946001302438655001202451IND9200835720221118225412.0920218e19910801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920083572DNAL7 a18980482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelchior, F.10aCoordinate- and elicitor-dependent expression of stilbene synthase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase genes in Vitis cv.

The induction was studied in cell suspension cultures of grape (Vitis cv. Optima) by treatment with fungal cell wall. Several independent cDNA clones for PAL and stilbene synthase were isolated from a cDNA library of fungal cell wall-induced grape cells and identified by sequence analysis. The stilbene synthase cDNA sequence of pSV21 predicted a protein of 392 amino acids and Mr 42,791, similar in size to that observed experimentally for immunodetected stilbene synthase. The cDNA sequences of pSV21 and pSV25 differed in 76 bp in the coding region. The sequences of grape stilbene synthase cDNAs exhibited significant homology to the sequence reported for the peanut stilbene synthase cDNA. Both PAL and stilbene synthase mRNA, measured by RNA blot hybridizations, were induced within 1 h of addition of fungal cell wall preparations to the cell cultures, rose to a maximum by the sixth hour, then declined slowly over the next 20 h. The activities of PAL and stilbene synthase were also induced in parallel, but reached their maximum at different times after fungal cell wall addition to the cell cultures. The induction patterns of stilbene synthase and PAL in grape and peanut are discussed. 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3astilbenes 3aDNA 3aVitis 3anucleotide sequences 3agene induction 3aphytoalexins 2aAcyltransferasesxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCells, Cultured 2aDNAxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligonucleotide Probes 2aPhenylalanine Ammonia-Lyasexgenetics 2aPlantsxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysisxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 0alyases 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data1 aKindl, Helmut,d1936-0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g1991 Aug. 1, v. 288, no. 2 p.552-557x0003-98617nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02737naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001400155245009900169300001800268500002400286500001500310520130400325650002701629650003001656650001501686650001601701650002201717650000701739650001901746650002201765650001901787650001601806650001401822650001301836653002901849653001501878653001901893700002301912773016301935852000902098856007702107930003302184945002502217946001302242655001202255IND4401746920221118225254.0080221e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440174692DNAL7 a10.1021/jf06376752doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aH0001 aTas, D.O.10aTemperature and pH Effect on the Microbial Reductive Transformation of Pentachloronitrobenzene  ap. 5390-5398.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of pH and temperature on the microbial reductive transformation of pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), an organochlorine fungicide, was investigated with a mixed fermentative/methanogenic culture developed from a contaminated estuarine sediment. Culture series were incubated at a temperature range from 4 to 45 °C at pH 6.9 ± 0.1 and at a pH range from 2.7 ± 0.1 to 7.6 ± 0.1 at 22 °C. Significant differences were observed in terms of biotransformation rate, extent, and products as a function of temperature. Incubation at different pH values resulted in differences in biotransformation rate and extent, but not in terms of products formed. PCNB (3 micromolar) was transformed to pentachloroaniline (PCA) in all culture series. However, sequential dechlorination of PCA was observed only at a temperature range from 4 to 35 °C and at a pH range from 6.2 ± 0.1 to 7.6 ± 0.1. The highest PCA dechlorination rate was observed at 22 °C and at pH 7.6 ± 0.1. The effect of temperature on the PCA dechlorination rate was modeled using an Arrhenius relationship, which accounts for both enzyme activation and deactivation. The dechlorination of PCA and chlorinated aniline intermediates was simulated using a branched-chain Michaelis-Menten model, and kinetic constants were determined. 3asediment contamination 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3aquintozene 3ametabolites 3awater temperature 3apH 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3adechlorination 3amethanogens 3aestuaries 3abacteria 0areductive transformation 0afungicides 0achloroanilines1 aPavlostathis, S.G.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5390-5398dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf06376753Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle01947naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012100126300001600247500001500263520077900278650001701057650001901074650001701093650001301110650002601123650002201149650002401171650001101195650002701206650001601233650001201249650002301261650001101284653001901295653001901314653001201333700001701345773008501362852000901447930003301456945001301489946001101502655001201513IND2060632520221118225236.0971121e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206063252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJingguo, W.10aCompetition for nitrogen during mineralization of plant residues in soil: microbial response to C and N availability  ap. 163-170.  a2019-12-05  aIn an experiment where N-poor (barley straw) and N-rich (clover leaves) plant residues were placed into soil as separate layers, negative effect of plant roots on microbial growth was observed. The depression effect occurred predominantly in N-poor plant residue layers, which indicated that microbial growth can be limited by N availability in such microsites in soil. More energy substrates were available in the planted straw layer as indicated by a significantly higher N immobilization potential in the planted soil compared with that in the unplanted soil. However, in the N-rich sites, plant roots stimulated N mineralization during 1 wk incubation of soil slurries. Microbial response to initial growth conditions, including C and N availability, are also discussed. 3abarley straw 3amineralization 3aroot systems 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3amicrobial ecology 3asoil microorganisms 3acarbon 3aecological competition 3adegradation 3abiomass 3amicrobial activity 3aleaves 0aplant residues 0aimmobilization 0aclovers1 aBakken, L.R.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g1997 Feb., v. 29, no. 2 p.163-170x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle01910naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010400125300001600229500016300245520079900408650001601207650001501223650002201238650003001260650002001290651001501310653001701325653003501342700001801377700001601395773008301411852000901494930003301503945001301536946001101549655001201560IND2061021820221118225050.0971229e199703  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206102182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, H.B.10aRelict Megascolecidae and exclusion of Lumbricidae from basalt-derived soils in southern California  ap. 241-244.  aIn the special issue: ISEE 5 / edited by C.A.

D. woodi James, a relict species, was collected from only two of the BDS sites. Despite their common occurrence in the area, Lumbricidae were absent from the BDS sites, implying that some soil factors may be involved in their exclusion. Total soil iron content was about four times higher in the BDSs than in the NBSs.

Consequently, prevention and control strategies have been implemented in response to the outbreaks and considerable discussion has taken place regarding the need for implementing surveillance programs in high-risk areas with the objective of early detecting and preventing HPAIV epidemics. However countries ability to define the temporal and spatial extension of the high risk areas has been impaired by the lack of information on the distribution of susceptible wild bird populations in the region. Here, a technique for the detection of time-space disease clustering that does not require information on the distribution of susceptible populations and that has been referred to as the time-space permutation model of the scan statistic was used to identify areas and times of the year in which epidemics of H5N1 HPAIV were most likely to occur in wild bird populations of Europe from October, 2005, through December, 2008. The scan statistic was parameterized considering pre-existing knowledge on the epidemiological and ecological characteristics of the disease in the region. Robustness of the results was assessed using a generalized linear regression model to compare the outcomes of 36 alternative parameterizations of the scan statistic. Ten significant time-space clusters of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks were detected in six European countries. Results were sensitive (P <0.05) to the definition of the maximum spatial size defined for the clusters. Results presented here will help to identify high risk areas for HPAIV surveillance in the European Union. Assumptions, results, and implications of the analytical model are extensively presented and discussed in order to facilitate the use of this approach for the identification of high risk areas for infectious animal disease surveillance in the absence of population data. 3atemporal variation 3ageographical distribution 3aInfluenza A virus 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3adisease outbreaks 3aavian influenza 3awild birds 3adisease surveillance 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Wild 2aBirds 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aInfluenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtypexgrowth & development 2aInfluenza in Birdsxepidemiologyxvirology. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSpace-Time Clustering 3aEurope 0aEuropexepidemiology. 0abird diseases1 aPerez, A.M.1 aDe la Torre, A.1 aMuñoz, M.J.1 aMartínez, M.1 aSánchez-Vizcaíno, J.M.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2010 Aug. 1, v. 96, no. 1-2 p.1-8dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.05.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/01/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02892naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100002500188245011400213300001400327500002400341520103700365650003301402650002701435650001901462650002501481650002501506650002001531650001701551650001201568650001101580650007101591650002401662650005701686650007801743650005501821650002301876650002501899650001001924650007001934651001002004651001002014700001602024700002902040773010002069852000902169856009102178930003302269945002502302946001102327655001202338IND4439959520221118225112.0100716e20100801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443995952DNAL7 a205797542pmid7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aX1001 aMartínez-López, B.12aA simulation model for the potential spread of foot-and-mouth disease in the Castile and Leon region of Spain  ap. 19-29.  aIncludes references  aA spatial stochastic model was used to simulate the spread of a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in the Castile-and-Leon (CyL) region of Spain. The model was fitted using information available on premises demographics and on assumptions for animal movements, indirect contacts, and airborne exposure. Control measures dictated by Spanish and European Union regulations constituted a reference strategy to which six alternative control strategies were compared. For the reference strategy, the median (95% PI) numbers of infected, depopulated, and quarantined premises were 141 (2-1099), 164 (4-1302), and 334 (31-2059), respectively. Depopulation and vaccination of premises within a radius of <1km and <3km, respectively, around infected premises significantly (p-value<0.001) decreased the number of infected premises, compared to the reference scenario. Results presented here will contribute to the revision, design, and implementation of contingency plans and programs for prevention and control of FMD epidemics in Spain. 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3adisease models 3astochastic processes 3adisease transmission 3acontrol methods 3aspatial data 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aComputer Simulation 2aDisease Outbreaksxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aFoot-and-Mouth Diseasexepidemiologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 2aFoot-and-Mouth Disease Virusxgrowth & development 2aModels, Biological 2aStochastic Processes 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxtransmission. 3aSpain 0aSpain1 aPerez, A.M.1 aSánchez-Vizcaíno, J.M.0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2010 Aug. 1, v. 96, no. 1-2 p.19-29dElsevierx0167-58777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2010.05.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20110403b20110507c00000000  aINDd6CTe2011/01/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03190naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001500164245007100179300001800250500002400268500001500292520163900307650001601946650000901962650001601971650001701987650001302004650001402017650001902031650001802050650001602068650002402084650001002108650001602118650002902134650001502163650002502178650001402203653002302217653001402240700001302254700001302267700001302280700001102293773016302304852000902467856007702476930003302553945002502586946001302611655001202624IND4401734720221118225601.0080221e20070725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173472DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07039122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF900 0aJ1001 aKong, C.H.10aActivity and Allelopathy of Soil of Flavone O-Glycosides from Rice  ap. 6007-6012.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo flavone O-glycosides were isolated from allelopathic rice seedlings and have been identified as 5,4'-dihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxy-7-O-β-glucopyranosylflavone and 7,4'-dihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxy-5-O-β-glucopyranosylflavone. Considerable levels of these glycosides could be found in allelopathic rice tissues. They could not be detected in the soils growing these allelopathic rice seedlings. Only their aglycone, 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxyflavone, could be found in the soil. Further experiments showed that two flavone O-glycosides were exuded from allelopathic rice roots to the rihzosphere and then transformed into their aglycone form, that is, 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxyflavone, with a great diversity of biological activities on associated weeds and microbes by soil interactions once released. The glycosides degraded rapidly (t1/2 < 2 h), whereas their aglycone was more resistant toward degradation in paddy soils, in which the half-life (t1/2) at low (25 microgram/g) and high (200 microgram/g) doses reached 19.86 ± 3.64 h (r 2 = 0.97) and 28.78 ± 3.72 h (r 2 = 0.98), respectively. Furthermore, the mobility of both glycosides and their aglycone in paddy soil was evaluated by soil TLC with bioassay. The mobility of the glycosides (R(f) = 0.418 ± 0.069, n = 18) is higher than that of the aglycone (R(f) = 0.361 ± 0.048, n = 18). The results suggested that two flavone O-glycosides are formed in rice biosynthesis and that storage of the allelochemicals and their aglycone 5,7,4'-trihydroxy-3',5'-dimethoxyflavone is the agent of alleloapthic rice which interferes with weeds or microbes in paddy soil. 3aphytotoxins 3arice 3arhizosphere 3aOryza sativa 3aflavones 3aseedlings 3asoil chemistry 3aroot exudates 3aallelopathy 3asoil microorganisms 3aweeds 3apaddy soils 3asoil transport processes 3aglycosides 3achemical degradation 3ahalf life 0achemical reactions 0aaglycones1 aZhao, H.1 aXu, X.H.1 aWang, P.1 aGu, Y.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 25, v. 55, no. 15 p.6007-6012dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07039123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090113b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle03284naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162100002500179245012500204300001800329500002400347520116000371650001901531650002901550650001401579650002301593650002001616650001101636650002201647650001101669650002201680650001401702650002901716650002601745650002201771650001301793650001201806650002001818650002301838650004601861650005901907650003801966650001302004650003202017650001102049650005402060650003702114650004902151700002602200700001302226700001802239700001502257700001502272773012602287852000902413856008302422856004602505930003302551945002502584946001302609655001202622IND4401735020190509000000.0080221e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173502DNAL7 a179186262pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-20-10-12412doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Previously, we have shown that, in Rhizobium etli CFN42, the repeated fixNOQP operons (fixNOQPd and fixNOQPf) have a differential role in nitrogen fixation. Only the fixNOQPd operon is required for the establishment of an effective symbiosis; microaerobic induction of this operon is under the control of at least three transcriptional regulators, FixKf, FnrNd, and FnrNchr, belonging to the Crp/Fnr family. In this work, we describe two novel Crp/Fnr-type transcriptional regulators (StoRd and StoRf, symbiotic terminal oxidase regulators) that play differential roles in the control of key genes for nitrogen fixation. Mutations either in stoRd or stoRf enhance the microaerobic expression of both fixNOQP reiterations, increasing also the synthesis of the cbb3-type oxidase in nodules. Despite their structural similarity, a differential role of these genes was also revealed, since a mutation in stoRd but not in stoRf enhanced both the expression of fixKf and the nitrogen-fixing capacity of R. etli CFN42. 3aRhizobium etli 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3asymbiosis 3abacterial proteins 3aoxidoreductases 3aoxygen 3aenzyme substrates 3aoperon 3anitrogen fixation 3asymbionts 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3aprotein structure 3amutation 3amutants 3agene expression 3amicrobial genetics 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aElectron Transport Complex IVxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMutation 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aOperon 2aRhizobium etlixenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSymbiosisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aGómez-Hernández, N.1 aMora, Y.1 aDelgado, M.J.1 aRomero, D.1 aGirard, L.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2007 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.1241-1249dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-20-10-12413Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-20-10-1241  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/17  aOther US 7aarticle02627naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001500155245008300170300001800253500002400271500001500295520085300310650003201163650004401195650001801239650001401257650001701271650001801288650002101306650001101327650002101338650003201359650001701391650002301408650003601431650001501467650001301482650002301495650001101518653001101529653002201540653002501562653001901587700001601606700001301622700001501635700001401650700001501664700001401679773016301693852000901856856007701865930003301942945002501975946001302000655001202013IND4401736320221118225256.0080221e20070725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173632DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070734w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aX3801 aWeng, Z.Y.10aIsolation of Two Bioactive ent-Kauranoids from the Leaves of Isodon xerophilus  ap. 6039-6043.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIsodon xerophilus has been used as a herbal cold tea for the prevention and treatment of sore throat and inflammation in southernwestern China.

  1 aLiu, G.10aDetached and Attached Arabidopsis Leaf Assays Reveal Distinctive Defense Responses Against Hemibiotrophic Colletotrichum spp  ap. 1308-1319.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe agriculturally important genus Colletotrichum is an emerging model pathogen for studying defense in Arabidopsis. During the process of screening for novel pathogenic Colletotrichum isolates on Arabidopsis, we found significant differences in defense responses between detached and attached leaf assays. A near-adapted isolate Colletotrichum linicola A1 could launch a typical infection only on detached, but not attached, Arabidopsis leaves. Remarkably, resistance gene-like locus RCH1-mediated resistance in intact plants also was compromised in detached leaves during the attacks with the virulent reference isolate C. higginsianum. The differences in symptom development between the detached leaf and intact plant assays were further confirmed on defense-defective mutants following inoculation with C. higginsianum, where the greatest inconsistency occurred on ethylene-insensitive mutants. In intact Arabidopsis plants, both the salicylic acid- and ethylene-dependent pathways were required for resistance to C. higginsianum and were associated with induced expression of pathogenesis-related genes PR1 and PDF1.2. In contrast, disease symptom development in detached leaves appeared to be uncoupled from these defense pathways and more closely associated with senescence: an observation substantiated by coordinated gene expression analysis and disease symptom development, and chemically and genetically mimicking senescence. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3ascreening 3aprotein synthesis 3aloci 3agenetic resistance 3asigns and symptoms (plants) 3adisease course 3afungal diseases of plants 3abioassays 3aColletotrichum 3agene expression 3aresistance mechanisms 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3abiochemical pathways 3astrains 3avirulence 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aleaves 2aArabidopsisxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxmetabolism 2aColletotrichumxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aEthylenesxmetabolism 2aImmunity, Innate 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aVirulence 0aresistance genes 0asenescence 0aColletotrichum linicola 0aColletotrichum higginsianum1 aKennedy, R.1 aGreenshields, D.L.1 aPeng, G.1 aForseille, L.1 aSelvaraj, G.1 aWei, Y.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2007 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.1308-1319dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-20-10-13083Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-20-10-1308  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/17  aOther US 7aarticle02797naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001600155245007500171300001800246500002400264500001500288520133300303650001401636650001001650650000901660650001401669650001601683650001401699650001301713650001801726650002501744650002001769650001701789653004501806653001601851653003601867653001601903700001801919700001601937700001801953773016301971852000902134856007702143930003302220945002502253946001302278655001202291IND4401736720221118225046.0080221e20070725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173672DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07016382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aF2001 aPafundo, S.10aApplicability of SCAR Markers to Food Genomics: Olive Oil Traceability  ap. 6052-6059.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDNA analysis with molecular markers has opened a shortcut toward a genomic comprehension of complex organisms. The availability of micro-DNA extraction methods, coupled with selective amplification of the smallest extracted fragments with molecular markers, could equally bring a breakthrough in food genomics: the identification of original components in food. Amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) have been instrumental in plant genomics because they may allow rapid and reliable analysis of multiple and potentially polymorphic sites. Nevertheless, their direct application to the analysis of DNA extracted from food matrixes is complicated by the low quality of DNA extracted: its high degradation and the presence of inhibitors of enzymatic reactions. The conversion of an AFLP fragment to a robust and specific single-locus PCR-based marker, therefore, could extend the use of molecular markers to large-scale analysis of complex agro-food matrixes. In the present study is reported the development of sequence characterized amplified regions (SCARs) starting from AFLP profiles of monovarietal olive oils analyzed on agarose gel; one of these was used to identify differences among 56 olive cultivars. All the developed markers were purposefully amplified in olive oils to apply them to olive oil traceability. 3acultivars 3afoods 3aloci 3aolive oil 3afood matrix 3aoil crops 3agenomics 3aOlea europaea 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3atraceability 0asequence characterized amplified repeats 0amethodology 0amicro-DNA extraction techniques 0anew methods1 aAgrimonti, C.1 aMaestri, E.1 aMarmiroli, N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 25, v. 55, no. 15 p.6052-6059dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07016383Available from publisher's Web site  a20090107b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle03513naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100001600170245008300186300001600269500002400285500001500309520156600324650001601890650001401906650001201920650001901932650001401951650001401965650002101979650002502000650002602025650004802051650004802099650002502147650002902172650002102201650001702222650002802239650001302267650001402280650003302294650002602327650001602353650001702369650004902386650002702435653001302462653001802475653001302493653001002506700001502516700002002531700001402551700001602565700002002581773006602601852000902667856008202676930003302758945002502791946001102816655001202827IND4401737020140724000000.0080221e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173702DNAL7 a173448042pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68009512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF2001 aSjödin, P.10aRecent degeneration of an old duplicated flowering time gene in Brassica nigra  ap. 375-384.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGene and genome duplications play a major role in the evolution of plant species. The Brassica nigra genome is highly replicated as a result of ancient polyploidization events. Two copies of the flowering time gene CONSTANS (COa and COb) have been identified in B. nigra, and previous studies showed that COa is functional. In the present study, the polymorphism of 92 COb alleles sampled in seven populations was analyzed. Both polymorphism and recombination levels were elevated and varied strongly among populations and 8% of COb alleles exhibit apparently disabling mutations. Sequence data, however, do not provide unambiguous support for the presence of relaxed selective constraint on COb as compared to known functional CO genes. On the one hand, some of the disabling mutations reached high-frequency arguing for a loss of function but, on the other hand, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide polymorphism and diversity is low and similar to that observed in other B. nigra CO and CO-like genes, supporting the conservation of some function. We also showed that COb is still transcribed. Finally, the flowering time of Arabidopsis thaliana co mutant plants transformed with COb alleles with and without apparent disabling mutations was similar. We propose that COb was retained for a long period after duplication, but a recent fixation of a detrimental mutation, possibly as an effect of a bottleneck, resulted in its nonfunctionalization. We also speculate as to the presence of subsequent selection for rapid degeneration of the gene. 3apseudogenes 3aflowering 3aalleles 3aBrassica nigra 3aevolution 3aphenology 3agene duplication 3agenetic polymorphism 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFlowering Topsxgenetics 2aGene Duplication 2aGenes, Plant 2aMustard Plantxgenetics 2aMutation 2aPhylogeny 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPseudogenes 2aTime Factors 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aCoa gene 0aCONSTANS gene 0aCob gene 0agenes1 aHedman, H.1 aShavorskaya, O.1 aFinet, C.1 aLascoux, M.1 aLagercrantz, U.0 tHeredity.g2007 June, v. 98, no. 6 p.375-384x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68009513Available from publisher's Web site  a20080814b20080905c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/08/13  aNon-US 7aarticle03028naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155072000900164100002300173245018800196300001800384500002400402520111600426650001701542650001801559650001601577650001901593650001701612650001701629650002901646650002301675650002001698650001901718650001701737650003401754650002301788650002001811650001901831650001901850650004401869650002101913650001301934650001501947653002501962653002001987700002002007700001602027700002502043700002602068773016302094852000902257856007702266930003302343945002502376946001302401655001202414IND4401739220221118225229.0080221e20070725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173922DNAL7 a10.1021/jf070418h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ306 0aQ506 0aQ106 0aQ1161 aTorres-Arreola, W.10aEffect of a Low-Density Polyethylene Film Containing Butylated Hydroxytoluene on Lipid Oxidation and Protein Quality of Sierra Fish (Scomberomorus sierra) Muscle during Frozen Storage  ap. 6140-6146.  aIncludes references  aFresh sierra fish (Scomberomorus sierra) fillets were packed in low-density polyethylene films with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT-LDPE) added. Fillets packed in LDPE with no BHT were used as controls (LDPE). The packed fillets were stored at -25 °C for 120 days in which the film released 66.5% of the antioxidant. The influence of the antioxidant on lipid and protein quality, lipid oxidation, muscle structure changes, and shear-force resistance was recorded. As compared to LDPE films, fillets packed in BHT-LDPE films showed lower lipid oxidation, thiobarbituric acid values (4.20 ± 0.52 vs 11.95 ± 1.06 mg malonaldehyde/kg), peroxide values (7.20 ± 1.38 vs 15.15 ± 1.48 meq/kg), and free fatty acids (7.98 ± 0.43 vs 11.83 ± 1.26% of oleic acid). Fillets packed in BHT-LDPE films showed less tissue damage and lost less firmness than fillets packed in LDPE. A significant relationship between lipid oxidation and texture was detected (R2 adjusted, 0.70-0.73). BHT-LDPE films may be used not only to prevent lipid oxidation but also to minimize protein damage to prolong the shelf life of sierra fish. 3afish fillets 3aScomberomorus 3amarine fish 3afood packaging 3apolyethylene 3aplastic film 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3alipid peroxidation 3aanimal proteins 3afrozen storage 3aantioxidants 3apackaging materials migration 3apostmortem changes 3askeletal muscle 3ashear strength 3aperoxide value 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3afree fatty acids 3afirmness 3ashelf life 0aScomberomorus sierra 0aprotein quality1 aSoto-Valdez, H.1 aPeralta, E.1 aCardenas-Lopez, J.L.1 aEzquerra-Brauer, J.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 25, v. 55, no. 15 p.6140-6146dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070418h3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090108b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle01998naa a2200553 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001800133245008700151300001600238520026400254650002500518650002000543650003900563650006700602650001000669650000900679650001200688650003900700650001800739650003600757650002000793650005100813650001800864650001100882650003000893650002000923650005100943650002600994650000901020650000901029650001601038650005601054650004801110650004701158700001901205700001701224700001501241700001601256773009701272852000901369939003301378945000801411946001301419655001201432991560947920742620221118225207.0840328e198306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840018702DNAL7 a66033142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchroff, R.W.10aImmunological studies of homosexual men with immunodeficiency and Kaposi's sarcoma  ap. 300-314.  acellular and humoral immune function in 46 men with AIDS (24 patients with multiple opportunistic infections (including Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and Cryptosporidium enteritis), 12 with generalized prolonged lymphadenopathy, and 10 with Kaposi's sarcoma) 3aPneumocystis carinii 3aCryptosporidium 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 2aAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndromexcomplicationsximmunology. 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunology 2aB-Lymphocytes 2aCytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic 2aHLA-DR Antigens 2aHistocompatibility Antigens Class IIxanalysis 2aHomosexuality 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulinsxanalysis 2aLeukocyte Count 2aLymphatic Diseasesxcomplicationsximmunology. 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMale 2aMice 2aMiddle Aged 2aPneumonia, Pneumocystisxcomplicationsximmunology. 2aSarcoma, Kaposixcomplicationsximmunology. 2aT-Lymphocytesxclassificationximmunology.1 aGottlieb, M.S.1 aPrince, H.E.1 aChai, L.L.1 aFahey, J.L.0 tClinical immunology and immunopathology.g1983 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.300-314x0090-12297nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840328c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02853naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001800146245010700164300001800271500002400289500001500313520144800328650002301776650002601799650001101825650002101836650001901857650001401876650001901890650002001909653002301929653002301952653003301975653002402008653003602032700001902068773016302087852000902250856007702259930003302336945002502369946001302394655001202407IND4401743020221118225133.0080221e20070725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440174302DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07090922doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aSteinhaus, P.10aCharacterization of the Key Aroma Compounds in Soy Sauce Using Approaches of Molecular Sensory Science  ap. 6262-6269.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aApplication of aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) to the volatiles isolated from a commercial Japanese soy sauce revealed 30 odor-active compounds in the flavor dilution (FD) factor range of 8-4096, among which 2-phenylethanol showed the highest FD factor of 4096, followed by 3-(methylsulfanyl)propanal (methional), the tautomers 4-hydroxy-5-ethyl-2-methyl- and 4-hydroxy-2-ethyl-5-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (4-HEMF), 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)-furanone (4-HDF), and 3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl-2(5H)-furanone (sotolone), all showing FD factors of 1024. Thirteen odorants were quantified by stable isotope dilution assays, and their odor activity values (OAVs) were calculated as ratio of their concentrations and odor thresholds in water. Among them, 3-methylbutanal (malty), sotolone (seasoning-like), 4-HEMF (caramel-like), 2-methylbutanal (malty), methional (cooked potato), ethanol (alcoholic), and ethyl 2-methylpropanoate (fruity) showed the highest OAVs (>200). An aqueous model aroma mixture containing 13 odorants, which had been identified with the highest OAVs, in concentrations that occur in the soy sauce showed a good similarity with the overall aroma of the soy sauce itself. Heat treatment of the soy sauce resulted in a clear change of the overall aroma. Quantitation of selected odorants revealed a significant decrease in sotolone and, in particular, increases in 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 4-HDMF, and 4-HEMF induced by heating. 3amodel food systems 3aquantitative analysis 3aflavor 3afood composition 3aodor compounds 3asoy sauce 3aheat treatment 3astable isotopes 0avolatile compounds 0asensory properties 0aflavor dilution factor range 0aodor activity value 0aaroma extract dilution analysis1 aSchieberle, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 25, v. 55, no. 15 p.6262-6269dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07090923Available from publisher's Web site  a20090107b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle02094naa a2200577 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001500133245008900148300001600237520037300253650001800626650001500644650002100659650002000680650002700700650001600727650002000743650001500763650001000778650002500788650003100813650001100844650002900855650001100884650004100895650002300936650005600959650007101015650002601086650000901112650001601121650001501137651001401152651001401166653002501180653005001205653004301255700001601298700001401314700001701328773009601345852000901441939003301450945000801483946001301491655001201504991560947180742620221118224655.0840328e198305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840018682DNAL7 a64094802pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastes, M.10aCharacterization of the cellular immune response in American cutaneous leishmaniasis  ap. 176-186.  aAmerican cutaneous leishmaniasis, human, patients with localized, mucocutaneous, or diffuse forms of disease, in vitro (lymphocyte proliferation assay) and in vivo (delayed-type hypersensitivity skin tests) cellular immune reactivity evaluated using mitogens and parasite antigens (Leishmania mexicana pifanoi, L. braziliensis guyanensis, Trypanosoma cruzi): Venezuela 3aleishmaniasis 3aLeishmania 3aimmunocompetence 3aimmune response 3acell-mediated immunity 3alymphocytes 3aimmunopathology 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAntigensximmunology 2aChagas Diseaseximmunology 2aFemale 2aHelminthiasisxdiagnosis 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivity, Delayedxdiagnosis 2aImmunity, Cellular 2aLeishmaniasisxdiagnosisxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aLeishmaniasis, Mucocutaneousxdiagnosisxepidemiologyximmunology. 2aLymphocyte Activation 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSkin Tests 3aVenezuela 0aVenezuela 0aImmunity, Skin tests 0aLeishmania braziliensis guyanensis (Protozoa) 0aLeishmania mexicana pifanoi (Protozoa)1 aAgnelli, A.1 aVerde, O.1 aRondon, A.J.0 tClinical immunology and immunopathology.g1983 May, v. 27, no. 2 p.176-186x0090-12297nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840328c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle04081naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002200163245012100185300001800306520163300324650001901957650002501976650002402001650002502025650002002050650003602070650001902106650003402125650000802159650001002167650002302177650000902200650002302209650002202232650007702254650008102331650000902412650001902421650008302440650008002523650007402603650001502677650001102692650002202703650001902725650001102744650004602755650000902801650001602810650002602826650003202852650003202884650002002916650001702936650001602953651003302969653002903002700002303031700002203054700002403076700002503100773013003125852000903255930003303264945002503297946001303322655001203335IND4411223220221118224646.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441122322DNAL7 a188427962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHowarth, Nancy C.14aThe association of glycemic load and carbohydrate intake with colorectal cancer risk in the Multiethnic Cohort Study  ap. 1074-1082.  aBACKGROUND:High-glycemic-load diets may increase colorectal cancer risk through hyperinsulinemic effects. OBJECTIVE:We analyzed data for 191 004 participants in the Multiethnic Cohort Study to determine the risk of colorectal cancer associated with glycemic load (GL), carbohydrate, and sucrose and to ascertain whether this risk was modified by sex and ethnicity. DESIGN:During 8 y of follow-up, 2379 incident cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma occurred. We used baseline quantitative food-frequency questionnaire data to assess usual dietary intake over the preceding year. Using Cox regression, we calculated adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for colorectal cancer associated with quintiles of GL, carbohydrate, and sucrose. RESULTS:For both men and women in this cohort, white rice was the major contributor to GL. In multivariate models, RRs for colorectal cancer decreased significantly with increasing GL in women (RR for the highest quintile versus the lowest: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.97; P for trend = 0.02) but not in men (RR: 1.15; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.48; P for trend = 0.19). Results for carbohydrate and sucrose were similar. The inverse association with GL was found in women of all ethnic groups (P for interaction = 0.58). In men, an interaction was found between ethnicity and GL (P < 0.01): white men had a positive association with increasing GL (RR: 1.69; 95% CI: 0.98, 2.92; P for trend < 0.01), but men of other ethnic groups did not. CONCLUSION:GL and carbohydrate intake appear to protect against colorectal cancer in women in the Multiethnic Cohort, perhaps because a major source of GL is white rice. 3aglycemic index 3adietary carbohydrate 3acarbohydrate intake 3acolorectal neoplasms 3arisk assessment 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3acohort studies 3afood frequency questionnaires 3amen 3awomen 3agender differences 3arice 3aethnic differences 3aprotective effect 2aAdenocarcinomaxepidemiologyxethnologyxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aAdenomatous Polypsxepidemiologyxethnologyxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aAged 2aCohort Studies 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxethnologyxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexclassificationxmetabolism. 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosagexclassificationxmetabolism. 2aEthnicity. 2aFemale 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aGlycemic Index 2aHumans 2aHyperinsulinismxcomplicationsxetiology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aSex Factors 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0aMultiethnic Cohort Study1 aMurphy, Suzanne P.1 aWilkens, Lynne R.1 aHenderson, Brian E.1 aKolonel, Laurence N.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Oct., v. 88, no. 4 p.1074-1082dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/11/30  aOther US 7aarticle04164naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245012000164300001800284520230500302650002502607650001502632650002002647650000902667650003302676650001502709650001602724650001402740650001402754650002502768700001602793700002502809700001302834700002102847700001702868700001702885700002102902700001602923700001902939700002402958700002402982700001703006700001303023700001503036700001503051700001403066700001703080700001303097700001503110700001903125700001503144700001703159700001903176700001603195700001603211700001503227700001503242773013703257852000903394856008803403946001103491655001203502IND4442511420221118224712.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444251142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijpara.2010.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShinn, A.P.10aMulti-centre testing and validation of current protocols for the identification of Gyrodactylus salaris (Monogenea)  ap. 1455-1467.  aDespite routine screening requirements for the notifiable fish pathogen Gyrodactylus salaris, no standard operating procedure exists for its rapid identification and discrimination from other species of Gyrodactylus. This study assessed screening and identification efficiencies under real-world conditions for the most commonly employed identification methodologies: visual, morphometric and molecular analyses. Obtained data were used to design a best-practice processing and decision-making protocol allowing rapid specimen throughput and maximal classification accuracy. True specimen identities were established using a consensus from all three identification methods, coupled with the use of host and location information. The most experienced salmonid gyrodactylid expert correctly identified 95.1% of G. salaris specimens. Statistical methods of classification identified 66.7% of the G. salaris, demonstrating the need for much wider training. Molecular techniques (internal transcribed spacer region-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP)/cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) sequencing) conducted in the diagnostic laboratory most experienced in the analysis of gyrodactylid material, identified 100% of the true G. salaris specimens. Taking into account causes of potential specimen loss, the probabilities of a specimen being accurately identified were 95%, 87% and 92% for visual, morphometric and molecular techniques, respectively, and the probabilities of correctly identifying a specimen of G. salaris by each method were 81%, 58% and 92%. Inter-analyst agreement for 189 gyrodactylids assessed by all three methods using Fleiss' Kappa suggested substantial agreement in identification between the methods. During routine surveillance periods when low numbers of specimens are analysed, we recommend that specimens be analysed using the ITS-RFLP approach followed by sequencing of specimens with a “G. salaris-like” (i.e. G. salaris, Gyrodactylus thymalli) banding pattern. During periods of suspected outbreaks, where a high volume of specimens is expected, we recommended that specimens be identified using visual identification, as the fastest processing method, to select “G. salaris-like” specimens, which are subsequently identified by molecular-based techniques. 3aGyrodactylus salaris 3aSalmonidae 3adecision making 3afish 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amonitoring 3amorphometry 3apathogens 3ascreening 3astatistical analysis1 aCollins, C.1 aGarcía-Vásquez, A.1 aSnow, M.1 aMatějusová, I.1 aPaladini, G.1 aLongshaw, M.1 aLindenstrøm, T.1 aStone, D.M.1 aTurnbull, J.F.1 aPicon-Camacho, S.M.1 aRivera, C.

Their structures were elucidated through LC/DAD-MS and NMR analysis and were found to correspond to a pyranoanthocyanin moiety linked to substituted cinnamyl substituents. The structures of these compounds are very similar to the one already reported for portisins, with a phenolic moiety replacing the catechin moiety. The newly formed anthocyanin-derived compounds display a bathochromic shift of the lambda(max) (approximately 540 nm) when compared with their anthocyanin-pyruvic acid adduct precursor (lambda(max) = 511 nm), which may be due to the extended conjugation of the pi electrons in the structures of those pigments. Studies performed in model solutions helped to clarify the formation mechanism of these pigments that can result from the nucleophilic attack of the olefinic double bond of a hydroxycinnamic acid to the eletrophilic C-10 position of the anthocyanin-pyruvic acid adduct, followed by the loss of a formic acid molecule and decarboxylation. The chromatic characterization of these malvidin-3-glucoside-derived compounds revealed a higher resistance to discoloration against the nucleophilic attack by water and bisulfite when compared to malvidin-3-glucoside that is almost converted into its colorless hemiacetal form. However, the resistance to discoloration of these new pigments is not as high as the one reported for catechin-derived portisins. This could be explained by the presence of a smaller group (hydroxycinnamyl group), which does not protect so efficiently the chromophore against nucleophilic attack at the C-2 position. The occurrence of these pigments in red wine highlights new chemical pathways involving anthocyanin-pyruvic acid derivatives as precursors for the formation of new pigments in subsequent stages of wine aging that may contribute to its color evolution. 3aanthocyanins 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3areaction kinetics 3apyruvic acid 3acoumaric acids 3achemical reactions 3awine aging 3achemical bonding 3aport wines 3acolor 3amass spectrometry 3ared wines 3achemical structure 0aportisins 0apigments1 aFreitas, V. de1 aSilva, A.M.S.1 aMateus, N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 25, v. 55, no. 15 p.6349-6356dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf070968f3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090108b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/10  aOther US 7aarticle02720naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245007900199300001600278500002400294506007600318520148400394506003701878650001201915650001201927650001601939650001601955650001901971650001201990650002502002650004602027650004602073650002802119773010002147852000902247856007802256655001202334IND4442873320221207095905.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444287332DNAL7 a206825742pmid7 aPMC29449782pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcq1552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Bruce10aDid Drosera evolve long scapes to stop their pollinators from being eaten?  ap. 653-657.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Insectivorous plants frequently display their flowers on the ends of long racemes. Conventional wisdom is that long racemes in insectivorous plants have evolved to provide spatial separation between flowers and traps, which consequently prevents pollinators from being captured. However, it is also possible that long racemes evolved for better seed dispersal or to make flowers more visible to pollinators. METHODS: Two sympatric insectivorous plants with identical pollinators were studied: Drosera cistiflora, with an upright growth form but a short raceme; and Drosera pauciflora, with a basal rosette of traps and a very long raceme. If long racemes evolved to protect their pollinators then D. cistiflora should capture more pollinators than D. pauciflora. However, if long racemes evolved to attract pollinators then taller flowers should receive more pollination visits than shorter flowers. KEY RESULTS: Examination of D. pauciflora and D. cistiflora traps revealed that no pollinators were captured by either species, suggesting that long racemes did not evolve to protect pollinators from being captured. Experimental manipulations of flower height in D. cistiflora showed that experimentally shortened plants received significantly fewer pollination visits than plants which were taller in stature. CONCLUSIONS: Long scapes in Drosera and non-insectivorous plants probably evolved due to similar selective pressures such as pollinator attraction.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosera 3aflowers 3apollination 3apollinators 3aseed dispersal 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aDroseraxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aFlowersxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aPollinationxphysiology0 tAnnals of botany.g2010 Oct., v. 106, no. 4 p.653-657dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcq1553Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02641naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011500146300001800261500001500279520132600294650001501620650001501635650002201650650001401672650001301686650002001699650001101719650002901730650001201759650002201771650003401793650002401827650002701851650001701878650001301895650001601908653002301924653001501947653002201962653001101984773009801995852000902093930003302102945001302135946001102148655001202159IND2037628920221118224906.0940303e199310  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203762892DNAL7 a82243582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoulson, R.A.14aThe flow theory of enzyme kinetics: role of solid geometry in the control of reaction velocity in live animals  ap. 1445-1474.  a2019-12-05  a1. When blood flows, membranes are bombarded with ions etc., whose entry creates an ATP demand proportional to dow rate. Also proportional to flow rate is ATP production from oxidation of substrates [S] from the same blood volume. 2. O2,is limiting and reaction velocity at rest (metabolic rate) is determined by flow rate, F, but not by [S]. 3. Since resting blood O2 A-V difference is about 5 vol%, 11 circulated produces about 0.25 kcal in mammals, birds or warm reptiles. 4. Where O2 is not limiting, as in most amino acid deaminations, V = K F[S] with K a constant unrelated to Km. 5. At equal blood vol/kg, solid geometry dictates that the average cross-sectional area of major vessels/kg will be an inverse function of body mass. The smaller the animal, the shorter the vessels, the "thicker" the vessels/kg body wt, and at any one blood pressure, the higher the flow/kg/hr. If a man's major vessels were equal in cross-section/kg to those of a shrew, it would take 2241 of blood to fill them. 6. Growth decreases flow/kg (and therefore metabolic rate), by decreasing vessel cross-section/kg without changing blood pressure or linear velocity of flow. 7. Surface area/g, body wt to some power, average vessel length/kg, circulation time and average major vessel cross-sectional area are all related mathematically. 3ametabolism 3ablood flow 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aoxidation 3akinetics 3aenzyme activity 3aoxygen 2aAnaerobiosisxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aCellsxenzymology 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxmetabolism 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aGlycolysisxphysiology 2aHemorheology 2aKinetics 2aMathematics 0aliterature reviews 0asubstrates 0aanimal physiology 0atheory0 tInternational journal of biochemistry.g1993 Oct., v. 25, no. 10 p.1445-1474x0020-711X7nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US 7aarticle02809naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245011800129300001600247500001500263520166700278650001201945650001501957650001201972650000801984650001001992650002302002650001002025650001002035650002302045650001302068650001102081651001402092653001902106653002002125653001302145653000902158653002502167700002402192773008102216852000902297930003302306945001302339946001102352655001202363IND2322215620221118224751.0010725e200106  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232221562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaizal, A.C.M.10aPrevalence of coccidia and gastrointestinal nematode infections in cross bred goats in the dry areas of Sri Lanka  ap. 233-238.  a2019-12-05  aThe prevalence and intensity of oocysts of coccidia, particularly Eimeria species, and eggs of gastrointestinal nematodes in kids (2-4 months), young goats (5-12 months) and adult goats (>1 year) were determined in five large herds managed extensively in five villages in the dry zone. Of the representative samples examined, oocysts were found in 88% of kids, 91% of young goats and 83% of adults. Seven species of Eimeria were identified in faecal samples by salt flotation. Eimeria ninakohlyakimovae (31%), E. alijevi (29%) and E. arloingi (21%) were the most common species in all age categories. Other species encountered were E. christenseni (7%), E. jolchijevi (6%), E. hirchi (3%) and E. aspheronica (1%). Gastrointestinal nematode eggs were found in 89% of the kids, 94% of the young goats and 84% of the adult goats. Identification of gastrointestinal nematodes revealed Haemonchus contortus (90%) followed by Oesophogostomum spp. (8.5%) and Trichostrongylus spp. (1%) in all three age categories examined. Both Eimeria and gastrointestinal nematodes were found in 77% of the kids, 86% of the young goats and 71% of adult goats. The mean oocyst counts per gram of faeces in kids, young goats and adult goats were 9728, 1946, and 2667, respectively. The oocyst counts were not different significantly between age groups (P > 0.05). The mean egg counts per gram of faeces in kids, young goats and adult goats were 1217, 1641 and 1092, respectively. The egg counts in kids were significantly lower than that in young goats (P < 0.05). The intensity of Eimeria and gastrointestinal nematode infections between herds were significantly different (P < 0.01). 3aoocysts 3aarid zones 3aEimeria 3aova 3aherds 3adisease prevalence 3agoats 3afeces 3apopulation density 3aNematoda 3aadults 3aSri Lanka 0aidentification 0aCoccidiomorphea 0aCoccidia 0akids 0aextensive production1 aRajapakse, R.P.V.J.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2001 June, v. 40, no. 3 p.233-238x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02491naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001700147245010000164300001600264500002400280520108200304650002401386650002501410650001301435650003201448650002101480650001001501650002001511650002101531650002601552650001301578650001801591650001201609650001601621650000901637650002301646700002101669700001601690700001701706700001601723773007601739852000901815856012201824856008701946655001202033IND4467761420221118224651.0130516s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446776142DNAL7 a10.13073/0015-7473-62.2.1342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhigiang12aA laboratory test of the leachability and decay resistance of some synthesized borate compounds  ap. 134-138.  aIncludes references  aQuaternary ammonium tetraphenylborates (TPBs) and quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborates were synthesized for the manufacture of leaching-resistant boron wood preservatives.

The boron leaching rate of wood treated with quaternary ammonium TPB formulations ranged from 2.1 to 6.7 percent, while that of quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborate formulations ranged from 23.3 to 59.0 percent. Quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborates performed better than quaternary ammonium TPBs in termite resistance and inhibition zone tests. Quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborates could inhibit Gloeophyllum trabeum and Phanerochaete chrysosporium at all concentrations used in the laboratory inhibition zone test. Weight loss of masson pine (Pinus massoniana) sapwood treated with quaternary ammonium tetrafluoroborate solutions was 1.4 to 2.6 percent (G. trabeum) and 2.5 to 3.8 percent (by Coriolus versicolor) at preservative retentions around 7.0 kg/[m.sup.3]. 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aGloeophyllum trabeum 3aIsoptera 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3aPinus massoniana 3aboron 3aboron compounds 3adecay resistance 3alaboratory techniques 3aleaching 3amanufacturing 3asapwood 3aweight loss 3awood 3awood preservatives1 aJiang, Mingliang1 aMa, Xingxia1 aJiang, Zehui1 aFei, Benhua0 tForest products journal.g2012, v. 62, no. 2 p.134-138x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.highbeam.com/publications/forest-products-journal-p3690/february-20123Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13073/0015-7473-62.2.1343Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02557naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245007000144300001800214500001500232520109000247650002801337650002301365650001001388650002101398650001301419650001201432650001701444650001501461650001901476650000901495650002001504650002601524650001501550650001201565650001101577650002701588650002201615650002401637650003201661650000901693650001701702650003501719653001701754653001001771700001301781700001901794700001401813700001301827773009801840852000901938939003301947946001101980655001201991IND9300348620221118224802.0930119e199211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930034862DNAL7 a14519082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPericas, J.10aMetabolic utilization of muscular L-proline in 24-hr starved rats  ap. 1725-1730.  a2019-12-05  a1. The aim of this paper was to study the in vivo skeletal muscle L-proline related to its destination to other key tissues such as liver and intestine as well as to give some insight into the role of blood cells in proline handling. 2. L-U-[14C]proline was injected intramuscularly and following by sampling of blood, liver, intestine and contralateral muscle at 20 and 30 min after injection. 3. The distribution of radioactivity between blood cells and plasma and in total and individual amino acids, protein and glycogen fractions was determined in the above tissues. 4. The pattern of well fed rats was compared with those submitted to 24-hr complete starvation. 5. During starvation a minor degree of proline oxidation occurs. 6. The main destruction of proline in the liver seem to be the synthesis of proteins. 7. The radioactivity recovered in the blood proline fraction of starved rats is twice that of the fed rats and that it could be attributed mainly to plasma protein. 8. We have obtained in vivo evidence for the role of erythrocyte in the interorgan proline transport. 3aintramuscular injection 3anutrient transport 3aliver 3aisotope labeling 3aglycogen 3aproline 3aerythrocytes 3aintestines 3amuscle tissues 3arats 3aprotein content 3aamino acid metabolism 3astarvation 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aIntestinesxmetabolism 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMusclesxmetabolism 2aProlinexbloodxmetabolism. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aStarvationxbloodxmetabolism. 0adistribution 0ablood1 aPico, C.1 aMatamala, J.C.1 aPalou, A.1 aPons, A.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry.g1992 Nov., v. 24, no. 11 p.1725-1730x0020-711X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02508naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245007000143300001800213520090900231650001301140650002001153650002101173650000901194650002001203650002201223650002501245650002401270650002601294650004401320650001201364650001901376650002801395650001301423650004101436650002301477650002501500650002501525650001001550650002801560650002101588650002601609650003401635650001901669653001901688653002801707653002501735700001801760773009801778852000901876930003301885945001301918946001101931655001201942IND2037926520221118224826.0940315e199311  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203792652DNAL7 a82880372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, T.10aMolecular properties of aminopeptidase Ey as a zinc-metalloenzyme  ap. 1681-1688.  aAminopeptidase Ey from hen's egg yolk contains 1.0 g atom of zinc/mol of a subunit having molecular weight of 150 kDa.

Suspected alpha lipoic acid (ALA) toxicity was diagnosed based on clinical history and compatible laboratory findings in 2 dogs. Case 1 was presented within 10 hours of ALA ingestion, with initial behavioral changes likely due to hypoglycemia. During the course of hospitalization, hypoglycemia persisted and evidence of acute hepatic insult developed. With aggressive supportive care (including IV fluids with dextrose supplementation, hepatoprotective medications, and a plasma transfusion), he made a full recovery. Case 2 was presented approximately 60 hours after ALA ingestion, and was found to be in oliguric renal failure. She was treated with IV fluids, gastroprotective medications, and furosemide, but her condition deteriorated and she was ultimately euthanized within 16 hours of admission to the hospital. ALA is an uncommon but serious toxin that should be considered in cases presenting with hypoglycemia, acute renal failure, or acute hepatic insult. 3aalpha acids 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3afurosemide 3aglucose 3ahospitals 3ahypoglycemia 3aingestion 3aprognosis 3arenal failure 3atoxicity 3atoxins 2aAnimals 2aDog Diseasesxchemically inducedxtherapy. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aMale 2aThioctic Acidxpoisoning1 aHerold, Lee V.0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2009 Oct., v. 19, no. 5 p.501-506dBlackwell Publishing Incx1479-32617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-4431.2009.00460.x 7aarticle02717naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001500146245007400161300001800235500002400253500001500277520114700292650001301439650002101452650002601473650001901499650001401518650002201532650001901554650002401573650001901597650002001616650002201636653002301658653001201681653002601693653003901719653001601758653001601774653004301790653002901833700001701862773016301879852000902042856007702051930003302128945002502161946001302186655001202199IND4401730420221118224558.0080221e20070725xx |||||o|||||||||||chi||7 aIND440173042DNAL7 a10.1021/jf062150k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aChen, C.S.10aTurbidity-Based Assay for Polygalacturonic Acid Depolymerase Activity  ap. 5907-5911.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA technically simple and inexpensive discontinuous turbidity assay for qualitative and/or quantitative assessments of polygalacturonic acid depolymerase activity is presented. The enzyme reaction is initiated by the addition of enzyme preparation to a reaction mixture containing 0.02% polygalacturonic acid (PGA) in acetate buffer. The progress of the reaction is monitored by terminating aliquots of the reaction mixture (via heat treatment at appropriate times), subsequently adding poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) for turbidity development (approximately 30 min), and then measuring the turbidity (typically at 420 nm) of the resulting PGA-PDADMAC complex-containing solution. PGA depolymerase activity causes a decrease in the observed turbidity of PGA-PDADMAC-containing solutions because the stability of the interpolyelectrolyte PGA-PDADMAC complex is a function of the degree of polymerization of the PGA. The rate of turbidity change is herein shown to be proportional to a relatively wide range of enzyme concentrations. The assay is demonstrated using a commercial pectinase preparation and tomato fruit extracts. 3atomatoes 3adepolymerization 3alaboratory techniques 3apolymerization 3aturbidity 3apolygalacturonase 3aplant extracts 3aenzymatic reactions 3aheat treatment 3aenzyme activity 3agalacturonic acid 0achemical reactions 0aenzymes 0apolygalacturonic acid 0apolygalacturonic acid depolymerase 0amethodology 0anew methods 0apoly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) 0adegree of polymerization1 aPenner, M.H.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 25, v. 55, no. 15 p.5907-5911dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf062150k3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090108b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle02629naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245011300169300001600282500002400298520111800322650002301440650002501463650001601488650002801504650001101532650002201543650002101565650001201586650001301598650002001611650001001631650001401641650002201655650000901677650001201686650001801698650002101716650001201737650002401749650001501773650001301788650001401801653001201815653003401827653003501861653001101896700001701907773009901924852000902023856005502032655001202087IND4423894520221118224632.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442389452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2009.01268.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCui, Shu-Yan10aIsolation and characterization of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene from Locusta migratoria manilensis  ap. 287-295.  aIncludes references  aTrehalose plays an important role in protecting organisms from various stresses. Trehalose-6-phosphate synthase (TPS) is the key enzyme in trehalose synthesis, but in insects only a few TPS genes have been identified and their function has not been well characterized. To better understand the function of TPS in insects, a complete TPS complementary DNA (cDNA) clone was obtained from the fat body of the locust Locusta migratoria manilensis (GenBank accession number: EU131894). The full-length cDNA is 2 806 bp, including an open reading frame of 2 442 bp, which encodes an 813 amino acids protein with a calculated molecular weight of 91 976 Daltons and an isoelectric point of 6.14. The deduced amino acid sequence is highly similar to other published insect TPS and its C-terminal also has a region homologous to trehalose phosphate phsophatase (TPP). Semi-quantitative analysis indicated that the TPS transcript was expressed not only in fat body, but also in gut, hemolymph and leg muscle. These data may facilitate studies of TPS function in insects and improve our understanding of trehalose metabolism. 3aLocusta migratoria 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3adigestive system 3aenzymes 3afat body 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahemolymph 3aisoelectric point 3alegs 3alocusts 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular weight 3amuscles 3aopen reading frames 3aphosphates 3aproteins 3atrehalose 0acloning 0aLocusta migratoria manilensis 0atrehalose-6-phosphate synthase 0aRT-PCR1 aXia, Yu-Xian0 tInsect science.g2009 Aug., v. 16, no. 4 p.287-295dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-96097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2009.01268.x 7aarticle03039naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100001600179245015600195300001400351500002400365500001500389520127600404650002101680650001701701650001501718650003001733650002701763650002201790650002501812650002201837650004401859650002501903650003501928650002001963650003301983650002602016650002402042650002302066650003102089653002802120653002402148653003702172700002502209700001502234773006402249852000902313856008202322930003302404945002502437946001102462655001202473IND4401732120140724000000.0080221e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173212DNAL7 a170216142pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68009022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF831 0aF2001 aTellier, A.10aAntagonistic pleiotropy may help population-level selection in maintaining genetic polymorphism for transmission rate in a model phytopathogenic fungus  ap. 45-52.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIt has been shown theoretically that the conditions for the maintenance of polymorphism at pleiotropic loci with antagonistic effects on fitness components are rather restrictive. Here, we use a metapopulation model to investigate whether antagonistic pleiotropy could help maintain polymorphism involving common deleterious alleles in the phytopathogenic fungus Microbotryum violaceum. This fungus causes anther smut disease of the Caryophyllaceae. A previous model has shown that the sex-linked deleterious alleles can be maintained under a metapopulation structure, when intra-tetrad selfing (mating between products of the same meiosis) is high, due to founder effects and selection at the population level. Here, we add two types of pleiotropic advantages to the metapopulation model. A competitive advantage for strains carrying the sex-linked deleterious alleles did not facilitate their maintenance because competitive situations were too rare. In contrast, higher spore production did facilitate the maintenance of the deleterious alleles at low intra-tetrad mating rates and with a large advantage for spore production. These results show that antagonistic pleiotropy may promote the persistence of genetic variation, in combination with other selective forces. 3aSilene latifolia 3alethal genes 3apleiotropy 3afungal diseases of plants 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3anatural selection 3agenetic polymorphism 3aUstilago violacea 2aBasidiomycotaxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aBiological Evolution 2aInheritance Patternsxgenetics 2aModels, Genetic 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSpores, Fungalxphysiology 0aantagonistic pleiotropy 0apopulation genetics 0amating-type-linked haplo-lethals1 aVillaréal, L.M.M.A.1 aGiraud, T.0 tHeredity.g2007 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.45-52x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68009023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03653naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001500146245018500161300001800346500002400364500001500388520199800403650002102401650002602422650001502448650002302463650001602486650002302502650001002525650001902535650002102554650002202575650002302597650001402620651002502634651002002659653001602679653001602695653001702711700001902728700001802747700001802765700002002783773016302803852000902966856007702975930003303052945002503085946001303110655001203123IND4401731820221118224908.0080221e20070725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173182DNAL7 a10.1021/jf07053202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aParker, M.10aIdentification and Quantification of a Marker Compound for 'Pepper' Aroma and Flavor in Shiraz Grape Berries by Combination of Chemometrics and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry  ap. 5948-5955.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a'Black pepper' aroma and flavor is important to some Australian Shiraz red wine styles but the aroma compounds involved have yet to be identified, and no objective analytical method to assess 'pepper' grape aromas is available to date. Samples of potentially 'spicy'/'peppery' grapes were obtained from vineyards in South Australia and Victoria over two vintages. The important sensory attributes of the grapes, including the aroma descriptor 'pepper', were rated by a sensory panel. The sensory study revealed a strong correlation between the intensity of 'pepper' aroma and the intensity of 'pepper' flavor perceived on the palate. The grape homogenates were analyzed by static headspace GC-MS using a cool inlet system. Vectors obtained by analysis of over 13 000 individual mass spectra per grape sample were then subjected to multivariate analyses. Both principal component analysis and partial least-squares regression were used to develop multivariate models based on mass spectra and aroma descriptors to explain the intensity of the rating of the 'pepper' character. Corresponding differences in mass spectra and aroma were observed among vineyards and from the same vineyards in different years. Additional optimization of the methodology enabled selection of a single region of the GC-MS chromatogram that allowed prediction of 'pepper' aroma intensity with a correlation coefficient >0.98 and led to the identification of α-ylangene, a tricyclic sesquiterpene. To assess the potential of α-ylangene as a marker for this sensory characteristic, a method for α-ylangene analysis of grapes and wine using HS-SPME-GC-MS was developed. Although not a significant aroma compound by itself, α-ylangene was a satisfactory marker for the 'pepper' aroma in grapes and wine, and its concentration showed similar discrimination between 'peppery' vineyards and vintages as that obtained using the multivariate models. Despite its presence in grapes, we could not detect α-ylangene in wine. 3asesquiterpenoids 3aquantitative analysis 3abiomarkers 3aheadspace analysis 3awine grapes 3asensory properties 3awines 3aodor compounds 3aflavor compounds 3amass spectrometry 3agas chromatography 3adetection 3aVictoria (Australia) 3aSouth Australia 0amethodology 0anew methods 0achemometrics1 aPollnitz, A.P.1 aCozzolino, D.1 aFrancis, I.L.1 aHerderich, M.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 25, v. 55, no. 15 p.5948-5955dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf07053203Available from publisher's Web site  a20090107b20090206c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/12/09  aOther US 7aarticle03063naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161100001400170245007400184300001400258500002400272520132100296650001801617650001301635650001801648650002501666650001401691650003201705650002401737650001801761650002501779650001201804650004001816650004301856650002101899650002101920650004101941650002901982650001102011650000902022650001402031650002902045650001402074650001402088650004502102653001402147653003102161700001302192700003202205773006402237852000902301856008202310930003302392945002502425946001102450655001202461IND4401731920221118224921.0080221e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173192DNAL7 a170359542pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68008812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aGotoh, T.10aCardinium symbionts cause cytoplasmic incompatibility in spider mites  ap. 13-20.  aIncludes references  aIntracellular symbiotic bacteria belonging to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides lineage have recently been described and are widely distributed in arthropod species. The newly discovered bacteria, named Cardinium sp, cause the expression of various reproductive alterations in their arthropod hosts, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), induction of parthenogenesis and feminization of genetic males. We detected 16S ribosomal DNA sequences similar to those of Cardinium from seven populations of five spider mite species, suggesting a broad distribution of infection of Cardinium in spider mites. To clarify the effect of Cardinium on the reproductive traits of the infected spider mites, infected mites were crossed with uninfected mites for each population. In one of the populations, Eotetranychus suginamensis, CI was induced when infected males were crossed with uninfected females. The other six populations of four species showed no reproductive abnormalities in the F1 generation, but the possibility of CI effects in the F2 generation remains to be tested. One species of spider mite, Tetranychus pueraricola, harbored both Cardinium and Wolbachia, but these symbionts seemed to have no effect on the reproduction of the host, even when the host was infected independently with each symbiont. 3aTetranychidae 3abacteria 3aendosymbionts 3abacterial infections 3aWolbachia 3acytoplasmic incompatibility 3ainsect reproduction 3aribosomal DNA 3anucleotide sequences 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacteroidetesxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aCluster Analysis 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aCytoplasmxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPhylogeny 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSex Ratio 2aSymbiosis 2aTetranychidaexmicrobiologyxphysiology. 0aCardinium 0areproductive abnormalities1 aNoda, H.1 aItō, S.q(Satoshi),d1946-0 tHeredity.g2007 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.13-20x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68008813Available from publisher's Web site  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03120naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143072000900161072000900170100001800179245012500197300001300322500002400335520156000359650002801919650001001947650002001957650002001977650002001997650001202017650003402029650005102063650004102114650001802155650003002173650001902203650002002222653002302242653002602265700001402291700001702305700001502322700001402337700001602351773006302367852000902430856008202439930003302521945002502554946001102579655001202590IND4401731720221118224838.0080221e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440173172DNAL7 a170800252pmid7 a10.1038/sj.hdy.68008772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL0011 aCorradini, N.10aDrosophila melanogaster as a model for studying protein-encoding genes that are resident in constitutive heterochromatin  ap. 3-12.  aIncludes references  aThe organization of chromosomes into euchromatin and heterochromatin is one of the most enigmatic aspects of genome evolution. For a long time, heterochromatin was considered to be a genomic wasteland, incompatible with gene expression. However, recent studies - primarily conducted in Drosophila melanogaster - have shown that this peculiar genomic component performs important cellular functions and carries essential genes. New research on the molecular organization, function and evolution of heterochromatin has been facilitated by the sequencing and annotation of heterochromatic DNA. About 450 predicted genes have been identified in the heterochromatin of D. melanogaster, indicating that the number of active genes is higher than had been suggested by genetic analysis. Most of the essential genes are still unknown at the molecular level, and a detailed functional analysis of the predicted genes is difficult owing to the lack of mutant alleles. Far from being a peculiarity of Drosophila, heterochromatic genes have also been found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana, as well as in humans. The presence of expressed genes in heterochromatin seems paradoxical because they appear to function in an environment that has been considered incompatible with gene expression. In the future, genetic, functional genomic and proteomic analyses will offer powerful approaches with which to explore the functions of heterochromatic genes and to elucidate the mechanisms driving their expression. 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3agenes 3ainsect proteins 3aheterochromatin 3ainsect genetics 2aAnimals 2aDrosophila Proteinsxgenetics 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulationxgenetics 2aGenes, Insect 2aHeterochromatinxgenetics 2aModels, Animal 2aModels, Genetic 0aliterature reviews 0aheterochromatic genes1 aRossi, F.1 aGiordano, E.1 aCaizzi, R.1 aVerni, F.1 aDimitri, P.0 tHeredity.g2007 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.3-12x0018-067X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.hdy.68008773Available from publisher's Web site  a20080227b20080301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03999naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002600163245009800189300001600287520179300303650003002096650001402126650001502140650002202155650001902177650002002196650001602216650002302232650001602255650001902271650001602290650001002306650003802316650001702354650002002371650002502391650003802416650002802454650003402482650002402516650001102540650002802551650002202579650004102601650001102642650004902653650002002702650005402722650003902776650003002815650001402845650002402859650001702883650004102900650005202941650001602993700002003009700002003029700002003049773012803069852000903197930003303206945002503239946001303264655001203277IND4411225520221118224805.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441122552DNAL7 a188427732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCollado, Maria Carmen10aDistinct composition of gut microbiota during pregnancy in overweight and normal-weight women  ap. 894-899.  aBACKGROUND: Results of experimental studies suggest that deviations in gut microbiota composition predispose to excessive energy storage and obesity. The mother influences the original inoculum and the development of infant microbiota, which in turn is associated with later weight gain. OBJECTIVE: We characterized the gut microbiota in women according to their body mass index (BMI) and the effect of weight gain over pregnancy on the composition of microbiota before delivery. DESIGN: Overweight women (n = 18) were selected according to their prepregnancy BMI from a prospective follow-up study. Normal-weight women (n = 36) were selected as controls in consecutive order of recruitment. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy was defined as >16.0 kg for normal-weight and >11.5 kg for overweight states according to Institute of Medicine recommendations. The composition of gut microbiota was analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization coupled with flow cytometry (FCM-FISH) and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: Bacteroides and Staphylococcus were significantly higher in the overweight state than in normal-weight women as assessed by FCM-FISH and qPCR. Mother's weight and BMI before pregnancy correlated with higher concentrations of Bacteroides, Clostridium, and STAPHYLOCOCCUS: Microbial counts increased from the first to third trimester of pregnancy. High Bacteroides concentrations were associated with excessive weight gain over pregnancy (P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota composition and weight are linked, and mother's weight gain is affected by microbiota. Microbiota modification before and during pregnancy may offer new directions for preventive and therapeutic applications in reducing the risk of overweight and obesity. 3aintestinal microorganisms 3apregnancy 3aoverweight 3aideal body weight 3apregnant women 3abody mass index 3aweight gain 3amaternal nutrition 3aBacteroides 3aStaphylococcus 3aClostridium 2aAdult 2aBacteroidesxgrowth & development 2aBirth Weight 2aBody Mass Index 2aCase-Control Studies 2aClostridiumxgrowth & development 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometryxmethods 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGastrointestinal Tractxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescencexmethods 2aInfant, Newborn 2aOverweightxepidemiologyxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aPregnancy 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aStaphylococcusxgrowth & development 2aThinnessxepidemiologyxetiologyxmicrobiology. 2aWeight Gain1 aIsolauri, Erika1 aLaitinen, Kirsi1 aSalminen, Seppo0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Oct., v. 88, no. 4 p.894-899dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/11/29  aOther US 7aarticle03623naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007000126300001600196500001500212520245000227650002202677650002502699650002002724650001002744650001402754650003202768650001902800650001402819650001502833650002102848650001402869653001502883653001502898700001402913700001802927700002002945700001802965700001902983700001603002773008103018852000903099930003303108945001303141946001103154655001203165IND2322216720221118224937.0010725e200106  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232221672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWareski, P.10aExpression of apoptosis-related proteins in mammary gland of goat  ap. 279-289.  a2019-12-05  aThe expression of apoptosis-related proteins: TGF-beta1 (auto/paracrine inducer) and its receptor (TGF-betaRIII), Bax (promoter), Bcl-2 (inhibitor) and CPP-32 (executor of apoptosis) as well as the apoptotic cell number in mammary glands of 11 Polish White Improved goats in the course of the lactation cycle (peak of lactation: days 40-70, late lactation: days 208-256, drying off: days 267-340) was investigated. The immunohistochemical study demonstrated a significant increase in TGF-beta1 and TGF-betaRIII expression in the lobuloalveolar tissue from the early lactation to the dry period. Our recent study on HC11 mouse mammary epithelial cells [Cell. Mol. Biol. 46 (2000) 175] has revealed an inhibitory effect of prolactin on TGF-beta1 transcription, which may explain the low TGF-beta1 synthesis during lactogenesis and galactopoiesis and the increase in TGF-beta1 and TGF-betaIIIR expression in late lactation and dry period. Bax expression was the lowest in the peak of lactation, significantly increased in late lactation and remained elevated during drying off. Bcl-2 content was lower than Bax in all examined periods, but it increased significantly at the end of lactation, which suggests the survival of cells with the highest resistance to apoptogenic stimuli. The increase in Bcl-2 level in remnant lobuloalveolar tissue is probably the molecular mechanism that limits the rate of secretory tissue involution. The induction of CPP-32 (caspase 3) from the peak of lactation to dry period was accompanied by a progressive loss of mammary epithelial cells and the increase in apoptotic cell numbers but only in the dry period. The increase in the expression of examined proteins in the late lactation and the dry period indicates their involvement in the induction (TGF-beta1 and TGF-betaRIII), regulation (Bax and Bcl-2) and execution (CPP-32) of programmed cell death in the course of mammary gland involution. The lack of an increase in apoptotic cell number in late lactation, in spite of the evident decrease in total cell number, suggests milk as an alternative route (apart from phagocytosis) of apoptotic cells elimination from the mammary gland. The presented results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of mammary cell apoptosis in goat and for this reason may have practical implications for control and regulation of mammary gland remodelling, which is a prerequisite for subsequent successful lactation. 3aprotein synthesis 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aanimal proteins 3agoats 3alactation 3atransforming growth factors 3amammary glands 3areceptors 3aepithelium 3apromoter regions 3aapoptosis 0ainhibitors 0adry period1 aMotyl, T.1 aRyniewicz, Z.1 aOrzechowski, A.1 aGajkowska, B.1 aWojewodzka, U.1 aPloszaj, T.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2001 June, v. 40, no. 3 p.279-289x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01081naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245004000128300001400168500001500182520036100197650001700558653001700575700001700592700001600609773011900625852000900744939003300753946002900786655001200815IND8103323220221118224939.0810409e198101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND810332322DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGilliam, C.H.10aBoron toxicity in woody ornamentals  ap. 29-31.  a2019-12-05  aBoron (B) toxicity is characterized by leaf tip yellowing followed by apparent leaf tip necrosis and premature defoliation.

The model and the numerical method are applied to a series of test cases with laboratory data and also to a practical case of realistic size. The numerical model is designed to work on both structured quadrilateral and unstructured triangular grids and is able to cope with unsteady wetting/drying fronts. 3alandslides 3amathematical models 3atopography 3atransient flow1 aMurillo, J.1 aGarcía-Navarro, P.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 July 15, v. 373, no. 3-4 p.273-289dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.05.003 7aarticle02813naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010200126300001400228520164700242650001001889650002101899650001601920650001801936650001101954650001501965650001001980650001401990650002002004650001802024650001202042650002502054651001102079653001502090653001202105653002602117700001802143700001802161700001702179700001302196773008002209852000902289930003302298945001302331946001102344655001202355IND2205164620221118224715.0000608e199909  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220516462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawas, J.R.10aEffects of grain supplementation on the intake and digestibility of range diets consumed by goats  ap. 49-56.  aTwo studies were conducted during the wet and dry seasons to investigate the effects of grain supplementation on intake and digestibility of range diets consumed by goats. Fifty pre-puberal female Moxoto goats were randomly assigned to one of the four dietary treatments: grain supplementation at 0, 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8% BW. Intake and fecal output of OM were determined using Cr(2)0(3) and ADL as internal and external markers, respectively. Diet quality was determined through the collection of extrusa samples using 20 adult esophageally fistulated goats, which were equally and randomly assigned to one of the four dietary treatments. During the dry season, goats selected a diet with more (p < 0.01) protein and less (p < 0.01) cell wall components than during the wet season. An increase in the level of supplement from 0% to 1.8% BW during both these seasons resulted in a decrease in forage of OM intake, and an increase in total OM intake. During the wet season, total OM intake increased from 50.5 to 61.9 g/kg(0.75), or from 2.71 to 3.26% BW. Digestibility of OM also increased from 48.7% to 65.7%. During the dry season, total OM intake increased from 55 to 74 g/kg(0.75) or from 1.6% to 2.6% BW, and digestibility of OM increased from 47.7% to 66.2%. During the dry season, the inadequacy of 1.6% BW OM intake observed in unsupplemented goats could be attributed to the restriction of free diet selection. Although CP intake of unsupplemented animals was higher than the maintenance requirement, grain supplementation was required to allow for enough digestible OM and CP intakes to meet energy and protein requirements for growth. 3agoats 3afeed supplements 3afeed intake 3adigestibility 3aforage 3adry season 3afeces 3aexcretion 3adietary protein 3acrude protein 3afemales 3acell wall components 3aBrazil 0adry matter 0aquality 0adigestibility markers1 aSchacht, W.H.1 aShelton, J.M.1 aOlivares, E.1 aLu, C.D.0 tSmall ruminant research.g1999 Sept., v. 34, no. 1 p.49-56x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle03220naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012300127300001600250520218000266650001002446650001702456650001102473650001302484650001702497650001202514650001602526650002302542650001802565651001702583653001602600653001202616653001802628653001102646700001802657773008102675852000902756930003302765945001302798946001102811655001202822IND2205306120221118224649.0000619e199910  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220530612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnyman, M.A.10aRepeatability and heritability of objective and subjective fleece traits and body weight in South African Angora goats  ap. 103-109.  aThe repeatability and heritability of body weight, greasy fleece weight and mean fibre diameter, as well as various subjective fleece traits of South African Angora goats were estimated. The first of two data sets analysed, was collected through the Angora goat performance testing scheme (AGPTS), while the second comprised data collected on the experimental flocks kept at the Jansenville Experimental Station (JEF). The following traits were assessed subjectively on a linear scale ranging from 1 to 50 at the second, third and fourth shearings, namely fullness of face covering, fullness of the neck, fullness of belly and points, style, character, evenness of fleece, softness of face and ears, pigmentation in the face and on the ears, and kemp and medullated fibres. Heritability and repeatability estimates were obtained by fitting repeatability animal models under a DFREML programme. Heritability for body weight was higher in the JEF (0.47 +/- 0.01) than in the Angora studs (0.35 +/- 0.05), while the same heritabilities were estimated for fleece weight (0.22 +/- 0.04) and fibre diameter (0.30 +/- 0.05) in both data sets. The repeatability of body weight was higher in the JEF (0.63) than in the studs (0.53), but it was lower for fleece weight (0.27 vs. 0.41) and fibre diameter (0.35 vs. 0.68) in the JEF. Heritability and repeatability estimates for all subjectively assessed traits, with the exception of face cover in the JEF and pigmentation in both data sets, were moderate to low. Due to the fact that young bucks in South Africa are sold at 14-16 months of age with their full third fleece, performance testing has to be done at 8-9 months of age at the second shearing. As fleece weight had the lowest repeatability of the three production traits, it was recommended the fleece weight be left out of the selection index. The possible inclusion of style in the selection index needs to be investigated further. As far as the other subjectively assessed traits are concerned, it is recommended any selection for the further improvement of these traits should be based on independent culling levels and they should not be included in the selection index. 3agoats 3aheritability 3afleece 3adiameter 3apigmentation 3atexture 3abody weight 3aselection criteria 3adietary fiber 3aSouth Africa 0aperformance 0aquality 0afleece weight 0aangora1 aOlivier, J.J.0 tSmall ruminant research.g1999 Oct., v. 34, no. 2 p.103-109x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02051naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245009400173300001600267520078800283650001301071650001001084650002501094650001901119650002501138650001801163650002001181650001801201650002001219650001301239650002901252653001301281653002301294653001201317653002501329653002801354700001601382773007601398852000901474856007801483939003301561946001101594655001201605IND9200004820221118224720.0920108s1988    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000482DNAL7 a242723372pmid7 a10.1007/BF000273812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchantz, R.10aMaize chloroplast genes ndhD, ndhE, and psaC.

Two genes have some homology to respiratory NADH dehydrogenase subunits. They have been observed in Marchantia and tobacco and are designated ndhD and ndhE. The maize genes code for polypeptides of 58 and 11.3 kilodaltons respectively. The gene psaC is found upstream of ndhD; it encodes an 8.7-kilodalton iron-sulfur protein of PSI. The genes ndhD and psaC are cotranscribed in maize, and give rise to an RNA of 2.1 kilobases. The pool of RNAs from this transcription unit increases about three-fold within the first 10 hours of illumination of dark-grown maize seedlings. On the other hand, ndhE is transcribed independently. 3aZea mays 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3amessenger RNA 3agene expression 3aphotosystem I 3achloroplast DNA 3agenomics 3atranscription (genetics) 0agreening 0agenetic regulation 0acloning 0airon-sulfur proteins 0amolecular sequence data1 aBogorad, L.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1988, v. 11, no. 3 p.239-247x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000273813Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03273naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245008100166300001600247500002400263520208000287650001202367650001502379650001702394650001202411650001202423650001102435650002402446650001502470650001902485650001102504650002202515650001602537650001202553650001502565650001502580650001702595651001202612700002002624700001702644773010902661852000902770856004802779655001202827IND4416386520221118224725.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441638652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-008-9532-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStromberg, J.

This study contrasted riparian plant species richness and composition (extant vegetation and soil seed bank) between stream reaches with different low-flow conditions (perennial vs. ephemeral flow) but similar flood patterns and similar watershed-derived species pools. Data were collected at Cienega Creek (Arizona, USA) over a 2 year period spanning drought conditions and wetter conditions. Consistent with expectations relating to water limitation effects on diversity, species richness in the riparian zone was lower at ephemeral-flow sites during a season with minimal precipitation and no overbank flooding; under these conditions, the more permanent water sources of the perennial-flow sites sustain the larger number of species. During seasons with greater precipitation and elevated stream flows, in contrast, species richness at ephemeral-flow sites increased to levels at or slightly above those of perennial-flow sites. For values pooled across two wet seasons of a calendar year, year-round richness was greater at the two ephemeral-flow sites (total of 92 vascular plant species) than at the two perennial-flow sites (68 species). This greater year-round richness was a combination of multiple factors: greater light, space, and bare ground, a diverse soil seed bank (with the seed banks equally species-rich among hydrologic types), and moderately abundant precipitation and flooding sufficient to stimulate establishment of opportunistic species (mainly annuals) during the bimodal wet seasons. These results indicate that long-term patterns of site water availability, by influencing woody plant cover, mediate the diversity response to episodic water pulses in dryland rivers. The results also have implications for riparian conservation efforts, which to date have focused primarily on perennial stream reaches: ephemeral reaches of spatially intermittent rivers harbor many riparian plant species, and warrant conservation efforts, as well. 3aannuals 3aarid lands 3aburied seeds 3adeserts 3adrought 3afloods 3aground cover plants 3aperennials 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3astream flow 3astreams 3avegetation 3awet season 3awoody plants 3aArizona1 aHazelton, A.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether there were any differences in the micronutrient contents in organic and conventional tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Two tomato cultivars ‘Lladó' and ‘Antillas' grown organically and conventionally were compared regarding their micronutrient in terms of K, Ca, Na, Mg, Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, lycopene, ß-carotene, ascorbic, malic and citric acids, and total phenolic compound content. Cultivar ‘Lladó' had the highest concentration of the nutrient lycopene, ß-carotene, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu. Where cultivation method affected the concentration of ascorbic acid and Mn, only one cultivar was affected. For all nutrients examined, cultivar differences were greater than differences because of cultivation method. This study confirms that the most important variable in the micronutrient content of tomatoes is cultivar; organically grown tomato is no more nutritious than conventionally grown tomato when soil fertility is well managed. 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aascorbic acid 3acultivars 3alycopene 3amalic acid 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aorganic foods 3aphenolic compounds 3asoil fertility 3atomatoes1 aVázquez-Odériz, M.

Both types of nodules are essentially similar, particularly when stem nodules are formed in the dark. We detected the specific expression of at least 16 genes in stem and root nodules and observed the stimulated expression of about 10 other genes in both nodules. Six of the nodule-specific translation products (apparent molecular masses around 16 kDa) cross-react with an antiserum raised against leghemoglobin purified from Sesbania rostrata stem nodules. During stem nodule development, most of the nodule-stimulated genes are expressed concomitantly with leghemoglobin at day 12 after inoculation. However, some genes are already stimulated at days 6-7, some others later in development (day 18), and some are transiently activated. Patterns of root nodules induced by either Azorhizobium caulinodans strain ORS571, capable of effective root and stem nodulation, or Rhizobium sp. strain ORS51, capable of effective root nodulation only, are very similar except for a specific 37.5 kDa polypeptide. Several types of ineffective stem and root nodules were studied; in every case the amount of leghemoglobin components appeared reduced together with most of the nodule-stimulated polypeptides. 3aAzorhizobium caulinodans 3anodulins 3astem nodules 3aroot nodules 3aSesbania 3agene expression 3agenes 3amutants 3aRhizobium 3anodulation 3aleghemoglobin 0anodule-specific polypeptides 0adark 0anodule-specific proteins 0aRhizobiaceae1 aHuguet, T.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1988, v. 10, no. 6 p.537-548x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000336083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02056naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002700110245004700137300001600184500007500200520107100275650001501346650001901361650002501380650001701405650002601422700001701448700001901465700001901484700001701503700001701520700001601537773007501553852000901628930003301637945001301670946001101683655001201694IND2201454920221118225136.0991104e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220145492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorraine-Colwill, D.F.10aResistance to glyphosate in Lolium rigidum  ap. 489-491.  aExtended Summaries: 9th International Congress of Pesticide Chemistry.  aAnnual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) is a widespread and important weed of Australia and populations of this weed have developed resistance to most major herbicides, including glyphosate. The possible mechanisms of resistance have been examined in one glyphosate-resistant Lolium population. No major differences were observed between resistant and susceptible biotypes in respect of (i) the -target enzyme (EPSP synthase), (ii) DAHP synthase, the first enzyme of the target (shikimate) pathway, (iii) absorption of glyphosate, or (iv) translocation. Following treatment with glyphosate, there was greater accumulation of shikimate (derived from shikimate-3-Pi) in susceptible than in resistant plants. In addition, the resistant population exhibited cross-resistance to 2-hydroxy-3-(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)propyl phosphonate, a herbicide which, although structurally similar to glyphosate, acts at an unrelated target site. On the basis of these observations we speculate that movement of glyphosate to its site of action in plastid is involved in the resistance mechanism. 3aglyphosate 3aLolium rigidum 3aherbicide resistance 3aweed control 3aresistance mechanisms1 aHawkes, T.R.1 aWilliams, P.H.1 aWarner, S.A.J.1 aSutton, P.B.1 aPowles, S.B.1 aPreston, C.0 tPesticide science.g1999 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.489-491x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02797naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245013200172300001600304500001500320520149600335650002701831650002001858650001501878650002201893650001301915650002001928650002901948650002201977650001901999650002102018650003802039653001202077653000802089700001402097700001802111700001502129773007602144852000902220856007802229939003302307946001102340655001202351IND9200002920221118224940.0920107s1988    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000292DNAL7 a242724082pmid7 a10.1007/BF000390322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallas, N.10aLinear forms of plasmid DNA are superior to supercoiled structures as active templates for gene expression in plant protoplasts  ap. 517-527.  a2019-12-04  aIntroduction of the plasmids pUC8CaMVCAT and pNOSCAT into plant protoplasts is known to result in transient expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. Also, transfection with the plasmid pDO432 results in transient appearance of the luciferase enzyme. In the present work we have used these systems to study the effect of DNA topology on the expression of the above recombinant genes. Linear forms of the above plasmids exhibited much higher activity in supporting gene expression than their corresponding supercoiled structures. CAT activity in protoplasts transfected with the linear forms of pUC8CaMVCAT and pNOSCAT was up to ten-fold higher than that observed in protoplasts transfected by the supercoiled template of these plasmids. This effect was observed in protoplasts derived from two different lines of Petunia hybrida and from a Nicotiana tabacum cell line. Transfection with the relaxed form of pUC8CaMVCAT resulted in very low expression of the CAT gene. Northern blot analysis revealed that the amount of poly(A)+ RNA extracted from protoplasts transformed with the linear forms of the DNA was about 10-fold higher than that found in protoplasts transformed with supercoiled DNA. Southern blot analysis revealed that about the same amounts of supercoiled and linear DNA molecules were present in nuclei of transfected protoplasts. No significant quantitative differences have been observed between the degradation rates of the various DNA templates used. 3agenetic transformation 3aPetunia hybrida 3aluciferase 3adirect DNA uptake 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3aDNA conformation 3achloramphenicol acetyltransferase 0aPetunia 0aDNA1 aZakai, N.1 aFriedberg, D.1 aLoyter, A.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1988, v. 11, no. 4 p.517-527x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000390323Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01487naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008800130300001600218500007500234520057600309650001100885650002800896650003700924650001900961700002200980700001601002700001401018773007501032852000901107930003301116945001301149946001101162655001201173IND2201455120221118225017.0991104e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220145512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolleyres, L.P.10aInsecticidal natural products: new rocaglamide derivatives from Aglaia roxburghiana  ap. 494-497.  aExtended Summaries: 9th International Congress of Pesticide Chemistry.  aIn the course of the screening for novel, naturally occurring pesticides from the plant family Meliaceae, an extract of the stem bark of Aglaia roxburghiana was found to exhibit significant insecticidal activity.

The deduced amino acid sequence contains a single repetitive element of carrot extensin (Ser-Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro). The related mRNAs have a defined distribution in tissues of the plant and are accumulated mainly in the coleoptile node and root tip. A peptide that corresponds to one of the repetitive elements of the protein has been synthesized and antisera have been obtained in rabbits. These antibodies react against crude preparations of coleoptile cell wall and against polypeptides extracted following the protocols described for the extraction of extensin. From these data it is concluded that the cDNAs correspond to a family of cell wall glycoproteins from maize. 3aroot tips 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3acoleoptiles 3aimmunochemistry 3aDNA 3aproline 3aamino acid sequences 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aextensin 3acell wall components 3ahistochemistry 3aplant proteins 0acloning 0arepetitive amino acid sequences 0amolecular sequence data 0aproline-rich protein 0aglycoproteins1 aPerez-Grau, L.1 aAlbericio, F.1 aGiralt, E.1 aRuiz-Avila, L.1 aLudevid, M.D.1 aPuigdomenech, P.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1988, v. 11, no. 4 p.483-493x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000390293Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02353naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245002500132300001600157520143400173650002001607650002101627650001201648650002501660650002501685650001201710650001401722650001801736650002401754653001201778653002901790653002801819700001501847773007601862852000901938939003301947946001101980655001201991IND9200002320221118224900.0920107s1988    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCameron-Mills, V.12aA gamma-hordein gene  ap. 449-461.  aThe 1614 bp nucleotide sequence of a barley gene encoding a gamma-hordein endosperm storage polypeptide is presented. The deduced amino acid sequence is 305 amino acids long. It comprises a 19 amino acid signal peptide, an N-terminal half composed of proline-glutamine blocks organized in repeating units and a C-terminal half where the repeats are dispersed and less conserved. The deduced amino acid sequence shows strong homology to a gamma-gliadin polypeptide from wheat and a gamma-secalin polypeptide from rye and less homology to a B1 hordein polypeptide from barley. The 378 bp 5' non-coding region contains a TATA box at -85, an AGGA sequence at -105 and a -300 element typical of prolamin storage protein genes. The transcript start is 56 bp upstream of the ATG codon and 30 bp downstream of the TATA box. The 318 bp 3' non-coding region contains 2 putative polyadenylation signals, 76 and 132 bp downstream of the stop codon. gamma-Hordein polypeptides are encoded by a small multigene family. The gamma-hordein gene family is not part of the deleted chromosome 5 region, containing the Hor 2 locus, in the B hordein-deficient mutant hor 2ca. Two mRNA size classes of 1350 and 1450 nt are detectable in wild-type endosperms from 8 to 26 days after anthesis. The mutant hor 2ca contains as much gamma-hordein mRNA as the wild type, whereas the B and C hordein-deficient mutant lys 3a contains barely detectable amounts. 3aHordeum vulgare 3amultigene family 3ahordein 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3amutants 3aendosperm 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 0acloning 0atranscription start site 0amolecular sequence data1 aBrandt, A.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1988, v. 11, no. 4 p.449-461x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01559naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008000127300001600207500007500223520063800298650002300936650001000959650001900969650001700988650001201005650001401017653001601031700001601047700001701063773007501080852000901155930003301164945001301197946001101210655001201221IND2201455220221118224847.0991104e199904  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220145522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZounos, A.K.10aBioactive compounds from neem tissue cultures and screening against insects  ap. 497-500.  aExtended Summaries: 9th International Congress of Pesticide Chemistry.  aHairy root cultures have been derived from neem (Azadirachta indica A Juss, Family Meliacceae) using Agrobacterium rhizogenes and have been studied for the production of compounds with antifeedant effect on insects.

The ECG was monitored by standard bipolar leads that provided discernible electrocardiographic features only in Lead I. Electrocardiograms of lambs differ significantly from those of kids with respect to QRS complex, P-R interval and T wave. Higher basal heart rate in lambs is apparently due to shorter P-R interval and shorter interval between successive cardiac cycles (p < 0.05). Pentazocine, 3 mg kg-1 i.m., appears safer for lambs than kids as it significantly decreased P-R interval, Q-T interval, cardiac cycle duration, interval between successive cardiac cycles, respiration rate, and increased heart rate in kids but not in lambs (p < 0.05). 3ainterspecific variation 3aheart rate 3ahuman health and safety 3asheep 3agoats 3arisk assessment 3aduration 3aagonists 0aspecies differences 0arespiration 0arespiration rate 0aevaluation1 aNazki, A.R.1 aRaina, R.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2000 July, v. 37, no. 1/2 p.13-17x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle03068naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213100002100230245010800251300001600359520137200375650001701747650001801764650003101782650002001813650002301833650001901856650002101875650001501896650002001911650002101931650001301952650001301965650002201978650001202000650002302012650003802035650003102073650003602104650002802140653002002168653002502188700001802213700002502231773007302256852000902329856008302338930003302421945002502454946001102479655001202490IND4434090420221118224801.0100317e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443409042DNAL7 a200976862pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpp1242doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBlande, James D.10aFoliar methyl salicylate emissions indicate prolonged aphid infestation on silver birch and black alder  ap. 404-416.  aIt is well documented that when plants are damaged by insects they respond by emitting a range of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). While there have been numerous reports concerning VOCs induced by chewing herbivores, there are relatively few studies detailing the VOCs induced by aphid feeding. The effects of aphid feeding on VOCs emitted by boreal forest trees have been particularly neglected. Herbivore-induced VOCs have relevance to direct and indirect plant defence and atmospheric chemistry. In this study, we analysed the VOCs emitted by Betula pendula (Roth) and Alnus glutinosa (L.) (Gaertn.) infested by specialist aphid species under laboratory conditions. We also complemented this by collecting VOCs from leaf beetle-damaged saplings under field conditions. In addition to induction of some inducible terpenes, we detected substantial aphid-induced emissions of methyl salicylate (MeSA) in both B. pendula and A. glutinosa. MeSA emission intensity depended on the length of aphid infestation. Feeding by beetles induced emission of (E)-DMNT in both tree species and (E)-β-ocimene in A. glutinosa but had no effect on MeSA emissions. MeSA has been shown to have aphid-repellent qualities and has been shown recently to have impact on formation of secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. We discuss our results in relation to these two phenomena. 3aforest trees 3agas emissions 3avolatile organic compounds 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aEuceraphis betulae 3amonoterpenoids 3asesquiterpenoids 3aAgelastica 3ainsect behavior 3afeeding behavior 3ahoneydew 3aduration 3amethyl salicylate 2aAnimals 2aAphidsxphysiology 2aBetulaxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aIlexxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aSalicylatesxmetabolism 0aAgelastica alni 0ainfestation duration1 aKorjus, Minna1 aHolopainen, Jarmo K.0 tTree physiology.g2010 Mar., v. 30, no. 3 p.404-416x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpp1243Available from publisher's Web site  a20100409b20100501c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02773naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001300157245010800170300001600278520154100294650002001835650001801855650000801873650001901881650001901900650002501919650002501944650002001969650001801989650001102007650002902018653001402047653001202061653002802073700001602101700001502117773007602132852000902208856007802217939003302295946001102328655001202339IND9200002720221118224616.0920107s1988    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000272DNAL7 a242724062pmid7 a10.1007/BF000390302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, B.10aCloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a mRNA rapidly-induced by ABA in barley aleurone layers  ap. 495-506.  aAbscisic acid (ABA) inhibits the gibberellic acid induced synthesis of alpha-amylase in barley aleurone layers, yet ABA itself induces more than a dozen polypeptides (Lin & Ho, Plant Physiol 82: 289-297, 1986). As part of our effort to elucidate the molecular action of ABA in barley aleurone layers, we have isolated and characterized an ABA-induced cDNA clone, pHV A1. This cDNA clone hybridizes to an RNA species of approximately 1.1 kb from ABA-treated barley aleurone layers. The level of this mRNA is tripled within 40 minutes after ABA treatment, reaches a peak at 8-12 h, and is present up to 48 h. The induction of this mRNA responds to concentrations of ABA as low as 10(-9) M, but higher ABA concentrations induce higher expression of this mRNA. The products of hybrid-select translation and in vitro transcription/translation with pHV A1 comigrate on SDS gel as a 27 kDa polypeptide. However, the sequence of pHV A1 indicates that it has an open reading frame encoding a 22 kDa protein. This size discrepancy is probably due to the high content of the basic amino acid, lysine. This notion has been confirmed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showing that this polypeptide is one of the most basic proteins in ABA-treated barley aleurone layers. The deduced amino acid sequence of pHV A1 contains nine imperfect repeats 11 amino acids long which share homology with cotton Lea 7 protein (Baker, Steele & Dure, Plant Mol Biol, in press). The identity and function of the encoded product of pHV A1 is under investigation. 3aHordeum vulgare 3amessenger RNA 3aDNA 3aaleurone layer 3aplant proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aabscisic acid 3alysine 3atranscription (genetics) 0ainduction 0acloning 0amolecular sequence data1 aUknes, S.J.1 aHo, T.H.D.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1988, v. 11, no. 4 p.495-506x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000390303Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03539naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245016600133300001300299500001500312520205800327650002202385650001702407650001002424650001802434650000802452650001402460650001202474650002002486650001702506650002702523650001002550650000902560650003002569650002002599650001602619650001402635650001702649651001302666653001102679653000902690653001002699653001902709700002102728700001502749700001702764700001602781700001402797700001602811773008002827852000902907930003302916945001302949946001102962655001202973IND2207389020221118224644.0001019e200007  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220738902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukasa-Mugerwa, E.10aBetween and within breed variation in lamb survival and the risk factors associated with major causes of mortality in indigenous Horro and Menz sheep in Ethiopia  ap. 1-12.  a2019-12-05  aData collected on 3256 lambs born to Horro and Menz breed ewes single-sire mated to 71 rams at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Debre Berhan station between September 1992 and June 1996 were analysed for rates of survival and growth from birth to weaning. A significantly lower proportion of Menz lambs died before 1 year of age (28%) than the Horro lambs (59%). Least squares means for pre- and post-weaning mortality were 8.8 and 19.3%, respectively in Menz, and 25.3 and 34.2% for Horro sheep. Major causes of death were similar in Horro versus Menz lambs and were pneumonia (53 vs. 54%, respectively), digestive problems (14 vs. 12%), endoparasite infections (9 vs. 13%), starvation-mismothering-exposure (SME) complex (10 vs. 7%) and septicemia (3 vs. 2%). Relationships among causes of mortality with breed, birth weight (BWT), season of birth, parity, litter size and lamb health category (number of times a lamb was sick between birth and 1 year of age) were determined. The impact of these factors on mortality varied with lamb age. Lambs that were born with <2kg BWT had a greater risk of dying from any cause except pneumonia. But, even though Horro lambs were heavier than Menz at birth (2.4 vs. 2.1 kg, respectively), twice as many died before 1 year of age. The cause of mortality was further influenced by season of birth, lamb sex and health category. In addition, sires were a significant source of variation for progeny survival at 6,9 and 12 months of age, but not at the younger ages. The best and worst Horro ram sired progeny groups that had mortality rates up to 1 year of age of 22 vs. 80%, respectively. The same estimates in Menz rams were 11 and 48%, respectively. Reduced mortality rate would significantly increase lamb output. However, isolated efforts to solve this problem are likely to have limited impact. Instead, an integrated approach to minimise the impact of underlying factors is advocated. Farm (animal) management routines that could be introduced in the short or longer term are discussed. 3abreed differences 3asheep breeds 3asires 3ahelminthiasis 3aage 3apneumonia 3aweaning 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 3aenvironmental exposure 3alambs 3aewes 3adigestive system diseases 3apaternal effect 3alitter size 3amortality 3abirth weight 3aEthiopia 0agrowth 0amenz 0asheep 0alambing season1 aLahlou-Kassi, A.1 aAnindo, D.1 aRege, J.E.O.1 aTembely, S.1 aTibbo, M.1 aBaker, R.L.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2000 July, v. 37, no. 1/2 p.1-12x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle02165naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245007500172300001600247500001500263520065600278650001300934650001800947650001200965650002800977650001701005650002501022650002901047650001601076650001601092653001201108653001901120653002901139653001801168653001001186653002801196653001401224653001801238653001301256653001301269653002501282653004801307700002301355700001701378700002101395773007601416852000901492856007801501939003301579946001101612655001201623IND9200002520221118224638.0920107s1988    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000252DNAL7 a242724042pmid7 a10.1007/BF000390282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFurtek, D.10aSequence comparisons of three wild-type Bronze-1 alleles from Zea mays  ap. 473-481.  a2019-12-04  aWe have sequenced genomic clones of two wild-type Bronze-1 (Bz1) alleles, and a cDNA clone from a third wild-type Bz1 allele from maize.

The transcript is preceded by a putative TATA box, but not a recognizable CAAT box. The bz1 gene contains a single intron, and exhibits a strong bias for codons with the highest G + C content.

The physical characteristics of digesta are discussed along with their impact on the physiology of digestion with special reference to sites where these characteristics are likely to influence digestive efficiency. Evidence is reviewed regarding the effects of supplementation with viscoactive agents on the flow and mixing of digesta in particular segments of the human gut that, by changing the rheology and liquid permeability of digesta in that segment, influence specific aspects of digestion and absorption. 3afood intake 3ahealth status 3aviscosity 3ahuman health 3adiet therapy 3adigestion 3anutritive value 3adigesta 3aintestines 3aintestinal absorption 3afood choices 3adietary supplements 3apermeability 2aAbsorption 2aAnimals 2aColonxphysiology 2aDigestionxphysiology 2aFood 2aFood Technology 2aGastric Emptyingxphysiology 2aGastrointestinal Motility 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aIntestine, Smallxphysiology 2aObesityxprevention & control 2aParticle Size 2aPermeability 2aRheology 2aStomachxphysiology 2aViscoelastic Substances 2aViscosity 0adiet 0adigestive physiology 0aliterature reviews 0ahuman nutrition 0adigestive system1 aJanssen, Patrick W.M.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2010 Feb., v. 50, no. 2 p.130-145x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083908022487263Available from publisher's Web site  a20100513b20100605c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle02422naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245014100172300001700313520101400330650002301344650002001367650002101387650000901408650001001417650001801427650003001445650001401475650001301489650001301502650001701515650001201532650002201544653001501566653001301581653004101594700002101635700001901656700001801675773012601693852000901819856009201828930003301920946001101953655001201964IND4411136320221118224621.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441113632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01617.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKUBO, Toshihiko10aWhole-body heat transfer coefficient and body temperature change of juvenile Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis according to growth  ap. 995-1004.  aBluefin tuna maintain a higher body temperature than ambient sea water. Body heat is derived mainly from metabolic heat to elevate and maintain regional body temperature that is higher than the ambient, while heat loss is caused by heat transfer throughout the whole body surface and gills. Retention of high body temperature is thought to differ at each growth stage, so that a larger body mass maintains a higher body temperature. We evaluated the whole-body heat transfer coefficient, thermal difference between each tissue and water temperature, and metabolic heat in tissues during swimming of juvenile bluefin tuna as a function of fork length (FL) using a small thermometer and a treadmill-type flow tank. A system for maintaining high body temperature was well developed in fish with FL greater than 20.0 cm. Whole-body heat transfer coefficient was fitted to a - 0.695 power of mass. Juvenile bluefin tuna showed a transition speed of 3.0 FL/s at which they switched from aerobic to anaerobic motion. 3aThunnus orientalis 3aThunnus thynnus 3abody temperature 3afish 3agills 3aheat transfer 3aheat transfer coefficient 3ajuveniles 3aseawater 3aswimming 3athermometers 3atissues 3awater temperature 0aendothermy 0ajuvenile 0awhole-body heat transfer coefficient1 aSAKAMOTO, Wataru1 aMurata, Osamu.1 aKUMAI, Hidemi0 tFisheries science.g2008 Oct., v. 74, no. 5 p.995-1004dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax0919-92687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1444-2906.2008.01617.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02623naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001900157245011200176300001600288520149600304650001201800650002101812650001001833650004501843650001401888650001701902650002301919653001601942653001901958700001601977700001901993700001802012773007602030852000902106856007802115939003302193946001102226655001202237IND9200001120221118225003.0920107s1988    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000112DNAL7 a242725002pmid7 a10.1007/BF000174662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMclean, Bitty.10aDetermination of copy number and linkage relationships among five actin gene subfamilies in Petunia hybrida  ap. 663-672.  aThe actin gene superfamily of Petunia hybrida cv. Mitchell contains greater than 100 gene members which have been divided into several highly divergent subfamilies. Five subfamily-specific probes have been used to compare the actin genes among the Mitchell, Violet 23 (V23) and Red 51 (R51) cultivars of P. hybrida. The sum total of actin genes in these five subfamilies was estimated to be between 10 and 34 members in both V23 and R51. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between V23 and R51 were examined with these five probes and eleven different restriction endonucleases. Among the 55 comparisons, 87% exhibited RFLPs. These data indicate extreme divergence between V23 and R51 in DNA sequence and/or the presence of small insertions and deletions surrounding these actin gene subfamilies. This divergence suggests that V23 and R51, which have contrasting phenotypic marker loci on every chromosome, may be useful for the development of a complete RFLP linkage map of the Petunia genome. The segregation of Hind III RFLPs among the progeny of two backcrosses demonstrated that representatives of the five subfamilies of Petunia actin genes exist at four distinct genetic locations and suggested that two of these loci are tightly linked. Apparently, amplification of the numerous members of the Petunia actin gene superfamily occurred via gene dispersal of the original subfamily progenitors and not primarily as a result of amplification of a single chromosomal region. 3aPetunia 3amultigene family 3aactin 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3acultivars 3ainbred lines 3alinkage (genetics) 0asegregation 0amultiple genes1 aBaird, W.V.1 aGerats, A.G.M.1 aMeagher, R.B.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1988, v. 11, no. 5 p.663-672x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000174663Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02890naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001800135245008300153300001600236500002400252500002300276520148400299650001801783650002801801650002201829650002601851650001401877650001501891650000901906650002001915650001501935650000901950650001101959651001701970700001501987700001902002700001702021700001502038700001402053700001302067700001602080700002102096700001302117773009102130852000902221856007502230856009102305655001202396IND4467729020221118225051.0130513s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446772902DNAL7 a10.4141/P01-1802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKutcher, H.R.10aRhizobium inoculant and seed-applied fungicide effects on field pea production  ap. 645-661.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aField pea has been shown to benefit from the use of rhizobium inoculation and seed-applied fungicides under intensive production. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of seed- or soil-applied rhizobium (Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae) inoculants and seed-applied fungicides on field pea (Pisum sativum "Carneval") production on fields with no previous history of the crop. The study was conducted at seven locations in Saskatchewan in each of 2 yr. Fungicide treatments were Apron FL (metalaxyl), Apron FL + Thiram 75WP (dithiocarbamate) and an untreated check in 1997 and a fourth treatment, Thiram 75WP, was added in 1998. Rhizobium treatments were seed-applied liquid inoculant, soil-applied granular inoculant and a non-inoculated check. Inoculation with rhizobium increased nodulation (5 of 10 sites), seed yield (6 of 13 sites), and protein content (3 of 8 sites), but occasionally appeared to reduce emergence (3 of 14 sites). Granular inoculant had more beneficial effects than the liquid inoculant. Fungicide treatments had few positive effects on production, and occasionally negative effects such as reduced emergence. Interaction effects were rare between seed-applied fungicide and seed-applied liquid or soil-applied granular rhizobium inoculants, which indicated compatibility of these products. Variability in the effects of inoculant types and fungicides suggests that responses are dependent on local soil and environmental conditions. 3aPisum sativum 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3acropping sequence 3aenvironmental factors 3ametalaxyl 3anodulation 3apeas 3aprotein content 3aseed yield 3asoil 3athiram 3aSaskatchewan1 aLafond, G.1 aJohnston, A.M.1 aMiller, P.R.1 aGill, K.S.1 aMay, W.E.1 aHogg, T.1 aJohnson, E.1 aBiederbeck, V.O.1 aNybo, B.0 tCanadian journal of plant science.g2002 Oct., v. 82, no. 4 p.645-661x0008-42207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/P01-1803Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjps.html3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03626naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126072001700144072001700161072001700178100002200195245011900217300002000336500016000356500001500516520161400531650001702145650001902162650001002181650002102191650002302212650002302235650001802258650001802276650002602294650001802320650002302338650001702361650002302378653001802401653002302419653004002442653002602482700002602508700002202534700002102556700002202577700002302599700002502622700002402647700002002671700001602691773014102707852000902848856008402857930003302941945002502974946001302999655001203012IND4434221120221118224924.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443422112DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2010.28450B2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The SCP was developed by a coalition of scientists and nutrition educators, experts with experience with dietary guidelines, public health organizations, and food manufacturers in response to consumer confusion over multiple front-of-the-package systems based on different criteria. Representatives from different government organizations acted as observers. The process of developing the program was facilitated by the nonprofit Keystone Center, an organization that develops consensus solutions to complex health and social policy changes. The nutrition criteria for receiving the SCP icon are specific for product category by indicating "smarter" products within that category. A calorie indicator noting calories per serving and servings per package accompanies the SCP icon to remind consumers that calories do count, even for smarter food choices. For a product to qualify, it first has to be below the threshold for "nutrients to limit" and then (in most cases) it must be above the threshold for one or more nutrients or food groups to encourage. The criteria are based on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines and other consensus science and are transparent and available on the SCP website. This article describes the nutrition criteria and rationales for their selection. 3asupermarkets 3aenergy content 3afoods 3anutrient content 3aDietary Guidelines 3aconsumer education 3ahealth policy 3afood industry 3anutrition information 3apublic policy 3ahealth information 3afood choices 3anutrition labeling 0apublic health 0aliterature reviews 0afront-of-package nutrition labeling 0aSmart Choices Program1 aBalentine, Douglas A.1 aBlack, Richard M.1 aHildwine, Regina1 aIvens, Barbara J.1 aKennedy, Eileen T.1 aPackard, Patricia T.1 aSperber, Bradley R.1 aSteffen, Daniel1 aStory, Mary0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Apr., v. 91, no. 4 p.1078S-1089SdAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2010.28450B3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle03413naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011100126300001600237500008900253500002400342520199400366650002402360650002302384650002502407650001502432650001702447650001702464650001002481650001002491650002002501650001902521650001002540650002102550650001902571650001402590650001702604650000902621650001002630650001002640700001602650700001502666700001602681700001702697773012202714852000902836856008602845655001202931IND4467721420221118224948.0130510s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446772142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCebolla, V.14aThe control of Verticillium dahliae on artichokes by chemical and non chemical soil disinfestation methods  ap. 473-478.  aPaper presented at the V International Congress on Artichoke, held in Tudela, Spain.  aIncludes references  aSince some years ago, the globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) crops of Benicarló, at the north of Valencian Country (Alcachofa de Benicarló, appellation of origin) frequently suffer a tracheomicotic syndrome produced by Verticillium dahliae. The fungus remains in the soil, after it is infested, for long periods of time and lasts even in rotations of crops intercalated between two successive of artichoke. The crop use to remain in the field for two consecutive seasons or even more, if it is allowed by the plant health condition. In order to study the effect of soil disinfestation for disease control several systems of soil disinfestation are compared, based on chemical systems like the successive application of 1,3-dichloropropene (Telone II emulsifiable) at 18 g/m(2) followed by metam-Na at 72 g/m(2), the mixture of 55.4% 1,3-dicholoropropene and 32.7% chloropicrin (Agrocelhone emulsifiable) at 40 g/m(2), all of them applied with the irrigation water, and physical methods like solarization with the addition of manure at 5Kg/m(2) or combined method like solarization with metam-Na at 72 g/m(2). Methyl bromide at 30 g/m(2) under VIF sheet and a non disinfested check was used. as reference. The studied parameters include, the biocidal effect in the soil and efficacy over weeds, plant vigour, yield in quantity and quality as well as mortality due to V. dahliae. Excellent results were reached, on the first season, with all the compared systems except the check which had a high mortality rate and heavy yield losses. The effects for wed control and plant vigour follow the same pattern. On the second season the results are similar to the first one, but some problem of plant death affected all the treatments. The studied systems for soil disinfestation ensures the healthiness and quality of crop at least by the first season, and facing the next phase out of methyl bromide as a consequence of Montreal Protocol, some chemical and physical alternatives are offered. 3a1,3-dichloropropene 3aCynara cardunculus 3aVerticillium dahliae 3aartichokes 3achloropicrin 3acrop quality 3acrops 3adeath 3adisease control 3adisinfestation 3afungi 3airrigation water 3amethyl bromide 3amortality 3aplant health 3asoil 3avigor 3aweeds1 aNavarro, C.1 aMiguel, A.1 aLlorach, S.1 aMontfort, P.0 tActa horticulturae.g2004 Oct., , no. 660 p.473-478dInternational Society for Horticultural Sciencex0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/660/660_71.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03886naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012600128300001600254500002400270520259300294650001002887650001702897650001102914650001202925650002002937650001802957650001102975650001202986650001802998650001003016650002203026650001403048650001203062650002403074650001503098650001403113650002603127650001403153650000903167650001903176650001903195651001903214700001503233700001903248700001703267773009903284852000903383655001203392IND4372469220221118224936.0050720e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437246922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRidder, N. de10aRevisiting a 'cure against land hunger': soil fertility management and farming systems dynamics in the West African Sahel  ap. 109-131.  aIncludes references  aAnalysis of agricultural production systems in West Africa at the end of the 1980s revealed that arable farming without external inputs would lead to expansion of arable land at the expense of grazing land. With increasing population and demand for cereals, fallow systems would change to permanent cultivation, with the risk of decline in soil fertility of both grazing and arable land. This development finally would lead to decreasing land productivity jeopardising food security. Despite this alarming picture, food security has improved in the last decades. This paper reviews literature in order to revisit the analysis by testing the following hypotheses: Decline of soil fertility over time is hard to estimate and to measure. Expected decline in soil fertility is counteracted by farmers through reallocation and intensified use of organic material produced within the system. As farming systems develop soil fertility is first managed through reallocation and intensified use of organic material and mineral fertilisers are only used when such options are exhausted. To test the first hypothesis nutrient budgets and the direct monitoring and measuring of soil fertility to detect changes in soil fertility are discussed. To evaluate the second and third hypotheses a possible pathway of development of farming systems is presented substantiated with supportive evidence. Nutrient budgets show negative trends in stocks, which are probably overestimated because lateral in- and outflows are scale-dependent, difficult to estimate and often ignored. Under farming conditions, decline in soil fertility can hardly be measured. Factors involved are inherent low soil fertility, heterogeneity of soils and highly variable soil fertility management in space and in time. However, at coarser scales, gradients in soil fertility are detected being a result of centripetal transport of organic material. In the schematic development pathway, soil fertility management practises follow the path from fallow, via intensifying recycling of nutrients combined with increased integration of livestock and arable farming to using external inputs. Spatial analysis shows that the different stages in development co-exist. It is concluded that the first analysis in the 1980s has overestimated the negative trends in soil fertility decline through increased use of organic material by increased labour use. However, current systems at many places will face a shift towards use of external inputs, i.e., fertilisers. This development is apparently only possible if market attractiveness permits. 3aSahel 3aarable soils 3afallow 3afarmers 3afarming systems 3afood security 3agrains 3agrazing 3agrazing lands 3alabor 3aland productivity 3alivestock 3amarkets 3amineral fertilizers 3amonitoring 3anutrients 3aproduction technology 3arecycling 3arisk 3asoil fertility 3aspace and time 3aWestern Africa1 aBreman, H.1 aKeulen, H. van1 aStomph, T.J.0 tAgricultural systems.g2004 May, v. 80, no. 2 p.109-131dElsevier Science Ltdx0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100002100139245009800160300001600258500002400274500001500298520133300313650002001646650001401666650001301680650001001693650001701703650002601720650001301746650001801759650001401777650000901791650002001800650002101820650001201841651002101853651001501874700001801889700001901907773007201926852000901998856007902007655001202086IND4467728720221118224942.0130513s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446772872DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc2013-0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlfaro, René I.10aDelivering Sitka spruce with resistance against white pine weevil in British Columbia, Canada  ap. 235-245.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis [Bong.] Carr) breeding program for resistance against the white pine weevil Pissodes strobi Peck (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is arguably one of the most successful pest resistance breeding programs for plantation forest species in North America, with a substantial proportion of the planting stock in BC and Washington State currently coming from this breeding program. Using conventional selection and breeding, and by screening Sitka spruce populations using artificial weevil infestations, we identified sources of heritable and stable weevil resistance. We also used this program to investigate potential causes behind this resistance and identified several heritable resistance mechanisms, including anatomical characteristics, such as constitutive resin canals and sclereid cells in the bark, terpene defenses and variation in tree phenology. We concluded that resistance is conferred by a suite of traits whose composition varies among resistant sources. In addition, we evaluated the efficiency of screening for resistance using weevil population enhancement as a screening method. Our results culminated in the establishment of seed orchards, and the availability of resistant seed that is contributing to the return of Sitka spruce as a species of choice in coastal British Columbia. 3aPissodes strobi 3aphenology 3abreeding 3atrees 3aresin canals 3aresistance mechanisms 3aplanting 3aseed orchards 3ascreening 3abark 3apest resistance 3aPicea sitchensis 3aforests 3aBritish Columbia 0aWashington1 aKing, John N.1 avanAkker, Lara0 tForestry chronicle.g2013 , v. 89, no. 2 p.235-245x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc2013-0423Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01753naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001900139245009200158300001600250500002400266520071800290650002501008650002901033650001201062650002101074650001501095650002201110650001801132650001201150651001101162700001701173700001901190700002201209773007201231852000901303856007901312655001201391IND4467728620221118225052.0130513s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446772862DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc2013-0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrozco, Nadine10aOregon's forest sector innovation system: An investigation towards advanced performance  ap. 225-234.  aIncludes references  aThe forest products industry has faced numerous challenges in remaining innovative: outside forces such as industry culture and policy provide few incentives while poor communication among industry actors impedes creative growth from within.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to prospectively evaluate whether the protective effect of soy is due to soy isoflavones alone or to their combination with other beneficial dietary factors in an Asian population. DESIGN: Using principal components analysis, we previously identified a "meat-dim sum" pattern characterized by meat, starch, and dim sum items and a "vegetable-fruit-soy" pattern characterized by cruciferous vegetables, fruit, and tofu items in a population-based cohort of Singapore Chinese initiated between 1993 and 1998. Component scores representing intakes of each pattern were used in multivariable Cox regression models to analyze the relation between diet at baseline and breast cancer incidence. RESULTS: As of 31 December 2005, 629 incident breast cancer cases had been diagnosed among the 34,028 women. With greater intake of the vegetable-fruit-soy dietary pattern, we observed a dose-dependent trend (P < 0.01) for decreasing breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women [hazard ratio (HR): 0.70; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.95 for the fourth compared with first quartile]. A stronger association for the vegetable-fruit-soy pattern was observed among postmenopausal women with ≥5 y of follow-up (HR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.36, 0.88; P for trend <0.01). No trend was observed for a greater intake of the meat-dim sum dietary pattern and increased breast cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that a diet characterized by vegetables, fruit, and soy has an early-acting protective effect on breast carcinogenesis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ameat products 3afood intake 3aisoflavones 3aChinese people 3awomen 3asoybean products 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3amenopause 3astarch 3adietary carbohydrate 3arisk factors 3avegetables 3arisk reduction 3abreast neoplasms 3adisease incidence 2aAged 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxtherapeutic use 2aAsian People. 2aBreast Neoplasmsxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aDiet 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aFruit 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aIsoflavonesxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPlant Extracts 2aPostmenopause 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aProspective Studies 2aRisk Factors 2aSoy Foods 2aSoybeansxchemistry 2aTreatment Outcome 2aVegetables 3aSingapore 0aSingaporexepidemiology. 0adiet 0adim sum 0afruits (food)1 aWu, Anna H.1 aWang, Renwei1 aKoh, Woon-Puay1 aYuan, Jian-Min1 aYu, Mimi C.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2010 Apr., v. 91, no. 4 p.1013-1019dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.285723Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/05  aOther US 7aarticle04922naa a2200997 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166072001700184072001700201100002000218245011800238300001800356500001500374506007600389520191200465506003702377650001302414650001102427650001502438650001102453650002302464650002002487650001802507650001402525650001102539650002302550650000902573650002902582650002002611650001102631650003202642650002602674650002302700650002602723650002302749650000902772650001502781650002402796650001602820650002102836650002202857650003102879650004702910650001602957650001802973650002102991650002803012650004303040650000903083650001703092650002803109650002403137650001103161650001103172650002903183650002003212650001803232650003403250650001503284650001203299650001503311650002903326651001203355651002703367653002103394700002403415700002503439700001803464700001803482700003403500700002603534700002703560700002303587773013903610852000903749856008303758930003303841945002503874946001303899655001203912IND4434220320221207110445.0100319e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443422032DNAL7 a201474742pmid7 aPMC28446842pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2009.280892doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the prevalence of zinc deficiency and anemia and their interrelation among low-income African American and Hispanic preschool children. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study in which a prospective 3-d food diary was completed, and hemoglobin, serum ferritin, zinc, copper, and C-reactive protein concentrations were measured. Children with elevated C-reactive protein concentrations were excluded from analysis. RESULTS: Of 292 children recruited, 280 (mean ± SD age: 2.5 ± 1.2 y) qualified for analysis. One hundred forty-six (52%) children were African American and 134 (48%) were Hispanic; 202 (72%) were enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children nutrition program. A low serum zinc concentration (<10.7 μmol/L) was present in 34 (12%) children, and 37 (13%) were anemic (hemoglobin < 110 g/L). African American (odds ratio: 3.47; 95% CI: 1.51, 7.96) and anemic (odds ratio: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.24, 6.90) children had an increased risk of zinc deficiency. Serum zinc correlated with hemoglobin (r = 0.24, P < 0.001). Children with a height/length less than the fifth percentile had significantly lower mean serum zinc concentrations than those with a height/length greater than the fifth percentile (12.4 ± 1.8 compared with 13.0 ± 2.2 μmol/L; P < 0.001). In a multiple logistic regression model, African American race-ethnicity was associated with zinc deficiency (odds ratio: 0.26; P = 0.02). The main sources of iron and zinc in the diets were meat products and cereals. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of zinc deficiency and anemia was high in this population of low-income minority children, especially among African Americans. Further investigation of the incidence of zinc deficiency and the ability of anemia to screen for it is warranted.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aferritin 3aheight 3aprevalence 3aBlacks 3apreschool children 3achild nutrition 3ameat products 3aHispanics 3aanemia 3aC-reactive protein 3airon 3adietary nutrient sources 3adietary surveys 3acopper 3aanthropometric measurements 3anutrient deficiencies 3aethnic differences 3alow income households 3anutritional status 3azinc 3ahemoglobin 3adeficiency diseases 3agrain foods 3adietary minerals 3adisease incidence 2aBlack or African American. 2aAnemia, Iron-Deficiencyxbloodxethnology. 2aBody Height 2aEdible Grain. 2aChild, Preschool 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDeficiency Diseasesxbloodxethnology. 2aDiet 2aDiet Records 2aHemoglobinsxmetabolism 2aHispanic or Latino. 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aIronxbloodxdeficiency. 2aLogistic Models 2aMeat Products 2aNutritional Statusxethnology 2aOdds Ratio 2aPoverty 2aPrevalence 2aZincxbloodxdeficiency. 3aGeorgia 0aGeorgiaxepidemiology. 0aanemia (disease)1 aGrant, Frederick K.1 aSwaby-Ellis, E.

Sea cucumbers with a mean wet body weight of 8.0 ± 1.2 g (mean ± SD) were allocated to each treatment randomly with five replicates. After a 38-day trial, specific growth rate (SGR) and food conversion efficiency (FCE) decreased with increasing temperature in constant-temperature treatments. Among the four modes of temperature fluctuation, SGR of sea cucumbers reared under a mode which simulated the natural fluctuation of the temperature (mode C) of seawater was significantly higher than that of sea cucumbers reared at the corresponding constant temperatures. This enhancement of growth rate by use of mode C was attributed to higher FCE and lower energy allocated to respiration and feces. In large-scale culture, a temperature-control mode designed based on mode C could enhance not only growth but also efficiency of food utilization by the young sea cucumber. 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aaquaculture 3abody weight 3aenergy 3afeces 3afood conversion 3afoods 3arearing 3aseawater 3atemperature1 aDong, Yun-Wei1 aDong, Shuang-Lin0 tAquaculture international.g2009 Oct., v. 17, no. 5 p.459-467dSpringer Netherlandsx0967-61207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-008-9216-4 7aarticle02906naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245017200195300001600367520115300383650001701536650001001553650001201563650005301575650005101628650004901679650003501728650006501763650005001828650005001878650001101928650002501939650004401964650005802008650000902066650002902075653000902104700002002113700002102133773013702154852000902291856009202300930003302392946001102425655001202436IND4411138020221118224636.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441113802DNAL7 a187931972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1574-695X.2008.00473.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoodman, Michael E.10aProduction of outer surface protein A by Borrelia burgdorferi during transmission from infected mammals to feeding ticks is insufficient to trigger OspA seroconversion  ap. 277-282.  aThe Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, produces two outer surface lipoproteins, OspA and OspB, that are essential for colonization of tick vectors. Both proteins are highly expressed during transmission from infected mammals to feeding ticks and during colonization of tick midguts, but are repressed when bacteria are transmitted from ticks to mammals. Humans and other infected mammals generally do not produce antibodies against either protein, although some Lyme disease patients do seroconvert and produce antibodies against OspA for unknown reasons. We hypothesized that, if such patients had been fed upon by additional ticks, bacteria moving from the patients' bodies to the feeding ticks would have produced OspA and OspB proteins, which then led to immune system recognition and antibody production. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing immune responses of infected mice following feedings by additional Ixodes scapularis ticks. However, results of the present studies demonstrate that expression of OspA and OspB by B. burgdorferi during transmission from infected mammals to feeding ticks does not trigger seroconversion. 3aLyme disease 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aAntigens, Bacterialxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aAntigens, Surfacexbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aArachnid Vectorsxmicrobiology 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aBacterial Vaccinesxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aBorrelia burgdorferiximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aIxodesxmicrobiology 2aLipoproteinsxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aLyme Diseaseximmunologyxmicrobiologyxtransmission. 2aMice 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 0aOspA1 aCooley, Anne E.1 aStevenson, Brian0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2008 Nov., v. 54, no. 2 p.277-282dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2008.00473.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01714naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245009200143300001600235520058200251650001600833650000800849650002500857650002300882650002700905650001300932650002600945650002500971650001000996650002201006650001801028650001301046650002501059650002401084653002801108700002001136773009501156852000901251939003301260946001101293655001201304IND9205062920221118224640.0920811e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920506292DNAL7 a13102912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranco, R.10aTheoretical study about the variability of the genome of foot-and-mouth disease viruses  ap. 325-329.  aThe possibilities of change in amino acids of a protein are discussed in terms of a point mutation.

On basis of these considerations, the genome from 5 strains (CSP, C3Ind, O1K, A10 and A12) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus was studied.

The effectiveness of such biomanipulation as a lake management option could be compromised if removed fish are rapidly replaced by large-scale immigration from a connected lake.2.Stable isotope analysis (SIA) was used to examine the migrations of perch (Perca fluviatilis L.) and roach (Rutilus rutilus (L.)) between two connected lakes in central Finland, Jyväsjärvi and the larger Päijänne. Baseline δ¹⁵N signatures in primary consumers were significantly higher in Jyväsjärvi and this difference was reflected further up the food chain in fish.3.Spring fish spawning migrations from Päijänne resulted in a significant decrease in mean δ¹⁵N signatures of both perch and roach in the adjacent part of Jyväsjärvi, but by summer these mean δ¹⁵N signatures in fish muscle tissue had increased again to match those in the rest of the lake. δ¹³C signatures of both fish species were more variable and were of less value for tracking fish migrations.4.A robust discriminant analysis was used to classify perch and roach caught from Jyväsjärvi into fish originating from either Jyväsjärvi or Päijänne. The greatest proportions of immigrant perch and roach in Jyväsjärvi were observed in spring 2004 (71% and 56%), when biomanipulation of Jyväsjärvi had started. Immigrant fish percentages in the following spring were considerably lower (24% and 14%, respectively), most likely dueto effective biomanipulation.5.Results indicate that the current biomanipulation has decreased the extent of the spring migration, and that immigrant fish have not significantly repopulated Jyväsjärvi after the intense fishing. More generally, the data illustrate how stable isotopes offer the possibility to track migrations of common fish species between adjacent freshwater lakes. 3aPerca fluviatilis 3aRutilus rutilus 3adiscriminant analysis 3afood chain 3alakes 3amigratory behavior 3amuscle tissues 3aperch 3aspawning 3aspring 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3awater management 3awater quality1 aKeskinen, Tapio1 aHämäläinen, Heikki.1 aKarjalainen, Juha1 aJones, R.

Filarial enzyme showed Km value of 3.33 mM for ATP as computed from the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot. The enzyme could be completely solubilized by sonication with about 4-fold increase in specific activity of the enzyme. The enzyme showed about 2-fold activation by the calmodulin fractions isolated from S. cervi and rat brain homogenates. The enzyme was highly sensitive to inhibition with some phenothiazine derivatives. Trifluoperazine was observed to be the most potent inhibitor followed by promethazine and chlorpromazine. Some antheimintics viz. diethycarbamazine and centperazine were found to be highly potent inhibitors of the enzyme, significant inhibition of filarial Ca2+-ATPase was also observed with levamisol and suramine. Studies indicate Ca2+-ATPase of S. cervi as a potential chemotherapeutic target. 3adiethylcarbamazine 3acalcium 3achlorpromazine 3atrifluoperazine 3aenzyme activity 3aphenothiazine 3aSetaria cervi 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3ainorganic ions 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxpharmacology 2aCalcium Chloridexpharmacology 2aCalcium-Transporting ATPasesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCalmodulinxmetabolism 2aEgtazic Acidxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFilarioideaxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aKinetics 2aPhenothiazinesxpharmacology 2aSetariasis 2aSolubility 0aanthelmintics 0acentperazine1 aShukla, O.P.1 aTekwani, B.L.0 tInternational journal of biochemistry.g1992 Sept., v. 24, no. 9 p.1447-1452x0020-711X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03797naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100002600163245010200189300001800291500001500309520173700324650001902061650002702080650001002107650000802117650001002125650001502135650002502150650002402175650002302199650003002222650002002252650001202272650002002284650001002304650003702314650006502351650004402416650002002460650005502480650003802535650001102573650001102584650002202595650000902617650001602626650002402642650002702666650001602693650004202709653001202751653001802763700002302781700002402804700002102828700001802849700002202867773013002889852000903019930003303028945002503061946001303086655001203099IND4411223520221118224859.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441122352DNAL7 a188427992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAlatalo, Päivikki I.10aEffect of moderate alcohol consumption on liver enzymes increases with increasing body mass index  ap. 1097-1103.  a2019-12-04  aBACKGROUND:Although both ethanol consumption and overweight alter the activities of hepatic enzymes in circulation, the differentiation of an alcohol or nonalcohol basis for such changes remains problematic. The magnitude of alterations occurring among moderate drinkers has remained obscure. OBJECTIVE:We examined the links between moderate ethanol consumption, body mass index (BMI; in kg/m²), and liver enzymes. DESIGN:Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) were recorded from 2164 apparently healthy participants (1028 men, 1136 women) reporting either no alcohol (abstainers) or <40 g ethanol consumption per day (moderate drinkers). The study population was further classified according to BMI as follows: <19 (underweight), greater-than-or-equal19 and <25 (normal weight), greater-than-or-equal25 and <30 (overweight), and greater-than-or-equal30 (obese). RESULTS:Serum ALT (P < 0.05) and GGT (P < 0.001) but not AST (P = 0.805) activities in moderate drinkers were higher than those in abstainers. For all enzymes, a significant main effect was observed of increasing BMI, which was more striking in moderate drinkers than in abstainers. Tests of between-subjects effects indicated significant interactions with sex and drinking status, although not with sex and BMI. CONCLUSIONS:The effect of moderate alcohol consumption on liver enzymes increases with increasing BMI. These findings should be considered in the clinical assessment of overweight alcohol consumers and in the definition of normal ranges for liver enzymes. These results may also help to develop new approaches for examining patients with fatty liver induced by either ethanol or adiposity. 3aliver function 3aaspartate transaminase 3aliver 3amen 3awomen 3aoverweight 3aalanine transaminase 3aalcoholic beverages 3agender differences 3agamma-glutamyltransferase 3abody mass index 3aethanol 3aenzyme activity 2aAdult 2aAlanine Transaminasexmetabolism 2aAlcohol Drinkingxadverse effectsxepidemiologyxmetabolism. 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aEthanolxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aFatty Liver, Alcoholicxdiagnosis 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxmetabolism 2aOverweightxmetabolism 2aSex Factors 2agamma-Glutamyltransferasexmetabolism 0aenzymes 0aliver enzymes1 aKoivisto, Heidi M.1 aHietala, Johanna P.1 aPuukka, Katri S.1 aBloigu, Risto1 aNiemelä, Onni J.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2008 Oct., v. 88, no. 4 p.1097-1103dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/11/30  aOther US 7aarticle03334naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245007400143300001600217520165900233650001501892650000901907650002701916650001701943650002601960650003701986650000902023650001502032650003202047650001202079650004302091650003902134650005002173650004602223650002102269650001202290650002102302650000902323650004902332650002902381650000902410650002502419650002902444650003302473653001802506700001402524700001802538700001502556700001602571700001602587700002802603773008302631939003302714852000902747655001202756IND9200012420221118225033.0920109e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920001242DNAL7 a18566082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirose, N.10aInhibition of cholesterol absorption and synthesis in rats by sesamin  ap. 629-638.  aThe effects of sesamin, a lignan from sesame oil, on various aspects of cholesterol metabolism were examined in rats maintained on various dietary regimens. When given at a dietary level of 0.5% for 4 weeks, sesamin reduced the concentration of serum and liver cholesterol significantly irrespective of the presence or absence of cholesterol in the diet, except for one experiment in which the purified diet free of cholesterol was given. On feeding sesamin, there was a decrease in lymphatic absorption of cholesterol accompanying an increase in fecal excretion of neutral, but not acidic, steroids, particularly when the cholesterol-enriched diet was given. Sesamin inhibited micellar solubility of cholesterol, but not bile acids, whereas it neither bound taurocholate nor affected the absorption of fatty acids. Only a marginal proportion (ca. 0.15%) of sesamin administered intragastrically was recovered in the lymph. There was a significant reduction in the activity of liver microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase after feeding sesamin, although the activity of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, drug metabolizing enzymes, and alcohol dehydrogenase remained uninfluenced. Although the weight and phospholipid concentration of the liver increased unequivocally on feeding sesamin, the histological examination by microscopy showed no abnormality, and the activity of serum GOT and GPT remained unchanged. Since sesamin lowered both serum and liver cholesterol levels by inhibiting absorption and synthesis of cholesterol simultaneously, it deserves further study as a possible hypocholesterolemic agent of natural origin. 3asesame oil 3adiet 3acholesterol metabolism 3abiosynthesis 3aintestinal absorption 3acholesterol 7alpha-monooxygenase 3arats 2aAbsorption 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAnimals 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxpharmacology 2aAspartate Aminotransferasesxblood 2aCholesterolxbiosynthesisxbloodxmetabolism. 2aDioxolesxbloodxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aFecesxchemistry 2aLignans 2aLymphxchemistry 2aMale 2aMicrosomes, Liverxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aOrgan Sizexdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred Strains 2aSesame Oilxpharmacology 2aTaurocholic Acidxmetabolism 0asesame lignan1 aInoue, T.1 aNishihara, K.1 aSugano, M.1 aAkimoto, K.1 aShimizu, S.1 aYamada, Hitoshi,d1955-0 tJournal of lipid research.g1991 Apr., v. 32, no. 4 p.629-638x0022-22757nnas  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aDNAL 7aarticle02073naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245016800122300001600290520099400306650002601300650001101326650001101337650001301348650002101361650001601382650002501398650002301423650002401446650002301470650001601493650002201509700001401531700001501545773008401560852000901644939003301653946001301686655001201699IND9200011720221118224928.0920109e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920001172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, R.10aRole of environmental thermal fluctuation in seasonal variation of fatty acid composition of total lipid in fatbody of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana (Linn.)  ap. 211-215.  aThe fatty acid composition of total lipid in the fatbody of male, female and nymphal cockroach, Periplaneta americana (Linn.), changes in response to seasonal alterations in environmental temperature. The compensatory mechanisms employed in cold adaptation, either in winter-acclimatized insects or 16 degrees C-acclimated summer roaches, include an increase in the level of unsaturated fatty acids and a decrease in the level of saturated fatty acids. In the warm, either during the summer or during the 32 degrees C acclimation of winter insects, the content of unsaturated fatty acids fell and the level of saturated fatty acids rose. Thus temperature seems to play an important role in seasonal variation of lipid metabolism in the fatbody of cockroach. A sexual dimorphism is also discernible in this insect with respect to the fatty acid composition of total lipid of fatbody either during seasonal acclimatization in nature or during thermal acclimation under laboratory conditions. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3anymphs 3aadults 3afat body 3alipid metabolism 3afatty acids 3achemical composition 3agender differences 3aambient temperature 3aseasonal variation 3aacclimation 3asexual dimorphism1 aDas, A.B.1 aFarkas, T.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g1991 July, v. 16, no. 4 p.211-215x0306-45657nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02249naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166100001700183245014600200300001600346520065300362650001401015650001601029650003601045650001901081650002601100650002901126650002701155650002601182650001101208650002101219650002201240650002501262650001601287651002101303653002701324653001801351653004401369700001601413700001501429700001401444700001701458773008701475852000901562856008901571930003301660945002501693946001301718655001201731IND4434039620221118224851.0100315e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443403962DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2010.97002992doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Imidacloprid treated sugar beet seed was sown in two undisturbed soil monoliths (1.0 m2 surface area, 1.1 m depth) of sandy loam on April 1991 and 1994. The application rate was 1.3 mg active ingredient/pellet (9 pellet/m2) corresponding to about 120 g/hectare each. In the other years cereals were grown. Data/results were gathered during the five years on 1) weather, 2) occurance, volumes, radioactive residues of leachate, 3) yields, residues in the harvested crops, 4) distribution of residues in the soil monoliths at the end of the study, 5) material balance and calculation of portion mineralized to 14CO2. This study confirms the low mobility of imidacloprid and its degradation products in soil under practice-relevant field conditions. Following the use of imidacloprid in the recommended manner the possibility of contamination of deeper soil layers and groundwater can be excluded. 3asoil physics 3asoil chemistry 3aagrochemicals 3apesticides 0asoil science0 tLysimeter concept : environmental behavior of pesticides.dWashington, DC : American Chemical Society : Distributed by Oxford University Press, c1998.7nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02067naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072001700149072001700166100001800183245011500201300001600316520065900332650001300991650001701004650001301021650003601034650001901070650002301089650002601112650001501138653002001153653001601173653001901189653002101208653002101229653001301250653001801263700001701281700001601298700001501314773008701329852000901416856008901425930003301514945002501547946001301572655001201585IND4434039720221118224736.0100315e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443403972DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2010.97003002doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The oil of the aerial parts had 1,8-cineole (10.5%), α-humulene (21.7%), farnesyl acetate (11.2%), β-caryophyllene (9.9%) and selin-11-en-4-ol (8.9%) as the major components, while the rhizome oil was dominated by 1,8-cineole (12.7%) and cyperene (11.34%) and E,E-farnesol (5.5%). This analyses, especially that of the rhizome oil, suggest another chemotype of K. erecta from the known predominant cyperene-type. 3aKyllinga 3aaerial parts 3arhizomes 3achemical constituents of plants 3aessential oils 3abeta-caryophyllene 3aquantitative analysis 3achemotypes 0aKyllinga erecta 0a1,8-cineole 0aalpha-humulene 0afarnesyl acetate 0aselin-11-en-4-ol 0acyperene 0aE,E-farnnesol1 aMdlolo, C.M.1 aAdeniyi, B.1 aAkinde, T.0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2010 , v. 22, no. 2 p.189-192x1041-29057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2010.97003003Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle01937naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245015800127300001600285520095000301650001901251650001101270650001501281650001701296650001601313650001501329650002701344650002601371650001501397653001301412700002101425773007501446852000901521930003301530945001301563946001101576655001201587IND2203391420221118224752.0000328e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220339142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, S.P.10aField-simulator study of insecticide resistance conferred by esterase-, MACE- and kdr-based mechanisms in the peach-potato aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer)  ap. 810-814.  aInsecticide sprays were applied to Myzus persicae (Sulzer) populations carrying various combinations of three insecticide resistance mechanisms (esterase-based metabolic resistance and two target site mechanisms, known as MACE and kdr), supported on host plants growing in field simulator cages. The study showed that MACE confers extreme resistance to pirimicarb and triazamate (carbamate insecticides) but not to deltamethrin + heptenophos (16 + 1) (Decisquick) or dimethoate (an organophosphorus insecticide). Resistance to dimethoate depends solely on levels of esterase-based resistance, while resistance to Decisquick depends on kdr and esterase. None of the four insecticides is effective against aphids carrying MACE combined with extreme esterase-based resistance. This knowledge, in association with current monitoring of the mechanisms, will play an important role in making decisions on insecticide use against M. persicae in the UK. 3aMyzus persicae 3aclones 3apirimicarb 3adeltamethrin 3aheptenophos 3adimethoate 3ainsecticide resistance 3aresistance mechanisms 3atriazamate 0aefficacy1 aDevonshire, A.L.0 tPesticide science.g1999 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.810-814x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle03218naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072001700165072001700182072001700199100002300216245011600239300001600355500001500371520121900386592002801605650002101633650002001654650001301674650000801687650001301695650001701708650001601725650001101741650001701752650001801769650002401787650001901811650001001830650001301840650004801853650002001901650004301921650002401964650002501988650001102013650000902024650003502033650003102068650002002099650001602119653003202135653002102167653001302188700002202201773013402223852000902357856008602366930003302452945002502485946001102510990002302521655001202544IND4434041620221118224705.0100315e20090501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443404162DNAL7 a202094682pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.79.3.1732doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Twenty-two young (mean age, 22.2 ± 2.7 years) male soccer players were allocated to two randomly assigned groups in a placebo-controlled, double-blind design. Subjects in the pyruvate group orally ingested tablets that contained pyruvate at a dose of 2 g per day in two equal doses for 4 weeks. There were no statistically significant changes in weight and body-mass index (BMI) within or between groups (p>0.05) after the supplementation protocol. Percentage of body fat decreased similarly in both pyruvate and placebo groups after the supplementation protocol (p>0.05). There were no changes in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), arm fat index (AFI), and total or regional muscle mass within or between groups (p>0.05). No subject reported any side effects from pyruvate or placebo treatment. The results of the present study indicate that supplementation with pyruvate during training does not significantly alter the body mass, fat, and muscle mass in healthy trained men. Pyruvate supplementation appears to be ineffective as a fat loss strategy in young athletes.  aPublisher supplied data 3asubcutaneous fat 3abody mass index 3aexercise 3amen 3aathletes 3apyruvic acid 3abody weight 3adosage 3ayoung adults 3aacute effects 3adietary supplements 3alean body mass 2aAdult 2aAthletes 2aBody Compositionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weightxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aExercisexphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOxygen Consumptionxphysiology 2aPyruvic Acidxpharmacology 2aWaist-Hip Ratio 2aYoung Adult 0aanthropometric measurements 0abody composition 0abody fat1 aAhmetovic, Zlatko0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2009 May 1, v. 79, no. 3 p.173-179dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.79.3.1733Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/19  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02010naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011600128300001600244520109000260650001501350650001301365650001701378650002001395650001501415650001001430650000901440650001501449700001701464700001901481700001901500773007501519852000901594930003301603945001301636946001101649655001201660IND2203391720221118224703.0000328e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220339172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaydenova, Z.10aEffect of s-triazine and phenoxyalkanoic acid herbicides on UDP-glucuronosyltransferase in rat liver microsomes  ap. 825-830.  aTwelve herbicides, representatives of two chemical groups, substituted phenoxyalkanoic acids and s-triazines, were tested for their inhibitory effect on the glucuronidation of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), phenolphthalein (PPh) and 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) by rat liver microsomes. One millimole MCPA, ametryn and cyanazine significantly decreased PPh UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity, while propazine was found to be a most potent inhibitor of 4-NP glucuronidation. Concentrations of 0.1 mM dichlorprop and cyanazine were still inhibitory against PPh-UGT. The inhibition of 4-MU glucuronidation by the herbicides was low and not specific. As a whole, s-triazine derivatives were more inhibitory than the substituted phenoxyalkanoic acids. Kinetic studies with propazine revealed a non-competitive type of inhibition towards the acceptor substrate 4-NP, with an apparent K(i) value of 0.540 mM. With ametryn, an uncompetitive type of inhibition against PPh and a mixed type of inhibition towards UDPGA were found, with apparent K(i) values of 0.330 mM and 0.380 mM, respectively. 3aherbicides 3atoxicity 3atransferases 3aenzyme activity 3amicrosomes 3aliver 3arats 3atoxicology1 aKrauss, G.J.1 aGolovinsky, E.1 aGrancharov, K.0 tPesticide science.g1999 Aug., v. 55, no. 8 p.825-830x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02968naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013500145300001600280520173000296650001002026650001302036650001802049650000702067650002002074650002102094650001202115650001802127650001202145650003102157650001502188650003302203650002502236650001002261650003102271700001502302700001402317700001802331700001702349773010102366852000902467939003302476946001302509655001202522IND9200008820221118224843.0920106e19910815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000882DNAL7 a18980592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshikawa, K.14aThe pH dependence of the action pattern in porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase-catalyzed reaction for maltooligosaccharide substrates  ap. 124-129.  aPorcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1; abbreviated PPA), which hydrolyzes alpha-D-(1,4) glucosidic bonds in starch and amylose, displays an optimum at pH 6.9 for the majority of substrates. The optimum pH, however, shifted to 5.2 for the hydrolysis of some low molecular substrates (Ishikawa, K., et al., 1990, Biochemistry 29, 7119-7123). Details of the substrate-dependent shift of the optimum pH in PPA were studied by use of a series of maltooligosaccharides with 14C-labeled reducing end glucose as substrates. The optimum pH for maltotriose was 5.2, whereas that for maltopentaose and maltohexaose was unchanged at pH 6.9. The pH profile for the intermediate size substrate maltotetraose showed abnormality; the apparent optimum pH was broadened between 5.5 and 6.5 and the bond cleavage pattern depended on pH, unlike that for the other substrates examined. These results were independent of either buffer systems or substrate concentration. Analyses of the hydrolysates of the maltooligosaccharides revealed that the shift of the optimum pH to the neutral region occurred only when the fifth subsite of PPA in the productive binding modes was occupied by a glucosyl residue of a substrate. The three-catalytic residue model of PPA deduced from the analysis of the hydrolysis of some modified maltooligosaccharides (p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-maltoside, gamma-cyclodextrin, maltopentaitol, and maltohexaitol) (Ishikawa, K., et al., 1990, Biochemistry 29, 7119-7123) was successfully adapted to the linear maltooligosaccharides used in this work. These results indicate that the different productive binding modes of the linear oligosaccharide substrates affect directly the catalytic power and the optimum pH of PPA. 3aswine 3apancreas 3aalpha-amylase 3apH 3aenzyme activity 3aoligosaccharides 2aAnimals 2aBinding Sites 2aBuffers 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aHydrolysis 2aOligosaccharidesxmetabolism 2aPancreasxenzymology 2aSwine 2aalpha-Amylasesxmetabolism1 aMatsui, I.1 aHonda, K.1 aKobayashi, S.1 aNakatani, H.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g1991 Aug. 15, v. 289, no. 1 p.124-129x0003-98617nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02071naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245016700127300001600294500001500310520093700325650002601262650003401288650003901322650002801361650002301389650001201412650003101424650001801455653001801473700001201491700001501503700001701518700001601535773009301551852000901644939003301653946001101686655001201697IND9200007620221118224901.0920106e199008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVandamme, P.10aIntra- and interspecific relationships of veterinary campylobacters revealed by numerical analysis of electrophoretic protein profiles and DNA: DNA hybridizations  ap. 295-303.  a2019-12-04  aThe intra- and interspecific relationships of Campylobacter mucosalis and Campylobacter hyointestinalis were studied by numerical analysis of gel electrophoretic protein profiles, DNA: DNA hybridizations and determinations of the DNA base compositions.

C. mucosalis strains, representing the different serotypes within this species, also showed high DNA binding values (> 73%) and had similar percentage G + C values (36.0 to 37.4 mol%). Several protein electrophoretic types within both species could be distinguished visually as well as by numerical analysis of the protein profiles.

  1 aPokharel, Yuba Raj10aIncreased Ubiquitination of Multidrug Resistance 1 by Ginsenoside Rd  ap. 252-259.  a2019-12-04  aMCF-7/ADR cells, a doxorubicin-resistant human breast cancer cell line, acquires resistance to several chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracylines and taxol, via overexpression of the multidrug resistance1 (MDR1) gene. The present study was designed to clarify whether ginsenosides affect the expression of the MDR1 gene in MCF-7/ADR cells. Ginsenoside Rd, Re, Rb1, and Rg1 (100 μ g/ml) decreased MDR1 protein levels in MCF-7/ADR cells. In particular, ginsenoside Rd most potently inhibited MDR1 protein expression without cytotoxicity, but did not change mRNA levels or nuclear levels of key transcriptional factors for MDR1 gene expression, hypoxia inducible factor-1, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein β, Forkhead box-containing protein, O subfamily1, or Y-box binding protein-1. Reporter gene analyses showed that ginsenoside Rd did not decrease MDR1 gene transcription or the pregnane X receptor reporter. MDR1 protein stability is dependent on ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. We further found that ginsenosides Rd increased ubiquitination of MDR1. Moreover, doxorubicin resistance in MCF-7/ADR cells was reversed by ginsenoside Rd treatment. These results propose that ginseng administration with other anti-cancer agents may be useful for the treatment of chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer through down-regulating MDR1 protein. 3atriterpenoid saponins 3adrug therapy 3achemical constituents of plants 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3aplant extracts 3amedicinal plants 3ahypoxia 3aABC transporters 3amultiple drug resistance 3aherbal medicines 3ahuman cell lines 3agene overexpression 3acell culture 3acarcinoma 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aPanax ginseng 3areporter genes 3afibroblasts 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aBreast Neoplasms 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aDoxorubicin 2aDrug Resistancexdrug effects 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGinsenosidesxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1xanalysisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aUbiquitinationxdrug effects 0agenes 0atriterpenoids 0aglycosides 0achemotherapy1 aKim, Nak Doo1 aHan, Hyo-Kyung1 aOh, Won Keun1 aKang, Keon Wook0 tNutrition and cancer.g2010 , v. 62, no. 2 p.252-259x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355809034071713Available from publisher's Web site  a20100410b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/09  aOther US 7aarticle04055naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001800215245007000233300001600303500001500319520150300334650002101837650002001858650001101878650003001889650001001919650001201929650001901941650001901960650001401979650002801993650001802021650000902039650001202048650002302060650001602083650002202099650001802121650002202139650001702161650003602178650002102214650006502235650001202300650004002312650001402352650004002366650001802406650003202424650001102456650003002467650002902497650007102526650006002597650003202657650000902689650003002698650005702728653001702785653001802802700002002820700001902840700002102859700002102880700002002901700002002921700002102941773007402962852000903036856008503045930003303130945002503163946001303188655001203201IND4434057220221118224625.0100316e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443405722DNAL7 a200991982pmid7 a10.1080/016355809033052842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRossini, Anna10aInfluence of Lignans Depletion on Murine Mammary Gland Morphology  ap. 237-242.  a2019-12-04  aDifferent studies have focused on the effects of phytoestrogens-supplemented diets on mammary gland morphogenesis and breast cancer risk; however, particular dieting behaviors and food choices may result in a reduction of the natural source of phytoestrogens. The evaluation of a reduced phytoestrogens intake effect by depletion without modifying other dietary ingredients is hard. Since lignans, the largest contributors to phytoestrogens intake in Western diets, are metabolized into bioactive compounds by gut bacteria, long-term antibiotic treatments, inducing intestinal microflora disruption, may reduce enterolactone availability. To elucidate the effect of phytoestrogens lack on mammary tissue morphogenesis, female FVB mice were treated with gentamicin or metronidazole/ciprofloxacin from the age of 6 to 7 wk. After 21 wk, enterolactone urine levels were 120.07 ± 20.5 ng/ml in untreated mice, 30.4 ± 24.46 ng/ml in metronidazole/ciprofloxacin-treated mice, and 3.29 ± 4.38 ng/ml in gentamicin-treated mice. Histological analysis revealed no significant alterations of mammary morphology in metronidazole/ciprofloxacin-treated mice, whereas gentamicin-treated mice showed increase of ducts number and duct-tree branching vs. controls. These findings indicate that normal mammary tissue size and shape are maintained even in the presence of low levels of lignans and suggest that only a complete depletion of these compounds induced significant alterations of mammary gland structure. 3aepithelial cells 3aplant estrogens 3aadults 3aintestinal microorganisms 3awomen 3adieting 3amammary glands 3awild relatives 3aapoptosis 3aepidemiological studies 3amorphogenesis 3amice 3alignans 3acell proliferation 3aantibiotics 3along term effects 3aanimal models 3aplant-based foods 3afood choices 3achemical constituents of plants 3abreast neoplasms 2a4-Butyrolactonexanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesisxurine. 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosis 2aBacteriaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCell Division 2aCiprofloxacinxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGentamicinsxpharmacology 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aLignansxadministration & dosagexbiosynthesisxmetabolismxurine. 2aMammary Glands, Animalxcytologyxgrowth & development. 2aMetronidazolexpharmacology 2aMice 2aMorphogenesisxphysiology 2aPhytoestrogensxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 0aphytosterols 0aeating habits1 aZanobbio, Laura1 aPalazzo, Marco1 aSfondrini, Lucia1 aMorelli, Daniele1 aTagliabue, Elda1 aBalsari, Andrea1 aRumio, Cristiano0 tNutrition and cancer.g2010 , v. 62, no. 2 p.237-242x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355809033052843Available from publisher's Web site  a20100410b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/09  aOther US 7aarticle02881naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001300136245013500149300001600284500002400300500001500324520165600339650001801995650001502013650001102028650002202039650002302061650002002084650002402104650001902128650001102147650001502158650001702173651001002190653001402200700001702214700002402231700001902255700001702274773010802291852000902399856003902408655001202447IND4433679620221118224638.0100305e20100315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443367962DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.75092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xi10aSimulating the integrated effects of topography and soil properties on runoff generation in hilly forested catchments, South China  ap. 714-725.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEstimation of runoff components associated with catchment topography and soil properties is critical for planning water resources utilization and evaluating hydrological changes due to artificially induced land surface manipulation. In this study, the modified TOPMODEL by Scanlon et al. (2000) was applied to simulate runoff-generating processes and to separate runoff components in two hilly forested catchments within the Dongjiang Basin of Southeast China. The modified TOPMODEL was improved by integrating an evapotranspiration package with the model algorithms. Influences of catchment topography and soil properties on runoff generation were analysed on the basis of explicit expression of catchment field capacity distribution derived from the topographic index and catchment average field capacity. Study results demonstrate that the model is capable of simulating hydrological processes and separate hydrological components in both hourly and daily time steps. Total runoff generation primarily depends on the effective storage capacity of unsaturated zone. A 50% decrease of the effective storage capacity from 0·22 to 0·11 m over the soil zone leads to a 6·6% increase in total runoff. Topography plays a dominant role in formation of runoff components. When the catchment mean slope increases by 87%, subsurface storm flow could increase by 50% whilst overland flow decreases by 7·5% and baseflow by 6·7%. Vertical changes of soil permeability influence runoff components as well. Decrease of the lower layer hydraulic transmissivity may result in 2-3% increase of overland flow and subsurface storm flow and 5% decrease of baseflow. 3aoverland flow 3atopography 3abasins 3asimulation models 3aevapotranspiration 3asubsurface flow 3aforested watersheds 3afield capacity 3arunoff 3aalgorithms 3apermeability 3aChina 0awater use1 aCheng, Qinbo1 aChen, Yongqin David1 aSmettem, Keith1 aXu, Chong-Yu0 tHydrological processes.g2010 Mar. 15, v. 24, no. 6 p.714-725dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.7509 7aarticle04687naa a2200913 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001900215245007000234300001600304500001500320520198200335650002202317650002002339650001902359650003402378650002102412650001502433650001002448650001702458650001402475650002802489650002102517650002202538650002902560650001702589650002502606650002302631650001202654650001902666650002202685650001402707650001202721650001602733650003602749650001502785650002302800650003002823650002802853650002402881650002902905650003202934650002102966650003202987650004803019650002303067650002303090650002203113650002303135650002103158650001103179650005203190650004503242650001803287650002603305650002703331651001103358653001603369653003603385700001803421700001903439700002303458700002003481700002103501773007403522852000903596856008503605930003303690945002503723946001303748655001203761IND4434057020221118224621.0100316e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443405702DNAL7 a200991972pmid7 a10.1080/016355809033053672doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

However, the effect of LFE treatment on the growth of colorectal cancer cells has not been evaluated. This study investigated the effect of LFE on two colorectal cancer cell lines, SW-480 and Colo 320DM, and the possible mechanisms involved. LFE-treated cells were assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion, for in vitro tumorigenesis by seeding cells in soft agar to allow anchorage independent growth, for cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry, for loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by rhodamine 123 staining, for increased apoptosis by DNA fragmentation assay, and for changes in the levels of proteins involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis by immunoblotting. LFE (25-400 μg/ml) could inhibit proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The cell cycle of both LFE-treated cell lines showed obvious S phase block. Western blotting further showed the S phase block in these two cell lines was mainly due to cyclin E accumulation and cyclin A decrease. LFE treatment increased rhodamine 123-negative cells and DNA fragmentation in Colo 320DM cells but not in SW480 cells. Increased levels of the apoptosis activation protein, caspase 3, were also found in Colo 320DM cells. The activation of caspase 3 in LFE-treated SW480 cells was not significant. The caspase 3 activation in Colo 320DM cells by LFE was mediated by the suppression of Bcl-2 protein levels. LFE treatment could inhibit the proliferation and malignancy of colorectal cancer cell lines and was associated with S phase block of the cell cycle. An apoptotic mechanism induced by LFE involving a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase 3 activation was found in Colo 320DM cells but not in SW480 cells. The results of this study indicate that LFE has potential to be developed as a novel functional food or chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer. 3aproanthocyanidins 3achemoprevention 3aplant extracts 3aOriental traditional medicine 3amedicinal plants 3aflavonoids 3awomen 3amitochondria 3aapoptosis 3aepidemiological studies 3ahuman cell lines 3aDimocarpus longan 3anutritional intervention 3acell culture 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3alongans 3aimmunoblotting 3aDNA fragmentation 3acarcinoma 3aflowers 3afruit crops 3achemical constituents of plants 3acell cycle 3amembrane potential 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCaspase 3xanalysis 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aColorectal Neoplasmsxchemistryxpathology. 2aCyclin Axanalysis 2aCyclin Exanalysis 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aFlowersxchemistry 2aFluorescent Dyes 2aHumans 2aMembrane Potential, Mitochondrialxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aRhodamine 123 2aS Phasexdrug effects 2aSapindaceaexchemistry 3aTaiwan 0apolyphenols 0atropical and subtropical fruits1 aLin, Ying-Hsi1 aZhou, Shi-Ping1 aChung, Yuan-Chiang1 aLin, Chih-Cheng1 aWang, Shao-Cheng0 tNutrition and cancer.g2010 , v. 62, no. 2 p.229-236x0163-55817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016355809033053673Available from publisher's Web site  a20100410b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/09  aOther US 7aarticle01950naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100002100157245009500178300001400273520077000287650004301057650002101100650001901121650001801140650002001158650002401178650002401202650001901226650001301245650001101258653001101269653002301280700001501303700001701318773007401335852000901409856007801418939003301496946001101529655001201540IND9200006020221118224928.0920108s1988    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000602DNAL7 a242722512pmid7 a10.1007/BF000156612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoldsworth, M.J.10aOrganisation and expression of a wound/ripening-related small multigene family from tomato  ap. 81-88.  acDNA clones derived from a ripe tomato fruit cDNA library were used to investigate changes in the abundance of specific mRNAs in ripening fruit and wounded leaves. mRNAs related to one cDNA clone (pTOM 13) were expressed in both situations.

The plots were sprigged with 'Tifway 419' bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x C transvaalensis). The dimethylamine salt of 2,4-D [(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid] was applied as foliar sprays at a rate of 2.24 kg AI ha(-1). Simulated rainfall was applied at an intensity of 29mm h(-1) one day before and 1,2,4, and 8 days after the pesticide applications for 0.92, 1.75, 1.75, 0.92, and 0.92 h, respectively. Water run-off was measured using a tipping-bucket apparatus and sub-samples were analyzed for pesticide residues. Data collected from the study were also compared with the GLEAMS and PRZM-2 model simulations for surface water and 2,4-D run-off. Mass and concentration of 2,4-D in run-off decreased rapidly, with 74.5% of the total run-off of 2,4-D occurring in the first run-off event after treatment. When calibrated to the site-specific characteristics, the GLEAMS and the PRZM-2 models adequately simulated the average of surface water run-off over all plots, with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and coefficient of determination for linear regression (R(2)) being 22.8% and 0.917 for GLEAMS, and 23.7% and 0.879 for PRZM-2, respectively. However, both GLEAMS (NRMSH = 82.1%, R(2) = 0.776) and PRZM-2 (NRMSE = 125.8% R(2) = 0.513) less accurately simulated 2,4-D concentrations in run-off. 3a2,4-D 3arunoff 3alosses from soil 3asimulation models 3alawns and turf 3aapplication rate 3agolf courses 0atransport processes1 aSmith, A.E.1 aHook, J.E.1 aBridges, D.C.0 tPesticide science.g1999 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.422-433x0031-613X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000104b20000110c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02472naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001800157245014700175300001600322500001500338520107300353650002701426650003501453650001401488650002001502650003001522650002201552650001301574650002001587650001901607650002701626650002001653653001201673653001201685653001601697653001901713653003001732653001501762700001801777773007601795852000901871856007801880939003301958946001101991655001202002IND9200005820221118224832.0920108s1988    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000582DNAL7 a242723482pmid7 a10.1007/BF000273922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeroles, S.C.10aExpression and inheritance of kanamycin resistance in a large number of transgenic petunias generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation  ap. 355-364.  a2019-12-04  aOne hundred and four kanamycin-resistant Petunia "Mitchell" plants were regenerated from leaf discs cocultivated with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 containing a binary vector pCGN200. Selection for kanamycin resistance was applied during plant regeneration at the initiation of both shoots and roots. The regenerated plants were analysed for expression and inheritance of their kanamycin resistance phenotype. Approximately half of the plants showed normal Mendelian inheritance for one or two kanamycin resistance genes. In one case, the two copies were inserted at closely linked sites on homologous chromosomes, and gave < 0.05% kanamycin-sensitive progeny on backcrosses. Six plants had inheritance patterns suggesting that the kanamycin gene had inserted into an essential region of DNA. Forty-five plants showed lower than expected transmission of kanamycin resistance, which was associated with low expression of the resistance phenotype in most cases. Ten plants produced segregation ratios that are not readily interpreted by Mendelian inheritance. 3agenetic transformation 3agenetically modified organisms 3akanamycin 3aPetunia hybrida 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aPetunia axillaris 3aplasmids 3agene expression 3areporter genes 3ainheritance (genetics) 3adrug resistance 0avectors 0aPetunia 0asegregation 0abinary vectors 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0ati plasmid1 aGardner, R.C.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1988, v. 11, no. 3 p.355-364x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000273923Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02435naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001600157245011400173300001500287520122600302650001701528650004301545650001201588650001601600650002001616650002401636650001401660650001801674650001701692653001501709700001601724700001501740700001801755700001901773700001601792773007401808852000901882856007801891939003301969946001102002655001202013IND9200004020221118224701.0920108s1987    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920000402DNAL7 a242768992pmid7 a10.1007/BF000156422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParks, B.M.14aThe aurea mutant of tomato is deficient in spectrophotometrically and immunochemically detectable phytochrome  ap. 97-107.  aThe aurea locus mutant (au(w)) of tomato contains less than 5% of the level of phytochrome in wild-type tissue as measured by in vivo difference spectroscopy. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against etiolated-oat phytochrome demonstrates that crude extracts of etiolated mutant tissue are deficient in a major immunodetectable protein (116 kDa) normally present in the parent wild type. Analyses of wild-type tissue extracts strongly indicate that the 116-kDa protein is phytochrome by showing that this protein: a) is degraded more rapidly in vitro after a brief far-red irradiation than after a brief red irradiation (Vierstra RD, Quail PH, Planta 156: 158-165, 1982); b) contains a covalently bound chromophore as detected by Zn-chromophore fluorescence on nitrocellulose blots; and c) has an apparent molecular mass comparable to phytochrome from other species on size exclusion chromatography under non-denaturing conditions. The demonstration that the aurea mutant is deficient in this 116-kDa phytochrome indicates that the lack of spectrally detectable phytochrome in this mutant is the result of a lesion which affects the abundance of the phytochrome molecule as opposed to its spectral integrity. 3aspectroscopy 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3amutants 3aphytochrome 3aimmunochemistry 3aprotein degradation 3ared light 3afar-red light 3afluorescence 0adeficiency1 aJones, A.M.1 aAdamse, P.1 aKoornneef, M.1 aKendrick, R.E.1 aQuail, P.H.0 tPlant molecular biology.g1987, v. 9, no. 2 p.97-107x0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF000156423Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03943naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213100002100230245006600251300001600317500001500333520193500348650002102283650000802304650002002312650001302332650001102345650002702356650002002383650000902403650001202412650001102424650001502435650003702450650002702487650002702514650001002541650001102551650001302562650002602575650002202601650003602623650001402659650002802673650002802701650004902729650002502778650003402803650003102837650000902868650004502877650001002922653001802932700002802950700002102978773007302999852000903072856008303081930003303164945002503197946001103222655001203233IND4434081020221118224806.0100317e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443408102DNAL7 a200083272pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpp1072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To elucidate N source and sink relations in mature Macadamia integrifolia Maiden et Betche trees, we traced 15N label after injection into individual branches and, after soil application, analysed xylem sap and examined the effects of hedging on tree N relations. Xylem sap N and sugar composition and concentration changed in relation to phenology and tree management. Canopy position did not affect xylem sap N concentration but sampling date had a significant effect. Hedging in spring was associated with a rapid and dramatic reduction of the concentration of xylem sap N until the following autumn, but unhedged trees were not available to unequivocally assess the significance of the results. Following 15N-branch injection in winter, most 15N label was incorporated into flushing leaves and into bark. After 15N injection in spring, flushing leaves and flowers were most strongly 15N-labelled. In late spring, 15N label was equally incorporated by developing nuts that were retained or later abscised. Soil 15N application in summer resulted in 15N-labelling of outer and mid-canopy leaves. In the following spring, 15N label was translocated to flushing leaves, flowers and developing nuts. The results indicate that outer and mid-canopy leaves are the main N sink for soil-derived N during the vegetative phase and a N source for developing tissues during the reproductive phase. Our study provides evidence that N supply to developing nuts is not a primary cause for nut abscission, supporting the notion that high N fertilizer application rates do not improve nut retention. We propose that current orchard design and hedging practices should be reviewed in context of the role of outer canopy leaves as a source of N for reproductive tissues. 3aisotope labeling 3asap 3astable isotopes 3aorchards 3asugars 3afertilizer application 3anutrient uptake 3anuts 3apruning 3ayields 3aabscission 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aMacadamia integrifolia 3aamino acid composition 3axylem 3acanopy 3anitrogen 3anutrient partitioning 3anutrient reserves 3achemical constituents of plants 3anut trees 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aMacadamiaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Isotopesxmetabolism 2aNutsxgrowth & development 2aSoil 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aXylem 0aplant tissues1 aRennenberg, H.q(Heinz)1 aSchmidt, Susanne0 tTree physiology.g2010 Feb., v. 30, no. 2 p.244-256x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpp1073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100325b20100403c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02719naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002800143245009700171300001600268500002400284520166500308650001101973650001201984650001001996650001802006650001602024650001202040700001702052700002402069700001902093773011502112852000902227856006202236856008302298655001202381IND4460657120221118225159.0110802s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446065712DNAL7 a10.2460/javma.239.3.3802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTennent-Brown, Brett S.10aComparison of three point-of-care blood glucose meters for use in adult and juvenile alpacas  ap. 380-386.  aIncludes references  aObjective—To compare the performance of 3 point-of-care glucose meters in adult and juvenile alpacas with that of a laboratory-based analyzer. Design—Evaluation study. Animals—35 adult alpacas and 21 juvenile alpacas. Procedures—Whole blood samples obtained via jugular venipuncture were tested with all 3 point-of-care glucose meters; plasma samples were also tested with 1 of those meters. Glucose concentrations determined by use of the point-of-care meters were compared with results from the laboratory-based analyzer. Results—Plasma glucose concentrations determined by use of the laboratory-based analyzer ranged from 36 to 693 mg/dL. Over the entire range of glucose concentrations tested, the Lin concordance correlation coefficient (agreement) was significant and excellent for all comparisons. Concordance decreased for 1 glucometer when testing whole blood samples over a narrower range of glucose concentrations (50 to 200 mg/dL). Bias was typically small (< 10 mg/dL) for 3 of the 4 comparisons but considerable for 1 meter with the use of whole blood. The limits of agreement were wide for all comparisons over the entire range of glucose concentrations tested but decreased to within acceptable limits when the narrower glucose range (50 to 200 mg/dL) was analyzed for 3 of the comparisons. For samples with a PCV < 25%, bias and the limits of agreement were greater for one of the meters tested. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Discrepancies between point-of-care glucose meters and reference techniques can be considerable in alpacas, emphasizing the importance of assessing individual meter performance in a target population. 3aadults 3aalpacas 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3acorrelation 3aglucose1 aKoenig, Amie1 aWilliamson, Lisa H.1 aBoston, Ray C.0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 239, no. 3 p.380-386x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.avma.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.239.3.3803Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03552naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245005700193300001600250500002400266520198100290650001302271650002902284650001402313650001002327650002202337650001602359650001302375650002702388650002002415650001502435650001602450650002402466650002702490650001302517650003802530650002102568650001902589650001402608650001802622650002302640650002102663700003302684700002402717700002002741700002202761700002302783700002402806773010402830852000902934856005502943655001202998IND4457976420221118225106.0110513e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445797642DNAL7 a214863692pmid7 a10.1111/j.1523-1739.2011.01662.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFRANKHAM, RICHARD10aPredicting the Probability of Outbreeding Depression  ap. 465-475.  aIncludes references  aFragmentation of animal and plant populations typically leads to genetic erosion and increased probability of extirpation. Although these effects can usually be reversed by re-establishing gene flow between population fragments, managers sometimes fail to do so due to fears of outbreeding depression (OD). Rapid development of OD is due primarily to adaptive differentiation from selection or fixation of chromosomal variants. Fixed chromosomal variants can be detected empirically. We used an extended form of the breeders' equation to predict the probability of OD due to adaptive differentiation between recently isolated population fragments as a function of intensity of selection, genetic diversity, effective population sizes, and generations of isolation. Empirical data indicated that populations in similar environments had not developed OD even after thousands of generations of isolation. To predict the probability of OD, we developed a decision tree that was based on the four variables from the breeders' equation, taxonomic status, and gene flow within the last 500 years. The predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations is elevated when the populations have at least one of the following characteristics: are distinct species, have fixed chromosomal differences, exchanged no genes in the last 500 years, or inhabit different environments. Conversely, the predicted probability of OD in crosses between two populations of the same species is low for populations with the same karyotype, isolated for <500 years, and that occupy similar environments. In the former case, we recommend crossing be avoided or tried on a limited, experimental basis. In the latter case, crossing can be carried out with low probability of OD. We used crosses with known results to test the decision tree and found that it correctly identified cases where OD occurred. Current concerns about OD in recently fragmented populations are almost certainly excessive. 3acrossing 3adecision support systems 3agene flow 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3akaryotyping 3amanagers 3aoutbreeding depression 3apopulation size 3aprediction 3aprobability 3aselection intensity 2aAdaptation, Biological 2aBreeding 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDecision Trees 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Drift 2aPopulation Density 2aSocial Isolation1 aBallou, J.

Clinical Findings—Transabdominal ultrasonography revealed a multilayered mass in the urinary bladder apex consistent with full-thickness invagination of the bladder wall. Treatment and Outcome—Exploratory surgery was performed, and partial inversion of the urinary bladder was confirmed. The invaginated bladder apex was manually reduced, and partial cystectomy was performed to remove the invaginated section of bladder wall. Histologic findings were consistent with vascular congestion and edema secondary to partial invagination. Bacterial culture of a section of the bladder mucosa demonstrated concurrent bacterial urinary tract infection. Clinical signs resolved following surgical resection of the bladder apex and antimicrobial treatment for the concurrent urinary tract infection. Clinical Relevance—Partial invagination of the urinary bladder should be considered in the differential diagnosis for cats with clinical signs of hematuria, stranguria, and inappropriate urination. A diagnosis may be made on the basis of detection of invaginated tissue in the bladder apex during abdominal ultrasonography. 3abladder 3acats 3aedema 3ahematuria 3amucosa 3aresection 3aultrasonography 3aurination1 aChew, Dennis J.1 aHeng, Hock Gan1 aTownsend, Katy L.1 aKarnik, Ketaki0 tJournal of the American Veterinary Medical Association.g2011 Aug. 1, v. 239, no. 3 p.370-373x0003-14887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.avma.org/3Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2460/javma.239.3.3703Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02437naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013800129300001600267500001500283520132800298650002001626650001301646650001601659650002401675650001201699650000801711650001201719650001001731650001101741650000901752651001101761653002301772653002501795653001101820653001701831700001801848773008301866852000901949930003301958945001301991946001102004655001202015IND2207394120221118225152.0001019e200007  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220739412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBelibasaki, S.10aSexual activity and body and testis growth in prepubertal ram lambs of Friesland, Chios, Karagouniki and Serres dairy sheep in Greece  ap. 109-113.  a2019-12-05  aSexual activity, body size and testis growth in the prepubertal period (120-210 days of age) were studied in five male lambs of each of four dairy sheep breeds. Sexual responses developed earlier in Friesland than in Chios and Karagouniki and latest in Serres ram lambs. Friesland lambs expressed interest in females at 127 days of age and 34 kg live weight 18-36 days younger and 3.4-6.3 kg lighter than the three Greek breeds. Puberty (first mounting with ejaculation occurred) of ram lambs appeared to be more closely associated with body weight than with chronological age. Age at puberty averaged 179 days in Friesland, 8, 10 and 30 days younger (p < 0.05) than in Karagouniki, Chios and Serres, respectively. On the other hand, weight at puberty averaged 50 kg for Friesland and Chios compared to about 44 kg for the two other breeds (P < 0.05). In the four breeds studied there was a 41-52 days interval between the time when lambs first expressed interest in females and the time puberty occurred, the longest was that of Friesland lambs. There was a significant breed difference in scrotal circumference. At puberty the scrotal circumference was 33.9 cm in Friesland lambs, 4-6 cm greater than in the three Greek breeds. Friesland ram lambs had a greater scrotal circumference throughout the entire period studied. 3asexual behavior 3adiameter 3abody weight 3aChios (sheep breed) 3apuberty 3aage 3ascrotum 3alambs 3atestes 3arams 3aGreece 0asexual development 0adevelopmental stages 0agrowth 0asheep breeds1 aKouimtzis, S.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2000 July, v. 37, no. 1/2 p.109-113x0921-44887nnas  aDNAL  a20010204b20010209c00000000  aINDdJIT  aNon-US 7aarticle01717naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005200125300001600177520074900193650001000942650001000952650003200962650001200994650001601006650002201022650002701044650001501071650000801086650001601094650002001110700001801130700001801148700001601166773008301182852000901265930003301274945001301307946001101320655001201331IND2207395320221118225224.0001019e200007  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220739532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMine, O.M.10aSheep-goat hybrid born under natural conditions  ap. 141-145.  aThe paper reports a 5 year old male sheep-goat interspecific hybrid born under natural conditions.

Expected future climate tendencies over the Mediterranean could threaten the sustainability of such strategic tree crop. This study evaluates the productive and environmental performance of olive orchards under different climate change scenarios and management strategies across the main olive-farming regions over southern Europe using the process-based model OliveCan. Simulations were performed for low density LD (100 trees ha⁻¹), high density HD (400 trees ha⁻¹) and super high density SHD (1650 trees ha⁻¹) olive orchards over baseline period (1980-2010) and future scenarios (2041–2070 and 2071–2100 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Results showed that the future increase in CO₂ concentration may compensate the negative effects of higher evaporative demand and diminished water supply resulting in an enhancement of water use efficiency and carbon capture potential in olive orchards. Irrigation requirement for the maximum productivity are expected to increase by 5−27%. Moreover, rainfed low density orchards will be the most vulnerable to expected climate changes, in particular in the driest areas. In fact, a decrease in yield up to 28 % with an increase in its interannual variability of 20 % is expected over the Iberian Peninsula while yield increased up to 26 % over the centre of the Mediterranean. Deficit irrigation and intensification will improve olive orchard productivity and carbon sequestration capacity. Besides, the decrease in winter chilling is not expected to be enough to produce significant flowering anomalies or failures over the study area. Even though findings of this research showed that olive orchards may benefit from future conditions, assessment of management alternatives at local scale will be a must for a better adaptability of olive orchards.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adeficit irrigation 3aenvironmental performance 3aevaporative demand 3airrigation requirement 3amodels 3aolives 3aorchards 3atrees 3awater supply 3awater use efficiency 3ayields 3aIberian Peninsula 3aMediterranean region 3aSouthern European region 0aOlea europaea 0aAgricultural management 0aProductivity 0aSustainability1 aLópez-Bernal, Álvaro1 aMoriondo, Marco1 aDibari, Camilla1 aRegni, Luca1 aProietti, Primo1 aVillalobos, Francisco J.1 aTesti, Luca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8728-75630 tEuropean journal of agronomy.g2021 Sept., v. 129 p.126319-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49616x1161-03017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2021.1263193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04124naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005600138245012500194300001600319500002000335520169200355592002802047596008102075596006702156596006802223596006102291596006602352596001202418596002402430596007802454596005002532596001002582596001102592596001402603596001002617596001202627650004102639650001702680650001902697650001502716650001602731650001902747650001702766650001502783650001702798650001202815650001302827650002502840650001302865650001402878650001502892650000902907650001102916650001102927650001402938650002202952650001502974650001802989650001503007650001803022650001503040651002503055651001303080700002303093700002003116700001903136773013003155856007203285852000903357655001203366IND60685524320221119081939.0200304e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068552432DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.34762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBasso, Marta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1732-293310aAssessing the adequacy of SWAT model to simulate postfire effects on the watershed hydrological regime and water quality  ap. 619-631.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aForest fires have intensified in the Mediterranean area over the last decades, becoming increasingly destructive. Catastrophic wildfires, such as the ones that occurred on the Portuguese territory during 2017, have emphasized the need for developing management tools capable of rapidly assessing their impact on downstream water bodies. This study focuses on the effects of the 2017 forest fires on the water quality of the Zêzere River (Portugal), one of the major sources of freshwater to Lisbon and the surrounding areas. During 2017, more than 100,000 ha (30% of the Zêzere watershed) were affected by wildfires, making it one of the largest burned areas in Portugal. Using the soil water assessment tool, the land use (curve number, crop vegetation management factor) and soil (soil erodibility factor) parameters were modified considering different magnitudes of the fire event (low, medium, and high severity). The impact of the different wildfires was then assessed at the subbasin level and at the entrance of Castelo de Bode reservoir. Simulations showed a significant increase in runoff and sediment concentration at the subbasin level in the years following the fire events, with high concentrations of nutrients occurring at the reservoir inlet. Nitrate concentration slightly overcame the threshold limits foreseen in legislation for drinking water, meaning that fires could have additional impact on human health. Phosphate concentration recurrently exceeded the legislation threshold, representing a severe risk to the ecosystem by potentially promoting the eutrophication of downstream water bodies, oxygen deficiency in the bottom substrate, and reduced biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data  aPOCI‐01‐0145‐FEDER‐007638cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aSFRH/BD/146356/2019cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aSFRH/BPD/110655/2015cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aUID/AMB/50017cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  aUID/EEA/50009/2019cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  cCEECIND  cNational Funds (OE)  cERDF Funds of the Competitiveness Factors Operational Programme—COMPETE  cPT2020 Partnership Agreement and Compete 2020  cFEDER  cPIDDAC  cFCT/MCTES  cCESAM  cMARETEC 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3abiodiversity 3adrinking water 3aecosystems 3aerodibility 3aeutrophication 3aforest fires 3afreshwater 3ahuman health 3ahypoxia 3aland use 3alaws and regulations 3anitrates 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3arisk 3arivers 3arunoff 3asediments 3asimulation models 3asoil water 3asurface water 3avegetation 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aMediterranean region 3aPortugal1 aVieira, Diana C.S.1 aRamos, Tiago B.1 aMateus, Marcos0 tLand degradation & development.g2020 Mar., v. 31, no. 5 p.619-631dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.34763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03721naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245013500179300001600314520199400330592002802324650001702352650002202369650002302391650001502414650001002429650001302439650001102452650002102463650001502484650001402499650001502513650001102528650003102539650001902570650002202589650001802611650001202629650002802641650002102669650001302690651001002703653002402713653003002737653001702767653002302784653003102807700003102838773021602869856008503085852000903170655001203179IND60618420220221118055533.0190415e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061842022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecohyd.2018.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallick, Priyanka Halder10aForest, wetland and biodiversity: Revealing multi-faceted ecological services from ecorestoration of a degraded tropical landscape  ap. 278-296.  aWith the deterioration of tropical forests, the loss of species, their habitat and linked socio-ecological degradation is regrettably becoming widespread. Although having their own contribution to sustainable development separately, the linkages between wetlands and forests exemplify the importance of managing ecosystems in their entirety to protect their ecological character and related ecosystem services (ES) that are vital to human activity. To explore the role of ecorestoration efforts within forest-wetland ecosystem in conserving biodiversity and maintaining the sustained flow of ES, the multi-decadal recovery of a degraded landscape of Gurguripal forest, West Bengal, India, was tracked with the help of geospatial technology and field surveys of biodiversity and socio-ecological bonds. To evidence the noticeable recovery of the study site over 25 years remote sensing (RS) techniques were used to track forest type and land use land cover (LULC) changes over time, together with an ecological monitoring at site of the sal dominated tropical deciduous forest and the created wetland ecosystems using ground truth data on vegetation, floral and faunal diversity, physicochemical parameters of water and soil, etc. and socio-ecological survey do depict existing ecosystem services (ES) of these ecosystems. The study confirms positive effects of watershed management initiated by the Forest Department, Government of West Bengal, involving local people ultimately causing reduction in the proportion of degraded land and an increase in green coverage that has been strikingly manifested through retaining surface water. In spite of the lower incidence of terrestrial fauna inside the core of secondary forest with respect to fringe areas, the wetlands, so formed, not only serve as vital perennial water sources in this drought-prone lateritic tract and enrich aquatic biodiversity, but also multifariously multiply the value of ES in this otherwise degrading piece of land.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afauna 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aland degradation 3alandscapes 3alaterites 3amonitoring 3apeople 3aphysicochemical properties 3aremote sensing 3asecondary forests 3asurface water 3asurveys 3asustainable development 3atropical forests 3awetlands 3aIndia 0aWetland restoration 0aForest ecological service 0aBiodiversity 0aWater conservation 0aLand use land cover change1 aChakraborty, Susanta Kumar0 tInternational journal of ecohydrology & hydrobiology.g2018 July, v. 18, no. 3 p.278-296dElsevier B.V.aEuropean Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of ScienceswJournal:2195x1642-35937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2018.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03314naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010500161300001400266500002000280520164700300592002801947596008101975596009302056650002802149650002902177650001702206650001102223650001302234650001302247650001702260650001902277650001602296650002202312650001702334650001902351650001002370650001602380651001302396700002002409700002802429700002202457700001802479700002102497700002202518700002102540700002002561773012102581856007302702852000902775655001202784IND60626258420221123015227.0181220e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062625842DNAL7 a10.1111/jrh.123062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohansson, Patrik10aAdapting an Evidence‐based Cardiovascular Disease Risk Reduction Intervention to Rural Communities  ap. 87-96.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPURPOSE: Using the RE‐AIM framework, the primary purpose of this qualitative study was to assess focus group data to generate information on the applicability of an evidence‐based cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk intervention developed for an urban setting for rural areas in Nebraska. We also sought to determine potential adaptations that may be necessary to implement the study in a rural setting. The CVD risk reduction intervention is based on the Community Outreach and Cardiovascular Health (COACH) program, which included nurse practitioner/community health worker teams. METHODS: This qualitative study involved conducting 3 focus groups with patients with CVD risk factors to assess community readiness for participating in the intervention, the mode of the delivery of the intervention, the setting of the intervention, program content, and raising awareness of the intervention. FINDINGS: Findings from the focus groups indicate acceptability toward a CVD risk reduction program modeled after the COACH. Participants favored initial in‐person face‐to‐face interactions with a nurse practitioner that could transition to phone‐based meetings and Skype. In addition, participants underscored that confidentiality can be a concern in small communities and therefore community health workers need to be trusted individuals. Calls for additions to COACH materials were very specific and participants underscored the need for social support. CONCLUSIONS: With minor adaptations, the COACH program can be pilot tested in rural settings to address key health concerns and behaviors that affect risk for cardiovascular health.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Office of Rural Health, Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services  cUniversity of Nebraska Medical Center Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs 3acardiovascular diseases 3acommunity health workers 3afocus groups 3anurses 3aoutreach 3apatients 3arisk factors 3arisk reduction 3arural areas 3arural communities 3arural health 3asocial support 3ateams 3aurban areas 3aNebraska1 aSchober, Daniel1 aTutsch, Sonja Franziska1 aBrueggeman, Grant1 aLeon, Melissa1 aLyden, Elizabeth1 aSchulz, Paula Sue1 aEstabrooks, Paul1 aZimmerman, Lani0 tJournal of rural health.g2019 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.87-96dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44673x0890-765X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jrh.123063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02375naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245022300175520102800398592002801426650001801454650002401472650001701496650002601513650001001539650001401549650001601563650001901579653001701598653006401615653001201679653001201691653001801703700001801721700002901739700001901768773009101787856009001878852000901968655001201977IND60787520520221119145518.0220914e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078752052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlais, Philippe10aStatic and fatigue testing of open-hole and assembled composites based on long carbon fiber and a nylon matrix developed using fused deposition modelling: Multiscale characterization of printed holes and machined holes  aThe three-dimensional printing of long fiber composites was developed in recent years, and the mechanical behavior of the printed composites requires further investigation. The joining of this type of material requires a hole; and with reference to the available literature, the bearing strength requires investigation. In this context, three manufacturing processes were used for hole generation: direct printing, conventional drilling, and abrasive waterjet drilling (AWJ). The holes obtained by these manufacturing processes were characterized using X-ray tomography and a roughness system. Open-hole quasi-static and fatigue tests were used to assess the mechanical behavior of hole manufacturing on the tensile sections. Single-shear bearing tests yielded the same trend as that observed with open holes, where conventional drilling demonstrated higher performance than the printed and AWJ specimens. The absence of delamination and higher drilling temperature sealed the surface, thus limiting the influence of voids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon fibers 3acomputed tomography 3adelamination 3amechanical properties 3anylon 3aroughness 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0a3-D Printing 0aContinuous carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites 0aFatigue 0aDefects 0aBolted joints1 aToubal, Lotfi1 aZitoune, R.q(Redouane),1 aChaib, Zouhair0 tComposites.g2022 Nov., v. 162 p.107126-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12034x1359-835X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02860naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003600151245012600187300001300313520105000326536022401376592002801600596002001628650001201648650001101660650001601671650001601687650001501703650001201718651001101730653003501741653003101776653002401807653000801831653002201839653002601861700002501887700004601912700003401958700003501992700003502027700002402062700003602086700003002122773011902152856008602271852000902357655001202366IND60765529720221120152901.0220130e20220102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076552972DNAL7 a10.1080/02626667.2021.19851242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira da Costa, José Micael14aThe water, climate and energy nexus in the São Francisco River Basin, Brazil: an analysis of decadal climate variability  ap. 1-20.  aThis paper analyses decadal climate phenomena and the phases of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and assesses the climate–water–energy nexus at the reservoir system of the São Francisco River Basin (SFRB), Brazil. This study brings a non-traditional approach focused on the link between climatic patterns and hydrological processes and their social-economic consequences, such as their effect on energy production. The methodology used data from the precipitation, natural streamflow, and AMO and PDO series. These variables were evaluated by wavelet transform analysis (WTA), flow duration curve (FDC), streamflow that is equalled or exceed ed 90% of the time (Q90), the reliability index (RI) for different demands and the hydropower generated. The results suggest that the WTA for the SFRB was more significant on the inter-annual scale, and the period with opposite phases of AMO(−) and PDO(+) showed the highest values of FDC, Q90, RI and hydropower generated simulated for the SFRB.  aThis work was supported by the National Council for Scientific and 1030 Technological Development – Brazil (Climate, Water and Energy Project in the São Francisco River Basin) [under grant number 310286/2018-2)] SDG.  aPublisher supplied data  a310286 / 2018-2 3aclimate 3aenergy 3astream flow 3awater power 3awatersheds 3awavelet 3aBrazil 0aclimate–water–energy nexus 0awavelet transform analysis 0aflow duration curve 0aQ90 0areliability index 0ahydropower generation1 aSilveira, Cleiton S.1 aVasconcelos Júnior, Francisco das Chagas1 aMarcos Junior, Antonio Duarte1 ada Silva, Marx Vinicius Maciel1 aRamos, Sérgio Filipe Carvalho1 aPorto, Victor Costa1 aSouza Filho, Francisco de Assis1 aMartins, Eduardo S.

Here, we report the cloning of an IKKβ cDNA (named SicIKKβ) from the mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi. The full-length cDNA is 4052bp and contains an ORF that encodes a predicted protein of 743-amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence of SicIKKβ has the same domain organization as human IKKβ, which consists of a serine/threonine kinase domain, a leucine zipper motif and a putative helix-loop-helix motif. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that SicIKKβ was ubiquitously expressed in tissues of mandarin fish, and its expression in mandarin fish fry (MFF-1) cells was up-regulated during the course of ISKNV infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3acomplementary DNA 3afish fry 3ahelix-loop-helix motifs 3aleucine zipper 3amolecular cloning 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Virus Infectionsxenzymologyxgeneticsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aFish Diseasesxenzymologyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aI-kappa B Kinasexgenetics 2aIridoviridaeximmunology 2aNF-kappa Bxmetabolism 2aPerciformesxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSequence Analysis, DNAxveterinary 2aUp-Regulation1 aGuo, Chang-Jun1 aZhou, Zhi-Cheng1 aYuan, Li-Qun1 aXiang, Zhi-Ming1 aWeng, Shao-Ping1 aZhang, Ying-Fen1 aYu, Xiao-Qing1 aHe, Jian-Guo0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2011 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.61-66dElsevier B.V.x0165-24277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2010.07.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02692naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002100159245010900180300001600289500000900305520135100314592002801665650001301693650002301706650001501729650001301744650001601757650003001773650001401803650001901817650001401836650001101850650000701861650002301868650000901891650002401900651001401924700002201938773020701960856009402167852000902261655001202270IND60665937020221121220152.0191028e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066593702DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100030010x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraft, George J.10aDependence of Aldicarb Residue Degradation Rates on Groundwater Chemistry in the Wisconsin Central Sands  ap. 368-372.  aepub  aAldicarb sulfoxide (ASO) (2-methyl-2-(methylsulfinyl)propanal O-[(methylamino)carbonyl]oxime) and aldicarb sulfone (ASO₂) (2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)propanal O-[(methylamino)carbonyl]oxime) degradation rates were measured in incubations simulating three depths (0.5, 5, and 10 m) of Wisconsin central sand plain (WCSP) aquifer. The incubations differed mainly in pH (5.8, 6.5, and 7.2, respectively, for the three depths) and pO₂ (20 kPa [0.2 atm] for the 0.5- and 5-m depths, 1.5 kPa [0.015 atm] for the 10-m depth). Degradation rates corresponded to half-lives ranging from years to less than a month. Aldicarb sulfone (ASO₂) degraded faster than ASO at the same depth. No ASO degradation was measured under aerobic, pH 5.8 conditions; no ASO oxidation was observed in any incubation. The shortest half-lives, 19 and 32 d for ASO and ASO₂, respectively, were obtained under the low pO₂ conditions. The results of this and a previous experiment provide degradation rates for a cross-section of WCSP groundwater chemistries. Thus, with knowledge of the groundwater chemistry at a given WCSP location, degradation rates can be estimated. Degradation rates of common groundwater contaminants as functions of chemical and physical controlling factors could prove valuable to groundwater managers for endeavors such as wellhead protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldicarb 3aaldicarb sulfoxide 3aaldoxycarb 3aaquifers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahalf life 3ahydrochemistry 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3apesticide residues 3asand 3awellhead protection 3aWisconsin1 aHelmke, Philip A.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g1992 July, v. 21, no. 3 p.368-372dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl1642x0047-24257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq1992.00472425002100030010x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245016700169520116600336592002801502650001501530650001101545650001301556650001901569650001801588650002401606650001301630650002001643650002501663653004001688653001601728653002601744653002301770700001501793700001201808700001601820700001301836700001801849700001701867700001801884773009101902856009001993852000902083655001202092IND60787520720221119151207.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078752072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2022.1071282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Di10aHighly thermal conductive phase change composites containing Ag-welding graphene framework with excellent solar-thermal conversion and rapid heat transfer ability  aThe anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) Ag-welding graphene framework prepared by unidirectional ice-templating freezing casting, was used to encapsulate polyethylene glycol (PEG) as phase change material (PCM) composite in this work. Arising from the decreased interfacial thermal resistance (ITR) in graphene skeleton by Ag-welding and the vertically oriented graphene skeleton as phonon transfer paths, the obtained PCM composite exhibited a high thermal conductivity of 4.3 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ at graphene loading of ∼6.25 vol%, which improved significantly the heat transfer rate during the heat charging/discharging processes. Meanwhile, the graphene framework gave the PCM composite an excellent solar-thermal conversion ability, which could be further enhanced by Ag-welding strategy. Besides, the 3D porous framework with huge capillary and surface tension forces effectively improved the shape stability and avoided leakage of PCM, with meanwhile remaining high energy storage capacities (147.4–165.9 J g⁻¹).

In this study, shRNA technology was used to suppress NDRG1 expression in CaSki (a cervical cancer cell line) and HO-8910PM (an ovarian cancer cell line). In vitro assays showed that NDRG1 knockdown enhanced tumor cell adhesion, migration and invasion activities without affecting cell proliferation. cDNA microarray analysis revealed 96 deregulated genes with more than 2-fold changes in both cell lines after NDRG1 knockdown. Ten common upregulated genes (LPXN, DDR2, COL6A1, IL6, IL8, FYN, PTP4A3, PAPPA, ETV5 and CYGB) and one common downregulated gene (CLCA2) were considered to enhance tumor cell invasive activity. BisoGenet network analysis indicated that NDRG1 regulated these invasion effector genes/proteins in an indirect manner. Moreover, NDRG1 knockdown also reduced pro-invasion genes expression such as MMP7, TMPRSS4 and CTSK. These results suggest that regulation of invasion and metastasis by NDRG1 is a highly complicated process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal ovaries 3acell adhesion 3acell proliferation 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ain vitro studies 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3ametastasis 3amicroarray technology 3aneoplasm cells 3aovarian neoplasms 3aproteins 3auterine cervical neoplasms1 aChen, Jiawei1 aDeng, Yanqiu1 aGao, Feng1 aZhu, Jiwei1 aFeng, Zhenzhong1 aLv, Xiuhong1 aZhao, Zheng0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 Apr. 29, v. 408, no. 1 p.154-159dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.03.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01880naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245014400174300001600318520046900334592002800803650001700831650002400848650001500872650001400887650001600901650002200917651001200939653002000951653001300971653001500984653002200999653003301021653001601054653002001070653001401090653001601104653002301120653003601143653002101179773013901200856008601339852000901425655001201434IND60596359220181002000000.0181002e20180504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059635922DNAL7 a10.1080/00379271.2018.14631732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPostle, Anthony C.10aCarayonovus n. gen. from Reunion Island – aberrant new genus of Anthocoridae or representative of a new family (Heteroptera: Cimicoidea)?  ap. 247-256.  aCarayonovus insignis n. gen., n. sp., a remarkable new genus and species of Heteroptera, is described from Reunion Island.

Petch], is a persistent threat to wheat production. Development of resistant varieties and identification of germplasm carrying new sources of resistance is necessary to preserve grain quality and yield. Resistance to FHB has been identified both within the gene pools of cultivated wheat and wild wheat relatives. In this study, a collection of the D genome species, Aegilops tauschii Coss. was evaluated for resistance to FHB. A total of 109 accessions of Ae. tauschii Coss. subsp. tauschii and Ae. tauschii Coss. subsp. strangulata (Eig) Tzvelev were infected with F. graminearum by single floret inoculation. Disease severity was rated as the percentage of infected spikelets at 21 days post-inoculation. A strong relationship was identified between geographical origin of Ae. tauschii accessions and FHB resistance. Generally, accessions from areas receiving high levels of annual rainfall were resistant whereas accessions from areas of low rainfall, more susceptible to FHB. High levels of FHB resistance were identified in accessions collected from regions bordering the Caspian Sea. The majority of accessions from arid regions were susceptible to FHB. The resistant germplasm identified in this study will support long-term FHB resistance breeding efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAegilops tauschii 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aarid zones 3abreeding 3acrop production 3adisease severity 3aflorets 3agene pool 3agenome 3agermplasm 3agrain quality 3aprovenance 3arain 3awheat 3aCaspian Sea1 aBrown, Linda K.1 aOlson, Eric L.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2017 Dec., v. 64, no. 8 p.2049-2058dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-017-0495-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245010500166300001400271500001500285520097500300592002801275650001101303650002101314650000901335650002101344650001201365650001401377650001501391650002001406650001201426650001901438650002001457650002301477650001501500650001801515653002901533653001901562700001901581700002001600773011701620852000901737856008301746655001201829IND2205119520221123020001.0181021e200001  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220511952DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517500070001112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSekiguchi, Yuka10aDurable Flame Retardant Cotton Fabric Prepared by Partial Pyrophosphorylation and Metal Complexation  ap. 71-76.  a2019-12-04  aIn order to prepare durable flame retardant cotton, mercerized cotton fabric is treated with orthophosphoric acid at 140°C or pyrophosphoric acid at 110°C, followed by metal-complexation. The LOI (limited oxygen index) values of the pyrophosphorylated cotton fabrics are higher than those of orthophosphorylated fabrics; the pyrophosphory lated fabric treated with Ni ²⁺ has an LOI value of 28, and those treated with Ca²⁺, Mg ²⁺, or Zn²⁺ have a value of 26. The pyrophosphorylated fabric merely rinsed in running tap water has an LOI value of 26. These values are similar to those for cotton fabrics resin-finished with organophosphorus compounds. The LOI values of treated fabrics do not decrease after laundering, in contrast to the behavior of resin-finished fabrics. The pyrophosphorylated sample has a tensile strength, elongation, and hand similar to those of untreated fabrics, and is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis to release reducing sugars.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3aflame retardants 3azinc 3atensile strength 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3adurability 3aphosphoric acid 3afabrics 3abiodegradation 3aphosphorylation 3achemical treatment 3ametal ions 3amercerization 0aflame retardant finishes 0ainorganic ions1 aSawatari, Chie1 aYagi, Tatsuhiko0 tTextile research journal.g2000 Jan., v. 70, no. 1 p.71-76dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517500070001113Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02117naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009300161300001800254500002000272520105000292592002801342650003001370650002001400650002501420650002301445650001701468650001201485650002501497700001801522700001801540773013901558856007301697852000901770655001201779IND60651670420221120055909.0190712e20140905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065167042DNAL7 a10.3390/su60960492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyeong, Seunghwan10aSustainable E-Governance: The Relationship among Trust, Digital Divide, and E-Government  ap. 6049-6069.  aJournal Article  aThis study empirically examines the correlation between the quality of e-government and trust in government. It used survey data collected in 2013 from the metropolitan areas of Seoul. An index was developed to measure the quality of e-government services, and the Gov 3.0 values were reflected in the analysis, including openness, sharing, communication, and collaboration. The results show a partial correlation between the quality of e-government service and trust in government. In addition, the level of trust varied according to the different type of the digital divide groups. It suggests that as ICT (Information Communication Technology) has become more sophisticated, a willingness to share information among organizations and stakeholders may become a major factor to thoseactively seeking information and resources to make value-added products. It also suggests that more integrated data management including network securityand an open attitude toward information sharing will be more important beyond the level of technical issues.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunications technology 3adata collection 3ainformation exchange 3ametropolitan areas 3astakeholders 3asurveys 3avalue-added products1 aKwon, Yongmin1 aSeo, Hyungjun0 tSustainability.g2014 Sept. 05, v. 6, no. 9 p.6049-6069dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su60960493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011800176300001800294520057600312592002800888650002300916650002300939650001100962650001300973650002700986650001301013653001801026653001501044653002401059653002201083653001401105653002201119700001901141700002601160700002101186700002401207700002001231773008101251856008101332852000901413655001201422IND60551438520221123005056.0161018e20141223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055143852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.10.0592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÁbrányi-Balogh, Péter10aHeteroatom effect on potential energy topology.

Twenty-two male physical education students – twelve trained (TG) (21.51 ± 1.25 years, 182.17 ± 4.37 cm and 82.88 ± 11.23 kg) and ten untrained (NTG) (23.89 ± 3.17 years, 176.8 ± 2.2 cm and 82.24 ± 8.43 kg) – participated in a crossover randomized study. They were asked to perform a 30-s Wingate test during six experimental sessions (three at 08:00 and three at 18:00 h) after different active warm-up (AWU) durations (5 min, 15 min, or 20 min). The AWU consisted of pedaling at a constant pace of 60 rpm against 50% of maximal aerobic power. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded after the AWU and again immediately after the Wingate test. Heart rate and temperature (T) were recorded during each session at rest, after AWU and immediately at the end of the Wingate test. During the Wingate test, peak power (PP), mean power (MP), and the fatigue index were recorded. While the RPE estimations were higher in NTG, no time-of-day effect was recorded in either experimental group (morning or evening). T , PP, and MP were higher in the afternoon than in the morning (p < 0.001 for PP and MP; p < 0.05 for T). Similarly, PP and MP during the Wingate test were significantly higher in the TG than in the NTG (p < 0.001). The morning–evening difference of PP and MP was affected by AWU duration; AWU ₁₅ was best in the morning for improving lower limb power for both the TG and NTG, whereas reducing this period to 5 min in the evening was appropriate for TG only.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological rhythms 3aeducation 3aexercise 3aheart rate 3amales 3amuscles 3asports 3astudents 3atemperature 0awarm-up 0aanaerobic load 0atime-of-day 0afitness level1 aChaâri, Nesrine1 aSouissi, Nizar0 tBiological rhythm research.g2015 July 4, v. 46, no. 4 p.497-509dTaylor & Francisx1744-41797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09291016.2015.10207103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02470naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245010700207300001600314500001100330506007600341520118700417592002801604506003701632650001101669650002301680650001201703650001801715650001701733650001301750650002601763650001501789700002101804700002201825700002801847773009501875856008101970852000902051655001202060IND60558024020221207115118.0161105e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055802402DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-016-0185-32doi7 aPMC50970722pmcid7 a278822662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Ada L.10aCommunity Interventions to Improve Cooking Skills and Their Effects on Confidence and Eating Behaviour  ap. 315-322.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Community-based interventions aiming to improve cooking skills are a popular strategy to promote healthy eating. We reviewed current evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions on different confidence aspects and fruit and vegetable intake. RECENT FINDINGS: Evaluation of cooking programmes consistently report increased confidence in cooking skills in adults across different age groups and settings. The effectiveness of these programmes on modifying eating behaviour is less consistent, but small increases in self-reported consumption of fruit and vegetables are also described. Lack of large samples, randomization and control groups and long-term evaluation are methodological limitations of the evidence reviewed. Cooking skill interventions can have a positive effect on food literacy, particularly in improving confidence on cooking and fruit and vegetable consumption, with vulnerable, low-socieconomic groups gaining more benefits. Consistency across study designs, delivery and evaluation of outcomes both at short and long terms are warranted to draw clearer conclusions on how cooking programmes are contributing to improve diet and health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3acommunity programs 3acooking 3aeating habits 3ahealthy diet 3aliteracy 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables1 aReardon, Rebecca1 aMcDonald, Matthew1 aVargas-Garcia, Elisa J.0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2016 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.315-322dSpringer USx2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-016-0185-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01668naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002300146245007200169300001400241500001500255520051700270592002800787650001100815650001100826650001200837650002900849650001300878650002000891650001300911650002300924650001500947653001300962700002200975700002800997700001601025700002001041773011701061852000901178856008301187655001201270IND2205120420221123003235.0181021e200001  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220512042DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517500070001132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoppenheidt, Klaus10aInfluence of Organofluorine-Treated Textiles on Biowaste Composting  ap. 84-90.  a2019-12-04  aA mixture of cotton textiles and biowaste is used as compost raw material.

Potential alternative sources are protein from peas (Pisum sativum L.) or more local sources like other grain legumes or rapeseed meal (Brassica napus L. subsp. oliefera). These are also good rotation crops. For farmers, protein and yield are key traits. In this study, a dataset containing 37 descriptors and 1222 accessions from a germplasm collection of P. sativum was analyzed. Scatterplot matrixes and tree regression analysis were used to establish the relationship among descriptors and to identify the most important predictors for seed yield and protein content respectively. Number of flowers per plant was shown to be important for seed yield prediction, followed by number of inflorescences per plant and number of pods per plant. In general, a negative correlation between seed protein content and seed yield was detected, but a few accessions that had both high seed yield and high protein content were identified. The results are discussed in relation to crop improvement and the importance of maintaining germplasm collections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aPisum sativum 3adata collection 3afarmers 3aflowers 3agermplasm conservation 3apeas 3apods 3aprotein content 3arapeseed meal 3aseed yield 3asoybeans 3ayield forecasting 3aEurope 3aSouth America1 aYndgaard, Flemming1 aPoulsen, Gert1 aBothmer, Roland von,0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2017 Dec., v. 64, no. 8 p.2035-2047dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-017-0494-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02135naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100003200146245009100178300001800269520085600287592002801143650001401171650002301185650001701208650001801225650001601243650001501259650001801274650001101292650002001303650001601323700003401339700006001373700006901433773017001502856008001672852000901752655001201761IND60645982920190813000000.0190605e20190513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064598292DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b005832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattar Knesebeck, Annelorie10aSynthesis of Malic Acid on Montmorillonite K10: A Langmuir–Hinshelwood Kinetic Study  ap. 9257-9265.  aTo accelerate the reaction of hydration of fumaric acid (F) to produce malic acid (M), Montmorillonite K10 (MK10) was tested as a solid acid catalyst. The experiments were performed in a stirred pressurized batch reactor at a catalyst concentration of 4.7%–9.4% (w:w), and temperatures of 448–493 K for times up to 36000 s. The concentrations of F, M, and maleic acid (Mx) formed from a secondary isomerization reaction were determined at different reaction times by UPLC analysis. MK10 increased the final conversion of F to at least 20% without any observed decay of its catalytic activity for four cycles of use. A reliable catalytic model that assumes that the surface reactions of isomerization and hydration of F are the rate-controlling steps was suggested. External mass-transfer resistances and diffusional limitations were not important.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3afumaric acid 3aisomerization 3amaleic acid 3amalic acid 3amass transfer 3amodels 3amontmorillonite 3atemperature1 aOrtiz, Ronald Wbeimar Pacheco1 aWypych, Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3498-83231 aZanoelo, Everton Fernando1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9347-40260 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 May 13, v. 58, no. 22 p.9257-9265dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.9b005833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008200165300001600247500001100263520193100274592002802205650001402233650001102247650002802258650002002286650002202306650003702328650002002365650001902385650000902404650001502413650001402428650001202442650001302454650002402467650000902491650002302500650001002523700002302533700001702556700002202573700002402595773009502619856008102714852000902795655001202804IND60558024120221117232711.0161105e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055802412DNAL7 a10.1007/s13668-016-0183-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeeters, Anna10aBeyond BMI: How to Capture Influences from Body Composition in Health Surveys  ap. 286-294.  aReview  aPopulation monitoring of health risks is critical for resource allocation and planning of health services and preventive interventions. It also enables identification of population groups and regional areas where need may be greater. To support these functions, population monitoring needs to be accurate and reliable over time. With increasing prevalence of obesity over time, the need to monitor high risk adiposity is recognised internationally. Body composition is regularly monitored in population health surveys globally, primarily to identify high risk adiposity as an important contributor to future disease burden. Body mass index, a composite of height and weight, is the most commonly used population indicator of high risk adiposity, but its correlation with body fat is relatively poor. Many population surveys also collect waist and hip circumference, with a minority collecting further indicators such as skinfold thickness, bioelectrical impedance and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Here, we review the advantages and disadvantages of the body composition indicators currently used in population health surveys and reflect on how the information from such indicators could be optimised. Our focus is on the use of indicators to identify those at increased metabolic health risk associated with excess body fat. We conclude that while most current indicators have reasonable correlation with body fat when tested, they have only been validated in small, specific samples that cannot be compared and are likely to have limited use over time as populations change demographically and in their body composition. Future population monitoring of high risk adiposity requires a more systematic analysis of which combined indicators from population health surveys will provide the best estimation of excess body fat and future cardio-metabolic risk across all adult ages, both sexes and a wide range of ethnicities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3aadults 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody mass index 3aburden of disease 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3ahealth services 3ahealth surveys 3ahips 3amonitoring 3anutrition 3aobesity 3aplanning 3aresource allocation 3arisk 3askinfold thickness 3awaist1 aTanamas, Stephanie1 aGearon, Emma1 aAl-Gindan, Yasmin1 aLean, Michael E.

Developing drought tolerance varieties can enhance yield and reduce the need for supplemental irrigation. Breeding for drought tolerance requires the knowledge of its genetic basis. Genetic basis for some seedling traits in cowpea was investigated. Seven generations (P₁, P₂, F₁, RF₁, F₂, BC₁ and BC₂) each derived from two crosses involving two highly drought tolerant (Danilla and IT97K-499-35) and one highly susceptible parents (Tvu7778) were evaluated for drought tolerance in the screen house. Data on Seedling height (SH), Seedling terminal leaflet area (SLA), Seedling Vigour (SV) and Recovery Capacity (RC) were collected. The SV was assessed on a scale of 1 (highly-tolerant) – 9 (highly-susceptible), while RC (%) was evaluated at 5 d interval for 30 d. The hybrids F₁ and RF₁ showed the best performances in both crosses with SV ranged from 2.50 ± 0.00 in Danilla × IT97K-499-35 cross to 6.50 ± 1.00 in the Danilla × TVU7778 cross. In both crosses, F₁ and RF₁ had 100.0% RC. Both dominance (46.5–68.6%) and additive (31.4–53.5%) effects were found similar and important in all the traits under water stressed. The six-parameter model indicated few cases of gene interactions, mostly dominance × dominance. Narrow sense heritability ranged from 33.5% for SH to 50.1% for SLA in the cross Danilla × TVU7778 at terminal water stress. Inheritance of these traits in cowpea involved both additive and dominance gene action. However, dominance and/or dominance × dominance effects had a more pronounced effect in genetic control of all characters.  aPublisher supplied data 3acowpeas 3acrossing 3adominance (genetics) 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agene interaction 3agenes 3agenetic analysis 3aheritability 3ahybrids 3amodels 3aparents 3aseedlings 3avigor 3awater stress 0aadditive gene action 0adominance gene action 0anarrow sense heritability 0arecovery capacity 0aseedling vigour1 aIlori, Christopher Olumuyiwa0 tPlant genetic resources.g2018 June, v. 16, no. 3 p.218-227dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621170002353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02936naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245024200203506007600445520135100521592002801872506003701900650002601937650003201963650002801995650003202023650002502055650001702080650001302097650000902110650001002119650002802129650001202157650001102169650000702180650001502187650002002202650001702222700002802239773012502267856007702392852000902469655001202478IND60648642020221207130912.0190701e20190606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864202DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox80601652doi7 aPMC66168622pmcid7 a311743512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamedi, Lesly 10aFunctional Activity of Four Autochthonous Strains <i>L. paraplantarum</i> AB362736.1, <i>L. plantarum</i> MF369875.1, <i>W. paramesenteroides</i> CP023501.1, and <i>E. faecalis</i> HQ802261.1 in a Probiotic Grape Marmalade during Storage  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGrape foods with probiotics are sources of beneficial bacteria for the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and also have a high antioxidant capacity. The addition of probiotics to dairy food is a traditional process; therefore, probiotic non-dairy products might contribute to a daily antioxidant diet to improve consumer life quality and health. This research was undertaken to develop a grape marmalade with a probiotic base to investigate the potential antioxidant activity in the probiotic non-dairy product. Thus, changes in active culture numbers, pH level, glucose concentration, and antioxidant properties were evaluated. Most of the isolates demonstrated higher growth in the grape marmalade than the synthetic grape marmalade, which was greater than 7 log colony-forming units (CFU)/g within 90 days of storage at 4 &deg;C. In addition, most of the wild isolates grew beyond the critical count of 106 CFU/g in sampling between 60 and 90 days of storage. Moreover, probiotic grape marmalade with probiotics showed a strong antioxidant capacity that failed to differ significantly with the synthetic medium. The study confirmed Lactobacillus paraplantarum AB362736.1, Lactobacillus plantarum MF369875.1, Weissella paramesenteroides CP023501.1, and Enterococcus faecalis HQ802261.1 were ideal bacteria for the probiotic process of grape marmalade.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aLactobacillus paraplantarum 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aWeissella paramesenteroides 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abacteria 3adiet 3afoods 3agastrointestinal system 3aglucose 3agrapes 3apH 3aprobiotics 3aquality of life 3astorage time1 aCharles, Albert  Linton0 tAntioxidants.g2019 June 06, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox80601653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01785naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245010500163300001800268520058500286592002800871650001600899650001800915650002300933650001300956650002100969650001300990700002001003700002801023700005501051700005901106700005801165773012001223856008301343852000901426655001201435IND60637596020221121064127.0190419e20190408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063759602DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b007312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIto, Saki10aTotal Synthesis of Termicalcicolanone A via Organocatalysis and Regioselective Claisen Rearrangement  ap. 2777-2781.  aA total synthesis of an anticancer xanthone natural product termicalcicolanone A utilizing multiple nucleophilic aromatic substitutions and pericyclic reactions has been developed.

Originally, the methodology focused on heat integration with heat exchanger network (HEN) synthesis. However, most chemical processes also include pressure manipulation with the inclusion of equipment such as compressors, expanders, pumps, and valves that affect heat integration. Recently, attention has therefore been directed toward simultaneous work and heat integration and the synthesis of work and heat exchange networks (WHENs). Mathematical programming has proven effective in solving heat integration problems. Several pinch location algorithms exist in the literature that calculate the minimum utility consumption given a set of hot and cold process streams. However, classification of streams into hot and cold streams prior to optimization is difficult when integrating compressors and expanders in HENs. Depending on the integration problem, the compression/expansion temperatures can vary greatly in order to fully utilize the heat of compression (or cooling from expansion) in the process. This represents a modeling issue, as classifying the stream identities prior to optimization essentially impose an upper or lower bound on the temperature variable. Instead, pinch location algorithms must be modified to handle unclassified process streams. Different strategies for handling unclassified process streams in exergy targeting and synthesis of WHENs were proposed by Yu et al. This article presents an alternative and more compact formulation using a nonsmooth extension to the simultaneous optimization and heat integration algorithm by Duran and Grossmann in order to handle unclassified process streams. Optimization is performed using IPOPT, and the sensitivities (gradients) are obtained using recent developments in nonsmooth analysis. The nonsmooth extension is tested for WHEN targeting using a number of examples from the literature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acold 3acompressors 3acooling 3aexergy 3aheat exchangers 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3aprocess design 3apumps 3atemperature1 aWatson, Harry A.

The release of total phenolics (TPs) into sausage was also assessed. RESULTS: All films exhibited antibacterial activity against L. monocytogenes on agar culture media. Chitosan films containing ZEO were the most effective on the growth of bacteria. The growth of L. monocytogenes was significantly inhibited by ZEO‐GSE containing films especially during storage of the sausages for 6 days. Aerobic mesophiles and lactic acid bacteria were the most sensitive and resistant groups to films by 0.1–1.1 and 0.1–0.7 log cycles reduction, respectively. Sausages wrapped by 10 g kg−1 GSE + 10 g kg−1 ZEO films had the lowest degrees of lipid oxidation, which was 23% lower than the control. The TPs of ZEO films decreased to zero after 6 days, whereas TPs of GSE films followed a slight decrease during the storage. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial/antioxidant chitosan film could be developed by incorporating GSE and ZEO for extending the shelf life of mortadella sausage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidants 3achitosan 3acold storage 3aculture media 3aessential oils 3agrape seed extract 3alactic acid bacteria 3alipid peroxidation 3amortadella 3aoilseeds 3ashelf life 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aBacteriaxgrowth & development 2aChitosan 2aFast Foods 2aFood Microbiology 2aFood Packaging 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFood Storage 2aGrape Seed Extractxpharmacology 2aLamiaceaexchemistry 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aOils, Volatilexpharmacology 2aPhenolsxpharmacology 2aRefrigeration 2aSwine 2aVitisxchemistry1 aTajik, Hossein1 aRazavi Rohani, Seyed Mehdi1 aOromiehie, Abdul Rasoul0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2011 Dec., v. 91, no. 15 p.2850-2857dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.4531  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014900164300001600313520165600329592002801985650000802013650002302021650001202044650001002056650003002066650002002096650002302116650001602139650001402155650001402169650002202183650003702205650001402242650001702256650001002273650002702283650002602310650001202336650001402348650001402362650002802376650002502404650001002429650001002439650001902449651001402468651001102482651001102493653000902504653001602513653001302529653001002542653001502552700002102567700002302588700002602611700002202637700002102659700001802680700002102698700001902719700002102738700001802759700001802777700001802795700001602813773012902829856008102958852000903039655001203048IND60652390520221118003720.0190712e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065239052DNAL7 a10.1017/S14792621170002592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkii, Dennis10aGenetic variation, Heritability estimates and GXE effects on yield traits of Mesoamerican common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) germplasm in Uganda  ap. 237-248.  aGermplasm of common beans from the Mesoamerican gene pool races: Durango, Jalisco, Mesoamerica and Guatemala have highest genetic variation for the crop's improvement. The objective was to assign 50 common bean germplasm in Uganda into its gene pool races based on analyses of population structure. Secondly, to estimate heritability and effects of genotype × environment (GXE) interaction on common bean agronomic and yield traits in space and time. Sample genomic DNA was amplified in 2011 with 22 Simple sequence repeat markers (SSRs) and alleles separated using capillary electrophoresis. Field evaluations were conducted in 2010 and 2011 at NaCRRI and 2015 at CIAT – Kawanda. Multivariate analyses of SSRs data identified four subgroups within the germplasm: K4.1–K4.4, with corresponding Wrights fixation indices (FST) as 0.1829 for K4.1, 0.1585 for K4.4, 0.1579 for K4.2 and least for K4.3 at 0.0678. Gene pool race admixtures in the population (14%) were notable and attributed to gene flow. Four superior parents currently used in improving resistance to major diseases grouped as; Jalisco for MLB49-89A; Mesoamerica for MCM5001 and G2333; Durango for MEXICO 54. Heritability values for yield traits estimated using phenotypic data from above fixed parents, was above 0.81. Season and location had significant effect (P < 0.05) on numbers of: flower buds per inflorescence, pod formation and weight of 100 seeds. The findings will improve understanding of co-evolutionary relationships between bean hosts and pathogens for better disease management and will broaden the germplasm base for improving other tropical production constraints.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aalleles 3abeans 3acapillary electrophoresis 3adisease control 3adisease resistance 3aflower buds 3agene flow 3agene pool 3agenetic variation 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agermplasm 3aheritability 3ahosts 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amultivariate analysis 3aparents 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3aplant genetic resources 3apopulation structure 3araces 3aseeds 3aspace and time 3aGuatemala 3aMexico 3aUganda 0aSSRs 0aMesoamerica 0adiseases 0ayield 0avariations1 aMukankusi, Clare1 aSebuliba, Sulaiman1 aTukamuhabwa, Phinehas1 aTusiime, Geoffrey1 aTalwana, Herbert1 aOdong, Thomas1 aNamayanja, Annet1 aPaparu, Pamela1 aNkalubo, Stanley1 aOtim, Michael1 aUgen, Michael1 aBuah, Stephen1 aGepts, Paul0 tPlant genetic resources.g2018 June, v. 16, no. 3 p.237-248dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl4078550x1479-263X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S14792621170002593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245009200162300001600254520173400270592002802004650001902032650001102051650001002062650002102072650000902093650001502102650001102117650001102128650001202139650001102151650001302162650001002175651001202185651001202197700001602209700002402225700002302249773011202272856004802384852000902432655001202441IND4476610520221120025440.0120320e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447661052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-011-0589-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorteus, Tom10aEmpirical development of strategy for the control of invasive American mink by trapping  ap. 403-413.  aAmerican mink (Neovison vison) are an ecologically damaging invasive species in Europe and Iceland where attempts to control them typically rely on trapping. The focus and efficiency of trapping can be improved by using track-recording mink rafts to identify where mink are present before traps are deployed. This paper describes development of operating strategy for the use of mink rafts with traps, to optimise capture efficiency against costs. We worked sequentially on two unconnected chalk streams in central southern England. On 17 km of the River Itchen, we operated a very high density of rafts (5.9 per km) through spring and summer to generate multiple detections of each mink present. All rafts recording mink tracks were armed with traps, and captured mink were euthanased. After removal of mink until no further detections were made, we calculated that each mink was detected 5.3 times at 5.1 raft sites, and on this basis, rationalised raft density to a standard one per kilometer of river. We set a trap deployment time (10 days) that encompassed the longest observed lapse from detection to capture (7 days), and extended the check interval for rafts in monitoring mode from 1 week to 2 weeks to further reduce costs. These operating rules were then deployed for 12 months on the 44-km River Wylye beginning in autumn. Rafts indicated that the river was cleared of mink through the capture of seven individuals, each of which was detected 3.6 times at 2.7 raft sites, on average, and was trapped within 6 days of detection giving a response time of less than 20 days. Although these operating rules may need refinement for other environments, we believe this is a sound basis for effective mink control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeovison vison 3aautumn 3achalk 3ainvasive species 3amink 3amonitoring 3arivers 3aspring 3astreams 3asummer 3atrapping 3atraps 3aEngland 3aIceland1 aShort, Mike1 aRichardson, Suzanne1 aReynolds, Jonathan0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2012 Apr., v. 58, no. 2 p.403-413dSpringer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-011-0589-8  aDNAL 7aarticle01357naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245017300154300002000327520032600347592002800673650003600701650002600737650002000763650001200783650001200795700001200807700001800819773013500837856007400972852000901046655001201055IND60639007520221118073437.0190501e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063900752DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc07758g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Tao10aRhodium-catalyzed C–H activation of 3-(indolin-1-yl)-3-oxopropanenitriles with diazo compounds and tandem cyclization leading to hydrogenated azepino[3,2,1-hi]indoles  ap. 14117-14120.  aRh(iii)-Catalyzed C–H activation of 3-(indolin-1-yl)-3-oxopropanenitriles with diazo compounds and cyclization leading to seven-membered ring scaffolds has been developed.

Aromatics are very important chemical groups in polymer science for the synthesis of several thermostable and thermosetting polymers. However, most petroleum-based aromatic monomers (such as phenol) are toxic. Furthermore, less toxic and sustainable aromatics are difficult to obtain because natural phenols have various functionalities in nature. Consequently, aromatic-containing building blocks must be synthesized. The present review gives an overview of the different synthetic methods to prepare aromatic building blocks via various coupling methods. It then focuses on the synthesis of C–C bonds, reductive coupling of natural aldehydes, carbonyl–aromatic coupling and other various routes to prepare monomers. Indeed, owing to the rich reactivity and properties of aromatics, these functional monomers will undoubtedly lead to the development of high-added value polymers. This review also gives a brief overview of their potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehydes 3achemical bonding 3afurans 3agreen chemistry 3aindustry 3apetroleum 3aphenol 3apolymers 3athermal stability 3atoxicity1 aAuvergne, Rémi1 aBoutevin, Bernard1 aCaillol, Sylvain0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 Feb. 18, v. 21, no. 4 p.724-747dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc03541e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011200171300001800283520091400301592002801215650001601243650001301259650001401272650001001286650001101296650001301307650000901320650001401329650001301343700001701356700002101373700001401394700001901408700005801427700005901485700001901544773011901563856008701682852000901769655001201778IND60686826720221121221708.0200319e20200226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068682672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b040642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xu-Quan10aDemetallization of Heavy Oils of High Metal Content through Pyrolysis under Supercritical Water Environment  ap. 2861-2869.  aThrough pyrolysis under a supercritical water (SCW) environment, the demetallization of Tsingtao vacuum residuum (VR) and Tahe atmospheric residuum (AR) with a total vanadium and nickel content above 300 ppm was studied. By introducing SCW, pyrolysis of heavy oil can be carried out in an emulsion structure in which heavy fractions rich in metals are concentrated in oil droplets. A metal removal rate higher than 90% could be obtained in 2 h, which is faster than the pyrolysis under the nitrogen environment. Although the two heavy oils have similar apparent properties, Tsingtao VR is characterized by the metal enrichment in the heaviest asphaltenes and the higher condensation activity of asphaltenes. Because of the preferential condensation of heavy fractions rich in metals, the liquid product yield of Tsingtao VR could be 15 wt % higher than that of Tahe AR at the metal removal rate of 70% to 90%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aasphaltenes 3adroplets 3aemulsions 3afuels 3anickel 3anitrogen 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3avanadium1 aPu, Jing-Cao1 aZheng, Hong-Bing1 aYu, Xu-De1 aChen, Xue-Feng1 aYuan, Pei-Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0797-963X1 aCheng, Zhen-Min1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7467-71351 aYuan, Wei-Kang0 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Feb. 26, v. 34, no. 3 p.2861-2869dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b040643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03053naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245010700209506007600316520147000392592002801862506003701890650001201927650001201939650004901951650003902000650001402039650001302053650000902066650001702075650002102092650002802113650001702141650002002158700002502178700002102203700002602224700001802250700001902268700002102287700002102308700001902329773012502348856007702473852000902550655001202559IND60648642420221207132631.0190701e20190608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864242DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox80601682doi7 aPMC66165442pmcid7 a311817512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParadis, Stéphanie 10aAging Exacerbates Ischemia-Reperfusion-Induced Mitochondrial Respiration Impairment in Skeletal Muscle  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCycles of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) that occur during peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are associated with significant morbi-mortality, and aging is an irreversible risk factor of PAD. However, the effects of advanced age on IR-induced skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction are not well known. Young and aged mice were therefore submitted to hindlimb IR (2 h ischemia followed by 2 h reperfusion). Skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, calcium retention capacity (CRC) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were determined using high resolution respirometry, spectrofluorometry and electronic paramagnetic resonance. IR-induced impairment in mitochondrial respiration was enhanced in old animals (V<inf>ADP</inf>; from 33.0 &plusmn; 2.4 to 18.4 &plusmn; 3.8 and 32.8 &plusmn; 1.3 to 5.9 &plusmn; 2.7 pmol/s/mg wet weight; &minus;44.2 &plusmn; 11.4% vs. &minus;82.0 &plusmn; 8.1%, in young and aged mice, respectively). Baseline CRC was lower in old animals and IR similarly decreased the CRC in both groups (from 11.8 &plusmn; 0.9 to 4.6 &plusmn; 0.9 and 5.5 &plusmn; 0.9 to 2.1 &plusmn; 0.3 &micro;mol/mg dry weight; &minus;60.9 &plusmn; 7.3 and &minus;60.9 &plusmn; 4.6%, in young and aged mice, respectively). Further, IR-induced ROS production tended to be higher in aged mice. In conclusion, aging exacerbated the deleterious effects of IR on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration, potentially in relation to an increased oxidative stress.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalcium 3aelderly 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahindlimbs 3aischemia 3amice 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3areactive oxygen species 3arisk factors 3askeletal muscle1 aCharles, Anne-Laure 1 aGeorg, Isabelle 1 aGoupilleau, Fabienne 1 aMeyer, Alain 1 aKindo, Michel 1 aLaverny, Gilles 1 aMetzger, Daniel 1 aGeny, Bernard 0 tAntioxidants.g2019 June 08, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox80601683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02630naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010700174520143200281592002801713650001501741650001801756650003401774650002301808650001501831650001101846650001901857650001601876650002001892653001801912653001001930653001201940653002201952653002001974700006001994773009102054856009002145852000902235655001202244IND60713191520221120044702.0220103e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071319152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1285712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, Shweta10aRiver water treatment using electrocoagulation for removal of acetaminophen and natural organic matter  aElectrocoagulation (EC) was assessed for removal of acetaminophen and natural organic matter (measured as UV₂₅₄) from river water. Process was assessed for time, electrode materials, inter electrode distance, and voltage. Best conditions for removal of acetaminophen and UV₂₅₄ absorbance were 60 min reaction time, aluminum-aluminum electrodes, 2 cm inter electrode distance, and 9 V. Acetaminophen tested at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 mg L⁻¹ showed that treatment efficiency decreased as the concentration increased. The main mechanism for removal of acetaminophen was H bonding with Al(OH)₃ flocs; this was confirmed by XRD and FT-IR spectrum. Pseudo-second order kinetics model exhibited a good fit on experimental data for acetaminophen removal at different concentrations. Univariate ANOVA indicated statistically significant difference between treatments for acetaminophen removal (F₂.₇₆ = 136, P = <0.001). A significant linear correlation was found between UV₂₅₄ absorbance and acetaminophen removal at different concentrations. Preliminary analysis suggest that EC will cost US$ 0.22/m³ for river water treatment. The lab-scale EC process was compared with a full-scale water treatment plant for removal of natural organic matter. Water treatment plant after multiple levels of purification was not able to fully remove UV₂₅₄ absorbance whereas EC treatment showed good efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aacetaminophen 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrocoagulation 3aelectrodes 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3ariver water 3awater treatment 0aAcetaminophen 0aUV254 0aAl(OH)3 0aReaction kinetics 0aWater treatment1 aKumar, R.

Many viruses have evolved mechanisms for generating their own cap structures with methylation at the N7 position of the capped guanine and the ribose 2′-Oposition of the first nucleotide, which help viral RNAs escape recognition by the host innate immune system. The RNA genomes of coronavirus were identified to have 5′-caps in the early 1980s. However, for decades the RNA capping mechanisms of coronaviruses remained unknown. Since 2003, the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has drawn increased attention and stimulated numerous studies on the molecular virology of coronaviruses. Here, we review the current understanding of the mechanisms adopted by coronaviruses to produce the 5′-cap structure and methylation modification of viral genomic RNAs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA transport 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3agenome 3aguanine 3ainnate immunity 3amessenger RNA 3amethylation 3aribose 3atranslation (genetics) 3avirology 3aviruses1 aGuo, Deyin0 tVirologica Sinica.g2016 Feb., v. 31, no. 1 p.3-11dSpringer Singaporex1674-07697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12250-016-3726-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245011900178300001400297520178100311592002802092650001202120650001302132650002302145650001202168650002302180650001102203650001702214650001802231650001202249650001502261650002002276650002602296650000902322650001702331651001402348651001402362700002102376700002002397700002402417773009702441856008402538852000902622655001202631IND50059496920221117171642.0141111e20121115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005949692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2012.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZalesny, Ronald S., Jr.13aAn approach for siting poplar energy production systems to increase productivity and associated ecosystem services  ap. 45-58.  aShort rotation woody crops such as Populus spp. and their hybrids (i.e., poplars) are a significant component of the total biofuels and bioenergy feedstock resource in the USA.

We confirmed the validity of this mapping technique by sampling and assessing biotic variables within locations identified on the maps. Lastly, we estimated potential poplar productivity within identified areas using a process-based growth model (3-PG) to determine spatial distribution of productive lands across the study area. Overall, eligible lands suitable for poplar production systems totaled 373,630ha across both states, representing 30.8% of the study area and a total potential aboveground yield at the end of a 10-year rotation of 36.2–42.6dryTg. Poplar biomass ranged from 9.5±0.3 to 11.9±0.2dryMgha⁻¹yr⁻¹ across both states, with an overall mean of 10.0±0.1dryMgha⁻¹yr⁻¹. While this novel approach was validated for Minnesota and Wisconsin, our methodology was developed to be useful across a wide range of geographic conditions, irrespective of intra-regional variability in site and climate parameters. Thus, this information is vital for siting poplar energy production systems to increase productivity and associated ecosystem services, and is widely applicable to woody biomass production systems worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3aclimate 3aecosystem services 3aenergy 3aenergy crops 3agrowth models 3ahybrids 3aland cover 3aland use change 3aproduction technology 3asoil 3aspatial data 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin1 aDonner, Deahn M.1 aCoyle, David R.1 aHeadlee, William L.0 tForest ecology and management.g2012 Nov. 15, v. 284 p.45-58dElsevier B.V.x0378-11277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2012.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02833naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245007400179300001600253520147800269592002801747650004401775650002801819650001401847650001501861650001301876650001801889650001501907650002001922650001901942650001301961650001301974650003301987650002202020650001602042650001902058653002502077653002202102653001702124700002102141700002102162773009802183856008502281852000902366655001202375IND60693037820221120223346.0200504e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069303782DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2015.11323692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYusefi, Mina Ghandehari10aHydrophobic modification of PVDF membranes for biodiesel purification  ap. 263-270.  aIn this study, Nafion® solution was utilized to modify the surface of commercial polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane in order to enhance the hydrophobicity of membrane for biodiesel purification. In order to modify the membranes, the commercial PVDF membranes were dipped in Nafion® solution for different coating times (0, 3, 5, 7, 10 min) at constant pressure and temperature. The modified membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra, contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy and purification experiments. The presence of Nafion® functional groups in the membrane structure was indicated by FTIR spectra at around 1970 cm⁻¹ 1057 cm⁻¹. The contact angle measurements exhibited that the surface contact angle of the membranes was increased by increasing the coating time in the Nafion® solution. The SEM images showed that coating the Nafion® solution caused a reduction in porosity, pore size and surface roughness of modified membrane. This reduction was increased with increasing in coating time in Nafion® solution. Thus, the denser membrane with less porosity was produced for modified PVDF membranes. The modified membranes were applied for purification of biodiesel produced from canola oil using dead end filtration cell. The results show that the yield of biodiesel production was increased with increasing in coating time while biodiesel flux was decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiodiesel 3acanola oil 3acoatings 3acontact angle 3afiltration 3afuel production 3ahydrophobicity 3amoieties 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface roughness 3atemperature 3athermoplastics 0ahydrophobic membrane 0aNafion® solution 0amodification1 aRahimpour, Ahmad1 aMehdipour, Hasan0 tBiofuels.g2016 May 3, v. 7, no. 3 p.263-270dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2015.11323693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169300001800288520133900306592002801645650001601673650001501689650002201704650002501726650002301751650001701774650001101791650002001802650002101822650001801843650001301861650001201874650001101886650001901897650001301916650001301929650001801942653002201960653006001982653002702042653002402069700001302093700005702106700001702163700001302180700001502193700001902208700001202227700005802239700005702297773014302354856008502497852000902582655001202591IND60681904720221119133359.0200121e20191217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068190472DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b058462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhi-Kun10aLewis Acid-Facilitated Deep Eutectic Solvent (DES) Pretreatment for Producing High-Purity and Antioxidative Lignin  ap. 1050-1057.  aDue to its low cost and green nature, pretreatment of lignocelluloses using deep eutectic solvents (DESs) is a promising approach for dissociation of lignocelluloses and extraction of lignin. However, pureChCl/glycerol DES has been found to be ineffective for this purpose. In this work, we develop a strategy of introducing Lewis acids (AlCl₃, FeCl₃, FeCl₂, ZnCl₂, and CuCl₂) into ChCl/glycerol for efficient pretreatment of hybrid Pennisetum energy grass in order to produce high-purity and antioxidative lignin. Furthermore, the structural characteristics of the regenerated lignin isolated using the DES pretreatment were comprehensively investigated. The results revealed that the FeCl₃-catalyzed DES pretreatment facilitated fractionation of the regenerated lignin. It was observed that the amount of ether linkages in the regenerated lignin decreased gradually with increasing pretreatment severity. Furthermore, it was found that the amount of phenolic hydroxyl groups in the regenerated lignin was sharply increased. The regenerated lignin isolated after the DES pretreatment showed excellent antioxidant activity. It is concluded that a deep understanding of the fundamental chemistry of lignin during the Lewis acid-catalyzed DES pretreatment will be beneficial for the optimization of the pretreatment process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aPennisetum 3aaluminum chloride 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalytic activity 3adissociation 3aenergy 3aferric chloride 3aferrous chloride 3afractionation 3aglycerol 3agrasses 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amoieties 3asolvents 3azinc chloride 0ahybrid Pennisetum 0aLewis acid-catalyzed deep eutectic solvent pretreatment 0aAntioxidant activities 0aStructural features1 aHong, Si1 aWen, Jia-long1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0156-53721 aMa, Cheng-Ye1 aTang, Lv1 aJiang, Hao1 aChen, Jun Jie,1 aLi, Sha1 aShen, Xiaojun,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5626-39911 aYuan, Tong-Qi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1854-938X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Dec. 17, v. 8, no. 2 p.1050-1057dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b058463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02435naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001900146245013600165300001600301520131100317592002801628650001101656650001201667650002301679650002101702650001201723650001101735650002601746700001601772700001801788700001701806700002101823700001801844773011901862852000901981856008301990655001202073IND2320982220221120071613.0181021e200004  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232098222DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517500070004082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakida, Tomiji10aDyeing and Mechanical Properties of Cotton Fabrics Treated with Sodium Hydroxide/Liquid Ammonia and Liquid Ammonia/Sodium Hydroxide  ap. 328-332.  aDesized and scoured cotton fabric is treated in a two-step process with sodium hydroxide/ liquid ammonia and liquid ammonia/sodium hydroxide to investigate the effect of the treat ment sequence. Crystallinity, moisture regain, water absorbency, dyeability, and KES mechan ical properties are measured. Despite a considerable decrease in crystallinity with both treatments, water absorbency decreases with NaOH/NH₃ and increases with NH₃/NaOH compared with the untreated fabric. Furthermore, the NaOH/NH₃ treatment decreases the early dyeing rate with CI Direct Blue 1, whereas the NH ₃/NaOH treatment increases the rate remarkably compared to the untreated fabric. Nevertheless, saturation dye uptake with the same dye increases with both treatments compared with the untreated. As a measure of fabric hand, shearing and bending hysteresis curves are obtained with a KES instrument. The shearing modulus and shearing hysteresis width of the NaOH/NH₃ treated fabric are much smaller than those of the NH3 treated fabric, while those of the NH₃/NaOH treated fabric are smaller compared with the NaOH treated fabric. From these results, it is clear that two-step processes such as NaOH/NH₃ and NH₃/NaOH are much more effective for softening hand than the NH3 and NaOH treatments independently.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3afabrics 3achemical treatment 3asodium hydroxide 3aammonia 3adyeing 3amechanical properties1 aKida, Kyoko1 aLee, Muncheul1 aBae, Soyeung1 aYoshioka, Hiromu1 aYanai, Yuichi0 tTextile research journal.g2000 Apr., v. 70, no. 4 p.328-332dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517500070004083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01476naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245013200163300001800295520028000313592002800593650002400621650001100645650002100656650002300677650002500700650002900725650001000754650002000764700001800784700005900802700005300861773012000914856008301034852000901117655001201126IND60637596720221120144427.0190419e20190404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063759672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b007862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGui, Jiao10aVisible-Light-Mediated Sulfonylimination of Tertiary Amines with Sulfonylazides Involving Cₛₚ₃–Cₛₚ₃ Bond Cleavage  ap. 2804-2807.  aVisible-light-induced cross-coupling of arylsulfonyl azides with tertiaryamines in the presence of Eosin Y at room temperature has been achieved.

The cloud layer is lifting, causing warmer and drier conditions. With climate change, tropical ecosystems have the potential to accentuate global CO2 emissions because of their significant influence over global C cycling. Unfortunately, we do not know how this will affect belowground communities, like soil fungi, and the vital ecosystem processes they control. We performed a soil translocation experiment along an elevation gradient in Monteverde, Costa Rica to assess how fungal communities, soil decomposition, and extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) of C-degrading enzymes may shift with climate change. Soils were translocated to four lower elevation sites. These sites spanned 4 °C increases in temperature and a 20% decline in soil moisture. We used microbial cages to isolate the fungal community and monitor how soil fungi would respond to warmer, drier conditions. Fungal abundance and diversity increased with warmer and drier conditions. Fungal communities also shifted. Specifically, we found changes in the richness of fungal phyla. Richness of lichen-forming fungi, pathogens, wood saprotrophs, and yeasts increased. In addition, we found that EEA was higher under warmer and drier conditions. Our results suggest that high elevation soils may shift towards an increased capacity to decompose C under future climate conditions. Moreover, with climate change, animals or plants in tropical montane cloud forests may be exposed to a greater richness of fungal pathogens. Overall, our study reveals that the lifting cloud layer may affect the fungal community within these forests, which in turn may affect both the structure and function of these forests.  aPublisher supplied data  cAnimal and Plant Health Inspection Servicedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100009168  cEDdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000138  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSEPAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000139  cUniversity of California, Irvine0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaltitude 3aanimals 3acages 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3aextracellular enzymes 3afungal communities 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3apathogens 3aplants (botany) 3asaprotrophs 3asoil fungi 3asoil water 3atemperature 3atropical montane cloud forests 3awood 3ayeasts 3aCosta Rica 0aClimate change 0aDecomposition 0aExtracellular enzyme activity 0aFungi 0aTranslocation 0aTropical montane cloud forests1 aTreseder, Kathleen K.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 Feb., v. 117 p.87-96dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04518naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003500134024001200169040001800181100002000199245011600219300001800335506017300353520250200526592002803028650001803056650001103074650001303085650002403098650001603122650001003138650001203148650001503160650002703175650001203202650001103214650002603225650002503251650001003276651001203286700002103298700002203319700002203341700002003363700001903383700002503402700001503427700002103442700001703463700001903480773011803499856011403617856008203731956008503813961000903898852000903907655001203916IND60585154520221214225009.0171103e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058515452DNAL7 a3350002aris7 a10113/58515452hdl7 a10.1007/s10722-017-0505-52doi8 ans13528  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMezghani, Najla10aMultivariate analysis of morphological diversity among closely related Daucus species and subspecies in Tunisia  ap. 2145-2159.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe genus Daucus includes about 20–25 species worldwide. Northern Africa represents a major center of diversity of Daucus, with Tunisia thought to contain 11 species and seven subspecies. The greatest taxonomic problems, however, and the greatest economic importance relative to immediate use in breeding, is in a group of species and subspecies in the Daucus carota L. clade, all containing 2n = 18 chromosomes. We assessed morphological diversity from a Daucus L. germplasm collection of nine individuals each from 45 accessions (405 individuals in total), at the National Gene Bank of Tunisia, of the following wild and one cultivated members of this clade: D. carota subsp. capillifolius (Gilli) Arbizu, D. carota subsp. carota, D. carota subsp. gummifer (Syme) Hook. f., D. carota subsp. sativus (Hoffm.) Arcangeli (cultivated), D. sahariensis Murb., and putative hybrids of D. carota subsp. carota and subsp. capillifolius. A prior study showed the effectiveness of fruit characters to identify several species and subspecies in the collection, but distinction between some closely related D. carota subspecies was difficult. In order to resolve the taxonomic classification, we tested 32 quantitative and qualitative morphological characters from leaves, stems and flowers on a field collection of 45 accessions corresponding to the different species/subspecies. The Shannon–Weaver diversity (H’) index was used to study the phenotypic diversity. The estimated H’ ranged from monomorphic for umbel type, position of involucral bracts on primary umbel, anther color, and symmetry of peripheral flowers to highly polymorphic for other traits. The highest (0.98) and the lowest (0.26) H’ values were recorded for flowering pattern within plants and foliage coverage. Multivariate analyses of principal components and dendrograms of all data and canonical discriminate analysis of the quantitative data supported the subdivision of the Daucus collection into five groups with various degrees of distinctness: (1) D. sahariensis, (2) D. carota subsp. capillifolius, (3) D. carota subsp. carota, very similar to (4) D. carota subsp. gummifer, and (5) D. carota subsp. sativus intergrading with putative hybrids between D. carota subsp. capillifolius and D. carota subsp. carota. Individual character state distribution plots provide useful characters and insights into taxonomic problems in the D. carota clade that we here discuss in reference to ongoing molecular studies in Daucus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaucus carota 3abracts 3abreeding 3acenter of diversity 3achromosomes 3acolor 3aflowers 3agene banks 3agermplasm conservation 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3amultivariate analysis 3aphenotypic variation 3astems 3aTunisia1 aBen Amor, Jihene1 aSpooner, David M.1 aSimon, Phillip W.1 aMezghani, Neila1 aBoubaker, Hiba1 aM’rad Namji, Ahmed1 aRouz, Slim1 aHannachi, Cherif1 aNeffati, M.,1 aTarchoun, Neji0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2017 Dec., v. 64, no. 8 p.2145-2159dSpringer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/58515453Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-017-0505-53Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/335000.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02043naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012500172300001600297520084700313592002801160650001101188650001401199650002001213650001901233650001401252650003101266650001001297650002001307650001001327650001501337653002401352653002401376653001601400653001801416700001901434773009801453856008501551852000901636655001201645IND60693037920221120223344.0200504e20160503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069303792DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2015.11323702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilambarasan, R.10aEffects of nano additives on performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with Annona methyl ester  ap. 271-277.  aThe aim of the present study is to analyze the effect of nano additives of zinc oxide particles on engine performance and emissions characteristics of a diesel engine fuelled with Annona methyl ester (A20) as a fuel. The zinc oxide particles was added to various blends of A20 such as 80% diesel + 20% Annona methyl ester, 80% diesel + 20% Annona methyl ester + 50 ppm zinc oxide particles, 80% diesel + 20% Annona methyl ester + 50 ppm zinc oxide. The AME (A20) was mixed with zinc oxide particles with the aid of a ultrasonicator. Results show that addition of zinc oxide additive improves the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and reduces specific fuel consumption at full load conditions. The zinc oxide additive is effective in control of hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), smoke and oxides of nitrogen (NOₓ) at full load conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona 3aadditives 3acarbon monoxide 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuels 3anitrogen oxides 3asmoke 3azinc oxide 0aAnnona methyl ester 0atransesterification 0aperformance 0adiesel engine1 aCentil, Irā.,0 tBiofuels.g2016 May 3, v. 7, no. 3 p.271-277dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2015.11323703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245018300168300001800351520067300369592002801042650001201070650002301082650002301105650002401128650002201152653004301174653002501217653002301242653003001265653002601295700001801321700002101339700002101360773008101381856008101462852000901543655001201552IND60551439520221122200753.0161018e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055143952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.10.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinozzi, Maura10aMicrowave-assisted cycloaddition of diisopropyl diazomethylphosphonate to electron-deficient alkenes: synthesis of multifunctionalized phosphonopyrazolynes and phosphonopyrazoles  ap. 9485-9491.  aAn efficient method for the synthesis of functionalized phosphonopyrazolines has been developed. The procedure involved the microwave-assisted cycloaddition of diisopropyl diazomethylphosphonate to dipolarophiles, such as α,β-unsaturated-nitriles and -esters, performed in neat conditions. By oxidative aromatization the phosphonopyrazolines, thus obtained, were converted into the corresponding phosphonopyazoles. Alternatively, phosphonopyazoles could be obtained by a one-pot, two step procedure directly from dipolarophiles, thus avoiding the isolation of the intermediate pyrazolines.

In 2006, multi-national plant expeditions collected eight fine-leafed Festuca rubra L. (2n = 6x–8x) accessions from the harsh semi-arid rangelands of Kyrgyzstan (KGZ) and the People’s Republic of China (CHN) that may have potential for use in western U.S. rangelands. Morphological and marker-based genetic analyses compared these collections with nine commercial cultivars, and four previously described high performance KGZ F. valesiaca Schleich. ex Gaudin subsp. valesiaca plant introductions in the high desert of the U.S. Great Basin. Initially, accession morphology was evaluated over 3 years at Blue Creek, UT for relative vigor, height, width, total biomass, persistence, and seed yield. Subsequently, a subset of the F. rubra accessions and checks were evaluated at three locations (Malta, ID, Blue Creek, UT, and North Logan, UT) over 2 years. All entries differed for all traits over years and locations in both trials, and CHN PI 659984 was consistently the best performing F. rubra entry examined. Marker-based genetic comparisons differentiated the F. rubra from the F. valesiaca accessions and the Festuca checks examined, and the F. rubra accessions based on ploidy and geographic origin. Because the F. rubra accessions examined were erect (25.5–76.4 cm), green during summer months, and rhizomatous with substantial seed fecundity under harsh semi-arid growing conditions, they have potential for inclusion in plant improvement programs for increased sustainability and wildfire control of western U.S. rangelands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFestuca rubra 3abasins 3abiomass 3acultivars 3adrought tolerance 3afecundity 3agenetic analysis 3agermplasm 3agrasses 3aintroduced plants 3alandscapes 3aplant improvement 3aploidy 3aprovenance 3arangelands 3aseed yield 3asummer 3avigor 3awildland fire management 3aChina 3aIdaho 3aKyrgyzstan 3aUtah1 aStaub, Jack E.1 aBushman, B.

The traditional process to prepare DOTP is costly and complicated, thus it is very necessary to find an efficient and environmentally-friendly way to obtain DOTP. In this study, we prepared DOTP from the alcoholysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by using 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (2-EH) as the solvent, and used choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents (ChCl-based DESs) as the catalysts due to their cheapness, low toxicity and ease of preparation. Under the optimized conditions (ChCl/Zn(Ac)₂ 1 : 1, 5 wt%, 180 °C, 60 min, PET : 2-EH 1 : 5 molar ratio), the conversion of PET and the yield of DOTP were 100% and 84.7%, respectively. Furthermore, the possible mechanism was proposed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results. It revealed that the hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) formed between 2-EH and DESs played a key role in accelerating the degradation process. Furthermore, the kinetics of the reaction was also investigated, and the results indicated that the alcoholysis of PET is a first-order reaction with an activation energy of 95.05 kJ mol⁻¹. This work confirmed that ChCl-based DESs are favorable for the degradation of PET to prepare DOTP under mild conditions, which can also be used for other polymer degradation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalcoholysis 3acatalysts 3acholine 3adensity functional theory 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen bonding 3aplasticizers 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3asolvents 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aLu, Xingmei1 aJu, Zhaoyang1 aLiu, Bo1 aYao, Haoyu1 aXu, Junli1 aZhou, Qing1 aHu, Yufeng1 aZhang, Suojiang0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 Feb. 18, v. 21, no. 4 p.897-906dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc03791d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01549naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011100157300002000268520041000288592002800698650001400726650002200740650002300762650001900785650001700804650001200821650001300833650001300846650001500859700002300874700002100897700001900918700002000937773013500957856007401092852000901166655001201175IND60639008320221118073414.0190501e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063900832DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc07793e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasai, Shota12aA chemical proteomic probe for detecting native carrier protein motifs in nonribosomal peptide synthetases  ap. 14129-14132.  aDerivatization of a 5′-(vinylsulfonylaminodeoxy)adenosine scaffold with a clickable functionality provided an activity-based probe that was used to label native carrier protein (CP) motifs in nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs).

Besides molecular markers and diverse phenotypic traits the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, enabling throughput metabolic fingerprinting, was used for the description of the germplasm collection. We used sophisticated multivariable analysis to integrate the data for structure analysis and to establish mutual relationships. We found that the accessions diversity across the eco-geographical variables was manifested differently depending on selected phenotypic, genetic, and metabolic criteria. Grain metabolic fingerprint derived from FTIR spectroscopy revealed the highest degree of germplasm diversity among all of the examined traits, particularly for spectral bands assigned to lipids. The landraces, which were collected in close geographical proximity, showed clear morphological and metabolic resemblances, although they represented quite different genetic backgrounds. All three levels of analysis showed the presence of selection resulting from environmental pressures and more specifically from the temperature at the landrace origin site.

Nitrate-N in runoff was isotopically heavier than NO3−-N in atmospheric deposition, indicating export of organically-cycled NO3−. Constant N2O concentrations in porewater profiles contrasted with a shift toward higher δ15N-N2O values upward. In the 60-30 cm depth interval, a significant negative correlation between δ15N-NO3- and δ15N-N2O values was observed. Higher δ15N values of residual NO3− in the deepest peat layer reflected higher rates of NO3− reduction. Isotopically heavier N2O-N at shallower depths corresponded to residual N2O following partial reduction to N2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric deposition 3abogs 3adenitrification 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3anitrous oxide production 3apeat 3apeatlands 3arunoff 3astable isotopes 0aNitrate 0aNitrous oxide 0aIsotopes 0aPeat 0aDenitrification1 aSuarez, Silvia Parra1 aGebauer, Gerhard1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1577-75011 aThoma, Michael1 aBuzek, Frantisek1 aCejkova, Bohuslava1 aJackova, Ivana1 aStepanova, Marketa1 aPrechova, Eva1 aCurik, Jan1 aVeselovsky, Frantisek1 aValkova, Ivana1 aBláha, Vladimír,1 aFottova, Daniela1 aKomárek, Arnošt,0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2018 Mar. 20, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245008900167300001600256520093400272592002801206650001601234650001501250650002601265650001001291650001701301650001401318650001601332700001701348700002501365700002001390700002301410773012501433856004601558852000901604655001201613IND6015333820221117192815.0170526e20120420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND601533382DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12183182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarla, Robert J.

Although these defects, known as dislocations, potentially contribute to the attenuation of seismic waves in Earth’s upper mantle, evidence for dislocation damping from laboratory studies has been circumstantial. We experimentally determined the shear modulus and associated strain-energy dissipation in pre-deformed synthetic olivine aggregates under high pressures and temperatures. Enhanced high-temperature background dissipation occurred in specimens pre-deformed by dislocation creep in either compression or torsion, the enhancement being greater for prior deformation in torsion. These observations suggest the possibility of anisotropic attenuation in relatively coarse-grained rocks where olivine is or was deformed at relatively high stress by dislocation creep in Earth’s upper mantle.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeformation 3ageophysics 3amodulus of elasticity 3arocks 3ashear stress 3atectonics 3atemperature1 aJackson, Ian1 aFitz Gerald, John D.1 aFaul, Ulrich H.1 aZimmerman, Mark E.0 tScience.g2012 Apr. 20, v. 336, no. 6079 p.332-335dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1218318  aDNAL 7aarticle02285naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011900163300001600282520113500298592002801433650004401461650001701505650002601522650001801548650001101566650001501577650001501592650002101607651001201628700002301640700002301663700001701686700002501703773009301728856008101821852000901902655001201911IND60514330320221120190028.0160227e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051433032DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0255-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirri, Aziz10aFTIR Spectroscopy and PLS-DA Classification and Prediction of Four Commercial Grade Virgin Olive Oils from Morocco  ap. 974-981.  aFourier transform infrared (FTIR) coupled to chemometrics was shown to be a useful method to classify and predict the quality of four commercial grade virgin olive oils (VOO). FTIR and physicochemical data were collected using a set of 70 samples representing extra virgin (EV), virgin (V), ordinary virgin (OV), and lampante (L) commercial grade olive oils collected in Beni Mellal region (central Morocco). Two partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models using physicochemical data and FTIR data were established and compared. The PLS-DA model using only physicochemical data was not accurate enough to distinguish satisfactorily among OV, V, and EV olive oil grades. On the contrary, the PLS-DA model on FTIR data was better in the calibration, able to describe 98 % of the spectral information and predicting 93 % of the VOO grades. In the external validation, this PLS-DA model accurately classified VOO commercial grades with prediction accuracy of 100 %. The proposed procedure is fast, nondestructive, simple, and easy to operate, and it is recommended for the quick monitoring of olive oil’s quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3achemometrics 3adiscriminant analysis 3aleast squares 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3avirgin olive oil 3aMorocco1 aBassbasi, Mahfould1 aPlatikanov, Stefan1 aTauler, Roma1 aOussama, Abdelkhalek0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.974-981dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0255-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245008400154300001800238500002000256520153600276592002801812650001701840650002501857650002701882650002201909650001201931650001901943650001701962651001001979700001901989700001502008700001802023700002102041773013802062856007302200852000902273655001202282IND60651668820221120131812.0190712e20140829xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065166882DNAL7 a10.3390/su60957632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Wenze10aDynamics of Multi-Scale Intra-Provincial Regional Inequality in Zhejiang, China  ap. 5763-5784.  aJournal Article  aThis paper investigates regional inequality in a multi-scale framework, using Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis, based on the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of counties and municipalities within the Zhejiang province in China between the years of 1990 and 2010. A Spatial Markov Chain is used to identify the dynamics of regional wealth disparity in Zhejiang. The results show that the regional inequality of Zhejiang is sensitive to the geographic scale of the analysis. In addition, the inter-county inequality shows an inverted-U shape pattern. At the same time, the inter-municipality inequality displays a more consistently upward trend, and the evolution of the interregional inequality is relatively stable over time. The regional inequality is more significant at finer (larger) spatial scales. The decomposition of the Theil Index shows that the contribution of the inequalities between Northeast Zhejiang and Southwest Zhejiang increased. The increasingly larger values of the Global Moran’s I show that there is an intensifying spatial aggregation of economic development. The comparison of the traditional Markov transition matrix and the Spatial Markov transition matrix illustrates how the relative wealth or poverty of neighboring counties make a significance difference in wealth in a given county as measured using domestic GDP per capita in Zhejiang province. This space-time analysis is valuable for policy making towards sustainable economic development in China given the soaring spatial inequality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aeconomic development 3agross domestic product 3aissues and policy 3apoverty 3aspace and time 3aspatial data 3aChina1 aZhang, Yuntang1 aYe, Xinyue1 aCheng, Yeqing1 aLeipnik, Mark R.0 tSustainability.g2014 Aug. 29, v. 6, no. 9 p.5763-5784dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su60957633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01651naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245009300165300002000258520053500278592002800813650001100841650002100852650002300873650001100896650000900907650001400916650000900930700002100939700001600960700001800976700002600994700002101020700001701041773013601058856007401194852000901268655001201277IND60639005520221118073446.0190501e20161027xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063900552DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc07705f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, David Junghoon,10aCNTs grown on nanoporous carbon from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks for supercapacitors  ap. 13016-13019.  aCarbon nanotubes (CNT) grown on nanoporous carbon (NPC), which yields coexisting amorphous and graphitic nanoarchitectures, have been prepared on a large scale from zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) by introducing bimetallic ions (Co²⁺ and Zn²⁺).

S116-S129.  aExcess alcohol exposure leads to alcoholic liver disease (ALD), a predominant cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to understand the association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) and ALD. In this review, we summarize the metabolism of n-3 PUFAs, animal model of ALD, and the findings from recent studies determining the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD as a possible treatment. The animal models of acute ethanol exposure, chronic ethanol exposure and chronic-plus-single binge ethanol feeding have been widely used to explore the impact of n-3 PUFAs. Although the results of studies regarding the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD have been inconsistent or controversial, increasing evidence has demonstrated that n-3 PUFAs may be useful in alleviating alcoholic steatosis and alcohol-induced liver injury through multiple mechanisms, including decreased de novo lipogenesis and lipid mobilization from adipose tissue, enhanced mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, reduced hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress, and promoted intestinal homeostasis, positively suggesting that n-3 PUFAs might be promising for the management of ALD. The oxidation of n-3 PUFAs ex vivo in an experimental diet was rarely considered in most n-3 PUFA-related studies, likely contributing to the inconsistent results. Thus, the role of n-3 PUFAs in ALD deserves greater research efforts and remains to be evaluated in randomized, placebo-controlled clinic trial.ABBREVIATIONAAarachidonic acid ACCacetyl-CoA carboxylase ACLYATP-citrate lyase ACOacyl-CoA oxidase ALAα-linolenic acid ALDalcoholic liver disease ALPalkaline phosphatase ALTalanine aminotransferase AMPKAMP-activated protein kinase ASTaspartate aminotransferase ATGLadipose triglyceride lipase cAMPcyclic adenosine 3’,5’-monophosphate COXcyclooxygenases CPT1carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 CYP2E1cytochrome P450 2E1 DGAT2diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 DGLAdihomo-γ-linolenic acid DHAdocosahexaenoic acid DPAdocosapentaenoic acid DTAdocosatetraenoic acid EPAeicosapentaenoic acid ERendoplasmic reticulum ETAeicosatetraenoic acid FASfatty acid synthase FATPsfatty acid transporter proteins GLA,γlinolenic acid GPR120G protein-coupled receptor 120 GSHglutathione; H&Ehaematoxylin-eosin; HO-1heme oxygenase-1; HSLhormone-sensitive lipase; IL-6interleukin-6 iNOSnitric oxide synthase LAlinoleic acid LBPlipopolysaccharide binding protein LOXlipoxygenases LXRliver X receptor LXREsLXR response elements MCP-1monocyte chemotactic protein-1 MTPmicrosomal triglyceride transfer protein MUFAmonounsaturated fatty acids MyD88myeloid differentiation factor 88 n-3 PUFAsomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid NAFLDnonalcoholic fatty liver disease NASHnonalcoholic steatohepatitis NF-κBtranscription factor nuclear factor κB PDE3Bphosphodiesterase 3B PPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor ROSreactive oxygen species RXRretinoid X receptor SCD-1stearyl CoA desaturase-1 SDAstearidonic acid SFAsaturated fatty acids SIRT1sirtuin 1 SODsuperoxide dismutase SREBPsterol regulatory element-binding protein TBtotal bilirubin TCtotal cholesterol TGtriacylglycerol TLR4Toll-like receptor-4 TNF-αtumor necrosis factor-α VLDLRvery low-density lipoprotein receptor WTwild type; ZO-1zonula occludens-1  aThe work was supported by the grants from the Research Committee of the University of Macau (MYRG2017-00035-ICMS to JB Wan), Macao Science and Technology Development Fund (065/2018/A2 to JB Wan) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, No. 81503288).  aPublisher supplied data  aMYRG2017-00035-ICMS to JB Wancthe Research Committee of the University of Macau  a065/2018/A2 to JB WancMacao Science and Technology Development Fund  aNSFC, No. 81503288cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  cFundo para o Desenvolvimento das Ciências e da Tecnologia  cResearch Committee of University of Macau 3aadipose tissue 3aanimal models 3abeta oxidation 3abilirubin 3achemotaxis 3acholesterol 3aethanol 3aexperimental diets 3afatty liver 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein receptors 3amitochondria 3amorbidity 3amortality 3anecrosis 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3aprotein kinases 3aresponse elements 3areticulum 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atransport proteins 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atriacylglycerols 0aAlcoholic liver disease 0aalcoholic steatosis 0aintestinal homeostasis 0ainflammation 0an-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 0aoxidative stress1 aMa, Li-Juan1 aYang, Yan1 aXiao, Zeyu1 aWan, Jian-Bo0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2019 June 27, v. 59, no. sup1 p.S116-S129dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2018.15445423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009300166300001600259520098500275592002801260650002001288650001801308650002201326650002001348650001001368650003201378650003501410650001601445650000901461650004301470650001801513650005201531650001301583700001501596700001301611700001801624700001901642700001701661773009301678856008101771852000901852655001201861IND60514330620221120185930.0160227e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051433062DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0271-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shuangfang10aReal-Time TaqMan PCR for Rapid Detection and Quantification of Coliforms in Chilled Meat  ap. 813-822.  aColiforms are a major group of bacteria associated with spoilage of refrigerated pork. It is necessary to develop an efficient and fast method to detect total coliforms in chilled pork because the traditional methods are laborious and time-consuming. In this study, a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) targeting the lacZ gene was developed for rapid enumeration of coliforms from chilled pork. Of the 106 strains tested, 35 coliform strains and one Shigella sonnei strain were correctly identified compared with 70 control strains which failed to amplify. Detection sensitivity was 112 CFU/g. The assay was able to detect and accurately quantify the total coliforms in chilled meat within 2 h without preenrichment. The results indicate that the real-time PCR is an efficient and time-saving method that could be adopted by the meat industry to detect coliforms to replace the traditional most probable number and the rapid coliform count plate methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aShigella sonnei 3achilled meats 3acoliform bacteria 3adetection limit 3agenes 3alivestock and meat industry 3amost probable number technique 3aplate count 3apork 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspoilage1 aYu, Yigang1 aLi, Rong1 aXia, Xingzhou1 aXiao, Xinglong1 aLi, Xiaofeng0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.813-822dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0271-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005500155245018200210500001900392520141800411592002801829650001501857650001601872650001501888650001401903650001401917650000701931650001501938650002401953650001501977653002401992653002502016653001302041653001902054653002102073653000802094653000902102653000902111653000802120653000902128653000702137700001502144773009102159856009002250852000902340655001202349IND60713189520221117160315.0201216e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071318952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1285512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Zhiguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2107-593610aMagnetic Fe3O4@MgAl-LDH@La(OH)3 composites with a hierarchical core-shell structure for phosphate removal from wastewater and inhibition of labile sedimentary phosphorus release  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn order to facilitate recovery and enhance phosphate adsorption capacity of lanthanum (La)-based materials, magnetic Fe₃O₄@MgAl-LDH@La(OH)₃ (MMAL) composites with a hierarchical core-shell structure were synthesized. In the preparation process, citric acid played a vital role in the morphology control of La(OH)₃, deciding the La content and phosphate adsorption capacity of materials. MMAL composites with a citric acid-to-La molar ratio of 0.375 (MMAL-0.375) exhibited a high adsorption capacity of 66.5 mg P/g, fast adsorption kinetics of 30 min, widely applicable pH range of 4.0–10.0, outstanding selective adsorption performance, and superior reusability in batch adsorption experiments. Moreover, the phosphate in the desorption solution could be concentrated by repeated use of desorption solution and recovered by using CaCl₂. When the obtained composites were used for the sedimentary phosphorus sequestration and recovery, the results showed that the addition of MMAL-0.375 effectively reduced the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in the overlying water. Accompanied by an evident increase in HCl-extractable phosphorus (HCl–P), mobile phosphorus (Pₘₒb) in sediments was effectively reduced. This work indicates that the MMAL-0.375 composites can serve as an effective tool for the removal of phosphate from wastewater and the control of sedimentary phosphorus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acitric acid 3adesorption 3alanthanum 3amagnetism 3apH 3aphosphates 3areactive phosphorus 3awastewater 0aMagnetic separation 0aPhosphate adsorption 0aSediment 0aEutrophication 0aLake restoration 0aMMA 0aMMAL 0aLDHs 0aSRP 0aPmob 0aTP1 aChen, Jing0 tChemosphere.g2021 Feb., v. 264 p.128551-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.1285513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005100151245008400202300001600286520141100302592002801713650001501741650002601756650001101782650001301793650001401806650001101820650001901831653002001850653001401870653003601884653002001920700002401940700001501964700001301979700001301992700001902005700001602024700001602040700005702056700005502113773014102168856008502309852000902394655001202403IND60681902320221119131844.0200121e20191115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068190232DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b049012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9891-494810aConfinement of Ag(I) Sites within MIL-101 for Robust Ethylene/Ethane Separation  ap. 823-830.  aEffective utilization of Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbents for practical C₂H₄/C₂H₆ separation urges both good separating performances and high stabilities. In this work, we incorporated AgNO₃ onto a typical metal–organic framework (MOF) of MIL-101 to obtain efficient Ag(I) π-complexation adsorbents. It was found that the separation performances were highly dependent on the location of the AgNO₃, which could be at the interior or the exterior of nanoporous MIL-101. Confining AgNO₃ inside the nanopores of MIL-101 was achieved through employing a double-solvent approach. The resulting AgM-DS adsorbents exhibited superior performances compared with not only pristine MIL-101 but also other modified samples with AgNO₃ at the exterior of MIL-101. To be specific, the optimal 1.6AgM-DS adsorbent secured good C₂H₄/C₂H₆ separation, which is C₂H₄ uptake (75.5 cm³·g–¹) and C₂H₄/C₂H₆ selectivity (9.5) at 100 kPa. For comparison, the C₂H₄ uptakes for MIL-101, 1.6AgM-WI, and 1.6AgM-SG were merely 48.1, 56.0, and 19.4 cm³·g–¹, and the corresponding IAST selectivity was only 1.1, 8.1, and 1.8, respectively. It was further indicated that the 1.6AgM-DS adsorbent maintained good stability for 3 weeks, alleviating the light sensitivity of AgNO₃. This work opens an avenue for constructing stable Ag(I) sites on MOFs to develop π-complexation adsorbents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3acoordination polymers 3aethane 3aethylene 3ananopores 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 0aπ-complexation 0astability 0ametal organic frameworks (MOFs) 0aethylene/ethane1 aZhang, Zhuangzhuang1 aXu, Chunli1 aWu, Hong1 aShi, Lei1 aWang, Shuaijun1 aXu, Xinyuan1 aYuan, Aihua1 aWang, Shaobin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1751-91621 aSun, Hongqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0907-56260 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Nov. 15, v. 8, no. 2 p.823-830dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b049013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03434naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008900171300001800260520146100278536016201739592002801901596002501929596005901954650002502013650002202038650002102060650002902081650001702110650001002127650001602137650001502153650002102168650002002189650001102209650001202220650002502232650002902257650001402286650002002300650001902320650001302339650001002352650001202362650001702374650001002391651001902401653002302420653004002443653002202483653001302505653002102518700002002539700001902559773014802578856008502726852000902811655001202820IND60645981320221118054734.0190605e20190627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064598132DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2018.15517762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurlando, Bruno10aNutritional and medicinal properties of underexploited legume trees from West Africa  ap. S178-S188.  aThis review concerns three legume trees (family Fabaceae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae) from West Africa, namely Detarium microcarpum, Parkia biglobosa and Dialium guineense, and illustrates their nutritional value and therapeutic properties. These species are an important source of nutrition for West African populations, but their agricultural exploitation is still incomplete. The survey was conducted on Scopus, Web of Science, and Medline, using scientific and common English names of the species as keywords and then selecting papers related to nutritional and medicinal properties. Main food products are fruit pulp and seeds, though leaves can also be used. Most relevant dietary features are high protein, vitamin, and micronutrient contents. Various therapeutic and nutritional benefits of these plants have been documented by ethnobotanical and experimental studies, stimulating an interest for their possible use as functional food or drug sources. Most studied medicinal properties include antidiabetic and antimicrobial activities of D. microcarpum, cardiovascular protective and antidiabetic activities of P. biglobosa, and bilharzia-preventing molluscicidal activity of D. guineense. Phytochemical characterizations have revealed potential sources of active drugs, such as D. guineense saponins and D. microcarpum diterpenes. Scientific results support popular uses of these legume trees, indicating a prominent nutritional and health value.  aAuthors were granted by Research Funds from the University of Genova and the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (FFABR Grant MIUR Funds).  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Genova  cItalian Ministry of Education, University and Research 3aDetarium microcarpum 3aDialium guineense 3aParkia biglobosa 3aantimicrobial properties 3aditerpenoids 3adrugs 3aethnobotany 3afruit pulp 3afunctional foods 3aglycemic effect 3aleaves 3alegumes 3amedicinal properties 3amolluscicidal properties 3anutrition 3anutritive value 3aphytochemicals 3asaponins 3aseeds 3asurveys 3atherapeutics 3atrees 3aWestern Africa 0aComplementary food 0aethnomedicine; Detarium microcarpum 0aDialium guineense 0aFabaceae 0aParkia biglobosa1 aPalmero, Silvio1 aCornara, Laura0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2019 June 27, v. 59, no. sup1 p.S178-S188dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl39431x1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2018.15517763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245007300157300002000230520124600250592002801496650001501524650001701539650001701556650001601573650001801589650001201607650001101619650000901630650001401639650001801653650001501671650000701686650001101693650002201704650001701726700001901743700001801762700001601780700001601796773012401812856007401936852000902010655001202019IND60669062920221116192226.0190920e20150727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066906292DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11124b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Weihua10aFurthering the chemosensing of silver nanoclusters for ion detection  ap. 64138-64145.  aLigand-protected metal nanoclusters (NCs) having hydrodynamic diameters and fluorescent properties have reasonable potential for ion detection and bio-imaging applications by taking advantage of their smaller sizes and degradability as compared with larger nanoparticles. By controlling the pH value, here we have synthesized a fluorescent silver nanocluster, Ag–glutathione, which is found to be a versatile chemosensor operative for the detection of both manganese (Mn²⁺) and iodine (I⁻) ions. Mn²⁺ and I⁻ are further distinguished by the ratiometric absorption spectrometry method. Care was taken for sufficient spectral analyses, based upon which we have fully demonstrated the chemosensing mechanisms of Ag@glutathione (Ag@SG) NCs applied in ion detection. Having expounded this issue, we further investigated the potential application of Ag@SG NCs in bio-imaging. It is interesting to find that the as-prepared Ag@SG NCs are nontoxic and available for fluorescence imaging of MCF-7 cells, with on/off alternation of fluorescence emission in the presence of Mn²⁺ or I⁻ ions. The low cytotoxicity, good penetrability and on/off fluorescence property of Ag@SG NCs in MCF-7 cells suggest promising biological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioimaging 3acytotoxicity 3afluorescence 3aglutathione 3ahydrodynamics 3aiodides 3aiodine 3aions 3amanganese 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apH 3asilver 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy1 aHuang, Saipeng1 aGuan, Lingmei1 aLiu, Xianhu1 aLuo, Zhixun0 tRSC advances.g2015 July 27, v. 5, no. 79 p.64138-64145dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11124b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03973naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245007800192300001600270520236400286592002802650650001602678650001902694650002302713650001202736650001302748650001402761650001002775650001602785650001402801650002302815650002102838650001202859650001102871650000902882650001302891650002302904650001202927650002102939650001402960650002302974650004902997651001603046700002903062700002503091700001903116700002503135700001703160700002103177700002403198773010903222856005503331852000903386655001203395IND4473469420221117180629.0120619e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447346942DNAL7 a223092492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.01959.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicolaus, Marion10aSocial environment affects juvenile dispersal in great tits (Parus major)  ap. 827-837.  a1. Habitat selection can affect individual fitness, and therefore, individuals are expected to assess habitat quality of potential breeding sites before settlement. 2. We investigated the role of social environment on juvenile dispersal behaviour in the great tit (Parus major). Two main contradictory hypotheses can be formulated regarding social effects on juvenile dispersal as follows: (i) High fledgling density and sex ratio may enhance the intensity of local (kin) competition and, therefore, reduce individual survival chance, enhance emigration and reduce settlement (‘repulsion’ hypothesis) (ii) Alternatively, high fledgling density and sex ratio may signal high‐quality habitat or lead to aggregation and thus increase individual survival chance, reduce emigration and enhance settlement (‘attraction’ hypothesis). 3. To disentangle positive from negative effects of high density and male‐biased sex ratio on dispersal, we manipulated the social composition of the fledgling population in 12 semi‐isolated nest‐box areas (plots) via a change of fledgling density (low/high) as well as fledgling sex ratio (female‐biased/balanced/male‐biased) across 3 years. We then tested whether experimental variation in male and female fledgling densities affected variation in local survival, emigration and settlement of juveniles, and whether social effects on survival and dispersal support the ‘repulsion’ or ‘attraction’ hypothesis. 4. We found no experimental effects on local survival and emigration probabilities. However, consistent with the ‘attraction’ hypothesis, settlement was significantly and positively affected by local experimental sex ratio in each of the study years: both male and female juveniles avoided female‐biased plots and settled more in plots that were balanced and male‐biased the previous year. 5. Our study provides unprecedented experimental evidence that local sex ratio plays a causal role in habitat selection. We suggest that settlers avoid female‐biased plots because a high proportion of females may reflect the absence or the low quality of local resources in the habitat. Alternatively, male territory acquisition may be facilitated by a high local density of ‘candidate’ males, and therefore, juveniles were less successful in settling in female‐biased plots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParus major 3abreeding sites 3adispersal behavior 3afemales 3ahabitats 3ajuveniles 3amales 3aprobability 3asex ratio 3asocial environment 2aAnimal Migration 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMovement 2aPopulation Density 2aSeasons 2aSex Distribution 2aSex Ratio 2aSocial Environment 2aSongbirdsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 0aNetherlands1 aMichler, Stephanie P.

A missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (NC_037337.1 g.35615224 T > G) in exon 6 of the EIF2AK4 gene which encodes a p.Ile205Ser substitution was observed in the Bovine Genome Variation Database and Selective Signatures (BGVD). The purpose of the current study is to determine the allelic frequency distribution of the locus and analyze its association with thermal tolerance in Chinese indigenous cattle. In our study, the allelic frequency distribution of the missense mutation (NC_037337.1 g.35615224 T > G) in Chinese cattle was analyzed by sequencing 1105 individuals of 37 breeds including 35 Chinese indigenous cattle breeds and two exotic breeds. In particular, association analysis was carried out between the genotypes and three environmental parameters including annual mean temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), and temperature&ndash;humidity index (THI). The frequency of the mutant allele G (NC_037337.1 g.35615224 T > G) gradually decreased from the southern cattle groups to the northern cattle groups, whereas the frequency of the wild-type allele T showed an opposite pattern, consistent with the distribution of indicine and taurine cattle in China. In accordance with the association analysis, genotypes were significantly associated with T (P < 0.01), RH (P < 0.01), and THI (P < 0.01), suggesting that the cattle with genotype GG were found in regions with higher T, RH, and THI. Thus, our results suggest that the mutation (NC_037337.1 g.35615224 T > G) of the EIF2AK4 gene is associated with thermal tolerance traits in Chinese cattle.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA repair 3aalleles 3acattle 3acattle breeds 3adatabases 3aexons 3afrequency distribution 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3aheat tolerance 3aloci 3amissense mutation 3amutants 3aoxidative stress 3arelative humidity 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atemperature 3aChina1 aCao, Yanhong 1 aRong, Yu 1 aNing, Qingqing 1 aJia, Peng 1 aHuang, Yongzhen 1 aLan, Xianyong 1 aDang, Ruihua 1 aChen, Hong 1 aLei, Chuzhao 0 tAnimals.g2019 June 19, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90603753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03578naa a2201141 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010100170300001800271520099000289592002801279650001501307650001701322650001201339650002301351650001501374650001101389650002701400650002301427650002301450650001701473650001501490650002201505650001301527650001501540650001001555653001801565653001701583653002201600653002801622653001901650653002301669653000801692653000801700653000901708653001401717653000701731653000801738653000701746653001001753653000701763653000901770653000701779653001001786653000801796653001001804653001101814653000701825653000901832653000701841653000701848653000701855653000801862653000901870653001101879653000901890653000701899653000901906653000701915653000701922653001201929653000701941653000801948653000801956653000801964653001001972653000801982653000801990653000701998653000802005653000702013653000702020653000902027653000902036653000702045653000802052653000802060653001102068653000702079653001102086653000702097653001102104653001102115653001002126700002002136700002502156700002102181700003202202700002002234773008002254856008102334852000902415655001202424IND60551437320221122064734.0161018e20150520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055143732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.10.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrouillas, Patrick10aOptical properties of wine pigments: theoretical guidelines with new methodological perspectives  ap. 3079-3088.  aWine pigmentation results from the complex chemistry of anthocyanins. Their flavylium cation form is stabilized either by chemical transformation occurring during wine aging (e.g., pyranoanthocyanin formation), or by the formation of non-covalent complexes with (phenolic) copigments.Molecular modeling (quantum mechanics and molecular dynamics) is more and more adapted to understand wine chemistry and pigmentation. The constant developments of theoretical methodologies might get non-specialists easily lost. This manuscript is a review of the theoretical studies dedicated to the field of wine pigments, showing conformational analysis, energetics of the various forms, pigment/copigment (non-)covalent association, and charge transfer excited states. QM/MM calculations are newly performed here, which improve solvent description. The conclusion is a comprehensive guideline for an accurate prediction of light absorption by wine pigments and all related supramolecular processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanthocyanins 3acations 3achemical reactions 3aguidelines 3amodels 3amolecular conformation 3amolecular dynamics 3aoptical properties 3apigmentation 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics 3asolvents 3awine aging 3awines 0aWine pigments 0aAnthocyanins 0aQuantum chemistry 0aDispersive&RSH (TD)-DFT 0aCopigmentation 0aMolecular dynamics 0aAM1 0aASC 0aBSSE 0aCAM-B3LYP 0aCC 0aCC2 0aCI 0aCOSMO 0aCP 0aCPCM 0aCT 0aCT-ES 0aDFT 0aDFT-D 0aDFT-NL 0aES 0aGAFF 0aGB 0aGS 0aHF 0aHMO 0aHOMO 0aIEFPCM 0aINDO 0aLR 0aLUMO 0aMD 0aMM 0aMM-PBSA 0aMO 0aMPE 0aNMR 0aNOE 0aNOESY 0aNTO 0aPCM 0aPE 0aPPP 0aQC 0aQM 0aQSPR 0aRESP 0aRI 0aRSH 0aSCS 0aSS-PCM 0aTD 0aTD-DFT 0aUV 0aUV/Vis 0avDW-DF 0aZINDO1 aDi Meo, Florent1 aGierschner, Johannes1 aLinares, Mathieu1 aSancho-García, Juan Carlos1 aOtyepka, Michal0 tTetrahedron.g2015 May 20, v. 71 p.3079-3088dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2014.10.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013200168300001600300520166700316592002801983650001502011650001202026650001102038650001902049650002502068650002702093650002202120650002102142650002402163650001302187650001902200650001902219650000902238653001802247653003302265653001802298653002202316653001802338700006102356700005602417773014102473856008502614852000902699655001202708IND60681902620200410000000.0200121e20191212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068190262DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b050832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVu, Nhu-Nang10aSelective Fragmentation through C–N Bond Cleavage of Carbon Nitride Framework for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production  ap. 853-863.  aA simple, practical approach for the structural modification of bulk g-C₃N₄ employing high-pressure NH₃ and H₂O formed by the polycondensation of urea is reported. The high-pressure processes the planarization of carbon nitride sheets that is disruptive because of structural distortion or defects, thus creating non-crystalline lines with highly reactive carbon species. The reaction of these carbon species with NH₃ leads to highly selective and oriented fragmentation of the carbon nitride framework, which is entirely different from previous reports, producing nanofragments with a very small density of defects. The high pressure proceeds the sheet planarization and the structural condensation of nanofragments, resulting in very high crystallinity. The fragmentation also creating a high concentration of functional groups (−NH₂ and −OH) on the edge of C₃N₄ sheets with a suitable proportion, constructing a large optimized hydrogen-bond network across intra- and interplanes that further enhance the crystallinity of the formed nanofragments. The high crystallinity, especially the strong planarization of carbon nitride sheets, significantly speeds up the charge separation and transfer, while the functional groups on the edge of sheets result in an excellent charge drive. Also, these groups simultaneously shift the conduction band to a higher level and improve proton adsorption and activation. As such, the as-prepared nanofragment photocatalyst exhibits a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate that is nearly five times increased, as compared to that of the bulk g-C₃N₄, with a high quantum efficiency of 12.3% at 420 nm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3acarbon 3acarbon nitride 3acleavage (chemistry) 3acondensation reactions 3acrystal structure 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrogen production 3amoieties 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aurea 0afragmentation 0acarbon nitride nanofragments 0acrystallinity 0afunctional groups 0aphotocatalyst1 aKaliaguine, Serge1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4467-28401 aDo, Trong-On1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7785-52990 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2019 Dec. 12, v. 8, no. 2 p.853-863dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.9b050833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245014200175300001600317520064600333592002800979650001701007650001901024650001101043650002201054650001001076650001101086650000901097650002001106650001901126650001001145650001601155651001001171651001001181653000901191653001801200653003501218653002501253653001001278653001401288700002401302700002601326700001701352700002501369700004701394700002501441773012301466856008401589852000901673655001201682IND60133100220221116150404.0150609e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310022DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2014.9941162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanal, Narendra Raj12aA comprehensive approach and methods for glacial lake outburst flood risk assessment, with examples from Nepal and the transboundary area  ap. 219-237.  aLike other mountainous areas, Nepal is highly vulnerable to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), and this vulnerability has increased due to climate change.

People, property and public infrastructure (including hydropower plants, roads and bridges) are vulnerable, and there is a need to integrate GLOF risk reduction strategies into national policies and programmes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3afloods 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3apeople 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk reduction 3aroads 3awater power 3aChina 3aNepal 0aGLOF 0aglacial lakes 0aGLOF modelling; hazard mapping 0aGLOF risk management 0aNepal 0aHimalayas1 aMool, Pradeep Kumar1 aShrestha, Arun Bhakta1 aRasul, Golam1 aGhimire, Pawan Kumar1 aShrestha, Rajendra B.q(Rajendra Bahadur),1 aJoshi, Sharad Prasad0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 31, no. 2 p.219-237dRoutledgex1360-06487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2014.9941163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245019200172300001800364520214100382592002802523650001102551650001702562650002802579650001302607650001302620650002102633650000902654650001902663650001402682650001402696650002202710650001102732650001802743700005502761700001202816700002202828700002302850700006202873700007002935700006203005773011903067856008703186852000903273655001203282IND60686825020200514000000.0200319e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068682502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b038512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyeonseok10aStructural Evolution of Organic Matter in Deep Shales by Spectroscopy (¹H and ¹³C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy, and Fourier Transform Infrared) Analysis  ap. 2807-2815.  aAmorphous organic matter in geomaterials also known as kerogen undergoes significant alteration in chemical structure during thermal maturation, which is characterized using a combination of solid-state ¹H and ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) techniques. For this study, four kerogen samples (type II) from the Bakken Formation were selected on the basis of the differences in their thermal maturity as well as representing the pre-oil and oil window stages as measured through organic petrology and bulk geochemical screening of the samples using programmed pyrolysis. Later, organic matter was extracted from selected aliquots for chemical spectroscopy. Results documented a systematic structural change in these four samples, where the ratio of CH₃/CH₂ increased when the maturity increases, along with the presence of a shorter aliphatic chain length. Furthermore, the aromatic carbon structure becomes more abundant in higher maturities and oil window stages quantified by ¹³C NMR, XPS, and FTIR. Also, the rate of increase in aromaticity demonstrates a considerable rift between the pre-oil window and oil window stages, as verified through bulk geochemical screening of the samples with Rock-Eval 6 pyrolysis hydrogen index. Notably, it is found that kerogen maturation causes the relatively bulky oxygen-related carbon compounds to reduce at the early stages of maturation (pre-oil window), followed by the concentration of such compounds at higher maturity stages. Next, the ratio of carbonyl/carboxyl functional groups to aromatic carbon shows an increase in the oil window stage, while a reduction of sulfur in higher maturities was detected mainly in the SOₓ forms. Finally, the nitrogen content of the samples is reported in a variety of forms, which varied regardless of the thermal maturation. It is concluded that the structural and chemical changes that occur in the organic matter involve defunctionalization of heteroatom functional groups, coupled with an increase in cross-linked carbon in the residual remaining kerogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acrosslinking 3ageochemical prospecting 3ahydrogen 3amoieties 3anitrogen content 3aoils 3aorganic matter 3apyrolysis 3ascreening 3aspectral analysis 3asulfur 3asulfur oxides1 aOncel, Nuri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0292-33491 aLiu, Bo1 aKukay, Alexandera1 aAltincicek, Furkan1 aVarma, Rajender S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9731-62281 aShokouhimehr, Mohammadreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1416-68051 aOstadhassan, Mehdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9235-43990 tEnergy & fuels.g2020 Feb. 07, v. 34, no. 3 p.2807-2815dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b038513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02511naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245013600205500001400341506007600355520099200431592002801423506003701451650001101488650001001499650001001509650001001519650002501529650001301554650002701567650001001594650001101604650000901615650002401624650001301648650001701661651001101678700002201689700002901711700002601740700002501766700002401791773011901815856007401934852000902008655001202017IND60648640620221207130917.0190701e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864062DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90603772doi7 aPMC66166162pmcid7 a312268072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCieślińska, Anna 10aGenetic Polymorphism of β-Casein Gene in Polish Red Cattle—Preliminary Study of A1 and A2 Frequency in Genetic Conservation Herd  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough there is growing interest in Red cow&rsquo;s milk in Poland, to date there are few reports investigating the characteristics of milk components in the studied population. Particular emphasis on milk proteins is advised, since &beta;-casein is a source of bioactive peptides named &beta;-casomorphins. &beta;-casomorphin 7, which originates mostly from &beta;-casein variants A1, may be a significant risk factor in human ischemic heart disease, arteriosclerosis, type I diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome, and autism. The aim of the present study was to identify CSN2 polymorphism gene in exon 7 using the genomic sequence from GenBank (M55158), g.8101C>A, (codon 67). Blood samples were collected from 201 Polish Red cattle (24 males and 177 females). The genotype of &beta;-casein was determined using PCR-ACRS. The frequency of &beta;-casein A2 in Polish Red population was 0.47. &beta;-casein A2 frequency in Polish Red bulls and in cows was 0.58 and 0.37, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautism 3ablood 3adeath 3aexons 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 3agermplasm conservation 3aherds 3ahumans 3amilk 3amyocardial ischemia 3apeptides 3arisk factors 3aPoland1 aFiedorowicz, Ewa 1 aZwierzchowski, Grzegorz 1 aKordulewska, Natalia 1 aJarmołowska, Beata 1 aKostyra, Elżbieta 0 tAnimals.g2019 June 20, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90603773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01841naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245012600170300001800296520068400314592002800998650001001026650001401036650002301050650002301073650001801096650001201114653002401126653002001150653002501170653003101195700001801226700006401244773008101308856008101389852000901470655001201479IND60551437520221122064744.0161018e20141216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055143752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2014.10.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetakamsetty, Ramu10aSynthesis of bis-α-amino acids through proline catalyzed asymmetric α-amination of higher homologs of Garner's aldehyde  ap. 9554-9563.  aA very convenient synthesis of bis-α-amino acids from the higher homologs of Garner's aldehyde is reported. The key step is proline catalyzed asymmetric amination of the aldehydes using dibenzylazodicarboxylate. The aldehydes used are either commercially available or can easily be prepared from aspartic or glutamic acid. One of the two chiral centers in the bis-amino acids comes from the aldehyde and the other one is generated through the proline catalyzed reaction, which were high yielding and proceeded with very high diastereoselectivity (93–99%). The reported route offers a general method for the synthesis of the title compounds with desired stereochemical outcome.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aaldehydes 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3aglutamic acid 3aproline 0aUnusual amino acids 0aOrganocatalysis 0aAsymmetric amination 0aProline catalyzed reaction1 aDas, Ram Pada1 aRamapanicker, Ramesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7717-68430 tTetrahedron.g2014 Dec. 16, v. 70 p.9554-9563dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2014.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245013800206500001400344506007600358520149700434592002801931506003701959650002401996650001902020650001102039650002302050650002102073650001602094650001602110650001802126650001302144650002102157650001202178700003002190700002402220700002202244700002502266700002702291700002802318773011902346856007402465852000902539655001202548IND60648640720221207134120.0190701e20190620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864072DNAL7 a10.3390/ani90603782doi7 aPMC66169102pmcid7 a312268102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaadeldin, Islam M.,10aIsolation and Culture of Skin-Derived Differentiated and Stem-Like Cells Obtained from the Arabian Camel (<i>Camelus dromedarius</i>)  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElite camels often suffer from massive injuries. Thus, there is a pivotal need for a cheap and readily available regenerative medicine source. We isolated novel stem-like cells from camel skin and investigated their multipotency and resistance against various stresses. Skin samples were isolated from ears of five camels. Fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and spheroid progenitors were extracted. After separation of different cell lines by trypsinization, all cell lines were exposed to heat shock. Then, fibroblasts and dermal cyst-forming cells were examined under cryopreservation. Dermal cyst-forming cells were evaluated for resistance against osmotic pressure. The results revealed that resistance periods against trypsin were 1.5, 4, and 7 min for fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and spheroid progenitors, respectively. Furthermore, complete recovery of different cell lines after heat shock along with the differentiation of spheroid progenitors into neurons was observed. Fibroblasts and spheroid progenitors retained cell proliferation after cryopreservation. Dermal cyst-forming cells regained their normal structure after collapsing by osmotic pressure. The spheroid progenitors incubated in the adipogenic, osteogenic, and neurogenic media differentiated into adipocyte-, osteoblast-, and neuron-like cells, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we isolated different unique cellular types and stem-like cells from the camel skin and examined their multipotency for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCamelus dromedarius 3abone formation 3acamels 3acell proliferation 3acryopreservation 3afibroblasts 3aheat stress 3akeratinocytes 3amedicine 3aosmotic pressure 3atrypsin1 aSwelum, Ayman  Abdel-Aziz1 aNoreldin, Ahmed  E.1 aTukur, Hammed  A.1 aAbdelazim, Aaser  M.1 aAbomughaid, Mosleh  M.1 aAlowaimer, Abdullah  N.0 tAnimals.g2019 June 20, v. 9, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani90603783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245014400162300001800306520159900324592002801923650002001951650000901971650002001980650002302000650001902023650002002042650001502062650003802077650002002115650001202135650001902147650004302166650001102209650003202220650001702252650002602269650000902295650002002304650001402324650001802338700001502356700001802371700001502389700001302404700001402417700001502431773009502446856008102541852000902622655001202631IND60514331320221120185809.0160227e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051433132DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-015-0282-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Wei10aDevelopment of an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Detection of 2-Amino-3-Methylimidazo [4, 5-f] Quinoline (IQ) in Processed Foods  ap. 1036-1045.  a2-amino-3-methylimidazo [4, 5-f] quinoline (IQ), is a type of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) formed during the thermal treatment of food processing, which possesses potential carcinogenicity and mutagenicity for humans. In this work, a simple, selective and sensitive direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dcELISA) for detecting IQ has been developed for the first time. 1H-pyrrolo [2, 3-f] quinoline (PQ), a structural analogue of IQ, was connected with two-carbon arm to obtain the hapten PQ acid (PQA), and then a specific polyclonal antibody was produced with PQA-bovine serum albumin (BSA) as immunogen. The half-maximum inhibition concentration (IC₅₀) and limit of detection (LOD; calculated as IC₁₅ value) of the assay were 50 ± 3 and 3 ± 0.3 μg L⁻¹, respectively. The assay showed no cross-reactivity with other HAAs analogues except 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo [4,5-f] quinoline (MeIQ) (12 %), which indicated that the assay had high specificity for the IQ. The proposed method was further applied successfully to determine IQ in fried beef, fried pork, and dried fish floss samples with satisfactory recoveries (84.96–116.23 %) and precision (CV%, 4.96–17.26 %). The LOD for IQ in processed foods was 15 μg kg⁻¹. In addition, the results of the established method were in good agreement with the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (R ² = 0.9917). All above shows the proposed immunoassay allows for a cost-effective, specific, accurate, and reliable quantitative detection of IQ in real processed food samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic amines 3abeef 3acarcinogenicity 3acost effectiveness 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3adried fish 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afood processing 3ahaptens 3aheat treatment 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amutagenicity 3apolyclonal antibodies 3apork 3aprocessed foods 3aquinoline 3aserum albumin1 aRan, Xuqin1 aHu, Gaoshuang1 aZhang, Yan1 aLu, Yang1 aLiu, Bing1 aWang, Shuo0 tFood analytical methods.g2016 Apr., v. 9, no. 4 p.1036-1045dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-015-0282-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01742naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245014600166300001800312520044200330592002800772650001400800650002300814650002300837650001100860650002200871650001300893650001400906650001500920700001600935700001500951700001500966700005500981700005401036700005401090773012001144856008301264852000901347655001201356IND60637594820221121055115.0190419e20190329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063759482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b006902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenguang10aNBE-Controlled Palladium-Catalyzed Interannular Selective C–H Silylation: Access to Divergent Silicon-Containing 1,1′-Biaryl-2-Acetamides  ap. 2718-2722.  aA novel palladium-catalyzed interannular selective C–H silylation of 1,1′-biaryl-2-acetamides is described.

Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus plantarum LD4 was identified using biochemical and molecular techniques including 16S rDNA amplification, followed by sequencing. Bacteriocin production started after 3 h, reaching a maximum during the early stationary phase. Bacteriocin present in cell-free supernatant showed stability in a pH range of 2.0 to 6.0, as well as at different temperatures (60–100 and 121 °C for 15 min under 15 psi pressure). Antimicrobial activity was not affected by catalase, lipase or α-amylase, but was reduced in the presence of trypsin and protease, suggesting the proteinaceous nature of the compound. Activity remained stable after treatment with different organic solvents, surfactants, and detergents. The molecular weight of bacteriocin LD4 was found to be ∼6 kDa using tricine SDS-PAGE. Antimicrobial activity was demonstrated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Enterococcus faecium, and a few strains of lactic acid bacteria and haloarchaea. Bacteriocin LD4 caused K⁺ ion efflux in target cells, suggesting the pore-forming nature of the compound. Given the stability under various conditions and the broad antimicrobial spectrum against pathogens, the bacteriocin LD4 has the potential for application in food safety as well as therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aMicrococcus luteus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aSalmonella Typhi 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aVibrio 3aalpha-amylase 3aantibacterial properties 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteriocins 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalase 3adetergents 3afermented foods 3afood safety 3alactic acid bacteria 3amolecular weight 3apH 3apathogens 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apotassium 3aribosomal DNA 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3atemperature 3atherapeutics 3atrypsin1 aSheoran, Poonam1 aGupta, Aabha1 aYadav, Jayaparkash1 aTivārī, Santosha Kumāra,0 tAnnals of microbiology.g2016 Dec., v. 66, no. 4 p.1431-1440dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1590-42617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-016-1230-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245009100175300001400266520164700280592002801927650001401955650001601969650001101985650001401996650002502010650001802035650001902053650002802072650001102100650001402111650003002125650001702155650001902172650000902191650001902200653001402219653001002233653001702243653001302260653002302273653001302296700003202309700003302341700003302374700002702407700002902434700002102463700002602484773011202510856008302622852000902705655001202714IND60632865820221118185406.0190530e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063286582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Vitor Hugo Dos10aEvaluation of alginate hydrogel encapsulated mesenchymal stem cell migration in horses  ap. 38-45.  aOsteoarthritis is an incapacitating disease characterized by pain and a progressive decrease in joint mobility. The implantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has shown promising results for its treatment. The challenge remains to keep the cells longer at the site of action, increasing their therapeutic potential. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Qtracker® 655 nanocrystal marking on allogeneic synovial membrane (SM) MSCs, encapsulated in alginate hydrogel, evaluating the migration of these cells. The 10 radiocarpal joints were submitted to arthroscopic surgery (D0), divided into two groups. The chondral defect was treated according to the group: GA free-labelled MSCSM and GB labelled MSCSM microcapsules. Seven days after lesion induction and implantation of labelled cells, biopsies of the lesion site were performed in two animals, and fragments of SM and joint capsule also collected, which were frozen and later processed for fluorescence microscopy. The synovial fluid of the three animals was analyzed by flow cytometry three times – 3, 7 and 21 days after application. The cellular marking with the nanocrystals allowed the visualization of the cells in cartilage, synovial membrane, synovial fluid and articular capsule, but with a predilection for the synovial membrane and the lesion site was scarce. The labelled MSCSM in microcapsules were scarce in the synovial fluid and could be related to the small quantity of MSCs leaving the pores of the microcapsules, also favorable results, as the cells release paracrine effects acting for a long period until the cellular differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3aarthroscopy 3abiopsy 3acartilage 3acell differentiation 3acell movement 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahorses 3ahydrogels 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3ananocrystals 3aosteoarthritis 3apain 3asynovial fluid 0aCartilage 0aHorse 0aQuantum dots 0aScaffold 0aTissue engineering 0aTracking1 aPfeifer, João Pedro Hübbe1 aSouza, Jaqueline Brandão De1 aStievani, Fernanda De Castro1 aHussni, Carlos Alberto1 aGolim, Marjorie De Assis1 aDeffune, Elenice1 aAlves, Ana Liz Garcia0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2019 June, v. 124 p.38-45dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2019.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245008100170300001800251520151000269592002801779650001401807650002501821650001701846650001301863650001201876650001801888650001101906650003101917650001301948650002101961650001901982700001802001700002002019700006802039700001902107773011902126856008702245852000902332655001202341IND60686825420221121190158.0200319e20200123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068682542DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b039142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErshov, M.A.10aBlending Characteristics of Isooctene, MTBE, and TAME as Gasoline Components  ap. 2816-2823.  aCurrently, one of the most important problems in Russian refineries is the lack of production of high-octane gasoline that meets current and future environmental requirements. One solution for this problem is blending oxygenates into gasoline, for example, tertiary amyl methyl ether (TAME) and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE). Each of these substances has its advantages and disadvantages. Prospects for obtaining other high-octane components alternative to MTBE and TAME may have good prospects. One choice is dimerization of isobutylene to produce di-isobutylene and the product consists mainly of isooctene isomers. Physico-chemical characteristics of isooctene sample as component of motor gasoline in comparison with MTBE and TAME are investigated. The results showed that the introduction of isooctene, which has low volatility, leads to a decrease in Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of base gasoline at the level of TAME. Furthermore, the antiknock properties of isooctene in various gasoline bases are established. The values of the isooctene blend octane numbers calculated in the ranges of 108–150 by the research methods and 92–136 by the motor methods are calculated according to the obtained results, isooctene has high antiknock detonation efficiency at the MTBE level. Finally, the use of isooctene as gasoline additives gives good prospects to refining companies in light of decreasing the overhead, enhancing the grade of product, as well as decreasing large effects on the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3abusiness enterprises 3adimerization 3agasoline 3aisomers 3amethyl ethers 3aoctane 3aphysicochemical properties 3arefining 3aresearch methods 3avapor pressure1 aPotanin, D.A.1 aTarazanov, S.V.1 aAbdellatief, Tamer M.

Ruminants evolved as cellulose fermenters adapt to fiber-rich diets. Instead, high-producing ruminants nowadays are commonly fed with grain-based diets to increase intake and productivity. Such diets, however, trade off the health of the animal. One negative aspect of such feeding is related to elevated levels of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) in the gut lumen and the likelihood of LPS translocation across the gut causing systemic and local (tissue) inflammation with consequences for production and longevity. However, the view for toxicity of gut LPS is oversimplified, overlooking the physicochemistry of LPS and the translocation route that determine the fate and immune reactive activity of LPS within the host. The barrier and defensive mechanisms of rumen morphology and intestinal mucus are understated. LPS cross the epithelial barrier paracellularly through impaired tight-junction and transcellularly through receptor-mediated transcytosis and the lipoprotein pathway transporting lipids. The lipoprotein pathway delivers LPS to the circulation before reaching the liver for detoxification and is believed to be the major natural route of gut LPS translocation at least in non-ruminants. Ruminant research has focused on endotoxemia and systemic inflammation but with little success and conflicting results, not to mention that low-grade inflammation is not easy to detect. In fact, LPS in the circulation must be effectively removed to avoid an adverse effect of rising level of LPS in the circulation. Circulating LPS could be transported towards target tissues in various organs, leading to local inflammation and altered metabolic activity in the tissues. Therefore, it might be feasible to capture tissue inflammation, especially in the metabolic organs including the liver, adipose tissues, and mammary gland. The present review gathers research updates and presents a comprehensive view of the physicochemical properties and bioactivity of LPS and the possibilities of translocation as well as other possible fate of LPS at each gut site in ruminants. Furthermore, we describe the involvement of three key metabolic organs including the liver, adipose tissue, and mammary gland in response to gut-derived LPS that lead to inflammation in the tissue posing consequences for the health and longevity of dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipose tissue 3aadverse effects 3abiochemical pathways 3acellulose 3adairy cows 3adiet 3aendotoxemia 3aendotoxins 3aepithelium 3afermenters 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3alipopolysaccharides 3alipoproteins 3aliver 3alongevity 3amammary glands 3amucus 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphysiological transport 3arumen 3atoxicity 0aBacterial lipopolysaccharide 0aEndotoxemia 0aInflammation 0aLiver 0aAdipose tissue 0aDairy cow1 aZebeli, Qendrim0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2018 Oct., v. 120 p.17-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45491x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2018.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01937naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245011500174300001600289520073900305592002801044650003001072650002901102650001401131650002401145650001501169650001901184653001101203653002501214653002301239653001501262653002501277700002301302700002101325773012301346856008501469852000901554655001201563IND60133100720221116150216.0150609e20150403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013310072DNAL7 a10.1080/07900627.2015.10238912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Mandira,10aEstablishment of a regional flood information system in the Hindu Kush Himalayas: challenges and opportunities  ap. 238-252.  aRapid advances in communication technology are making access to information faster, more reliable, and cheaper.

This article provides an example of how regional cooperation has been achieved and is being promoted in the Hindu Kush Himalayas through the development of a regional flood information system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunications technology 3adecision support systems 3ahydrology 3ainformation systems 3amonitoring 3arisk reduction 0afloods 0aregional cooperation 0ainformation system 0atechnology 0aHindu Kush Himalayas1 aGrabs, Wolfgang E.1 aKhadgi, Vijay R.0 tInternational journal of water resources development.g2015 Apr. 3, v. 31, no. 2 p.238-252dRoutledgex1360-06487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07900627.2015.10238913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002600193245012900219300001600348506007600364520147700440592002801917506003701945650002801982650001902010650002102029650001302050650002202063650001902085650001202104650002102116650001602137650002502153650003802178650002002216650003702236650001302273650001202286650001602298650002402314650001402338650002002352650001502372650000902387650001702396650002202413651001002435700001802445700002302463700003202486700001702518700002802535773010002563856005502663852000902718655001202727IND4468742020221207130828.0120727e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446874202DNAL7 a221507992pmid7 aPMC32573692pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03988.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzaneda, Antonio J.10aEnvironmental aridity is associated with cytotype segregation and polyploidy occurrence in Brachypodium distachyon (Poaceae)  ap. 797-805.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a• The ecological and adaptive significance of plant polyploidization is not well understood and no clear pattern of association between polyploid frequency and environment has emerged. Climatic factors are expected to predict cytotype distribution. However, the relationship among climate, cytotype distribution and variation of abiotic stress tolerance traits has rarely been examined. • Here, we use flow cytometry and root‐tip squashes to examine the cytotype distribution in the temperate annual grass Brachypodium distachyon in 57 natural populations distributed across an aridity gradient in the Iberian Peninsula. We further investigate the link between environmental aridity, ploidy, and variation of drought tolerance and drought avoidance (flowering time) traits. • Distribution of diploids (2n = 10) and allotetraploids (2n = 30) in this species is geographically structured throughout its range in the Iberian Peninsula, and is associated with aridity gradients. Importantly, after controlling for geographic and altitudinal effects, the link between aridity and polyploidization occurrence persisted. Water‐use efficiency varied between ploidy levels, with tetraploids being more efficient in the use of water than diploids under water‐restricted growing conditions. • Our results indicate that aridity is an important predictor of polyploid occurrence in B. distachyon, suggesting a possible adaptive origin of the cytotype segregation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrachypodium distachyon 3aabiotic stress 3aclimatic factors 3adiploidy 3adrought tolerance 3aflow cytometry 3agrasses 3astress tolerance 3atetraploidy 3awater use efficiency 2aBrachypodiumxcytologyxgenetics. 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aChromosome Segregationxgenetics 2aDroughts 2aEcotype 2aEnvironment 2aFlowersxphysiology 2aGeography 2aLogistic Models 2aPolyploidy 2aRain 2aTime Factors 2aWaterxphysiology 0aSpain1 aRey, Pedro J.1 aBastida, Jesús M.1 aWeiss‐Lehman, Christopher1 aRaskin, Evan1 aMitchell‐Olds, Thomas0 tnew phytologist.g2012 Feb., v. 193, no. 3 p.797-805dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03988.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245007800209300001800287520144100305592002801746650004401774650001601818650002201834650003601856650001501892650001501907650002201922650001201944650001501956650001701971650001501988650001902003650001102022650000702033650003302040650001602073650001902089650001602108650001902124700003002143700002802173700002702201700002802228773017002256856008002426852000902506655001202515IND60645982220190813000000.0190605e20190522xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064598222DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.9b000452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Roberto R.

The removal of hardness and metal ions from water are necessary in certain sources of human consumption and for industrial purposes. In this work, sodium-modified vermiculite was investigated toward the removal of calcium ions in aqueous medium. The effects of adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial concentration of calcium ions, initial pH, and temperature were systematically studied for both raw and modified vermiculite. pH 10 was shown to be the most appropriate to conduct the experiments. Raw, sodium-modified, and postadsorption vermiculite were characterized by microstructure analysis (scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray diffraction). The maximum adsorption capacity was found in sodium-modified vermiculite, resulting in about 80 mg g–¹. Kinetic studies were carried out to relate the experimental data to pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and Elovich models. Isotherm models (Freundlich, Langmuir, and Redlich–Peterson) were employed to describe the softening process, and thermodynamic parameters ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS° were determined. Results revealed a spontaneous endothermic adsorption process with pseudo-second-order kinetics and corroborated the sodium-modified vermiculite adequacy for water softening.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray fluorescence spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acalcium 3aendothermy 3afluorescence 3ametal ions 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 3avermiculite 3awater hardness1 ade Lima, Paulo Douglas S.1 aGreati, Vitor Rodrigues1 ade Sousa, Paulla B.

We assessed the impact of A. mangium plantations in pure stands and in mixture with eucalypt trees on the physico-chemical properties of the soil after one rotation. METHODS: Bulk densities, N, C, available P and pH were determined on soil sampled in the pure acacia (100A), pure eucalypt (100E) and mixed-species (50A:50E) stands. N and P were determined in aboveground litters and in leaves, bark and wood of trees. RESULTS: N and C concentrations were higher in 50A:50E than in 100A and 100E in the top soil layer. The pH was lower in 100A and higher in 100E than in 50A:50E. The available P was lower in 50A:50E than in 100A and 100E. Leaf N was lower in 50A:50E than in 100A for acacia, and higher than in 100E for eucalypt. Leaf P was similar for acacia but higher for eucalypt in 50A:50E than in 100E. In contrast to P, the amount of N in aboveground litterfall increased with the proportion of acacia in the stand. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of acacia trees in eucalypt plantations increased C and N contents of the soil but decreased the available P content in the mixed-species stand. This may be related to a higher uptake of P needed to maintain the N:P stoichiometry in eucalypt leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcacia mangium 3aEucalyptus urophylla 3abark 3acoastal plains 3acoastal soils 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aplantations 3apure stands 3asandy soils 3asoil pH 3atopsoil 3atrees 3awood1 aEpron, Daniel1 aBouillet, Jean-Pierre1 aMareschal, Louis0 tPlant and soil.g2014 June, v. 379, no. 1-2 p.205-216dSpringer International Publishingx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2047-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03821naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100002100172245008700193300001800280500001500298520154200313592002801855650001301883650001501896650002801911650002301939650000901962650001601971650001501987650002802002650001002030650001402040650001502054650001202069650002502081650002202106650002202128650002002150650001602170650001602186650001002202650003602212650001302248650002702261650001002288650003702298650001202335650002302347650002502370650001802395650004002413650001502453650003702468650002802505650003902533650003802572650004002610650002502650650003702675650002202712650002302734650003702757650004102794653001702835700002802852773008502880856008902965852000903054655001203063IND4466587920221120141742.0141110e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446658792DNAL7 a227395402pmid7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Thais G.10aAtrazine promotes biochemical changes and DNA damage in a Neotropical fish species  ap. 1118-1125.  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of Atrazine, an herbicide used worldwide and considered as a potential contaminant in aquatic environments, were assessed on the Neotropical fish Prochilodus lineatus acutely (24 and 48h) exposed to 2 or 10μgL⁻¹ of atrazine by using a set of biochemical and genetic biomarkers. The following parameters were measured in the liver: activity of the biotransformation enzymes ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S transferase (GST), antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), content of reduced glutathione (GSH), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and occurrence of lipid peroxidation (LPO); in brain and muscle the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and DNA damage (comet assay) on erythrocytes, gills and liver cells. A general decreasing trend on the biotransformation and antioxidant enzymes was observed in the liver of P. lineatus exposed to atrazine; except for GR, all the other antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and biotransformation enzymes (EROD and GST) showed inhibited activity. Changes in muscle or brain AChE were not detected. DNA damage was observed in the different cell types of fish exposed to the herbicide, and it was probably not from oxidative origin, since no increase in ROS generation and LPO was detected in the liver. These results show that atrazine behaves as enzyme inhibitor, impairing hepatic metabolism, and produces genotoxic damage to different cell types of P. lineatus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrazine 3aDNA damage 3areactive oxygen species 3alipid peroxidation 3afish 3aglutathione 3abiomarkers 3aglutathione transferase 3abrain 3apollution 3ametabolism 3amuscles 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aenzyme inhibitors 3abiotransformation 3aenzyme activity 3aProchilodus 3ahepatocytes 3aliver 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agills 2aAcetylcholinesterasexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAtrazinextoxicity 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aCharaciformes 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xmetabolism 2aDNA Damage 2aGillsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Reductasexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Transferasexmetabolism 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMutagensxtoxicity 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity 0aantioxidants1 aMartinez, Cláudia B.R.0 tChemosphere.g2012 Nov., v. 89, no. 9 p.1118-1125dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.05.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01795naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001200146245010100158300001600259500001500275520075800290592002801048650002401076650001601100650001301116650001601129650001801145650001401163650001801177650000901195653000901204700002001213773012001233852000901353856008301362655001201445IND2203701920221123003329.0181023e199910  nju|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220370192DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517599069010102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Li,13aAn Improved Mathematical Simulation of the Coupled Diffusion of Moisture and Heat in Wool Fabric  ap. 760-768.  a2019-12-04  aAn improved mathematical model that takes into account the water vapor sorption mechanisms of wool fiber is developed to describe and predict the coupled heat and moisture transport in wool fabrics. The two-stage moisture sorption of wool is handled by a diffusion equation with two sets of variable water vapor diffusion coefficients in the fibers. The improved model is solved numerically by the finite difference method. Predictions from the new model are compared with those from the Nordon-David model and the previous two-stage model, and with experimental observations. Processes of moisture transfer in the air and in fibers and their interaction with heat transfer under humidity transient conditions are illustrated by a series of 3D diagrams.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3awater vapor 3asorption 3adiffusivity 3awater content 3adiffusion 3aheat transfer 3awool 0aheat1 aZhongxuan Luo, 0 tTextile research journal.g1999 Oct., v. 69, no. 10 p.760-768dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517599069010103Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01273naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010000157300002000257520031100277592002800588650002300616650001100639650001500650650001200665650001400677700001500691700001400706700002100720773013500741856007400876852000900950655001200959IND60639006620221118073438.0190501e20161206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063900662DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc07728e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Deshuang12aA carborane-incorporated mononuclear Co(ii) complex showing zero-field slow magnetic relaxation  ap. 14326-14329.  aAn air-stable mononuclear Co(ii) complex bearing an o-carborane dithiolate ligand has been synthesized which shows slow relaxation of magnetization in the absence of an applied field and a hysteresis loop at 1.8 K.

Dietary behaviors and the development of obesity are complex processes which feature interactions among multiple biological, behavioral, environmental, and cultural factors. Systems science, especially agent-based modeling, offers an effective approach to help identify the best strategies to leverage the food environment in ways that can improve dietary behaviors and prevent obesity. With support from existing literature, this study presents a conceptual framework that describes the pathways through which food environment influences dietary behaviors and obesity. The paper articulates the rationale for using systems science to understand the dynamics and interactions of food environment, dietary behaviors, and obesity. Two specific agent-based models depicting the food environment are presented to demonstrate the promise of systems science to inform the design and implementation of public health interventions and policies for improving dietary behaviors and preventing obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aobesity 3apublic health 3arisk1 aBerenson, Julia1 aGutiérrez, Amanda1 aPagán, José A.0 tCurrent nutrition reports.g2016 Dec., v. 5, no. 4 p.245-254dSpringer USx2161-33117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13668-016-0179-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03079naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245015600210506007600366520139300442592002801835506003701863650003401900650002501934650002501959650001701984650002402001650001402025650001702039650002002056650001202076650002102088650001702109650004302126650001102169650001302180650001802193650001802211650001002229650002202239651001402261651002802275651001902303651002802322773012502350856007702475852000902552655001202561IND60648641520221207130903.0190701e20190603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064864152DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox80601602doi7 aPMC66171232pmcid7 a311636982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabtemariam, Solomon 10aAntioxidant and Rutin Content Analysis of Leaves of the Common Buckwheat (<i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i> Moench) Grown in the United Kingdom: A Case Study  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe common buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench (Polygonaceae) is a gluten-free pseudocereal that has been gaining in popularity in recent years as a low-calorie and nutrient-rich healthy food option. Buckwheat farming is common in Eastern European countries and the Far East, while in the UK and other Western European countries, the plant has limited medicinal or food applications. The vegetative parts, particularly the leaves and flowers, are among the best-known sources of the bioactive compound, rutin. Hence, functional foods originated from buckwheat leaves are common, although the scope of such applications is limited by phototoxicity associated with the fagopyrin composition. Here, the antioxidant and rutin composition of the leaves of the plant grown in the UK are assessed. The methanol extract of the leaves displayed a potent DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging effect along with reducing power. Quantitative High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)-based analysis showed the rutin content of the leaves as 3417 mg/100g (on dry weight (DW) basis). The identity of rutin was also confirmed by isolation and structural elucidation based on spectroscopic studies. From the chemical content analysis, including fagopyrin levels and the antioxidant assays, UK-grown buckwheat has potential as a commercial source of rutin or as a functional food.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioactive compounds 3abuckwheat 3acase studies 3afarming systems 3aflowers 3afunctional foods 3ahealthy diet 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3amethanol 3aphototoxicity 3apseudocereals 3arutin 3aspectral analysis 3aEast Asia 3aEastern European region 3aUnited Kingdom 3aWestern European region0 tAntioxidants.g2019 June 03, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox80601603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002600185245014800211500001100359506007600370520093900446592002801385596002001413506003701433650003201470650000801502650002201510650000901532650002101541650001501562650003001577700001501607700001901622700001901641773011301660856007801773852000901851655001201860IND60626255720221207084400.0181220e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062625572DNAL7 a10.1002/bies.2018001642doi7 aPMC64844412pmcid7 a305000782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurumurthy, Aishwarya10aPhase Separation and Transcription Regulation: Are Super‐Enhancers and Locus Control Regions Primary Sites of Transcription Complex Assembly?  aREVIEW  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt is proposed that the multiple enhancer elements associated with locus control regions and super‐enhancers recruit RNA polymerase II and efficiently assemble elongation competent transcription complexes that are transferred to target genes by transcription termination and transient looping mechanisms. It is well established that transcription complexes are recruited not only to promoters but also to enhancers, where they generate enhancer RNAs. Transcription at enhancers is unstable and frequently aborted. Furthermore, the Integrator and WD‐domain containing protein 82 mediate transcription termination at enhancers. Abortion and termination of transcription at the multiple enhancers of locus control regions and super‐enhancers provide a large pool of elongation competent transcription complexes. These are efficiently captured by strong basal promoter elements at target genes during transient looping interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  aRO1DK52356cNIH0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA 3aenhancer elements 3aloci 3apromoter regions 3aseparation 3atranscription termination1 aShen, Yong1 aGunn, Eliot M.1 aBungert, Jörg0 tBioEssays.g2019 Jan., v. 41, no. 1 p.e1800164-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938457x0265-92477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bies.2018001643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245008800179520145200267592002801719650004401747650001501791650001501806650002201821650002801843650002301871650001801894650001101912650001301923650001901936650001801955650000701973650001601980650003301996650001302029650002302042650002102065653002402086653000902110653001902119653001602138653001802154700006902172700006902241700002802310700002402338773010602362856008702468852000902555655001202564IND60666167620221122135749.0200210e20191220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066616762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1239312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakdel Mojdehi, Azadeh10aDevelopment of PES/polyaniline-modified TiO2 adsorptive membrane for copper removal  aThe current study focused on the preparation of adsorptive nanocomposite membrane for Cu(II) removal from aqueous solution. TiO₂ nanoparticles as adsorbent and Polyaniline (PANi) as a modifier to improve dispersion quality and adsorption capacity of TiO₂, were added to the polyethersulfone (PES) casting solution. Adsorptive membranes were prepared at different dosage of PANi-TiO₂ nanocomposite (3, 5 and 7 wt.%). The as-prepared membranes were characterized with respect to chemical structure, surface properties, and morphology, using Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), contact angle measurement and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The effect of PANi-TiO₂ content and type of solvent on the structure and performance of resultant membranes were also investigated. It is found that the optimum performance parameters (rejection of 94% and permeance of 59.5 kg/(m².h.bar)) were obtained for membrane containing 5 wt.% of PANi-TiO₂ nanocomposite. Additionally, the optimum sample was used to study the adsorption mechanism via Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-second order kinetic model. The effect of pH on adsorption capacity was also reported. Finally, membrane reusability was studied via subsequent adsorption-regeneration cycles. The obtained results indicated that Cu(II) removal efficiency of optimal adsorptive membrane reduced from 94% to 86% after 4 cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical structure 3acontact angle 3acopper 3akinetics 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apolyaniline 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asorption isotherms 3atitanium dioxide 0aAdsorptive membrane 0aTiO2 0aCopper removal 0aPolyaniline 0aNanocomposite1 aChenar, Mahdi Pourafshari1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7173-44211 aPourafshari Chenar, Mahdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7173-44211 aNamvar-Mahboub, Mahdieh1 aEftekhari, Mohammad0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Dec. 20, v. 583 p.123931-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1239313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006800152245010700220520130100327592002801628650000801656650001901664650001901683650001501702650001601717650001101733650001101744650002401755650001201779653001301791653002701804653003101831653002001862653002501882700006001907773010701967856008702074852000902161655001202170IND60787517720221122183656.0220816e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078751772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1193022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Martino, Roberto M.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6435-275910aTheoretical principles and application to measure the flux of carbon dioxide in the air of urban zones  aAtmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentrations increase due to volcanic emissions, diffuse degassing from fault zones, and various human-caused gas emissions, especially in densely populated urban zones, which play a pivotal role in the ongoing climate change. This study aims to examine changes in the concentration and stable isotopic composition of atmospheric CO₂. A laser-based analyzer provided the δ¹³C and δ¹⁸O values based on concentration measurements for various CO₂ isotopologues. Multiple linear regression (MLR) showed that almost 30% of the atmospheric CO₂ changes are caused by weather variations, while ∼70% of the changes involve CO₂ from various gas sources related to human activities. The Keeling plot approach was used to identify the isotopic signature of the extra CO₂, which points to the gas produced by hydrocarbon combustion. An isotopic mass balance model was designed to show the relation between excess atmospheric CO₂ and the flux of human-related gas emissions. Calculating the CO₂ flux in the atmosphere based on this isotopic mass balance model showed that several tons of CO₂ move daily between geospheres. This study shows that surveying atmospheric CO₂ in urban zones allows quantifying the CO₂ emissions from various sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3acombustion 3aenvironment 3ahumans 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aweather 0aCO2 flux 0aCarbon stable isotopes 0aOxygen isotope composition 0aAtmospheric CO2 0aGeochemical modeling1 aGurrieri, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4085-04400 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 288 p.119302-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1193023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245013800164300001400302520114700316592002801463650001601491650001401507650004301521650001101564650002601575650002801601650001601629700002001645773011801665856004601783852000901829655001201838IND50074152820221118001703.0140321e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007415282DNAL7 a10.1111/1747-0080.120482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrer, Olivia10aFeasibility study for efficacy of group weight management programmes achieving therapeutic weight loss in people with type 2 diabetes  ap. 16-21.  aAIM: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of traditional diabetes and weight management advice to short‐term use of a very low calorie diet combined with traditional education in a group setting for people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A 12‐week, non‐randomised dietary intervention was used including a control and treatment group in a community setting targeting obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Participants attended a pilot programme aiming to lose 5–10% body weight. Main outcome measures included percentage weight loss, change in HbA1c and total cholesterol. RESULTS: At 12 weeks more participants in the treatment group achieved significant weight loss of 5–10%, an average loss of 6.6 kg and a significant change in HbA1c (P = 0.017). Overall there was no significant changes in cholesterol for either group (P = 0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates the feasibility for short‐term use of a very low‐calorie diet for medically significant change in weight and HbA1c in obese people with type 2 diabetes and could provide a realistic framework clinical management of weight in a group setting.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3aeducation 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apeople 3avery low calorie diet 3aweight control programs 3aweight loss1 aGolley, Rebecca0 tNutrition & dietetics.g2014 Mar., v. 71, no. 1 p.16-21dThe Dietitican Association of Australiax1446-63687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1747-0080.12048  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024003500132040001800167100002000185245011700205506007600322506003100398520147600429592002801905596000801933596003901941506003701980650002302017650003702040650003202077650002902109650001002138650001302148650000902161650003002170650002302200650002102223650001802244650002702262650001602289650002302305653001602328653001602344653001702360653002002377700002402397773011302421856008202534852000902616655001202625IND60741899120221207064622.0210708e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074189912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2021.1035982chorus7 a10.1016/j.fgb.2021.1035982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chenggang10aEfficient genome editing using endogenous U6 snRNA promoter-driven CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aWe previously reported on a CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing system for the necrotrophic fungal plant pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This system (the TrpC-sgRNA system), based on an RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) promoter (TrpC) to drive sgRNA transcription in vivo, was successful in creating gene insertion mutants. However, relatively low efficiency targeted gene editing hampered the application of this method for functional genomic research in S. sclerotiorum. To further optimize the CRISPR-Cas9 system, a plasmid-free Cas9 protein/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-mediated system (the RNP system) and a plasmid-based RNA polymerase III promoter (U6)-driven sgRNA transcription system (the U6-sgRNA system) were established and evaluated. The previously characterized oxaloacetate acetylhydrolase (Ssoah1) locus and a new locus encoding polyketide synthase12 (Sspks12) were targeted in this study to create loss-of-function mutants. The RNP system, similar to the TrpC-sgRNA system we previously reported, creates mutations at the Ssoah1 gene locus with comparable efficiency. However, neither system successfully generated mutations at the Sspks12 gene locus. The U6-sgRNA system exhibited a significantly higher efficiency of genemutation at both loci. This technology provides a simple and efficient strategy for targeted gene mutation and thereby will accelerating the pace of research of pathogenicity and development in this economically important plant pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSF  cUSDA Agricultural Research Service0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCRISPR-associated endonuclease 9 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3agenes 3agenomics 3aloci 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amicrobial genetics 3aoxaloacetic acid 3apathogenicity 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3apolyketides 3aribonucleoproteins 0aCRISPR/Cas9 0aU6 promoter 0aGene editing 0aS. sclerotiorum1 aRollins, Jeffrey A.0 tFungal genetics and biology.g2021 Sept., v. 154 p.103598-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl54870x1087-18457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2021.1035983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013100164300001800295500001500313520159300328592002801921650001801949650001101967650001601978650001101994650001002005650002602015650002502041653002502066700001302091700001902104700001802123773010402141856008102245852000902326655001202335IND50067234520221120120432.0150207e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006723452DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-013-1241-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Xianyan10aGrowth responses and non-structural carbohydrates in three wetland macrophyte species following submergence and de-submergence  ap. 2069-2074.  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated the responses of growth and non-structural carbohydrates to submergence and de-submergence in three wetland macrophyte species. Survival rate, recovery ability, and soluble sugar and starch contents of flood-tolerant Polygonum hydropiper and of flood-sensitive Phalaris arundinacea and Carex argyi from Dongting Lake wetlands were investigated after 20, 40, and 60 days of complete submergence without light and 10 days after de-submergence. Plant dry weight and soluble sugar and starch contents decreased in all species during the submergence period. The decreases were slowest in P. hydropiper, intermediate in C. argyi, and most rapid in P. arundinacea. After 60 days of submergence, survival rates were 100, 50, and 0 % in P. hydropiper, C. argyi, and P. arundinacea, respectively. After recovery, plant dry weight increased in P. hydropiper and in C. argyi, but decreased in P. arundinacea. Compared to pre-submergence, soluble sugar contents generally increased and then remained relatively constant after recovery in all species, while starch content increased in P. hydropiper and decreased in P. arundinacea with increasing submergence time. For C. argyi, starch content decreased after recovery from the 20-day submergence, but increased after recovery from the 40- and 60-day submergences. These data illustrate mechanisms behind the flood tolerance of P. hydropiper and the sensitivity to flooding in P. arundinacea and C. argyi. These mechanisms include lower consumption and quicker accumulation of non-structural carbohydrates in flood-tolerant plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurvival rate 3asugars 3asubmergence 3astarch 3aCarex 3aPersicaria hydropiper 3aPhalaris arundinacea 0aPolygonum hydropiper1 aLi, Feng1 aChen, Xinsheng1 aXie, Yonghong0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2013 July, v. 35, no. 7 p.2069-2074dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-013-1241-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245009500161520139500256592002801651650001701679650001401696650001201710650000901722650001301731650001401744650000901758650000901767700002701776700003001803700001801833700002301851700002501874773011701899856007602016852000902092655001202101IND60780888620221117050840.0220623e20220617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078088862DNAL7 a10.3390/fire50300832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHagauer, Josef 10aControlling Metal Fires through Cellulose Flake Blanketing Followed by Water Spray Cooling  aThe traditional methods of fighting metal fires are not always safe for firefighters. The sand and salts that are thrown onto the fire to suffocate the flames can lead to splashes of molten metal, putting the firefighters and the surroundings at risk. A novel process is described where magnesium fires are brought under control using a simple two-step process. First, coated cellulose flakes, which contain approx. 30% inorganic salts, are blown onto the fire from a distance of several meters. Due to its low bulk density, the material settles smoothly on the fire and immediately covers the flames for several seconds. Before the hot metal can break through this cover, a fine water spray is applied to the fire. The water spray wets the top layer of the cellulose flakes, which will begin to char from the bottom. The water evaporates from within the cellulose flake layer and withdraws heat. It was observed that no hydrogen is formed and that this technique can safely control fires. It is judged that 90 kg of flakes could safely bring a pile of 75 kg of burning Mg flakes under control. By using a pneumatic conveying unit for the flakes, firefighters can effectively and efficiently cover the flames from a safe distance. This novel method could be recommended to firefighters in industrial magnesium processing plants, as well as local firefighters in the vicinity of such plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acellulose 3acooling 3aheat 3ahydrogen 3amagnesium 3arisk 3asand1 aMatlschweiger, Ulrich 1 aTippelreither, Christian 1 aLutz, Markus 1 aHribernig, Thomas 1 aLackner, Maximilian 0 tFire.g2022 June 17, v. 5, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27135x2571-62557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire50300833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024003900136040001800175100001800193245009100211300001600302520118500318536017801503592002801681596001501709650001701724650001101741650001701752650001901769650001701788653002201805653002401827653001801851700001701869700001601886773014501902856008602047852000902133655001202142IND60765526920221120112203.0220213e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076552692DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2021.19938872chorus7 a10.1080/00103624.2021.19938872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAirori, A.

However, its use is limited to sampling from soil pits. This study was conducted to: 1) determine whether clods collected from cores provide similar bulk density measurements to those collected from soil pits and 2) evaluate the impact of various clod bulk density methods on carbon stock calculation. Clods were collected from soil pits, 5.1 cm soil cores, and 8.9 cm soil cores. Three-dimensional laser scanning was used to measure the volume of the soil clods before and after oven-drying and bulk density was calculated as the dry mass of the clod divided by volume. Of 24 horizons sampled, 17 showed no significant effect of sampling method (core vs. pit) on dry bulk density. The error introduced by collecting clods from a core was small enough that it had no significant effect on carbon stock (p = .683). However, the moisture at which clods were scanned did have a significant effect on carbon stocks (p = .002 to 0.016). Data from the study suggest that collecting clods from soil cores introduces minimal error, but attention should be given to the moisture state at which clod volume is determined.  aThis work was supported by the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture under Hatch project [NEB-38-119] and a UCARE Award through the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  aPublisher supplied data  aNEB-38-119 3abulk density 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aplant analysis 3asoil density 0aSoil bulk density 0avolumetric analyses 0asoil sampling1 aBaker, T.

The two types of muscle are easy to separate, so they are often used as the model system for studies on their physiological and functional characteristics. In this study, we revealed that the carbohydrate and lipid metabolic KEGG pathways are different between slow and fast muscles of Chinese perch with transcriptome analysis. In fast muscle, glucose metabolism was catabolic with higher glycolysis capacity, while in slow muscle, glucose metabolism was anabolic with more glycogen synthesis. In addition, oxidative metabolism in slow muscle was stronger than that in fast muscle. By analyzing the expression levels of 40 miRNAs involved in metabolism in the muscles of Chinese perch, 18 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and 7 were significantly downregulated in slow muscle compared with fast muscle. Based on functional enrichment analysis of their target genes, the differential expression levels of 17 miRNAs in slow and fast muscles were reflected in their carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Among these, 15 miRNAs were associated with carbohydrate metabolism, and 6 miRNAs were associated with lipid metabolism. After 3 days of starvation, the expression levels of 15 miRNAs involved in glucose metabolism in fast and slow muscles increased. However, after 7 days of starvation, the mRNA levels of miR-22a, miR-23a, miR-133a-3p, miR-139, miR-143, miR-144, miR-181a and miR-206 decreased to basal levels. Our data suggest that the possible reason for the difference in glucose and lipid metabolism is that more miRNAs inhibit the expression of target genes in slow muscle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSiniperca chuatsi 3aaerobiosis 3aenergy 3afish 3agene expression regulation 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3aglycolysis 3alipid metabolism 3alipids 3amicroRNA 3amuscles 3astarvation 3atranscriptomics 0aSlow muscle 0aFast muscle 0aGlucose metabolism 0amiRNA 0aChinese perch1 aChen, Lin1 aCheng, Jia1 aPan, Yaxiong1 aZhu, Xin1 aBao, Lingsheng1 aChu, Wuying1 aZhang, Jianshe0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2021 Sept., v. 259 p.111003-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12014x1095-64337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2021.1110033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04936naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245023200169300001600401520306800417592002803485650001303513650002003526650002203546650001603568650001503584650001203599650001803611650002603629650001603655650001603671650002203687650002003709650002103729650001303750650001903763650002603782650001903808651001003827653002303837653001303860653001603873700001503889700002103904700001903925700001703944700002303961700001803984700002304002700001704025700001404042700001704056700002104073773014504094856008604239852000904325655001204334IND60765527120221120101734.0220213e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076552712DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2021.20084152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharma, K.

Moench) – Cowpea (Vigna Unguiculata) System in Rainfed Alfisols  ap. 337-345.  aSoil nitrogen (N) fractions play an important role in contributing toward the availability pool of N in soil and thus enhancing the availability of N to the growing crops. Besides this, the distribution of these forms of N in soil also helps in understanding the conditions that control their availability to the crops. These fractions are relatively dynamic and respond more readily to the organic input like application of crop residues. Therefore, a long-term field experiment (2005–2012) was conducted at the ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, Hyderabad, India, for 8 years to assess the long-term effect of graded levels of surface crop residue application under minimum tillage on the quantum of N fractions in soil and their quantitative relationship with crop yield and N uptake under sorghum-cowpea cropping system in rainfed semi-arid tropical (SAT) Alfisol. The results of the study indicated that the graded levels of surface residue application under minimum tillage significantly influenced most of the N fractions studied, except nitrate-N, unidentified–N and fixed NH₄ ⁺-N. Among the inorganic N fractions studied, the exchangeable NH₄ ⁺-N was significantly influenced by the residue treatments and it varied from 20.4 mg kg⁻¹ to 30.7 mg kg⁻¹ whereas the nitrate N was not influenced by the residue application and varied from 14.4 mg kg⁻¹ to 19.3 mg kg⁻¹ across the treatments. Among the surface crop residue application treatments, the use of crop residue at 6 t ha⁻¹ recorded significantly highest exchangeable NH₄ ⁺-N (30.7 mg kg⁻¹) as well as NO₃-N (19.3 kg ha⁻¹) followed by the treatment receiving sorghum residue at 4 t ha⁻¹ (28.1 kg ha⁻¹ and 17.8 kg ha⁻¹). The total hydrolyzable N varied from 416.9 mg kg⁻¹ to 545.7 mg kg⁻¹ across the treatments. Among the total hydrolyzable N sub-fractions, the hydrolyzable NH₄ ⁺-N ranged from 53.3 mg kg⁻¹ to 71.7 mg kg⁻¹, hexosamine N from 13.0 mg kg⁻¹ to 22.3 mg kg⁻¹, amino acid N ranged from 307.0 mg kg⁻¹ to 384.3 mg kg⁻¹, and unidentified N from 43.7 mg kg⁻¹ to 67.4 mg kg⁻¹ across the treatments, and constituted 12.7%,, 3.8%, 72%, and 11.5% of the total hydrolyzable N, respectively, in the soil. When these N fractions were regressed with the crop response parameters such as sorghum grain yield (YSₒᵣgₕᵤₘ yᵢₑₗd), cowpea grain yield (YCₒwₚₑₐ yᵢₑₗd), sorghum N uptake, (YSₒᵣgₕᵤₘ N ᵤₚₜₐₖₑ), cowpea N uptake (YCₒwₚₑₐ N ᵤₚₜₐₖₑ), and available N in soil (YAᵥₐᵢₗₐbₗₑ N), the coefficients of multiple determinations (R²) were found to be 0.833, 0.877, 0.961, 0.958, and 0.976, respectively, and were found to be significant (P = .05). The magnitude of significant coefficients of multiple determination (R²) indicated the importance of these nitrogen fractions in soil in influencing the crop yields of sorghum and cowpea, total N uptake by the crops, and nitrogen availability in the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlfisols 3aSorghum bicolor 3aVigna unguiculata 3aamino acids 3aarid lands 3acowpeas 3acrop residues 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3ahexosamines 3along term effects 3aminimum tillage 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen 3aplant analysis 3aresearch institutions 3atotal nitrogen 3aIndia 0aNitrogen fractions 0an uptake 0acrop yields1 aLal, Munna1 aSammi Reddy, K.,1 aIndoria, A.

One opportunity is mapping tree crown scorch following fires, which can support science and management. This proof-of-concept shows that crown scorch is distinguishable from uninjured canopy in point clouds derived from low-cost RGB and calibrated RGB-NIR cameras at fine resolutions (centimeter level). The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) provided the most discriminatory spectral data, but a low-cost RGB camera provided useful data as well. Scorch heights from the point cloud closely matched field measurements with a mean absolute error of 0.52 m (n = 29). Voxelization of the point cloud, using a simple threshold NDVI classification as an example, provides a suitable dataset worthy of application and further research. Field-measured scorch heights also showed a relationship to RPAS-thermal-camera-derived fire radiative energy density (FRED) estimates with a Spearman rank correlation of 0.43, but there are many issues still to resolve before robust inference is possible. Mapping fine-scale scorch in 3D with RPAS and SfM photogrammetry is a viable, low-cost option that can support related science and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3acameras 3acanopy 3adata collection 3aenergy density 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aphotogrammetry 3ascorch 3aspectral analysis 3atree crown 3aunmanned aerial vehicles1 aHoff, Valentijn 1 aParsons, Russell A.1 aQueen, Lloyd P.1 aSeielstad, Carl A.0 tFire.g2022 Apr. 29, v. 5, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27135x2571-62557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire50300593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02963naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245006100201300001000262506007600272520165700348592002802005506003702033650000902070650001302079650002302092650001002115650002202125650001902147650001902166650002302185650001202208650001502220700002402235700001902259700002102278773015602299856007702455852000902532655001202541IND60548033220221207124932.0160903e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054803322DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-4-52doi7 aPMC18042812pmcid7 a173098002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBere, Elling10aFree school fruit – sustained effect three years later  ap. 5.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Norwegian children consume less fruit and vegetables (FV) than recommended. In order to increase the intake, a School Fruit subscription programme is now offered to all Norwegian elementary and junior high schools. This programme has limited effect due to low participation by schools and pupils. However, recent evaluations of the programme offered for free have reported good effects in increasing FV intake. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the long term effects of the Norwegian School Fruit programme, provided at no-cost to the pupils, three years after it was provided for free. METHODS: A total of 1950 (85%) 6th and 7th grade pupils from 38 Norwegian elementary schools participated in the project. Nine schools were selected as intervention schools and participated for free in the Norwegian School Fruit programme for a school year (October 2001 until June 2002). A baseline questionnaire survey was conducted in September 2001, and follow-up surveys were conducted in May 2002 and May 2005. FV intake was assessed by a written 24-h recall (reporting FV intake at school and FV intake all day), and by four food frequency questions (reporting usual FV intake). Data were analysed by a linear mixed model for repeated measures. RESULTS: The pupils in the free fruit group increased their FV intake compared to pupils in the control group as a result of the intervention. Some of the effect was sustained three years later. The estimated long-term effects for FV all day were 0.38 and 0.44 portion/day for boys and girls, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results show long-term effects of a free school fruit programme.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aboys 3achildren 3aelementary schools 3agirls 3along term effects 3amiddle schools 3aquestionnaires 3astatistical models 3asurveys 3avegetables1 aVeierød, Marit B.,1 aSkare, Øivind1 aKlepp, Knut-Inge0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2007 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.5-5dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-4-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245014100172300001800313520137800331592002801709650001501737650001701752650002001769650001401789650001301803650001901816650000901835650001701844650001101861650001901872650001201891650002301903650001601926650001201942650001101954650001301965650001701978650001401995650001802009653002302027653001102050653002302061700002002084700002802104700002002132700002102152700002602173700002702199773009102226856008402317852000902401655001202410IND60559746720221121213718.0161216e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055974672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMišík, Miroslav14aThe Tradescantia micronucleus assay is a highly sensitive tool for the detection of low levels of radioactivity in environmental samples  ap. 1044-1048.  aEnvironmental contamination with radioactive materials of geogenic and anthropogenic origin is a global problem. A variety of mutagenicity test procedures has been developed which enable the detection of DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation which plays a key role in the adverse effects caused by radioisotopes. In the present study, we investigated the usefulness of the Tradescantia micronucleus test (the most widely used plant based genotoxicity bioassay) for the detection of genetic damage caused by environmental samples and a human artifact (ceramic plate) which contained radioactive elements. We compared the results obtained with different exposure protocols and found that direct exposure of the inflorescences is more sensitive and that the number of micronuclei can be further increased under “wet” conditions. The lowest dose rate which caused a significant effect was 1.2 μGy/h (10 h). Comparisons with the results obtained with other systems (i.e. with mitotic cells of higher plants, molluscs, insects, fish and human lymphocytes) show that the Tradescantia MN assay is one to three orders of magnitude more sensitive as other models, which are currently available. Taken together, our findings indicate that this method is due to its high sensitivity a unique tool, which can be used for environmental biomonitoring in radiation polluted areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aTradescantia 3aadverse effects 3abioassays 3aceramics 3adirect contact 3afish 3agenotoxicity 3ahumans 3ainflorescences 3ainsects 3aionizing radiation 3alymphocytes 3amitosis 3amodels 3amolluscs 3amutagenicity 3apollution 3aradionuclides 0aIonizing radiation 0aPlants 0aChromosomal damage1 aKrupitza, Georg1 aMišíková, Katarína,1 aMičieta, Karol1 aNersesyan, Armen1 aKundi, M.q(Michael),1 aKnasmueller, Siegfried0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2016 Dec., v. 219 p.1044-1048dElsevier Ltdx0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03656naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013400163300001400297520166200311592002801973650002102001650001502022650002802037650001602065650001802081650002102099650001602120650001002136650003202146650001102178650001302189650003902202650001702241650001202258650001202270650002402282653002302306653002902329653006602358653005302424653005002477653001902527653000802546653001102554653000902565653001302574653001002587653001002597653000702607653001302614653000902627653000902636653001102645653000802656653000802664653000802672700001502680700001402695700001702709700001702726773012102743856008502864852000902949655001202958IND60543300320221118093133.0190410e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054330032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.02.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Liu,10aSoluble expression of Spinach psbC gene in Escherichia coli and in vitro reconstitution of CP43 coupled with chlorophyll a only  ap. 19-24.  aCP43 is a chlorophyll a (Chl a) and β-carotene (β-Car) binding protein encoded by psbC gene. In this study, psbC gene isolated from Spinach was expressed in Escherichia coli in soluble state. After lysis of the cells, the apoproteins purified by nickel affinity chromatography were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot. Next, reconstitution experiment was carried out in vitro and the formation of stable pigment–protein complex was analyzed by partially denaturing electrophoresis. After purifying reconstituted CP43 (rCP43) from free pigments (FPs) by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and subsequently ion exchange chromatography (IEC), the eluate was analyzed by partially denaturing electrophoresis to confirm stability of the reconstructed complex. Finally, analyses of spectroscopic character of the eluate revealed that in vitro reconstitution was achieved and FPs were completely removed from the pigment–protein complex. Comparison between the absorption spectra of the rCP43 and native CP43 (nCP43) showed the lack of peaks between 450 and 500 nm, illustrating that the β-Car was stripped off rCP43. In brief, it is feasible to obtain a reconstituted protein binding Chl a only, indicating that the occupancy of the β-Car site has small impact on the stabilization of CP43. However, β-Car shows strong interaction with Chl a, inducing the hyperchromic effect in blue region of spectrum and the blue shift of the 438.5 nm and 673.5 nm absorption band to 437 nm and 671 nm respectively. To some extent, our research is suggestive that β-Car, coupled loosely with CP43, contributes to the precise orientation of Chl a in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aabsorption 3aaffinity chromatography 3aapoproteins 3abeta-carotene 3abinding proteins 3achlorophyll 3agenes 3aion exchange chromatography 3anickel 3apigments 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aspectroscopy 3aspinach 3asucrose 3aultracentrifugation 0aSoluble expression 0aReconstitution in vitro 0aPartially denaturing polyacrylamide green gel electrophoresis 0aVisible absorption and fluorescence spectrometry 0aReconstituted CP43 binding only chlorophyll a 0aPhotosystem II 0aChl 0aβ-Car 0aCP43 0aHis-CP43 0arCP43 0anCP43 0aDM 0aSDS-PAGE 0apsbC 0aPSII 0aLHC II 0aOEC 0aFPs 0aIEC1 aXie, Si-Si1 aYue Luo, 1 aZhu, Guo-Fei1 aDu, Lin-Fang0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2014 June, v. 79 p.19-24dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.02.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013200160300001800292520141900310592002801729650002801757650002201785650002101807650002801828650001701856650001601873650001801889650002201907650001801929650001401947650002001961650001901981650001302000700001402013700001202027700001802039700001302057700001602070773012202086856007402208852000902282655001202291IND60631429920221118083655.0190223e20190218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063142992DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra10282a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xian-Ling10aEnzymatic synthesis of selenium-containing amphiphilic aliphatic polycarbonate as an oxidation-responsive drug delivery vehicle  ap. 6003-6010.  aAlthough functional aliphatic polycarbonates (APCs) have attracted prominent research interest as stimuli-responsive biomaterials, the majority of functional APCs are fabricated by detrimental organometallic catalysts or organo-catalysts. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy based on enzymatic polymerization was developed to construct a selenium-containing amphiphilic aliphatic polycarbonate (mPEG-b-CMP₄₅). Specifically, the selenium in its backbone framework underwent a hydrophobic–hydrophilic transition upon exposure to the abnormal ROS level of the tumor, thus providing a promising platform for ROS-triggered drug release. This amphiphilic mPEG-b-CMP₄₅ efficiently encapsulated doxorubicin (DOX) via self-assembly in aqueous solution and showed an excellent ability to regulate the release of DOX in response to H₂O₂ at biologically relevant concentrations (100 μM). These DOX-loaded nanoparticles could easily be internalized into U87 cells and possess the inherent antitumor properties of DOX, while they exhibited much lower cytotoxicity in normal cells HL-7702. Moreover, in many cases, the introduction of selenium caused high cytotoxicity of the materials, but the cytotoxicity results in HL-7702 cells demonstrated the good biocompatibility of mPEG-b-CMP₄₅. These collective data suggested the potential use of mPEG-b-CMP₄₅ as a biocompatible and smart drug delivery vehicle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocompatibility 3abiocompatible materials 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3adrug carriers 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasms 3aorganocatalysts 3apolymerization 3aselenium1 aXing, Xiu1 aLi, Jun1 aLiu, Yan-Hong1 aWang, Na1 aYu, Xiao-Qi0 tRSC advances.g2019 Feb. 18, v. 9, no. 11 p.6003-6010dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra10282a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245008600208300001000294506007600304520154300380592002801923506003701951650003401988650001502022650002402037650002202061650001702083650002202100650001002122650002002132650001702152650001202169650001002181773015602191856007702347852000902424655001202433IND60548033320221207125007.0160903e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054803332DNAL7 a10.1186/1479-5868-4-62doi7 aPMC18206002pmcid7 a173388122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwartz, Marlene B14aThe influence of a verbal prompt on school lunch fruit consumption: a pilot study  ap. 6.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: This study evaluated an environmental intervention intended to increase consumption of the fruit serving among elementary school children participating in the National School Lunch Program (NSLP). METHODS: Children's fruit consumption was measured in two schools by observation. In the intervention school, cafeteria workers provided the verbal prompt, "Would you like fruit or juice with your lunch?" as the children stood in line in front of the fruit serving options. The control school had the same fruit and 100% juice options available, but the cafeteria workers did not provide a verbal prompt to take a fruit serving. Two variables were assessed: (1) Did children leave the lunch line with a fruit serving on their trays? and (2) Did they subsequently eat the fruit serving? RESULTS: The average percentage of children who took a fruit serving was 60% in the control school and 90% in the intervention school. In both schools, approximately 80% of children ate the fruit on their tray. As a result, nearly 70% of the children in the intervention school consumed a fruit serving at lunch, while fewer than 40% did so in the control school. CONCLUSION: A simple verbal prompt appears to have a significant impact on the likelihood that children will take, and subsequently consume, a fruit serving as part of their purchased school lunch. If these findings are replicated, policymakers may consider adding verbal prompts to the serving policy of the NSLP in an effort to increase fruit consumption among school children.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNational School Lunch Program 3acafeterias 3aelementary students 3afruit consumption 3afruit juices 3aissues and policy 3alunch 3aschool children 3aschool lunch 3aschools 3atrays0 tinternational journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity.g2007 Dec., v. 4, no. 1 p.6-6dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350546x1479-58687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1479-5868-4-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03528naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001800165245011600183300001400299520141800313592002801731650002501759650002801784650001501812650001901827650002001846650001701866650002101883650000901904650001101913650002501924650002501949650001601974650001401990650001402004650001602018650002402034650001302058650001202071650003302083650003502116650002302151650001102174650007402185650003702259650003302296650003002329650003002359650000902389650002402398650003702422650003602459700001502495700001202510700001602522700001802538700001502556700001902571700002002590700001802610773011102628856008202739852000902821655001202830IND4471314220221123021434.0141112e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447131422DNAL7 a215964042pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Fangyan10aEvaluation of recombinant proteins of Haemophilus parasuis strain SH0165 as vaccine candidates in a mouse model  ap. 51-56.  aThe recently completed genome sequence of Haemophilus parasuis strain SH0165 allowed us to screen putative OMPs for the development of recombinant vaccines. The objective of this study was to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of three OMPs of H. parasuis. Three putative OMPs (SmpA, YgiW and FOG) were cloned, expressed and purified by Ni affinity chromatography using nitriloacetic acid resin. Mice were immunized either individually (individual protein, IP) or synergistically (synergistic protein, SP) with the recombinant proteins. A significant increase in IgG titer was detected in all protein-immunized mice. Isotyping studies revealed that the antibodies produced were predominantly IgG2a-type, indicating a predominant Th1 response. A significant increase was observed in IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-γ levels in the culture supernatants of splenocytes isolated from immunized mice. Furthermore, mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 6×10⁹CFU (5×LD₅₀) of highly virulent homologous serovar 5 strain (SH0165) or 7.0×10⁹CFU (5×LD₅₀) of the heterologous serovar 4 strain (MD0322) at fourteen days after the last immunization. All of the recombinant proteins enhanced survival and reduced histopathological lesions. Our results indicated that the three OMPs showed protection both individually and synergistically against infection with the highly virulent H. parasuis in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaemophilus parasuis 3aaffinity chromatography 3aantibodies 3ahistopathology 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amice 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3arecombinant proteins 3aresin acids 3ascreening 3aserotypes 3asplenocytes 3avaccine development 3avaccines 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBacterial Vaccinesximmunology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFemale 2aHaemophilus Infectionsximmunologyxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aHaemophilus parasuisximmunology 2aInterferon-gammaxmetabolism 2aInterleukin-4xmetabolism 2aInterleukin-6xmetabolism 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aRecombinant Proteinsximmunology 2aVaccines, Syntheticximmunology1 aFu, Shulin1 aHu, Jin1 aLi, Jinquan1 aChang, Haitao1 aHu, Linlin1 aChen, Huanchun1 aTian, Yongxiang1 aBei, Weicheng0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2012 Aug., v. 93, no. 1 p.51-56dElsevier India Pvt Ltd.x0034-52887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2011.04.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02189naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245008900201300001800290500002000308520107700328592002801405596004101433650002301474650001501497650001201512650002201524650002601546700002601572700006301598773011901661856007401780852000901854655001201863IND60778657620221120065651.0220530e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077865762DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.140202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbecker, Molly A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5121-810112aA novel analytical framework to quantify co‐gradient and countergradient variation  ap. 1521-1533.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSpatial covariance between genotypic and environmental influences on phenotypes (CovGE) can result in the nonrandom distribution of genotypes across environmental gradients and is a potentially important factor driving local adaptation. However, a framework to quantify the magnitude and significance of CovGE has been lacking. We develop a novel quantitative/analytical approach to estimate and test the significance of CovGE from reciprocal transplant or common garden experiments, which we validate using simulated data. We demonstrate how power to detect CovGE changes over a range of experimental designs. We confirm an inverse relationship between gene‐by‐environment interactions (GxE) and CovGE, as predicted by first principles, but show how phenotypes can be influenced by both. The metric provides a way to measure how phenotypic plasticity covaries with genetic differentiation and highlights the importance of understanding the dual influences of CovGE and GxE on phenotypes in studies of local adaptation and species’ responses to environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data  a1764316cNational Science Foundation 3aanalytical methods 3acovariance 3aecology 3agenetic variation 3aphenotypic plasticity1 aTrussell, Geoffrey C.1 aLotterhos, Katie E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7529-27710 tEcology letters.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.1521-1533dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.140203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03683naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011700171300001800288520144300306536029401749592002802043596006602071596006702137596007202204650002702276650001802303650002002321650001002341650001402351650001802365650001602383650001602399650002602415650001102441650001602452650002002468650001802488650002702506650001002533653003202543653001702575653002702592653002802619653001102647700002602658700002302684700001902707700001802726700002502744700002002769700002002789700002202809700002302831773012102854856008502975852000903060655001203069IND60648143220221118020451.0190626e20190811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064814322DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.14413302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTodero, Izelmar10aConcentration of metabolites from Phoma sp. using microfiltration membrane for increasing bioherbicidal activity  ap. 2364-2372.  aThis study is focused on the concentration of fermented broth from Phoma sp. to increase its herbicidal activity. For this purpose, biomolecules produced by submerged fermentation using Phoma sp. were concentrated by hollow fiber microfiltration membranes. The membrane feed was separated into two streams (retentate and permeate) and the crude broth was concentrated to 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90% (relative to the initial volume). The retentate samples were submitted to bioassays (triplicate) for evaluating their phytotoxic effects on five young leaves of species of Cucumis sativus and also on pre-emergence of weeds as Bidens pilosa and Amaranthus retroflexus. The highest herbicidal activity was 80.7% obtained for a concentration of 30% in the retentate fraction. At this condition, the bioherbicide presented severe damage symptoms on the detached leaves of Cucumis sativus if compared to the crude fermented broth. In the pre-emergence of B. pilosa and A. retroflexus, 100% control was obtained for assays performed in a germination chamber. For greenhouse assays using the substrate, the control rate of A. retroflexus was dependent of concentration of bioherbicide. The promising results achieved in the research with membrane separation process allow us to propose and develop further studies for evaluating this technology in the concentration of other metabolites produced by fermentation which also have bioherbicidal activity.  aThe authors thank Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) for the scholarships, and National Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) and the Research Support Foundation of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (FAPERGS) for the financial support.  aPublisher supplied data  cResearch Support Foundation of the State of Rio Grande do Sul  cCoordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel  cNational Counsel of Technological and Scientific Development (CNPq) 3aAmaranthus retroflexus 3aBidens pilosa 3aCucumis sativus 3aPhoma 3abioassays 3abiopesticides 3agermination 3agreenhouses 3aherbicidal properties 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3amicrofiltration 3aphytotoxicity 3asubmerged fermentation 3aweeds 0aMembrane separation process 0abiomolecules 0asubmerged fermentation 0aecofriendly bioproducts 0afungus1 aConfortin, Tássia C.1 aSoares, Juliana F.1 aBrun, Thiarles1 aLuft, Luciana1 aRabuske, Jéssica E.1 aKuhn, Raquel C.1 aTres, Marcus V.1 aZabot, Giovani L.1 aMazutti, Marcio A.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2019 Aug. 11, v. 40, no. 18 p.2364-2372dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.14413303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245010700176300001400283520118100297592002801478650001501506650002901521650002001550650001701570650003901587650002201626650002201648650001301670650002301683650002001706650001101726650001101737651001701748651001801765653002901783653004401812653002701856653003701883653004401920653001801964653001701982700001901999700003002018700002502048700001902073700001902092700002102111773009902132856008902231852000902320655001202329IND60601847520221117202036.0200128e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060184752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2018.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPowers, Leanne C.10aSeasonal changes in dissolved organic matter composition in Delaware Bay, USA in March and August 2014  ap. 87-97.  aWe combined Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) and mass spectrometric analysis of stable carbon isotopes, a traditional method for tracking DOM sources, to investigate the variation in the complexity of water samples collected along a salinity gradient in Delaware Bay in March and August 2014. Detailed analyses of optical properties (ultraviolet and visible (UV–Vis) absorbance and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy) were carried out. Results from statistical parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of EEM data were also used to track and further constrain fluorescent DOM (FDOM). Optical analyses and FT-ICR-MS data showed large differences between late winter and summer conditions, and the stable carbon isotopic composition was more variable in summer than in late winter. Although terrestrial inputs of DOM are evident at low salinities in both seasons, our data suggest that a significant source of FDOM, from either in situ water column production or from benthic aquatic or semi-aquatic plant communities, contributes DOM to low and mid-salinity waters in Delaware Bay during summer but not in late winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3adissolved organic matter 3afactor analysis 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amass spectrometry 3aplant communities 3asalinity 3aseasonal variation 3astable isotopes 3asummer 3awinter 3aDelaware Bay 3aUnited States 0aDissolved organic matter 0aUltra high resolution mass spectrometry 0aStable carbon isotopes 0aUV–Vis absorption spectroscopy 0aExcitation-emission matrix spectroscopy 0aPARAFAC model 0aDelaware Bay1 aLuek, Jenna L.1 aSchmitt-Kopplin, Philippe1 aCampbell, Barbara J.1 aMagen, Cédric1 aCooper, Lee W.1 aGonsior, Michael0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2018 Aug., v. 122 p.87-97dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2018.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002700138245013300165300001800298500001100316520143000327592002801757596006801785596006801853596006801921650002801989650001702017650002002034650001902054650001302073650001802086650001102104650001802115650001102133650001702144650001702161650001402178650001702192650001302209650001302222650001802235650002202253650002102275700001702296700002502313700005902338773012402397856007302521852000902594655001202603IND60788600420221119005353.0220815e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078860042DNAL7 a10.1002/ptr.75382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Oliveira, Thayse V.10aPreclinical studies of the antitumor effect of curcumin‐loaded polymeric nanocapsules: A systematic review and meta‐analysis  ap. 3202-3214.  aREVIEW  aCurcumin, a plant‐derived compound, has various well‐known biological effects (anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumor, among others) as well as some important limitations for formulators, such as poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability. Its nanoencapsulation is reported to overcome these drawbacks and to improve its in vivo efficacy. Here, data from preclinical in vivo studies evaluating the antitumor efficacy of curcumin‐loaded polymeric nanocapsules are collected, analyzed, and discussed as a systematic review. Meta‐analyses are performed to assess the contribution of this nanoencapsulation compared with nonencapsulated curcumin. Eighteen studies (116 animals) meet the inclusion criteria. The evidence that curcumin‐loaded polymeric nanocapsules inhibits tumor growth (SMD: −3.03; 95% CI: −3.84, −2.21; p < 0.00001) and decreases tumor weight (SMD: −3.96; 95% CI: −6.22, −1.70; p = 0.0006) in rodents is established, regardless of the solid tumor model. To assess the quality of the studies included in the review a bias risk analysis was performed using the SYRCLE's RoB tool. Therefore, encapsulation in polymeric nanocapsules represents an important tool to improve the antitumor effects of curcumin, and this systematic review paves the way for future clinical studies and the translation of curcumin formulations into novel nanomedicines for human cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data  cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3acancer therapy 3acurcumin 3aencapsulation 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3ananocapsules 3ananomedicine 3aneoplasms 3aphytotherapy 3apolymers 3aresearch 3arisk analysis 3asystematic review 3awater solubility1 aStein, Renan1 ade Andrade, Diego F.1 aBeck, Ruy C.

Based on analogies with feather pecking in laying hens, a similar correlation might be present in parrots with feather damaging behaviour. To investigate whether this correlation is present in parrots, 22 Grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus erithacus) with and without feather damaging behaviour were subjected to (1) a manual restraint test, (2) novel object test and (3) open field test. All tests were performed in a standardized setting, with a one-week interval between the tests. Recordings were made of the parrots’ responses, which were subsequently analysed to determine latency times, intensity, frequency and/or duration of specific behaviours. In addition, blood was collected to assess the birds’ neurophysiologic responses (corticosterone, norepinephrine) during manual restraint. Significant differences were found between the groups of birds with and without feather damaging behaviour with regard to the birds’ reactions in all the behaviour tests. Particularly the response during the open field test was found to correlate well with the presence of feather damaging behaviour: birds with feather damaging behaviour showed higher open field activity indicative of a proactive coping style. Additionally, feather damaging birds displayed proactive behaviour in the novel object test, as expressed by their initial reaction to a novel object. A manual restraint test did not reveal distinct differences in the amount of resistance displayed by the parrots with and without feather damaging behaviour. Struggling frequencies and neurophysiologic responses, however, tended to be different, with a higher number of struggling attempts and a more prominent rise in plasma corticosterone concentrations in birds without feather damaging behaviour. Aforementioned results suggest that parrots with feather damaging behaviour display a proactive coping style, which is similar to the findings in feather pecking laying hens. These findings provide further insight into the aetiology of feather damaging behaviour, and suggest a potential role for behavioural testing in establishing whether a parrot is at risk for developing this behavioural disorder. Further (prospective) studies with larger groups of parrots are, however, needed to confirm a correlation between coping style and the display of feather damaging behaviour throughout the parrot population and to determine whether and which behaviour tests have (the highest) predictive value.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsittacus 3abehavior disorders 3ablood 3acorticosterone 3afeather pecking 3afeathers 3alaying hens 3anorepinephrine 3aparrots 3apecking 3arisk 0aManual restraint test 0aNovel object test 0aOpen field test 0aPsittacine 0aFeather plucking 0aFeather picking1 avan der Aa, Marleen M.J.A.1 aVinke, Claudia M.1 aLumeij, Johannes T.1 aSchoemaker, Nico J.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2013 Oct., v. 148, no. 3-4 p.218-231dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2013.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01729naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245010100197300001800298500001100316520077800327592002801105650001901133650002501152650001601177650002401193700002001217773011901237856007401356852000901430655001201439IND60778657820221121035212.0220530e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077865782DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.140062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOña, Leonardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0883-713410aCooperation increases robustness to ecological disturbance in microbial cross‐feeding networks  ap. 1410-1420.  aLETTER  aMicroorganisms mainly exist within complex networks of ecological interactions. Given that the growth and survival of community members frequently depend on an obligate exchange of essential metabolites, it is generally unclear how such communities can persist despite the destabilising force of ecological disturbance. Here we address this issue using a population dynamics model. In contrast to previous work that suggests the potential for obligate interaction networks to emerge is limited, we find the opposite pattern: ecological disturbance favours both specific network topologies and cooperative cross‐feeding among community members. These results establish environmental perturbations as a key driver shaping the architecture of microbial interaction networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3adynamic models 3aecological imbalance 3ametabolites 3apopulation dynamics1 aKost, Christian0 tEcology letters.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.1410-1420dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.140063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02984naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245013500199300001800334520135600352592002801708650001401736650001501750650001901765650001701784650001901801650001701820650002201837650002101859650002201880650002801902650001601930650002401946650002601970650001001996650001702006653001602023653001902039653001802058653002102076653002702097700001302124700001602137700001502153700001302168700001702181700002002198773014702218856008002365852000902445655001202454IND60630814820221121051805.0190214e20181119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063081482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.8b036622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7313-999210aProtection of Porcine Intestinal-Epithelial Cells from Deoxynivalenol-Induced Damage by Resveratrol via the Nrf2 Signaling Pathway  ap. 1726-1735.  aDeoxynivalenol (DON), a common mycotoxin, usually induces oxidative stress and affects the intestinal health of humans and animals. This study investigated the protective effect of resveratrol (RES), a natural antioxidant, on alleviating the cytotoxicity induced by DON in the porcine intestinal-epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Cells were incubated with RES for 24 h and then exposed to DON for another 24 h. Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, and oxidative-stress indicators were determined. In comparison with DON-only-treated cells, pretreatment with RES (15 μM) increased the cell viability (79.74 ± 2.02 vs 90.98 ± 2.66%, P < 0.01), improved proliferation (EdU-positive cells, 26.42 ± 1.12 vs 32.05 ± 0.78%, P < 0.01), decreased accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS, 1.68 ± 0.05 vs 1.29 ± 0.06, P < 0.01), stabilized mitochondrial-membrane potential (MMP, 8.98 ± 1.40 vs 2.29 ± 0.76, P < 0.001), and prevented apoptosis induced by DON (13.91 ± 1.20 vs 6.83 ± 0.52%, P < 0.01). RES activated the Nrf2 signaling pathway, and transfection with Nrf2 siRNA abrogated the protection of RES against DON-induced cytotoxicity, accumulation of intracellular ROS, and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. Collectively, RES protects IPEC-J2 cells against DON-induced damage at least partly via the Nrf2 signaling pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acell lines 3acell viability 3acytotoxicity 3adeoxynivalenol 3ahuman health 3aintestinal mucosa 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3areactive oxygen species 3aresveratrol 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3aswine 3atransfection 0aresveratrol 0adeoxynivalenol 0aIPEC-J2 cells 0aoxidative damage 0aNrf2 signaling pathway1 aZhu, Cui1 aYe, Jinling1 aLv, Yantao1 aWang, Li1 aChen, Zhuang1 aJiang, Zongyong0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2018 Nov. 19, v. 67, no. 6 p.1726-1735dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b036623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04225naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245011700163300001600280520266800296592002802964650002302992650001603015650002303031650001803054650000903072650002003081650002703101650002403128650001303152650001703165650002003182650000903202650002103211650002003232650001803252650001103270653001703281653002103298653001203319653002003331700001703351700001803368700002003386700001603406700001903422700001603441773015103457856007803608852000903686655001203695IND60539544020221118082059.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053954402DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-83892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwendel, B.H.10aInvited review: Organic and conventionally produced milk—An evaluation of factors influencing milk composition  ap. 721-746.  aConsumer perception of organic cow milk is associated with the assumption that organic milk differs from conventionally produced milk. The value associated with this difference justifies the premium retail price for organic milk. It includes the perceptions that organic dairy farming is kinder to the environment, animals, and people; that organic milk products are produced without the use of antibiotics, added hormones, synthetic chemicals, and genetic modification; and that they may have potential benefits for human health. Controlled studies investigating whether differences exist between organic and conventionally produced milk have so far been largely equivocal due principally to the complexity of the research question and the number of factors that can influence milk composition. A main complication is that farming practices and their effects differ depending on country, region, year, and season between and within organic and conventional systems. Factors influencing milk composition (e.g., diet, breed, and stage of lactation) have been studied individually, whereas interactions between multiple factors have been largely ignored. Studies that fail to consider that factors other than the farming system (organic vs. conventional) could have caused or contributed to the reported differences in milk composition make it impossible to determine whether a system-related difference exists between organic and conventional milk. Milk fatty acid composition has been a central research area when comparing organic and conventional milk largely because the milk fatty acid profile responds rapidly and is very sensitive to changes in diet. Consequently, the effect of farming practices (high input vs. low input) rather than farming system (organic vs. conventional) determines milk fatty acid profile, and similar results are seen between low-input organic and low-input conventional milks. This confounds our ability to develop an analytical method to distinguish organic from conventionally produced milk and provide product verification. Lack of research on interactions between several influential factors and differences in trial complexity and consistency between studies (e.g., sampling period, sample size, reporting of experimental conditions) complicate data interpretation and prevent us from making unequivocal conclusions. The first part of this review provides a detailed summary of individual factors known to influence milk composition. The second part presents an overview of studies that have compared organic and conventional milk and discusses their findings within the framework of the various factors presented in part one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3aantibiotics 3aconsumer attitudes 3adairy farming 3adiet 3afarming systems 3afatty acid composition 3agenetic engineering 3ahormones 3ahuman health 3alactation stage 3amilk 3amilk fatty acids 3amilk production 3aorganic foods 3aprices 0aorganic milk 0amilk composition 0apasture 0amilk fatty acid1 aWester, T.J.1 aMorel, P.C.H.1 aTavendale, M.H.1 aDeadman, C.1 aShadbolt, N.M.1 aOtter, D.E.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.721-746dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-83893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245011900165300001600284520102900300592002801329650002201357650001601379650001101395650001101406650002101417650003101438650001201469650002701481650001401508650001101522650001301533650001601546653002101562653005601583700001601639700001201655700001701667700001401684773013501698856008701833852000901920655001201929IND60754545320221120054921.0211123e20211215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075454532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.10.1222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Mi10aControllable conversion of shrimp shells into chitin or derived carbon material using acidic deep eutectic solvent  ap. 347-357.  aIt is important to convert waste shrimp shells into chitin and its derivatives, but it still faces disadvantages of pollution and long process. In this research, deep eutectic solvents made from choline chloride (ChCl) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (TsOH) were used to convert shrimp shells into chitin or carbon materials through adjustment of temperature with a dissolution-regeneration method in one step. Obtained precipitates and regenerated products gradually changed from chitin to carbon materials with the temperature adjusted to 130 °C and 110 °C, respectively. The α-chitin with the highest purity of 97.9 ± 0.1 wt% was prepared using 15 wt% ChCl/TsOH (1:2, n:n) aqueous solution at 70 °C, and the yield was 59.4 ± 1.9 wt%. Moreover, the carbon materials prepared by ChCl/TsOH (1:4) treatment with water and ethanol as anti-solvent were S/N/O-doped carbon materials, which exhibited potential in the supercapacitor with a specific capacitance of 24.8 and 19.3 F/g at 1 A/g, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acapacitance 3acarbon 3achitin 3acholine chloride 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aethanol 3ap-toluenesulfonic acid 3apollution 3ashrimp 3asolvents 3atemperature 0aCarbon materials 0aCholine chloride/p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate1 aYan, Jipeng1 aHe, Bin1 aChen, Xinyan1 aSun, Jian0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Dec. 15, v. 193 p.347-357dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.10.1223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02253naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245008800164300001800252500001100270520087500281592002801156596004801184596004701232596004701279650001501326650001701341650001501358650001401373650001501387650001701402650001501419650002301434700002301457700002401480700001801504700001901522700002601541700002101567700001401588773011601602856008001718852000901798655001201807IND60786822920221120074344.0220806e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078682292DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.128542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeHaan, Hunter13aAn in vivo proteomic analysis of the Me31B interactome in Drosophila germ granules  ap. 3536-3547.  aLETTER  aDrosophila Me31B is a conserved protein of germ granules, ribonucleoprotein complexes essential for germ cell development. Me31B post‐transcriptionally regulates mRNAs by interacting with other germ granule proteins. However, a Me31B interactome is lacking. Here, we use an in vivo proteomics approach to show that the Me31B interactome contains polypeptides from four functional groups: RNA regulatory proteins, glycolytic enzymes, cytoskeleton/motor proteins, and germ plasm components. We further show that Me31B likely colocalizes with the germ plasm components Tudor (Tud), Vasa, and Aubergine in the nuage and germ plasm and provide evidence that Me31B may directly bind to Tud in a symmetrically dimethylated arginine‐dependent manner. Our study supports the role of Me31B in RNA regulation and suggests its novel roles in germ granule assembly and function.  aPublisher supplied data  cIndiana University Northwest Star‐Up Fund  aMCB‐1054962cNational Science Foundation  aMCB‐1715541cNational Science Foundation 3aDrosophila 3acytoskeleton 3agerm cells 3agermplasm 3aglycolysis 3apolypeptides 3aproteomics 3aribonucleoproteins1 aMcCambridge, Aidan1 aArmstrong, Brittany1 aCruse, Carlie1 aSolanki, Dhruv1 aTrinidad, Jonathan C.1 aArkov, Alexey L.1 aGao, Ming0 tFEBS letters.g2017 Nov., v. 591, no. 21 p.3536-3547dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.128543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245010500197300001800302500001100320520125600331592002801587596002101615650005201636650002101688650002501709650001101734650001401745650001401759650001301773650001801786650000901804650002001813650001301833700001901846700001901865700001701884700001801901700002301919700002101942700001901963700006001982700006202042773011902104856007402223852000902297655001202306IND60778658020221120042515.0220530e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077865802DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.140032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFagre, Anna C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0969-507810aAssessing the risk of human‐to‐wildlife pathogen transmission for conservation and public health  ap. 1534-1549.  aREVIEW  aThe SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic has led to increased concern over transmission of pathogens from humans to animals, and its potential to threaten conservation and public health. To assess this threat, we reviewed published evidence of human‐to‐wildlife transmission events, with a focus on how such events could threaten animal and human health. We identified 97 verified examples, involving a wide range of pathogens; however, reported hosts were mostly non‐human primates or large, long‐lived captive animals. Relatively few documented examples resulted in morbidity and mortality, and very few led to maintenance of a human pathogen in a new reservoir or subsequent “secondary spillover” back into humans. We discuss limitations in the literature surrounding these phenomena, including strong evidence of sampling bias towards non‐human primates and human‐proximate mammals and the possibility of systematic bias against reporting human parasites in wildlife, both of which limit our ability to assess the risk of human‐to‐wildlife pathogen transmission. We outline how researchers can collect experimental and observational evidence that will expand our capacity for risk assessment for human‐to‐wildlife pathogen transmission.  aPublisher supplied data  a2021909cNSF BII 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aanimal pathogens 3adisease transmission 3ahumans 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apandemic 3apublic health 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3awildlife1 aCohen, Lily E.1 aEskew, Evan A.1 aFarrell, Max1 aGlennon, Emma1 aJoseph, Maxwell B.1 aFrank, Hannah K.1 aRyan, Sadie J.1 aCarlson, Colin J1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6960-84341 aAlbery, Gregory F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6260-26620 tEcology letters.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.1534-1549dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.140033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245012500169300001400294520125900308592002801567650001201595650001501607650003001622650001601652650002301668650001301691650002601704650001301730650001001743650001101753650001101764650002101775650002201796650001401818650000901832650001101841650002401852651001001876653003601886653002901922653003601951653002001987700001502007700001702022773009902039856008902138852000902227655001202236IND60601847820221117202139.0200128e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060184782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.orggeochem.2018.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Juzhi10aVariable apparent hydrogen isotopic fractionation between sedimentary n-alkanes and precipitation on the Tibetan Plateau  ap. 78-86.  aThe hydrogen isotope ratio values of sedimentary leaf wax n-alkanes (δDwₐₓ) have been considered a reliable proxy for precipitation isotope ratios (δDP) across various transects on a global basis. Records of δDwₐₓ have been used to infer past changes in hydrology, climate and altimetry, assuming nearly constant apparent hydrogen isotopic fractionation (εwₐₓ₋P) between sedimentary leaf wax components and precipitation. Here, we present the results of an analysis of δDwₐₓ values from the surface sediments of 22 lakes across a precipitation and vegetation gradient on the Tibetan Plateau. The δDwₐₓ values correlated significantly with mean annual precipitation δD (r 0.90) and summer precipitation δD (r 0.91), suggesting that δDwₐₓ can record δDP in very dry regions. However, εwₐₓ₋P varies with annual precipitation as well as with relative humidity. Calculation using Craig-Gordon isotope models showed that the variable εwₐₓ₋P values likely resulted from intensive soil evaporation and plant evapotranspiration in this relatively arid region. This implies that variable isotopic fractionation should be taken into consideration when reconstructing paleohydrology, paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkanes 3aarid zones 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3ahydrogen 3aisotope fractionation 3aisotopes 3alakes 3aleaves 3amodels 3apaleoclimatology 3arelative humidity 3asediments 3asoil 3asummer 3avegetation gradient 3aChina 0aSedimentary leaf wax D/H values 0aPrecipitation D/H values 0aApparent isotopic fractionation 0aTibetan Plateau1 aTian, Qian1 aWang, Mingda0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2018 Aug., v. 122 p.78-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2018.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245009600197300001800293500001100311520113800322592002801460596005501488596005501543596005501598650001701653650001701670650002901687700001601716700001601732700001701748700002101765700001701786700007001803773011901873856007401992852000902066655001202075IND60778658120221120042407.0220530e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077865812DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.140042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapdevila, Pol1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2842-430210aLife history mediates the trade‐offs among different components of demographic resilience  ap. 1566-1579.  aREVIEW  aAccelerating rates of biodiversity loss underscore the need to understand how species achieve resilience—the ability to resist and recover from a/biotic disturbances. Yet, the factors determining the resilience of species remain poorly understood, due to disagreements on its definition and the lack of large‐scale analyses. Here, we investigate how the life history of 910 natural populations of animals and plants predicts their intrinsic ability to be resilient. We show that demographic resilience can be achieved through different combinations of compensation, resistance and recovery after a disturbance. We demonstrate that these resilience components are highly correlated with life history traits related to the species’ pace of life and reproductive strategy. Species with longer generation times require longer recovery times post‐disturbance, whilst those with greater reproductive capacity have greater resistance and compensation. Our findings highlight the key role of life history traits to understand species resilience, improving our ability to predict how natural populations cope with disturbance regimes.  aPublisher supplied data  aBEVP30P01A5816cRamon Areces Foundation Fellowship  aNE/M018458/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/S006125/1cNatural Environment Research Council 3abiodiversity 3alife history 3areproductive performance1 aStott, Iain1 aCant, James1 aBeger, Maria1 aRowlands, Gwilym1 aGrace, Molly1 aSalguero‐Gómez, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6085-44330 tEcology letters.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.1566-1579dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.140043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002400169245016200193300001800355520096300373592002801336650001501364650002701379650002801406650002501434650001501459650002001474650003301494650001701527650001701544650001601561650001501577650004501592650002501637650002301662650003501685650003001720650004601750650002601796650003101822650002101853653001901874653002301893653002101916653001901937700001801956700001801974773013101992856005102123852000902174655001202183IND50076451720221118015439.0140410e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007645172DNAL7 a238021602pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.7968302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlikarami, Mohammad10aStudy of enzymatic degradation and water absorption of composites carboxymethyl cellulose and poly (ϵ-caprolactone) containing SiO2nanoparticle by cellulase  ap. 1516-1521.  aThis study investigates the effect of Poly (ϵ-Caprolactone (PCL) and Nano-SiO₂content within the Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) blends on the rate and extent of carboxymethyl cellulose enzymatic hydrolysis using the enzyme cellulase. The results reveal that blends with Nano-SiO₂content at 5 wt% exhibit a significantly reduced rate and extent of CMC hydrolysis. This may be attributed to interactions between CMC and SiO₂that prevent further enzymatic attack on the remaining CMC phases within the blend. The total solids that remained after 2880 min were 44.8 wt.% (CMC: PCL); 62.7 wt.% (CMC: PCL: 1% Nano-SiO₂); 69.8 wt.% (CMC: PCL: 3% Nano-SiO₂); 73.1 wt.% (CMC: PCL: 5% Nano-SiO₂).

Selectivity during biodegradation was observed for the adamantanes. The relative susceptibility to biodegradation of individual adamantane compounds was determined based on their compositional changes. Adamantanes with more alkyl substituents were generally more resistant to biodegradation, but exceptions also occurred. The position of alkylation had great control on the susceptibility to biodegradation. However, the more thermally stable compounds were not always more readily biodegraded, suggesting that the susceptibility of adamantanes is not directly controlled by thermodynamic stability. Selective biodegradation of adamantanes may be related to their stereochemical structures and demethylation could have occurred. Microbial alteration of adamantanes had negligible effects on the methyladmantane index, dimethyladamantane index 1, dimethyladamantane index 2, trimethyladamantane index 1 and trimethyladamantane index 2, suggesting that they could still be used to evaluate the thermal maturity of biodegraded crude oils. In contrast, the ethyladmantane index was significantly altered and thus is not valid for maturity assessment of biodegraded oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkylation 3abasins 3abiodegradation 3aoils 3apetroleum 3astereochemistry 3athermal stability 3aChina 0aBiodegradation 0aDiamondoids 0aAdamantane 0aAlkyladamantanes 0aBohai Bay Basin1 aHou, Dujie1 aXu, Changgui0 tOrganic geochemistry.g2018 Sept., v. 123 p.38-43dElsevier LtdwJournal:11790x0146-63807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.orggeochem.2018.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002700169245015500196300001800351520127700369592002801646650002701674650002901701650002001730650001801750650000901768650001801777650001701795650002501812650001501837650002501852650002801877650003001905651002101935651001101956653002801967653001001995653002602005653001002031653003202041653001502073653001102088700002002099700002102119773013102140856005102271852000902322655001202331IND50076451820221118015432.0140410e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007645182DNAL7 a238021612pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.7972422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖztürk, Buket Canbaz10aReference levels of natural radioactivity and 137Cs in and around the surface soils of Kestanbol pluton in Ezine region of Çanakkale province, Turkey  ap. 1522-1532.  aThe aim of the study was to conduct a systematic investigation on the natural gamma emitting radionuclides (²²⁶Ra, ²³²Th and ⁴⁰K) as well as ¹³⁷Cs in the surface soils from Kestanbol/Ezine plutonic area in Çanakkale province as part of the environmental monitoring program on radiologic impact of the granitoid areas in Western Anatolia. The activity measurements of the gamma emitters in the surface soil samples collected from 52 sites distributed all over the region has been carried out, by means of HPGe gamma-ray spectrometry system. The activity concentrations of the relevant radionuclides in the soil samples appeared in the ranges as follows: ²²⁶Ra was 20–521 Bq kg⁻¹; ²³²Th, 11–499 Bq kg⁻¹and; ⁴⁰K, 126–3181 Bq kg⁻¹, yet the ¹³⁷Cs was much lower than 20 Bq kg⁻¹at most. Furthermore, based on the available data, the radiation hazard parameters associated with the surveyed soils were calculated. The present data also allowed evaluation of some correlations that may exist in the investigated natural radionuclides of the soil samples from the plutonic area in Çanakkale province. It is concluded from the above that the concerned region did not lead to any significant radiological exposure to the environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental exposure 3aenvironmental monitoring 3agamma radiation 3aradionuclides 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3aspectroscopy 2aBackground Radiation 2aGamma Rays 2aRadiation Monitoring 2aRadioisotopesxanalysis 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 3aTurkey (country) 0aTurkey 0aKestanbol plutonic area 0asoils 0anatural radionuclides 0a137Cs 0aradiation hazard parameters 0aÇanakkale 0aTurkey1 aÇam, N.

This work aims to statistically validate the origin of diffuse contamination of Aquitaine agricultural soils and show that contamination is closely related to wine-growing in this region. For this purpose, several national databases have been used. From the French National Soil Monitoring Network (Réseau de Mesures de la Qualité des sols RMQS) data, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to bring out the copper contamination. The French test soil database (Base de Données des Analyses de Terre BDAT) and the national census of agriculture (Recensement Général Agricole RGA) have been crossed. A statistical approach has been used to determine the relationship between the median concentration of copper extracted by Ethylene Diamine Tetra-acetic Acid (EDTA) referred to as CuEDTA in cultivated topsoils of the Aquitaine region and the ratio between winegrowing area (Svine) and the Used Agricultural Area (UAA) expressed as the form Svine/UAA. The results revealed a strongly significant exponential correlation between these two variables. They allow concluding that at cantonal scale, when vines cover more than 80% of the UAA, an overexposure of soils to the diffuse contamination by copper can occur.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCensus of Agriculture 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3acopper 3adatabases 3adowny mildew 3aethylene 3apesticide application 3asoil analysis 3asoil pollution 3atopsoil 3avines 3aviticulture 3aFrance1 aChéry, Philippe1 aJalabert, Stéphanie1 aLee, Alexandre1 aPotin-Gautier, Martine1 aLespes, Gaëtane0 tScience of the total environment.g2012 Dec. 15, v. 441 p.239-247dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.09.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010200160300001800262520047000280592002800750650002300778650002300801650003400824650001500858650001300873650001900886650001500905700001500920700001500935700001700950700001600967700001700983700001801000700001401018773013301032856007401165852000901239655001201248IND60685468420221119144351.0200304e20200303xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068546842DNAL7 a10.1039/c9cc09426a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xin-Yuan10aCarrier dynamic monitoring of a π-conjugated polymer: a surface-enhanced Raman scattering method  ap. 2779-2782.  aHere, the carrier dynamics of a π-conjugated polymer is monitored by voltage-dependent surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).

A disintegrin and metalloprotease‐17 (ADAM17) is a key sheddase involved in essential processes, such as development, regeneration, and immune defense. ADAM17 exists in two conformations which differ in their disulfide connection in the membrane‐proximal domain (MPD). Protein‐disulfide isomerases (PDIs) on the cell surface convert the open MPD into a rigid closed form, which corresponds to inactive ADAM17. ADAM17 is expressed in its open activatable form in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and consequently must be protected against ER‐resident PDI activity. Here, we show that the chaperone 78‐kDa glucose‐regulated protein (GRP78) protects the MPD against PDI‐dependent disulfide‐bond isomerization by binding to this domain and, thereby, preventing ADAM17 inhibition.  aPublisher supplied data  aSFB 877 (A6)cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aSPP1710cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aLO 1722/1‐1cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  a2009/54067‐3cFAPESP  a2010/19278‐0cFAPESP  a2011/02267‐9cFAPESP  a305432/2014‐1cCNPq  a505413/2013‐2cCNPq  a470549/2011‐4cCNPq  a470268/2013‐1cCNPq 3adisulfides 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aimmune response 3aisomerization 3ametalloproteinases 3aprotein disulfide-isomerase1 aGranato, Daniela C.1 aKrossa, Sebastian1 aBartels, Anne‐Kathrin1 aYokoo, Sami1 aDüsterhöft, Stefan1 aKoudelka, Tomas1 aScheidig, Axel J.1 aTholey, Andreas1 aPaes Leme, Adriana F.1 aGrötzinger, Joachim1 aLorenzen, Inken0 tFEBS letters.g2017 Nov., v. 591, no. 21 p.3567-3587dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.128583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245011800160520161900278592002801897650001401925650000801939650002801947650001601975650001901991650000702010650002102017650001502038650000902053650001902062650001102081650001402092650001502106700001902121700002002140700002102160700002002181700001702201773012102218856007402339852000902413655001202422IND60794393320221119073814.0220922e20220908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079439332DNAL7 a10.3390/w141827922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Sun Young,10aCombined Effects of Substrate Depth and Vegetation of Green Roofs on Runoff and Phytoremediation under Heavy Rain  aThe quantity and quality of runoff from green roofs have so far been studied using an extensive vegetated roof (substrate depth > 150 mm). However, studies on various substrate depths and vegetation for runoff and phytoremediation in temperate and monsoon climates, where heavy rain is concentrated in a specific season, are limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate combined effects of substrate depth and vegetation of an unfertilized green roof on runoff reduction and airborne pollutant purification based on rainfall intensity. A total of 21 plots were implemented on a roof top with three substrate depths (100, 200, and 400 mm), two vegetation s (vegetated or non-vegetated), and control (plot with standard frame only). The runoff reduction increased significantly (p < 0.05) with increasing substrate depth. Vegetated plots had a slightly higher runoff reduction than plots without vegetation. Compared to controls, turbidity and pH tended to increase regardless of vegetation or substrate depth, with the exception of electrical conductivity (EC). However, concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Mn, and Cd) in the runoff of vegetated plots were all significantly (p < 0.05) lower than those of un-vegetated plots and controls. These results suggest that as the rainfall intensity increases, the depth of the substrate is more important than vegetation for runoff reduction. In addition, the vegetation can be an effective tool to neutralize acid rain to stabilize pH and effectively reduce EC and heavy metals in the runoff by remediating dissolved air pollutants from rainwater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid rain 3aair 3aelectrical conductivity 3agreen roofs 3amonsoon season 3apH 3aphytoremediation 3apollutants 3arain 3arain intensity 3arunoff 3aturbidity 3avegetation1 aOh, Deuk-Kyun 1 aLee, Sun-Yeong 1 aYeum, Kyung-Jin 1 aYoon, Yong-Han 1 aJu, Jin-Hee 0 tWater.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141827923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245007100202300001800273500001100291520097100302592002801273596004901301596005901350596003601409596003701445596008401482596003001566596003001596596004201626596004801668650002301716650002001739650002401759650001101783650001101794650001401805650001401819650001401833650002001847700005901867700002501926700007401951700005902025700002002084700005702104700006102161773011902222856007402341852000902415655001202424IND60778658420221120042509.0220530e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077865842DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.139542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRégimbeau, Antoine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0456-671710aContribution of genome‐scale metabolic modelling to niche theory  ap. 1352-1364.  aLETTER  aStandard niche modelling is based on probabilistic inference from organismal occurrence data but does not benefit yet from genome‐scale descriptions of these organisms. This study overcomes this shortcoming by proposing a new conceptual niche that resumes the whole metabolic capabilities of an organism. The so‐called metabolic niche resumes well‐known traits such as nutrient needs and their dependencies for survival. Despite the computational challenge, its implementation allows the detection of traits and the formal comparison of niches of different organisms, emphasising that the presence–absence of functional genes is not enough to approximate the phenotype. Further statistical exploration of an organism's niche sheds light on genes essential for the metabolic niche and their role in understanding various biological experiments, such as transcriptomics, paving the way for incorporating better genome‐scale description in ecological studies.  aPublisher supplied data  cFonds Français pour l'Environnement Mondial  a80 PRIMEcCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique  aANR‐10‐LABX‐54cMEMO LIFE  aANR‐19‐CE20‐0020cBrownCut  aANR‐11‐IDEX‐0001‐02cUniversité de Recherche Paris Sciences et Lettres  a835067cH2020 Environment  a862923cH2020 Environment  aANR‐10‐INBS‐09‐08cOCEANOMICS  aANR‐10‐INBS‐09‐08cFRANCE GENOMIQUE 3aecological studies 3aessential genes 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3aniches 3anutrients 3aorganisms 3aphenotype 3atranscriptomics1 aBudinich, Marko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3541-05471 aLarhlimi, Abdelhalim1 aPierella Karlusich, Juan José1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1739-44241 aAumont, Olivier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3954-506X1 aMemery, Laurent1 aBowler, Chris1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3835-61871 aEveillard, Damien1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8162-73600 tEcology letters.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.1352-1364dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.139543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245012100160300001600281520208700297592002802384650000902412650001502421650002402436650001202460650001002472650001002482650001202492650002002504650001102524650001102535653001402546653002702560653001202587653001302599653001602612700001502628700001402643700001502657700002702672700001702699700001702716773015102733856007802884852000902962655001202971IND60539544520221118082151.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053954452DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-85352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCockburn, M.10aImproving ergonomics in milking parlors: Empirical findings for optimal working heights in five milking parlor types  ap. 966-974.  aMilking postures have shifted from seated milking in tethered stalls to milking in a standing position in parlors. However, the musculoskeletal workload of dairy farmers remains high. Previous studies have shown that different working heights affect ergonomics, but they could not objectively evaluate and quantify the workload. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of working height in different milking parlor types on the milker’s workload during the task of attaching milking clusters. Computer-assisted recording and long-term analysis of movements were used to record positions of joints and body regions while performing certain tasks in terms of angular degrees of joints (ADJ) according to the neutral zero method. The 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles described the distribution of angular degree values measured for each joint. The ADJ were evaluated according to international standards and other scientific literature on the issue to assess the muscular load. The workload was compared between 5 parlor types (auto tandem, herringbone 30°, herringbone 50°, parallel, and rotary) on 15 farms with 2 subjects per parlor and 1 milking period per subject. The working height was defined as a coefficient based on the milker’s body height, the floor level, and the cow’s udder height. The data recorded during the attachment task were analyzed using generalized linear mixed-effects models taking into account the hierarchical experimental design. The results indicated that the interaction of the cow’s udder height, the milker’s body height, and the parlor type had a larger effect on ergonomics than each parameter had independently. The interaction was significant in at least 1 of the 3 percentiles in 28 out of 31 ADJ. The postural differences between parlor types, however, were minor. A milking health formula was created to calculate the ideal depth of pit by considering the parlor type, the milker’s height, and the mean herd udder height. This formula can be used to develop individual recommendations for future parlor construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3acows 3aergonomics 3aexperimental design 3afarmers 3afarms 3aherds 3amilking 3amilking parlors 3amodels 3audders 0aguideline 0amilking health formula 0aposture 0aworkload 0aherringbone1 aSavary, P.1 aKauke, M.1 aSchick, M.1 aHoehne-Hückstädt, U.1 aHermanns, I.1 aEllegast, R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.966-974dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-85353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01684naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245012200177300001600299520053700315592002800852650001200880650003800892650001300930650001200943650001900955650001100974650001200985650001900997650001601016650002001032650001601052650002401068650001201092700002101104773010701125856005701232852000901289655001201298IND4468826820221122031241.0120907e199103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446882682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb05325.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCHANG, SHUH‐MING10aRetrogradation of Rice Starches Studied by Differential Scanning Calorimetry and Influence of Sugars, NaCl and Lipids  ap. 564-566.  aIn waxy and nonwaxy rice starch gels the retrogradation process was a function of time.

Effects of maltose, glucose and lipids were dependent on rice starch gel and storage temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenthalpy 3aglucose 3aglutinous rice 3alipids 3amaltose 3aretrogradation 3arice starch 3asodium chloride 3astarch gels 3astorage temperature 3asucrose1 aLIU, LIH‐CHING0 tJournal of food science.g1991 Mar., v. 56, no. 2 p.564-566dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb05325.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245012600186300001800312520152500330536027401855592002802129596001602157596004302173596008002216650001502296650001902311650002202330650001402352650001902366650000902385650002502394650001902419650001402438650000702452650001902459650002002478650002102498650002502519653001502544653001702559653001402576653001302590653001502603700002802618700003302646700002402679773012102703856008502824852000902909655001202918IND60648143920221118020420.0190626e20190811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064814392DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.14428802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVillanueva-Rodríguez, Minerva10aDegradation of anti-inflammatory drugs in municipal wastewater by heterogeneous photocatalysis and electro-Fenton process  ap. 2436-2445.  aNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are compounds frequently found in municipal wastewater and their degradation by conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) is generally incomplete. This study compared the efficiency of two advanced oxidation processes (AOP), namely heterogeneous photocatalysis (HP) and electro-Fenton (EF), in the degradation of a mixture of common NSAID (diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen) dissolved in either deionized water or effluent from a WWTP. Both processes were effective in degrading the NSAID mixture and the trend of degradation was as follows, diclofenac > naproxen > ibuprofen. EF with a current density of 40 mA cm⁻² and 0.3 mmol Fe²⁺ L⁻¹ was the most efficient process to mineralize the organic compounds, achieving up to 92% TOC removal in deionized water and 90% in the WWTP effluent after 3 h of reaction. HP with 1.4 g TiO₂ L⁻¹ at pH 7 under sunlight, produced 85% TOC removal in deionized water and 39% in WWTP effluent also after 3 h treatment. The lower TOC removal efficiency shown by HP with the WWTP effluent was attributed mainly to the scavenging of reactive species by background organic matter in the wastewater. On the contrary, inorganic ions in the wastewater may produce oxidazing species during the EF process, which contributes to a higher degradation efficiency. EF is a promising option for the treatment of anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals in municipal WWTP at competitive electrical energy efficiencies.  aA postdoctoral fellowship granted by El Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR) to M.V.R. and financial support from Programa de Apoyo a la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (PAICYT-[IT 476-15]UANL) are gratefully acknowledged.  aPublisher supplied data  cPAICYT-UANL  cEl Colegio de la Frontera Sur (ECOSUR)  cUniversidad Autónoma de Nuevo Leóndhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004685 3adiclofenac 3aelectric power 3aenergy efficiency 3aibuprofen 3ainorganic ions 3airon 3amunicipal wastewater 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3asolar radiation 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment 0aDiclofenac 0adrug mixture 0aibuprofen 0anaproxen 0awastewater1 aBello Mendoza, Ricardo,1 aHernández-Ramírez, Aracely1 aRuiz-Ruiz, Edgar J.0 tEnvironmental technology.g2019 Aug. 11, v. 40, no. 18 p.2436-2445dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.14428803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03713naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010900161300001600270520218800286592002802474650001302502650002102515650002802536650001502564650001002579650001902589650001902608650001102627650000902638650001102647650003302658650002402691650001202715650002902727650001402756650001002770650002002780650001102800653001802811653001402829653001202843653001102855700002202866700001702888700002102905700001902926773015102945856007803096852000903174655001203183IND60539544620221118082135.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053954462DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-85642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDance, Alysha10aEnhanced early-life nutrition promotes hormone production and reproductive development in Holstein bulls  ap. 987-998.  aHolstein bull calves often reach artificial insemination centers in suboptimal body condition. Early-life nutrition is reported to increase reproductive performance in beef bulls. The objective was to determine whether early-life nutrition in Holstein bulls had effects similar to those reported in beef bulls. Twenty-six Holstein bull calves were randomly allocated into 3 groups at approximately 1 wk of age to receive a low-, medium-, or high-nutrition diet, based on levels of energy and protein, from 2 to 31 wk of age. Calves were on their respective diets until 31 wk of age, after which they were all fed a medium-nutrition diet. To evaluate secretion profiles and concentrations of blood hormones, a subset of bulls was subjected to intensive blood sampling every 4 wk from 11 to 31 wk of age. Testes of all bulls were measured once a month; once scrotal circumference reached 26cm, semen collection was attempted (by electroejaculation) every 2 wk to confirm puberty. Bulls were maintained until approximately 72 wk of age and then slaughtered at a local abattoir. Testes were recovered and weighed. Bulls fed the high-nutrition diet were younger at puberty (high=324.3 d, low=369.3 d) and had larger testes for the entire experimental period than bulls fed the low-nutrition diet. Bulls fed the high-nutrition diet also had an earlier and more substantial early rise in LH than those fed the low-nutrition diet and had increased concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) earlier than the bulls fed the low-nutrition diet. Furthermore, we detected a temporal association between increased IGF-I concentrations and an early LH rise in bulls fed the high-nutrition diet. Therefore, we inferred that IGF-I had a role in regulating the early gonadotropin rise (in particular, LH) and thus reproductive development of Holstein bulls. Overall, these results support our hypothesis that Holstein bull calves fed a high-nutrition diet reach puberty earlier and have larger testes than those fed a low-nutrition diet, and they provide clear evidence that nutritional modulation of Holstein bull calves during early life has profound effects on reproductive development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aage at slaughter 3aartificial insemination 3abeef bulls 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3abody condition 3acalves 3adiet 3aenergy 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aluteinizing hormone 3apuberty 3areproductive performance 3asecretion 3asemen 3aslaughterhouses 3atestes 0aHolstein bull 0anutrition 0apuberty 0atestes1 aThundathil, Jacob1 aWilde, Randy1 aBlondin, Patrick1 aKastelic, John0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.987-998dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-85643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009200168300001400260520139100274592002801665650002101693650001501714650001101729650001701740650002401757650001501781650002601796650001101822650002201833650001501855650001001870650002201880650001601902651002501918700002301943700002301966773010501989856008102094852000902175655001202184IND60555889020221119112406.0161030e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055588902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-015-2635-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCogoni, Annalena10aSmall-scale pattern of bryoflora in Mediterranean temporary ponds: hints for monitoring  ap. 81-95.  aIn the Mediterranean region temporary ponds are classified among the most biologically and biogeographically interesting ecosystems. Despite their important ecological functions in those environments, bryophytes are neglected or undervalued in most monitoring and conservation actions. We analyzed the data to understand if (i) environmental variables had an influence on the composition of bryophytes in temporary ponds (dbRDA); (ii) there are differences among sites and ponds, in terms of species composition (PERMANOVA); (iii) bryophytes respond to the water table fluctuation, showing a typical small-scale spatial zonation and comprehend if there are species or life form/strategies typical of those belts (PCoA). Bryophytes are distributed in concentric belts (outer, central, inner) according to their tolerance to floods: we observed a gradient from the outer belt, mainly composed by colonist and perennial such as Pottiaceae and Brachytheciaceae, to the more humid inner one where annual shuttle such as Ricciaceae dominates. We found significant species associated with belts, such as Tortella squarrosa in the outer belt, Fossombronia caespitiformis in the central belt, and Riccia canaliculata in the inner belt. The presence of indicator species and the distribution of dominant life form/strategies in the belts allow to monitor over time the changes in the flood level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrachytheciaceae 3aPottiaceae 3aRiccia 3abiogeography 3aecological function 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afloods 3aindicator species 3amonitoring 3aponds 3aspecies diversity 3awater table 3aMediterranean region1 aFilippino, Giorgia1 aMarignani, Michela0 tHydrobiologia.g2016 Nov., v. 782, no. 1 p.81-95dSpringer International Publishingx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-015-2635-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100006200187245011300249300001400362506007600376520144200452592002801894506003701922650001601959650001101975650001901986650001502005650001702020650001502037650001102052650000902063650002602072650002202098650002702120650000702147650001902154650001302173650001302186650002302199653001802222653001702240653001502257653001402272653001202286653000802298653000802306653000802314653001002322700001402332700002302346700001902369773010602388856008002494852000902574655001202583IND60589415420221207142210.0180222e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058941542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.11.0172doi7 aPMC58267922pmcid7 a291751382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWisnewski, Adam V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2461-940910aPolymerization of hexamethylene diisocyanate in solution and a 260.23 m/z [M+H]+ ion in exposed human cells  ap. 21-29.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) is an important industrial chemical that can cause asthma, however pathogenic mechanisms remain unclear. Upon entry into the respiratory tract, HDI's N=C=O groups may undergo nucleophilic addition (conjugate) to host molecules (e.g. proteins), or instead react with water (hydrolyze), releasing CO2 and leaving a primary amine in place of the original N=C=O. We hypothesized that (primary amine groups present on) hydrolyzed or partially hydrolyzed HDI may compete with proteins and water as a reaction target for HDI in solution, resulting in polymers that could be identified and characterized using LC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Analysis of the reaction products formed when HDI was mixed with a pH buffered, isotonic, protein containing solution identified multiple [M+H]⁺ ions with m/z's and collision-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation patterns consistent with those expected for dimers (259.25/285.23 m/z), and trimers (401.36/427.35 m/z) of partially hydrolyzed HDI (e.g. ureas/oligoureas). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and monocyte-like U937, but not airway epithelial NCI-H292 cell lines cultured with these HDI ureas contained a novel 260.23 m/z [M+H]⁺ ion. LC-MS/MS analysis of the 260.23 m/z [M+H]⁺ ion suggest the formula C13H29N3O2 and a structure containing partially hydrolyzed HDI, however definitive characterization will require further orthogonal analyses.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLewis bases 3aasthma 3acarbon dioxide 3acell lines 3adissociation 3aepithelium 3ahumans 3aions 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amononuclear leukocytes 3apH 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aproteins 3arespiratory system 0aHexamethylene 0aDiisocyanate 0aPolymerize 0aHydrolyze 0aDiamine 0aBPC 0aCID 0aHDI 0aPBMCs1 aLiu, Jian1 aRedlich, Carrie A.1 aNassar, Ala F.0 tAnalytical biochemistry.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 543 p.21-29dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11652x0003-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ab.2017.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245007300206300001800279500001100297520111100308592002801419596001401447596004001461596006901501596006901570596004101639596004101680596004101721596004101762596004101803596004101844650001101885650001701896650001901913650001701932650001901949650002501968650002401993650001802017650001202035650001402047650000902061650002002070650001902090650001402109700006502123700006002188700006102248700006102309700006302370700006202433700005902495700006102554773011902615856007402734852000902808655001202817IND60778658620221120042537.0220530e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077865862DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.140182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderegg, William R.

Many climate change mitigation strategies leverage forest preservation and expansion, but rely on forests storing carbon for decades to centuries. Yet climate‐driven disturbances pose critical risks to the long‐term stability of forest carbon. We quantify the climate drivers that influence wildfire and climate stress‐driven tree mortality, including a separate insect‐driven tree mortality, for the contiguous United States for current (1984–2018) and project these future disturbance risks over the 21st century. We find that current risks are widespread and projected to increase across different emissions scenarios by a factor of >4 for fire and >1.3 for climate‐stress mortality. These forest disturbance risks highlight pervasive climate‐sensitive disturbance impacts on US forests and raise questions about the risk management approach taken by forest carbon offset policies. Our results provide US‐wide risk maps of key climate‐sensitive disturbances for improving carbon cycle modeling, conservation and climate policy.  aPublisher supplied data  cMicrosoft  cDavid and Lucile Packard Foundation  a2018‐67012‐31496cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  a2018‐67019‐27850cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture  a1714972cNational Science Foundation  a1802880cNational Science Foundation  a2003017cNational Science Foundation  a2003205cNational Science Foundation  a2017494cNational Science Foundation  a2044937cNational Science Foundation 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon markets 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental policy 3aforest conservation 3aforest damage 3aforests 3amortality 3arisk 3arisk management 3atree mortality 3awildfires1 aChegwidden, Oriana S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1376-38351 aBadgley, Grayson1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1011-45731 aTrugman, Anna T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7903-97111 aCullenward, Danny1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6803-95721 aAbatzoglou, John T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7599-97501 aHicke, Jeffrey A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0494-28661 aFreeman, Jeremy1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7077-79721 aHamman, Joseph J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7479-84390 tEcology letters.g2022 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.1510-1520dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.140183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006000145245008900205300001800294500002000312520120300332592002801535596005901563596005801622596006801680596011701748596012601865596005901991596005902050596005702109596006402166596006502230650001302295650002202308650001702330650001902347650001702366650001402383650000902397650001602406650001602422700001602438700001702454700001602471700001302487700001302500700001802513700001102531773012602542856008002668852000902748655001202757IND60753294820221121231702.0211012e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075329482DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.158882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuan, Guangxiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3046-122210aStabilization of Lycium ruthenicum Murr. anthocyanins by natural polyphenol extracts  ap. 4365-4375.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAnthocyanins are a group of flavonoids widely used as natural pigments and in functional foods. However, the sensitivity of anthocyanins to environment factors limits their utilization. The present study examined the stabilizing effects of polyphenol extracts from raspberry, sea‐buckthorn, Lonicera edulis, and blackcurrant on Lycium ruthenicum Murr (LRM)‐derived anthocyanins. After light and heat exposure, contents of total anthocyanins and the monomers were detected with the pH differential method and the HPLC. Remarkably, polyphenol extracts from raspberry, Lonicera edulis and blackcurrant extended the half‐lives of anthocyanins, while the effect of the sea‐buckthorn extracts was negligible. Noticeably, petunidin‐3‐O‐[6‐O‐(4‐O‐trans‐p‐coumaroyl‐alpha‐L‐rhamnopyranosyl)‐beta‐D‐glucopyranoside]‐5‐O‐[beta‐D‐glucopyranoside], the major component of LRM‐derived anthocyanins, exhibited a dramatic increase in half‐life with the presence of polyphenol extracts from raspberry, Lonicera edulis, and blackcurrant. In summary, our findings suggest the polyphenol extracts could be developed into copigments for stabilization of anthocyanins.  aPublisher supplied data  a2020‐ZJ‐905cQinghai Provincial Science Foundation  a2020‐SF‐A2cQinghai Provincial Science Foundation  cQinghai Province High‐end Innovative Thousand Talents Program  a2021‐ZJ‐T05cInnovation Platform for the Development and Construction of Special Project of Qinghai Province  a2020‐0407‐NCC‐0001cInnovation Platform for the Development and Construction of Special Project of Qinghai Province  a31800297cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31870333cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2020426cYouth Innovation Promotion Association, CAS  aLQ21C020002cZhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation  aLGC20B020001cZhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation 3aLonicera 3aLycium ruthenicum 3aanthocyanins 3ablack currants 3afood science 3ahalf life 3aheat 3apolyphenols 3araspberries1 aWang, Yuwei1 aOuyang, Jian1 aHe, Yanfeng1 aZhou, Wu1 aDong, Qi1 aWang, Honglun1 aHu, Na0 tJournal of food science.g2021 Oct., v. 86, no. 10 p.4365-4375dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.158883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01743naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245007600211300001400287520062300301592002800924650002300952650001700975650002200992650001901014650001401033650001301047650001201060653000901072653001501081653002101096653001501117653001101132700003101143773010601174856008001280852000901360655001201369IND60589415520221118090233.0180222e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058941552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozano-Gerona, Javier1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4867-251110aImageJ-based semiautomatic method to analyze senescence in cell culture  ap. 30-32.  aβ-Galactosidase accumulates in the lysosomes of senescent cells of certain tissues.

Two anaerobic inocula were used: a mixture of flocculant biomass (I) from a full-scale anaerobic reactor treating waste activated sludge and a granular inoculum (II) from an industrial UASB reactor treating brewery wastewater. Soluble COD (CODs) removal efficiencies ranged between 67.7% and 70.1% and between 61.3% and 67.7% at hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of between 24–10 days for inoculum I and 24–8 days for inoculum II. However, for HRTs lower than 8 days and 6.7 days, equivalent to organic loading rates (OLRs) higher than 2.62 and 3.15 g COD/(L·d), respectively, a sudden decrease in the CODs removal efficiency was observed in both cases. In any case, inoculum II allowed for a more stable and efficient operation for a wider range of both OLRs and HRTs, permitting an appropriate and reliable operation for OLRs as high as 3.15 g COD/(L·d) and HRTs as low as 6.7 days. The methane production rates achieved with inoculum II were always higher than those reached with inoculum I. The overall methane yield obtained with inoculum II was 13% higher than that achieved with inoculum I. In addition, this value was 1.9 times higher than the methane yield obtained with untreated (non-sonicated) SuOC. A second-order kinetic model was found to be adequate to fit the experimental results obtained for the two inocula used. The kinetic constant obtained with inoculum I was 3.5 times higher than that achieved with inoculum II.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3ainoculum 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 3aspecific energy 3asunflower cake 3atemperature 3aultrasonics 3aupflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 3awastewater 2aAnaerobiosis 2aBeer 2aBioreactors 2aKinetics 2aMethanexanalysis 2aPlant Oils 2aSewage 2aSonication 2aWaste Managementxmethods 2aWaste Products 0aAnaerobic digestion 0asemi-continuous mode 0aultrasound 0amethane production rate 0amethane yield 0akinetics1 aRaposo, Francisco1 aBorja, Rafael0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 48, no. 12 p.1548-1556dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.797275  aDNAL 7aarticle02353naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007900169300001800248520095100266536011701217592002801334596006901362650001601431650001801447650001801465650002001483650001801503650002801521650002101549650001501570653001301585653002201598653001901620653001301639653001601652700002301668700002501691773012101716856008501837852000901922655001201931IND60648144120221118020517.0190626e20190811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064814412DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.14452992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaolin10aOrthophosphate modulates the phytotoxicity of nano-ZnO to Lemna minor (L.)  ap. 2446-2454.  aBecause of their applications in large numbers of products, Zinc Oxide nanoparticles (nano-ZnO) will inevitably enter into the environment. Nano-ZnO released into the environment will be present in a complex matrix which can cause various chemical and physical transformations and modulate the biological reactivity of these particles. Due to their rapid growth and small size, Lemna minor is recommended by OECD for toxicological testing. Here, we tested how nano-ZnO reactivity is modulated by the suite of macro- and micronutrients that are present in Lemna minor growth media. Specifically, we measured ex situ Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formation by nano-ZnO, and subsequent in planta toxicity. The data show how orthophosphate can modulate both ex situ ROS formation, and in planta toxicity. This has ramifications for phytotoxicity testing, which is commonly performed under controlled conditions and on media containing orthophosphate.  aX.C. gratefully acknowledges support by CSC (China Scholarship Council).

HPLC analyses revealed the formation of two novel dihydrobenzothiazine carboxylic acid derivatives (8-(3’,4’-dihydro-2H-chromene-3’,5’,7’-triol)-3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2H-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid and 7-(3’,4’-dihydro-2H-chromene-3’,5’,7’-triol)-3,4-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2H-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid) from 2′-cysteinyl catechin and 5′-cysteinyl catechin in cysteine incubations, respectively. In contrast, arginine and lysine did not lead to any amino acid adducts. Target compounds were separated by high-performance countercurrent chromatography and preparative HPLC and unequivocally characterized by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mechanistic incubations starting from the catechin–cysteine adducts showed that both catechin and PPO are crucial components in the formation of the dihydrobenzothiazines. The cysteine incubations showed a red-brown coloration, which coincided with formation and degradation of the dihydrobenzothiazines finally leading to the formation of high-polymeric melanins. Therefore, these compounds might be the key intermediates to understand development of color during cysteine-driven enzymatic browning reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aarginine 3acarboxylic acids 3acatechin 3acatechol oxidase 3acolor 3acountercurrent chromatography 3acysteine 3aenzymatic browning 3agallic acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3alysine 3amass spectrometry 3amelanin 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3apears 3apolyphenols 0aenzymatic browning 0apolyphenol−amino acid adducts 0ahigh-performance countercurrent chromatography 0acolor-dilution analysis 0adihydrobenzothiazine1 aMai, Franziska1 aGlomb, Marcus A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8826-08080 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Jan. 31, v. 67, no. 6 p.1719-1725dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.8b064583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245012200207300001800329500001100347520101800358592002801376596004401404596004401448650002801492650001501520650001901535650001601554650002101570650001401591650001101605650002701616650001501643700001801658700001601676700001401692700002201706700001701728700002601745773011601771856008001887852000901967655001201976IND60786823820221120221854.0220806e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078682382DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.128602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelkani, Girish C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0353-463310aTRiC/CCT chaperonins are essential for maintaining myofibril organization, cardiac physiological rhythm, and lifespan  ap. 3447-3458.  aLETTER  aWe recently reported that CCT chaperonin subunits are upregulated in a cardiac‐specific manner under time‐restricted feeding (TRF) [Gill S et al. (2015) Science 347, 1265–1269], suggesting that TRiC/CCT has a heart‐specific function. To understand the CCT chaperonin function in cardiomyocytes, we performed its cardiac‐specific knock‐down in the Drosophila melanogaster model. This resulted in disorganization of cardiac actin‐ and myosin‐containing myofibrils and severe physiological dysfunction, including restricted heart diameters, elevated cardiac dysrhythmia and compromised cardiac performance. We also noted that cardiac‐specific knock‐down of CCT chaperonin significantly shortens lifespans. Additionally, disruption of circadian rhythm yields further deterioration of cardiac function of hypomorphic CCT mutants. Our analysis reveals that both the orchestration of protein folding and circadian rhythms mediated by CCT chaperonin are critical for maintaining heart contractility.  aPublisher supplied data  aAG049494cNational Institutes of Health  aAR055958cNational Institutes of Health 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aarrhythmia 3acardiac output 3achaperonins 3acircadian rhythm 3alongevity 3amodels 3amyocardial contraction 3amyofibrils1 aBhide, Shruti1 aHan, Andrew1 aVyas, Jay1 aLivelo, Catherine1 aBodmer, Rolf1 aBernstein, Sanford I.0 tFEBS letters.g2017 Nov., v. 591, no. 21 p.3447-3458dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.128603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02493naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245004800160520144700208592002801655650002201683650001201705650001601717650001701733650000901750650002201759650001301781650001101794650000701805650001801812650001601830650001501846700002601861700002801887773012101915856007402036852000902110655001202119IND60794393720221119073739.0220922e20220908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079439372DNAL7 a10.3390/w141827962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Katie M.10aReactivity of Nitrate with Zero-Valent Iron  aElevated nitrate concentrations in groundwater and surface water supplies can negatively impact the quality of the environment and human health. Recent studies have examined the use of zero-valent iron technology to treat nitrate-contaminated groundwater. Mechanistic aspects of nitrate reduction by zero-valent iron are unresolved. This project investigated the kinetics and mechanism of nitrate reduction by zero-valent iron under anoxic conditions and under oxic conditions. Stirred-batch reactions were studied over environmentally relevant ranges of reactant concentration, pH, and temperature. A complex rate expression was derived with a 1.8 order dependence on nitrate, a 1.4 order dependence on zero-valent iron, and a fractional order (0.8) dependence on proton concentrations under anoxic conditions. An apparent activation energy of 35 kJ mol⁻¹ was observed indicating that nitrate reduction was diffusion controlled under our conditions. Furthermore, the calculated entropy of activation value of −162 J mol⁻¹K⁻¹ indicates that this reaction occurred by an associative mechanism. Under oxic conditions, there was a lag period in nitrate reduction where oxygen was preferentially utilized, leading to a slower rate of nitrate reduction when compared with anoxic conditions. These rate data can be used in predicting nitrate disappearance in nitrate-contaminated groundwater and wastewater treated with zero-valent iron.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aentropy 3agroundwater 3ahuman health 3airon 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3apH 3asurface water 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aKarathanasis, Tasios 1 aMatocha, Christopher J.0 tWater.g2022 Sept. 08, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141827963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04388naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001300143245014000156300001800296520244700314592002802761650002602789650002202815650001302837650001002850650001802860650001202878650000902890650001502899650002702914650002002941650001902961650002702980650002103007650002003028650001003048650001203058650001603070650001203086650003303098650001003131650001803141650002003159650002503179650001003204650002003214650002103234650000903255653002303264653001903287653002003306653001003326653002203336700001603358700002203374700002003396700002103416700001303437700002403450773015303474856007803627852000903705655001203714IND60539544820221118082138.0190318e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053954482DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2014-86122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, J.10aEffects of dry period length and dietary energy source on metabolic status and hepatic gene expression of dairy cows in early lactation  ap. 1033-1045.  aIn a prior study, we observed that cows with a 0-d dry period had greater energy balance and lower milk production compared with cows with a 30- or 60-d dry period in early lactation. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the influence of dry period length on metabolic status and hepatic gene expression in cows fed a lipogenic or glucogenic diet in early lactation. Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (n=167) were assigned randomly to 3×2 factorial design with 3 dry period lengths (n=56, 55, and 56 for 0-, 30-, and 60-d dry, respectively) and 2 early lactation diets (n=84 and 83 for glucogenic and lipogenic diet, respectively). Cows were fed a glucogenic or lipogenic diet from 10d before the expected calving date and onward. The main ingredient for a glucogenic concentrate was corn, and the main ingredients for a lipogenic concentrate were sugar beet pulp, palm kernel, and rumen-protected palm oil. Blood was sampled weekly from 95 cows from wk 3 precalving to wk 8 postcalving. Liver samples were collected from 76 cows in wk −2, 2, and 4 relative to calving. Liver samples were analyzed for triacylglycerol concentrations and mRNA expression of 12 candidate genes. Precalving, cows with a 0-d dry period had greater plasma β-hydroxybutyrate, urea, and insulin concentrations compared with cows with a 30- or 60-d dry period. Postcalving, cows with a 0-d dry period had lower liver triacylglycerol and plasma nonesterified fatty acids concentrations (0.20, 0.32, and 0.36mmol/L for 0-, 30-, and 60-d dry period, respectively), greater plasma glucose, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin (24.38, 14.02, and 11.08µIU/mL for 0-, 30-, and 60-d dry period, respectively) concentrations, and lower hepatic mRNA expression of pyruvate carboxylase, compared with cows with a 30- or 60-d dry period. Plasma urea and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations were greater in cows fed a lipogenic diet compared with cows fed a glucogenic diet. In conclusion, cows with a 0-d dry period had an improved metabolic status in early lactation, indicated by lower plasma concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids, greater plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin, and lower mRNA expression of pyruvate carboxylase in the liver, compared with cows with a 30- or 60-d dry period. Independent of dry period length, the glucogenic diet also improved the metabolic status compared with the lipogenic diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3aElaeis guineensis 3aHolstein 3ablood 3ablood glucose 3acalving 3acorn 3adairy cows 3adietary energy sources 3aearly lactation 3aenergy balance 3afatty acid composition 3afree fatty acids 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3aingredients 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3amilk production 3apyruvate carboxylase 3aseeds 3asugar beet pulp 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea 0acontinuous milking 0alipogenic diet 0aglucogenic diet 0aliver 0aenergy metabolism1 aGross, J.J.1 avan Dorland, H.A.1 aRemmelink, G.J.1 aBruckmaier, R.M.1 aKemp, B.1 avan Knegsel, A.T.M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2015 Feb., v. 98, no. 2 p.1033-1045dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2014-86123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245010700165300001300272520068000285592002800965650000900993650002201002650002601024650002401050650001901074650001501093650001201108650002001120653001501140653002401155653002101179653002201200653001501222653002001237700002001257773010501277856008001382852000901462655001201471IND60589415720221118090228.0180222e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058941572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ab.2017.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Sandra10aProteomic profiling of large myofibrillar proteins from dried and long-term stored polyacrylamide gels  ap. 8-11.  aA method for the utilization of dried polyacrylamide gels from the pre-proteomic era is described in order to enable the mass spectrometric analysis of long-term stored protein preparations.

Sulfate, which is a major source of sulfur, plays an important role in synthesizing sulfur‐containing amino acids, such as cysteine and methionine, organic compounds essential to all living organisms. Some investigations reported that the assimilatory sulfate reduction pathway (ASRP) involved in cysteine synthesis is crucial to entering bacterial dormancy in pathogens. Our previous investigation reported that the halophilic marine bacterium, Microbulbifer aggregans CCB‐MM1ᵀ, possesses an ASRP and the dissimilatory sulfate reduction pathway (DSRP). The bacterium might use DSRP to generate energy required for entering its dormant. However, the role of the ASRP in the dormancy of M. aggregans CCB‐MM1ᵀ was so far unknown. In this study, we found that genes involved in ASRP were downregulated in the dormancy. The disruption of the gene encoding an assimilatory sulfite reductase, cysI, suppressed a completely dormant state under low nutrient conditions. In addition, the cysI mutant showed cell aggregation at the middle‐exponential phase under high nutrient conditions, indicating that the mutation might be stimulated to enter the dormancy. The wild‐type phenotype of the bacterium was recovered by the addition of cysteine. These results suggested that cysteine concentration may play an important role in inducing the dormancy of M. aggregans.  aPublisher supplied data  aShort term grant (304/PCCB6315220)cUniversiti Sains Malaysia 3aMicrobulbifer 3aaquatic bacteria 3acysteine 3adormancy 3aenergy 3agenes 3amethionine 3amutants 3amutation 3aoxidoreductases 3aphenotype 3asulfates 3asulfites 3asulfur1 aFurusawa, Go1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8516-00510 tJournal of basic microbiology.g2021 Dec., v. 61, no. 12 p.1124-1132dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39022x0233-111X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.2021001983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010700160300001600267520115300283592002801436650001201464650001101476650001401487650001301501650002701514650003001541650002301571650001501594700001801609700001901627773008301646856007301729852000901802655001201811IND50071897620221122040730.0150206e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007189762DNAL7 a10.1111/pbr.121242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarić, Slađana10aAllelic polymorphism and inheritance of MdACS1 and MdACO1 genes in apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.)  ap. 108-114.  aThe allelic polymorphism and inheritance of MdACS1 and MdACO1 genes were analysed in 28 apple cultivars, which were derived from reciprocal crosses of the following parental pairs: ‘Golden Delicious’ × ‘James Grieve’, ‘Golden Delicious’ × ‘Jonathan’, ‘Cox's Orange Pippin’ × ‘Golden Delicious’, ‘Cox's Orange Pippin’ × ‘Jonathan’. Polymorphisms were detected by PCR and the use of two restriction enzymes (BamH1 and RsaI). In addition, new primers were designed for the further discrimination of MdACO1 alleles. Two alleles of MdACS1 gene (MdACS1‐1 and MdACS1‐2) and three alleles of MdACO1 gene (a, b and c) were detected. Cloning and sequencing of MdACO1 alleles confirmed a high conservation and some differences within the coding regions and helped to reconcile between different numbering systems. Observed segregations confirmed that alleles a, b and c belonged to the MdACO1 gene. It is apparent that polymorphisms within the MdACS1 and MdACO1 genes could aid cultivar genotyping and identification and, furthermore, that the MdACS1‐2/2 genotype is correlated with a long apple storage life.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aapples 3acultivars 3agenotype 3ainheritance (genetics) 3apolymerase chain reaction 3areciprocal crosses 3ashelf life1 aLukić, Milan1 aFlachowsky, H.0 tPlant breeding.g2014 Feb., v. 133, no. 1 p.108-114dP.

This tree is susceptible to various pathogens. Among them, a fungus was consistently isolated from gray leaf spot symptom in coconut. This study aimed to isolate, characterize, and find the management strategies of the causal fungus of gray leaf spot disease in coconut. Both morphological and molecular characters identified the pathogen as Pestalotiopsis sp. for the first time in Bangladesh. Artificial inoculation of this fungus showed symptoms similar to those previously observed in the field. Cross‐inoculation test suggests that Pestalotiopsis sp. has a wide host range. The infection process of Pestalotiopsis sp. started at 2 h after inoculation (hai) with the formation of germ tube followed by the formation of infection hyphae, which penetrated directly into the host at 6 hai. Gray leaf spot symptom was developed at 120 hai. Numerous conidia developed from the acervuli at 168 hai. These conidia acted as the source of inocula for secondary infection. The optimum temperature for the growth of Pestalotiopsis sp. was 25°C, however, the growth of Pestalotiopsis sp. ceased at 15°C and 35°C. This pathogen was completely inhibited by Autostin 50 WDG (carbendazim) at 100 ppm. Trichoderma viride (Pb‐7) was found as the potential biocontrol agent against Pestalotiopsis sp. These findings could contribute to describing the disease cycle and epidemiology of Pestalotiopsis sp. that would ultimately require to undertake effective control measures against this pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPestalotiopsis 3aTrichoderma viride 3abiological control agents 3acarbendazim 3acoconuts 3aconidia 3aepidemiology 3afruits 3afungi 3agerm tube 3ahost range 3ainoculum 3aleaf spot 3apathogens 3asecondary infection 3atemperature 3aBangladesh1 aSultana, Nasrin1 aMahmud, Nur U.1 aKader, Md Abdul,1 aHassan, Oliul1 aChang, Taehyun1 aIslam, M.

Since at least 2016, several countries in Africa and Asia reported an increase in the number of people investing in farms for maintaining scorpions and extracting (‘milking') their venom for commercial use. In addition to serious doubts about the quality of the venom extracted at these farms, repeated collecting of wild specimens may denude an area of scorpions. Given estimates of a million species threatened with extinction over the next decade, unsustainable overexploitation remains a major driver of biodiversity loss. The amateur venom-extraction business has the potential to adversely affect scorpion biodiversity in several biologically rich but poorly documented countries, which calls for urgent action from governments, universities and scientific societies to enhance the conservation of local scorpions. The following activities should thus be initiated or expanded: faunistic surveys and developing national lists of endemic species, red-listing threatened and endangered species using the IUCN Red List categories and criteria, educating local communities, and ceasing to issue permits for the collection of scorpions for commercial exploitation of any kind.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScorpiones 3abiodiversity 3aeconomic valuation 3aendangered species 3aextinction 3ahabitat destruction 3aindigenous species 3ainternational trade 3apeople 3ascorpion venoms 3aAfrica 3aAsia 0aconservation 0aIran 0aMiddle East 0avenom milking1 aSääksjärvi, Ilari Eerikki1 aPrendini, Lorenzo0 tArachnologische Mitteilungen.g2021 Mar. 5, v. 61, no. 1 p.20-23dArachnologische Gesellschaft e.V.wJournal:26749x2199-72337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.30963/aramit61033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122100002300140245008800163300001800251500000900269520147600278592002801754650001701782650000901799650001601808650001501824650001701839650002401856650000801880650001701888650001801905650001701923650002301940650002101963700002201984700002802006773012002034852000902154856007702163655001202240IND4415496120221123015237.0191126e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441549612DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2007.01472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulsen, Tjalfe G.10aAir Permeability in Repacked Porous Media with Variable Structure-Forming Potential  ap. 1139-1143.  aepub  aAir permeability was measured as a function of gravimetric water content and dry bulk density for six sieved, repacked porous materials with organic matter contents ranging from 0 to 88%. The six media used were two relatively fine sandy soils, a filter sand, a peat soil, and two commercial composts made from sewage sludge and yard waste, respectively. The materials were initially wetted from air dry to the desired water content, after which measurements were done. Selected combinations of material gravimetric water content and dry bulk density were used in the permeability measurements. The combinations were selected to cover the entire possible ranges of water content and dry bulk density for each material. The six materials exhibited very different relationships between air permeability, water content, and dry bulk density, exhibiting both increasing and decreasing air permeability with water content depending on their structural behavior. All six materials had regions in their water content–dry bulk density domains where air permeability tended to increase with increasing water content, indicative of increasing structure formation in these regions. This tendency was strongest for the two sandy soils and weakest for the filter sand, which exhibited almost no structure formation. Increased structure, as indicated by increasing air permeability with increasing water content, was strongest for low values of dry bulk density in all six materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aporous media 3asand 3asandy soils 3apeat soils 3aMSW composts 3ayard waste composts 3aair 3apermeability 3awater content 3abulk density 3asoil water content 3asoil pore system1 aBlendstrup, Helle1 aSchjønning, P.q(Per),0 tVadose zone journal.g2008 Nov., v. 7, no. 4 p.1139-1143dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2007.01473Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03284naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013900170300001600309500001900325520165900344536005902003592002802062596002402090650001002114650002302124650002002147650001102167650001402178650001202192650001902204650001302223650001302236650001602249650001302265650001502278653002302293653002002316653001802336653002602354653003002380700001902410700002302429700002202452700002202474700001902496700002002515773012502535856008502660852000902745655001202754IND60694683820221119230726.0200513e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069468382DNAL7 a10.1080/13416979.2018.14982882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDinh, Tai Tien10aSprouting capacity of Quercus serrata Thunb. and Quercus acutissima Carruth. after cutting canopy trees in an abandoned coppice forest  ap. 287-296.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRejuvenation by sprouting is a possible solution to prevent abandoned coppice forests in Japan from outbreaks of oak wilt disease. Applying this approach requires examining the sprouting capacity of large-sized oak trees. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of stump size, sprout characteristics (emerging time and origin position), and environmental factors (slope, convexity, soil moisture, soil net nitrogen mineralization rate (Net-NMR) and canopy closure) on sprout regeneration of the two widely distributed oaks in Japan, Quercus serrata and Quercus acutissima, in the first growing season after cutting. In November 2013, a study plot (40 × 90 m) was set, and canopy trees within the plot and edge areas were cut. We recorded sprout emergence, sprout origin position, sprout survival, and length from May to October 2014. Our data indicated that both species (ca. 60 years old) have not yet lost their ability of sprouting. In Q. acutissima, the sprouting probability increased with light availability and was higher in concave area, and its number of living sprouts was positively related to stump diameter. In Q. serrata, the number of living sprouts increased with light availability. Sprouts emerged earlier and/or originated from the lower part of stump exhibited a higher survival probability. Emerging time substantially influenced sprout growth pattern and its effect followed a similar tendency in both species. Our results evidence that the ability of sprouting and the number of living sprouts might not be reduced in large-sized trees, and the increasing of light availability could promote sprout regeneration.  aThe authors received no specific funding for this work  aPublisher supplied data  cno specific funding 3aJapan 3aQuercus acutissima 3aQuercus serrata 3acanopy 3acoppicing 3aforests 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3aoak wilt 3aprobability 3aresearch 3asoil water 0aSprouting capacity 0asprout survival 0asprout growth 0alarge-sized oak trees 0aabandoned coppice forests1 aAkaji, Yasuaki1 aMatsumoto, Tetsuya1 aToribuchi, Takumi1 aMakimoto, Takushi1 aHirobe, Muneto1 aSakamoto, Keiji0 tJournal of forest research.g2018 Sept. 3, v. 23, no. 5 p.287-296dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2018.14982883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012100167300001400288500001500302520172700317592002802044650001702072650001302089650001402102650001702116650001502133650001602148650001402164650001602178650002202194650001402216653002302230700001702253773012702270856008302397852000902480655001202489IND60087978420221122054658.0141102e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008797842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2011.04.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Mianrun10aExperimental simulation of trophic interactions among omnivorous copepods, heterotrophic dinoflagellates and diatoms  ap. 65-74.  a2019-12-06  aTrophic cascades in the marine pelagic food web, especially in the microbial food web in which copepods are the top controllers, are difficult to quantify and are generally overlooked. In this study, we simulated a simple pelagic food web in laboratory feeding experiments to demonstrate the trophic interactions among copepods, heterotrophic dinoflagellates and chain-forming diatoms and to quantify the trophic cascade effect and the true feeding rate of copepods. Results from the study showed that heterotrophic dinoflagellates play a central role in the lower trophic level of the marine food web by consuming diatoms and by serving as a quality food source for copepods, especially during the period of diatom blooms. Copepod omnivory was mediated by the concentration of diatoms, with the highest ingestion of diatoms occurring at intermediate diatom abundances and the selectivity toward dinoflagellates increasing as the diatom concentration increased. The trophic cascade was surprisingly low and even negative in treatments with low diatom concentrations, suggesting a competition effect when there was not enough diatom food. In this situation, the omnivorous copepods together with heterotrophic dinoflagellates exhibited strong herbivory and were able to control diatoms. In contrast, a high trophic cascade effect occurred at high diatom concentrations in which copepods had a high ingestion of heterotrophic dinoflagellates. We conclude that the role of copepods in the food web structure is mediated by the concentrations of diatoms, but one of the most important biological factors that determine the strength of trophic cascades is the ingestion rates of both copepods and heterotrophic dinoflagellates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgal blooms 3aCopepoda 3afood webs 3afood quality 3aherbivores 3aDinophyceae 3aingestion 3acontrollers 3aBacillariophyceae 3aomnivores 0aBacillariophycidae1 aLiu, Hongbin0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2011 July 15, v. 403, no. 1-2 p.65-74dElsevier B.V.x0022-09817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2011.04.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245016100160300001600321520140900337592002801746650001601774650000801790650001001798650001101808650002201819650001001841650003001851650002101881650001301902650002001915650002101935650001201956650001701968650001701985700001702002700002002019700001702039700001602056700001702072773009802089856004802187852000902235655001202244IND50060087320221117185649.0130220e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006008732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-012-9737-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Fang10aIsolation and characterization of two sorbitol transporter gene promoters in micropropagated apple plants (Malus × domestica) regulated by drought stress  ap. 475-482.  aThe role of polyol transporters in stress tolerance in plants have been elucidated by many studies. Sorbitol transporter genes MdSOT3, MdSOT4 and MdSOT5 in apple plants, which are important for sorbitol loading and unloading, are regulated by drought stress. To further confirm the role of sorbitol transporters in stress tolerance, the constructs harboring MdSOT3 and MdSOT5 genes were introduced into wild type Arabidopsis plants (Col-0) and the Arabidopsis transformed with MdSOT3 or MdSOT5 performed higher drought stress tolerance compared to WT. In order to further understand how sorbitol transporters are involved in drought tolerance in apple plants, upstream regions of sorbitol transporter genes were isolated from apple plant source leaves by Anchored PCR from genomic DNA obtained, and then were used to drive expression of the GUS reporter in tobacco plants. The results showed that the longest fragments of MdSOT3 and MdSOT5 promoters induced the highest GUS activity under drought stress conditions. Additionally, fragments of these promoters that contain cis-acting elements known to be involved in stress response also induced GUS activity under drought stress. Taken together, our data suggest that increased MdSOT3 and MdSOT5 activity, through cis-acting elements in the promoters of these genes, play important roles in imparting tolerance to drought in micropropagated apple plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3aMalus 3aapples 3adrought tolerance 3agenes 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apromoter regions 3asorbitol 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atobacco 3atransporters 3awater stress1 aLei, Hengjiu1 aZhao, Xiangjuan1 aShen, Xinjie1 aLiu, Ailing1 aLi, Tianhong0 tPlant growth regulation.g2012 Dec., v. 68, no. 3 p.475-482dSpringer-Verlagx0167-69037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-012-9737-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03692naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245007800205300001600283506007600299520211500375592002802490596008602518506003702604650002602641650001102667650001502678650001102693650001002704650001202714650001402726650001302740650002202753650001402775650001702789650001502806650001402821653002902835653001302864653001102877653001302888653001402901653003302915700002102948773012102969856007503090852000903165655001203174IND60624568320221207064443.0191016e20180212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062456832DNAL7 a10.1093/aob/mcx1212doi7 aPMC58087872pmcid7 a291827132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForrester, Nicole J14aThe direct effects of plant polyploidy on the legume–rhizobia mutualism  ap. 209-220.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPolyploidy is known to significantly alter plant genomes, phenotypes and interactions with the abiotic environment, yet the impacts of polyploidy on plant–biotic interactions are less well known. A particularly important plant–biotic interaction is the legume–rhizobia mutualism, in which rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen in exchange for carbon provided by legume hosts. This mutualism regulates nutrient cycles in natural ecosystems and provides nitrogen to agricultural environments. Despite the ecological, evolutionary and agricultural importance of plant polyploidy and the legume–rhizobia mutualism, it is not yet fully understood whether plant polyploidy directly alters mutualism traits or the consequences on plant growth. The aim was to propose a conceptual framework to understand how polyploidy might directly enhance the quantity and quality of rhizobial symbionts hosted by legume plants, resulting in increased host access to fixed nitrogen (N). Mechanistic hypotheses have been devised to examine how polyploidy can directly alter traits that impact the quantity (e.g. nodule number, nodule size, terminal bacteroid differentiation) and quality of symbionts (e.g. nodule environment, partner choice, host sanctions). To evaluate these hypotheses, an exhaustive review of studies testing the effects of plant polyploidy on the mutualism was conducted. In doing so, overall trends were synthesized, highlighting the limited understanding of the mechanisms that underlie variation in results achieved thus far, revealing striking gaps in knowledge and uncovering areas ripe for future research. Plant polyploidy can immediately alter nodule size, N fixation rate and the identity of rhizobial symbionts hosted by polyploid legumes, but many of the mechanistic hypotheses proposed here, such as bacteroid number and enhancements of the nodule environment, remain unexplored. Although current evidence supports a role of plant polyploidy in enhancing key aspects of the legume–rhizobia mutualism, the underlying mechanisms and effects on host benefit from the mutualism remain unresolved.  aPublisher supplied data  a1247842a1241006cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000000010 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3aecosystems 3agenome 3ahosts 3alegumes 3amutualism 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aphenotype 3aplant growth 3apolyploidy 3asymbionts 0awhole genome duplication 0aFabaceae 0alegume 0arhizobia 0asymbiosis 0abiological nitrogen fixation1 aAshman, Tia-Lynn0 tAnnals of botany.g2018 Feb. 12, v. 121, no. 2 p.209-220dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44715x1095-82907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcx1213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007500140245013200215300001800347520164800365592002802013650002402041650001002065650002902075650001302104650001202117650001502129650001402144650001602158650001502174650001802189650002002207650001702227650002002244650001802264650001702282650001102299650002602310650001402336650002702350650001502377700001602392700002302408700002102431700002502452700002402477700001702501700002802518773012602546856007402672852000902746655001202755IND60647298720221120023915.0190618e20190617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064729872DNAL7 a10.1039/c8gc03860k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamaniThese authors contributed equally in this work., Mohammad Hassan10aAdvances in plant materials, food by-products, and algae conversion into biofuels: use of environmentally friendly technologies  ap. 3213-3231.  aGreen technologies have emerged as useful tools for the generation of clean fuels with the potential to minimize the effect of human activity on the environment. Currently, these fuels are mainly composed of hydrocarbons obtained from crude oil. Over the past two decades, biomass has gained significant attention as a renewable feedstock for more sustainable biofuel production and has been a great candidate to replace fossil fuels. The principal components of most of the available biomass are cellulose, hemi-cellulose, and lignin. Although the available green technologies for biofuel production are progressing rapidly, productivity and chemical yield from these techniques are still below the required values. Therefore, there is a need for interdisciplinary studies to meet the requirements for more global and efficient production by streamlining processes, integrating technologies and achieving techno-economic improvements. In this context, we aim to give an overview of available biomass such as agricultural wastes suitable for the generation of different classes of biofuels including next-generation biofuels. Unfortunately, expensive, wasteful and energy-consuming pretreatment processes are still used. Therefore, novel technologies that allow a more efficient separation with low resource consumption and the generation of a low number of residues are required. In this regard, novel technologies such as efficient fractionation techniques and genetic and metabolic engineering including the application of CRISPR/Cas tools, as well as microfluidic platforms to improve the overall yield of biofuel production are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural wastes 3aalgae 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3abyproducts 3acellulose 3aclean fuels 3afeedstocks 3afractionation 3afuel production 3agene editing 3agreen chemistry 3ahemicellulose 3ahydrocarbons 3alignin 3ametabolic engineering 3apetroleum 3asustainable technology 3atechnology1 aEş, Ismail1 aLorenzo, José M.,1 aRemize, Fabienne1 aRoselló-Soto, Elena1 aBarba, Francisco J.1 aClark, James1 aMousavi Khaneghah, Amin0 tGreen chemistry.g2019 June 17, v. 21, no. 12 p.3213-3231dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc03860k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03276naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006800140245007700208500002000285520186100305592002802166650001402194650002802208650002102236650001602257650001202273650002102285650001402306650001802320650001202338650001802350650002402368650001302392650001502405650001402420650002502434650001602459650001302475700002402488700002102512700006702533773013502600856007402735852000902809655001202818IND60746414020221120110915.0210803e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074641402DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpe.137602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastiani, Fabio Henrique1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2717-129110aModeling the drying kinetics of alginate particles considering shrinkage  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlginate is an anionic and biodegradable biopolymer of natural occurrence, typically obtained from brown algae, being studied, and used in several applications in biomedicine and food industry by its low toxicity, low cost, and its gelification obtained by the addition of bivalent cations (Ca²⁺), besides being able to storage large amounts of liquid in its structure. In this context, this work aims to study the drying and shrinkage kinetics of this biomaterial. Microparticles of alginate were synthesized by the ionic gelification method using calcium chloride as reticulant agent. These microparticles were submitted to drying experiments conducted at 40, 50, and 60°C. A mathematical model which considers the microparticles moisture and volume change with time was proposed to model the drying process. Considering that the radius depends on time as Page and Sigmoid equations, two mathematical models were obtained. Both models were able to describe the experimental data and the kinetic parameters were adjusted as an exponential function of temperature (R² = 0.99). The statistical analysis of the residues between calculated and experimental data indicates an adequate prediction, with Page's model fitting more accurately to the data sets. Akaike's test also indicated the coupled Page model as the most adequate. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results presented in this paper provide mathematical methods of modelling the hydration kinetics of alginate particles and fitting the parameters which can help understanding the mass transfer and shrinkage phenomena during drying. Those characteristics are essential in describing alginate particles due to the high amount of water that they contain. Describing the drying kinetics of such particles may help to project and optimize equipment involved in alginate particles production process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3abiocompatible materials 3abiodegradability 3abiopolymers 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3aequipment 3afood industry 3aliquids 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3amedicine 3aprediction 3ashrinkage 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3atoxicity1 aSufredini, Stephani1 aRomio, Ana Paula1 aNicolin, Douglas Junior1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4791-86230 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.e13760-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.137603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245017500175300001600350520139300366592002801759650001201787650001301799650001601812650001401828650002901842650002501871650000901896650001301905650002601918650001101944650000701955650001401962650001801976650001301994650000902007653002102016653002302037653001302060653001602073653002602089700001902115700002102134700002302155700002902178700002302207773009802230856005102328852000902379655001202388IND50075555820221118213536.0140410e20130701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007555582DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2013.7765472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeolchini, Francesca10aChemical and biological strategies for the mobilisation of metals/semi-metals in contaminated dredged sediments: experimental analysis and environmental impact assessment  ap. 415-426.  aThis study deals with laboratory-scale investigations to evaluate the efficiency of different chemical leaching agents (i.e. sulfuric, oxalic and citric acids) and bioleaching processes (based on different acidophilic bacterial strains) on the mobilisation of metals/semi-metals in contaminated harbour sediments. A simplified life-cycle assessment was also performed in order to compare the investigated strategies in terms of their main environmental impacts. The different chemical leaching agents provided different extraction efficiencies of toxic metals. Among the investigated chemical leaching agents, citric acid 0.5 M and sulfuric acid pH 2 were the most effective, with average mobilisation efficiencies of ∼30% for Zn and Cr, ∼40% for Ni, and 35 and 58% for As, under citric and sulfuric acid, respectively. Similar higher extraction efficiencies of metals were also observed in bioleaching experiments with the presence of ferrous iron. The life-cycle assessment revealed that treatments based on diluted sulfuric acid are a better option considering both resource requirements and emissions, leading to lower environmental impacts compared with the other treatment strategies. Overall results from this study provide new insights for the definition of the most efficient and environmentally friendly strategies to be used for dredged sediments contaminated with metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3achromium 3acitric acid 3aemissions 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3airon 3aleaching 3alife cycle assessment 3anickel 3apH 3asediments 3asulfuric acid 3atoxicity 3azinc 0amarine sediments 0ametal contaminants 0aleaching 0abioleaching 0alife-cycle assessment1 aFonti, Viviana1 aRocchetti, Laura1 aSaraceni, Giovanni1 aPietrangeli, Biancamaria1 aDell'Anno, Antonio0 tChemistry in ecology.g2013 July 1, v. 29, no. 5 p.415-426dTaylor & Francisx1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2013.776547  aDNAL 7aarticle04387naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245015400181300001800335520249700353592002802850650001602878650002202894650002502916650001302941650002002954650001302974650002002987650002603007650001103033650001503044650001403059650002603073650001103099650002303110650001303133650001403146650000903160650001203169650001203181650002303193650001703216650001703233650001403250650002003264650001503284650001003299650002103309650001203330650001003342653000903352653001003361653002203371653002303393653001703416700001503433700001703448700001603465700001603481773011303497856008203610852000903692655001203701IND60516148820221120035147.0190804e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051614882DNAL7 a259085822pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311150006092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebret, B.10aInfluence of production system in local and conventional pig breeds on stress indicators at slaughter, muscle and meat traits and pork eating quality  ap. 1404-1413.  aSensory quality of pork is a complex phenotype determined by interactions between genetic and environmental factors. This study aimed at describing the respective influences of breed and production system on the development of pork quality. Plasma stress indicators and Longissimus muscle (LM) composition, physicochemical and sensory quality traits were determined in two contrasted breeds – the conventional Large White (LW, n=40) and the French local Basque (B, n=60). Pigs were reared in either a conventional (C; n=20 per breed), alternative (A; sawdust bedding and outdoor area, n=20 per breed) or extensive system (E; free-range, n=20 B). All the pigs from A and C systems were slaughtered at the same slaughterhouse, whereas B pigs from the E system were slaughtered at a local commercial abattoir. Major breed differences were found for almost all traits under study. LM from B pigs exhibited higher lipid, lower water and collagen concentrations, as well as lower collagen thermal solubility (P<0.001). Although plasma stress indicators at slaughter did not differ between breeds, except lower (P<0.05) lactate levels in B pigs, they exhibited higher LM pH1 and pHu values, and lower meat lightness, hue angle, water (drip, thawing and cooking) losses, glycolytic potential and shear force. Sensory analyses highlighted higher redness, marbling, tenderness, juiciness and flavour scores (P<0.01) of meat from B compared with LW pigs. Within both LW and B breeds, compared with C, the A system did not (P>0.05) influence plasma stress indicators, LM chemical composition and physicochemical or sensory traits of pork. In contrast, within the B pigs, the E system affected the meat quality more. Lower plasma cortisol levels (P<0.05), but higher plasma lactate, creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities, and more skin lesions (P<0.05), indicating higher muscular activity during pre-slaughter handling, were found in pigs produced in the E compared with the C system. E pigs exhibited higher meat pH1 and pHu values and shear force (P<0.01) and exhibited lower lightness, hue angle and drip and thawing losses (P<0.01) compared with the C pigs, whereas LM lipid, protein or collagen concentrations were not affected. Regarding sensory traits, the E system produced redder meat, but did not impact the eating quality of pork. Altogether, this study demonstrates that differences in meat quality between B and LW breeds can be modulated by extensive pig production system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarge White 3abreed differences 3achemical composition 3acollagen 3acooking quality 3acortisol 3acreatine kinase 3aenvironmental factors 3aflavor 3aglycolysis 3ajuiciness 3alactate dehydrogenase 3alipids 3alongissimus muscle 3amarbling 3aphenotype 3apork 3arearing 3asawdust 3asensory evaluation 3ashear stress 3askin lesions 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3asolubility 3aswine 3aswine production 3athawing 3awater 0apigs 0abreed 0aproduction system 0amuscle composition 0ameat quality1 aEcolan, P.1 aBonhomme, N.1 aMéteau, K.1 aPrunier, A.0 tAnimal.g2015 Aug., v. 9, no. 8 p.1404-1413dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311150006093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03625naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245013700215500002200352520199600374592002802370650002602398650002102424650003102445650001502476650002602491650001202517650001502529650001302544650001102557650002102568650002602589650001402615650002202629650002002651653001902671653002302690653002202713653002602735653002702761653002602788700001902814700002102833700001902854700002602873773012802899856008303027852000903110655001203119IND60618088220221122034229.0190412e20181009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061808822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2018.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKepfer-Rojas, Sebastian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1681-287710aPersistent land-use legacies increase small-scale diversity and strengthen vegetation–soil relationships on an unmanaged heathland  aPre-press version  aLand-use legacies are recognized determinants of vegetation dynamics and plant community assembly. The duration of these legacies and how they influence the structure of vegetation communities developing naturally in nutrient-poor ecosystems is not well understood. Here, we focus on the effects of increased nutrient availability from previous agricultural practices on multiple vegetation properties in a heathland where agriculture and domestic grazing ceased near 1870 and 1895, respectively. We compared diversity, compositional and functional properties of the vegetation responses to land-use legacies in the soil between areas with different agricultural histories (previously cultivated vs. uncultivated). Diversity measures were found to be higher in the previously cultivated soils. β-diversity was mainly driven by changes in species relative cover and increased with increasing nutrient availability in the cultivated area. Furthermore, functional traits related to nutrient acquisition (SLA and Leaf Nitrogen content) and the changes in vegetation composition were directly linked to soil properties only in the previously cultivated part of the heathland. Together these results revealed a shift to a deterministic control of the plant community, where increased nutrient availability leads to stronger associations between soil and vegetation properties. This suggests that as nutrients become available, niche differentiation and competitive interactions become the predominant underlying mechanisms structuring the community. Our study shows that land-use legacies of moderate intensity can alter the assembly mechanisms and diversity patterns in unmanaged vegetation that can be maintained after more than a century since cessation of agricultural practice.

An annotated list of spiders includes 113 species in 23 families. Salticidae (20 species, 17.7% of the species list) and Gnaphosidae (18 species, 15.9%) are the most species rich. The studied reserve is the westernmost locality of Ero koreana Paik, 1967 and Zelotes eugeneiKovblyuk, 2009. Richest were the ecotone habitats on the edges of forest plantations and shrub thickets (43–45 species), while the poorest were the most disturbed open grassland habitats like grazed steppe, secondary steppe and meadows (25–26 species). Spider assemblages of the undisturbed forb-fescue-feather grass and petrophytic steppe habitats accounted for 33–37 species. A comparison of the dry grassland spider faunas of 11 protected areas in the steppe and forest-steppe zones of Ukraine showed that the araneofauna of the Yelanetskyi Steppe is most similar to those of both forb-fescue-feather grass steppes of Southeast Ukraine and fescue-feather grass steppes of South Ukraine. Moreover, the spider fauna of the Yelanetskyi Steppe contains the least specific elements. 33% of the species are widespread and only 3.8% are recorded from one or only two close sites. Similarity of the spider faunas depends on the geographical location of the study area and on the types of the grasslands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGnaphosidae 3aSalticidae 3acase studies 3afauna 3aforest steppe 3aforests 3agrasses 3ahumans 3ashrubs 3aspiders 3aUkraine 0aEuropean fauna 0aconservation areas 0asteppe ecosystems0 tArachnologische Mitteilungen.g2021 Apr. 6, v. 61, no. 1 p.27-35dArachnologische Gesellschaft e.V.wJournal:26749x2199-72337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.30963/aramit61053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141242017900161245017000340300001400510500001900524520116000543592002801703650001701731650001401748650002101762650001201783650001601795650001001811650001201821650001201833650000901845651001601854653001801870653002201888653001501910653001601925653001501941653001401956700002001970773013601990856007502126852000902201655001202210IND60736270320221117233959.0210506e20210406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073627032DNAL7 a10.30963/aramit61062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloem, Geron J.10aSpinnentiere aus tropischen Gewächshäusern des Zoos in Rotterdam (Niederlande), mit einer Zitterspinne neu für Europa (Arachnida: Araneae, Mesostigmata, Pseudoscorpiones).10aArachnids (Arachnida: Araneae, Mesostigmata, Pseudoscorpiones) from tropical greenhouses at Rotterdam Zoo (the Netherlands), including a pholcid spider new to Europe  ap. 36-44.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAn inventory of arachnids was conducted in three tropical greenhouses of Rotterdam Zoo, the Netherlands. This was part of a survey in which pitfall traps, banana baits, litter samples, hand searching and beating were used to map arthropod diversity. A total of twenty spider species, one mite taxon and one pseudoscorpion species were collected. Fourteen specimens were used for COI-barcoding, which yielded two of the listed species. Four spider species were recorded for the first time for the Netherlands: Belisana ambenganHuber, 2005, Heteroonops spinimanus (Simon, 1892), Nesticella mogera (Yaginuma, 1972) and Triaeris stenaspis Simon, 1891, the first of which is also a new record for Europe and appears to be an extremely rare pholcid species. From the species found, thirteen are nonnative to the Netherlands and four of these are considered as expansive, since they have outdoor populations as well. Hand searching yielded the highest number of species, compared to the other four sampling techniques. A species saturation curve shows that in all likelihood not all species present in the surveyed greenhouses have been found during this survey.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMesostigmata 3aPholcidae 3aPseudoscorpiones 3abananas 3ainventories 3amites 3aspiders 3asurveys 3azoos 3aNetherlands 0aalien species 0aBelisana ambengan 0afaunistics 0anew records 0aNesticidae 0aOonopidae1 aNoordijk, Jinze0 tArachnologische Mitteilungen.g2021 Apr. 6, v. 61, no. 1 p.36-44dArachnologische Gesellschaft e.V.wJournal:26749x2199-72337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.30963/aramit61063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245018000196300001600376500002000392520167300412592002802085596006602113650001702179650002902196650002202225650001202247650002102259650001102280650001402291650000902305650001202314650001802326650002302344773012302367856007402490852000902564655001202573IND60753478520221116154453.0211015e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075347852DNAL7 a10.1111/sum.126702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStott, Tim A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4101-668810aDo riparian buffer zones and new forest management practices reduce stream suspended sediment loads?: Re‐visiting the Afon Tanllwyth in Hafren Forest, Plynlimon, 20 years on  ap. 921-935.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStudies of forest clear‐felling operations in 1995–97 in the Afon Tanllwyth sub‐catchment of the upper River Severn on Plynlimon, mid‐Wales, by Stott et al. (Journal of Environmental Management (2001), 63, 3), indicated elevated suspended sediment loads (SSLs) immediately following timber harvesting. UK Forestry Commission (1993) Forests and Water Guidelines recommended that riparian buffer zones adjacent to streams were left unplanted. This study 20 years on assessed the SSLs at the same point in the Afon Tanllwyth for 21 months between January 2017 and September 2018. While SSLs reported by Stott et al. (Journal of Environmental Management (2001), 63, 3). increased during and after the clear‐felling operations, by 2017–18 (20 years later) they appear to have recovered to levels similar to those measured pre‐clear‐felling (1995), despite this study taking place only a few months after approximately 3 ha of mature forest was clear‐felled on the north side of the catchment. Although the mean monthly SSL for 2017–18 of 1628 ± 95 kg is slightly lower than the 1,800 ± 176 kg reported for 1995, the difference is not significant. When SSL is corrected for differences in total monthly flow the flow adjusted SSLs are 1,346 ± 132 kg for 1995 and 945 ± 55 kg for 2017–18, thus significantly lower in 2017–18. These new data for 2017–18 indicate that SSLs seem to have recovered to levels significantly below those measured and reported by Stott et al. (Journal of Environmental Management (2001), 63, 3–25) in 1995 pre‐clear‐felling period, likely as a result of the establishment of the 50 m buffer zone.  aPublisher supplied data  aTAL‐NAFA 20161108‐002cInternational Atomic Energy Agency 3aclearcutting 3aenvironmental management 3aforest management 3aforests 3ariparian buffers 3arivers 3asediments 3asoil 3astreams 3asubwatersheds 3asuspended sediment0 tSoil use and management.g2021 Oct., v. 37, no. 4 p.921-935dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl36284x0266-00327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/sum.126703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02787naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245007500174300001600249520127200265592002801537650001001565650001701575650001201592650001101604650001501615650001101630650002101641650002001662650001901682650001701701650000901718650001101727650002101738650001301759650002101772650002701793650001601820650001401836650002201850651001001872653002501882653002801907653001701935653002201952653001601974653001001990700002702000700001702027700001902044773009802063856005102161852000902212655001202221IND50075556020221118214534.0140410e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007555602DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2013.7796812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Anindita10aPhytoaccumulation of iron by callus tissue of Clerodendrum indicum (L)  ap. 564-571.  aClerodendrum indicum (L.) is one of the important medicinal plants, originating in India. The plant is used as medicine for bronchitis, asthma and different immunological disease. Micro-propagation is a quick method, producing a huge number of plants. Apical leaf of Clerodendrum indicum (L.) was used as an explant for callogenesis. The combinations of different plant growth regulators (2,4-D, NAA, KN) in MS (Murashige and Skoog) medium produced two types of calli: one was friable and loose and the other was green, embryogenic and compact. Heavy metals cause pollution and health hazards. The plant absorbs heavy metals, which is very useful for controlling environmental pollution. Iron is a major nutrient for both plants and animals, but hyper accumulation of iron is injurious to health. Calli were used to study the optimum conditions of iron uptake in presence of different chemical environments. The different environments were created by using different chemical reagents such as (HCL, HNO₃, H₃PO₄ and KNO₃). Iron (III) was spiked with radioactive Fe-59 and dynamics of uptake was followed by measuring radioactivity by gamma-ray spectrometer. The best condition of iron uptake corresponded to 1 mol L⁻¹ KNO₃ after 4 hour of equilibration.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aClerodendrum 3aanimals 3aasthma 3abronchitis 3acallus 3acallus formation 3agamma radiation 3ahealth hazards 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amedicine 3amicropropagation 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3anitric acid 3apollution 3apotassium nitrate 3aIndia 0aClerodendrum indicum 0aplant growth regulators 0acallogenesis 0aphyto-remediation 0airon uptake 0aFe-591 aBandyopadhyay, Abhijit1 aDutta, Sikha1 aBasu, Sukalyan0 tChemistry in ecology.g2013 Aug. 1, v. 29, no. 6 p.564-571dTaylor & Francisx1029-03707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02757540.2013.779681  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024004300134040001800177100001600195245013900211300001600350506002800366506003600394506007600430506003100506520102600537592002801563596008301591506003701674650001601711650001301727650001401740650002301754650001101777650001701788650001301805650002401818650002401842650000701866650001801873650001501891650001401906650000901920650002501929650001601954653001801970653001201988653002002000653001702020653000702037653001302044653002002057700006002077700002102137700002002158773010002178856008702278903002402365852000902389655001202398IND60570671320221207103650.0190402e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057067132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0962doi7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0962chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwens, Cory10aCreaming and oxidative stability of fish oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by whey protein-xanthan-locust bean complexes: Impact of pH  ap. 314-322.  aResource is Open Access  aElsevier BV License Information  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aThe impact of pH on the physicochemical properties of 10% menhaden oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions containing 2% whey protein isolate (WPI) and 0.1% xanthan (XG)-locust bean gum (LBG) mixtures was investigated. The O/W emulsions containing 0.1% XG-LBG mixtures were compared to emulsions with 0.1% XG and 0.1% LBG. The results indicated that stability is dependent on pH and biopolymer type. At both pH 3 and 5, emulsions containing either XG or XG-LBG mixtures had large particle sizes, viscosity, droplet aggregation, and creaming index, resulting in poor physical stability which can be related to the adsorbed protein-polysaccharide interactions. At pH7, the XG-LBG emulsions showed the greatest resistance to phase separation and resulted in stable emulsions. Lipid oxidation measurements also indicated that XG-LBG mixtures can be used to form stable emulsions at pH 3 and pH 7. These results have significant implications for the development of novel structures containing lipid phases susceptible to lipid oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiopolymers 3acreaming 3aemulsions 3alipid peroxidation 3alipids 3alocust beans 3amenhaden 3aoil-water interface 3aoxidative stability 3apH 3aparticle size 3aseparation 3aviscosity 3awhey 3awhey protein isolate 3axanthan gum 0aO/W emulsions 0aXanthan 0aLocust bean gum 0aWhey protein 0apH 0aCreaming 0aLipid oxidation1 aGriffin, Kristen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9426-93821 aKhouryieh, Hanna1 aWilliams, Kevin0 tFood chemistry.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 239 p.314-322dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.0963Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03754naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001600166245014300182300001800325500001500343520188300358592002802241650001802269650001002287650002002297650002702317650001102344650001402355650002102369650001502390650001202405650002202417650001202439650002602451650001402477650001102491650001702502650001002519650003502529650001802564650004302582650001002625650001702635650001802652650001302670653001002683653001202693653001702705653003002722653002002752700001102772700001302783700001202796700001402808700001402822700001102836700001402847700001502861773011302876856008202989852000903071655001203080IND60516149120221120035234.0190804e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051614912DNAL7 a259518972pmid7 a10.1017/S17517311150006582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, N.

This study was conducted to better understand the effect of ANGPTL3 on important economic traits in cattle. First, transcript profiles for ANGPTL3 were measured in nine different Jiaxian cattle tissues. Second, polymorphisms were identified in the complete coding region and promoter region of the bovine ANGPTL3 gene in 707 cattle samples. Finally, an association study was carried out utilizing these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine the effect of these SNPs on the growth and meat quality traits. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that ANGPTL3 was mainly expressed in the liver. The promoter of the bovine ANGPTL3 contained several putative transcription factor binding sites (SF1, HNF-1, LXRα, NFκβ, HNF-3 and C/EBP). In total, four SNPs of the bovine ANGPTL3 gene were identified by direct sequencing. SNP1 (rs469906272: g.−38T>C) was identified in the promoter, SNP2 (rs451104723:g.104A>T) and SNP3 (rs482516226: g.509A>G) were identified in exon 1, and SNP4 (rs477165942: g.8661T>C) was identified in exon 6. Changes in predicted protein structures due to non-synonymous SNPs were analyzed. Haplotype frequencies and linkage disequilibrium were also investigated. Analysis of four SNPs in cattle from different native Chinese breeds (Nanyang (NY) and Jiaxian (JX)) and commercial breeds (Angus (AG), Hereford (HF), Limousin (LM), Luxi (LX), Simmental (ST) and Jinnan (JN)) revealed a significant association with growth traits (including: BW and hipbone width) and meat quality traits (including: Warner–Bratzler shear force and ribeye area). Therefore, implementation of these four mutations in selection indices in the beef industry may be beneficial in selecting individuals with superior growth and meat quality traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef industry 3aAngus 3aselection index 3alinkage disequilibrium 3alipids 3ameat cuts 3apromoter regions 3ahaplotypes 3aglucose 3aenergy metabolism 3atissues 3atranscription factors 3aSimmental 3acattle 3ashear stress 3aexons 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3agrowth traits 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aliver 3ameat quality 3abinding sites 3aHereford 0agenes 0aANGPTL3 0apolymorphism 0amarker assisted selection 0aeconomic traits1 aMa, Y.1 aYang, T.1 aLin, F.1 aFu, W.

GA increased the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), chlorophyll content and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of 1st and 6th leaves. The 100 mg L⁻¹ dose was most effective for increasing the total chlorophyll content and Pn, which increased by 100.00% and 59.55%, respectively, in the 1st leaf, and 110.18% and 44.90%, respectively, in the 6th leaf compared with the control. The 100 and 200 mg L⁻¹ GA solutions decreased the starch and soluble sugar levels in both 1st and 6th leaves, but increased those of the 1st and 6th buds which suggested that exogenous GA promotes the transportation of photosynthetic products from leaves to buds with the regulation of a sink–source relationship. Endogenous levels of gibberellin and auxin increased, but abscisic acid decreased in the 1st and 6th leaves after GA applications. The Pn was positively correlated with the total chlorophyll content (0.922 for 1st leaf and 0.944 for 6th leaf) and fluorescence parameters, but negatively correlated with soluble sugar and starch contents in 1st (−0.940 and −0.875, respectively) and 6th (−0.866 and −0.854, respectively) leaves. The difference in responses of leaves at different positions to exogenous GA due to the physiological differences of the leaves themselves.  aThis work was supported by the Special Fund for Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Welfare of China [201404702].  aPublisher supplied data  a201404702cSpecial Fund for Forestry Scientific Research in the Public Welfare of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100010015 3aCamellia oleifera 3aabscisic acid 3aauxins 3achlorophyll 3aflower buds 3afluorescence 3aforests 3agibberellic acid 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aresearch 3astarch 3asugars 3atransportation 0aleaf position 0aendogenous hormones1 aSu, Shu-chai1 aMa, Lv-yi1 aWang, Xiang-nan0 tJournal of forest research.g2018 Sept. 3, v. 23, no. 5 p.309-317dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13416979.2018.15123943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02774naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011800153300001600271520154100287592002801828650001601856650001601872650001601888650000901904650001101913650001301924650001301937650001401950650001501964650001501979650002201994650002102016650001502037700001802052700001702070700001102087700001802098700001202116773012902128856007402257852000902331655001202340IND60639832820221119144006.0190503e20170322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063983282DNAL7 a10.1039/c6em00521g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Hang10aFerrate(vi) initiated oxidative degradation mechanisms clarified by DFT calculations: a case for sulfamethoxazole  ap. 370-378.  aFerrate(vi) is an efficient and environmentally friendly oxidant for the degradation of organic micropollutants. However, the related mechanism for the degradation is ambiguous and can hardly be elucidated empirically due to the rapid oxidation process and unstable intermediates for experimental trapping. Herein we performed density function theory (DFT) calculations to unveil the mechanism of ferrate(vi)-mediated degradation, taking sulfamethoxazole as a model compound. The results show that nucleophilic attack (rather than electrophilic attack) of HFeO₄⁻ on the isoxazole moiety of sulfamethoxazole initiates the subsequent degradations, and ferrate(vi) rather than the water molecule provides O atoms for the oxidation of the nitroso group and isoxazole moiety. Electron delocalization from the Fe atom to the isoxazole moiety is crucial for the ring-opening of isoxazole, and organometallic intermediates suggested previously are not the necessary ones in the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole by HFeO₄⁻. Thus, this study has theoretically clarified the ferrate(vi) oxidation mechanisms for a representative sulfonamide, which were also partially corroborated by the intermediates and products observed in the previous experimental studies for phosphite and tryptophan. This study provides an exemplification on the application of quantum chemical calculations to clarify the degradation pathways of organic micropollutants, which is important for the prediction of degradation products needed in their engineering design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aLewis bases 3adegradation 3airon 3amodels 3amoieties 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apollutants 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics 3asulfamethoxazole 3atryptophan1 aChen, Jingwen1 aXie, Hongbin1 aGe, Pu1 aKong, Qingwei1 aLuo, Yi0 tEnvironmental science.g2017 Mar. 22, v. 19, no. 3 p.370-378dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6em00521g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014300169300001600312520123500328592002801563650002301591650003001614650001601644650002401660650002301684650001801707650002901725650001701754650001501771650001501786650001701801650001601818650001501834650002001849650002001869650001701889650001701906650001301923650002101936653001301957653001601970653001601986653001502002653001802017653001802035700002002053700001702073700002002090773009802110856005102208852000902259655001202268IND50075556220221122052309.0140410e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007555622DNAL7 a10.1080/02757540.2013.7903812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Orte, M.

In the present study, the toxic effects of several chemicals associated with land-based marine fish farming activities were assessed using two species of marine microalgae (Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Isochrysis galbana). Mini-scale toxicity tests were performed with six antibiotics (amoxicillin, ampicillin, flumequine, oxytetracycline, streptomycin and sulfadiazine) and two disinfectants (formaldehyde and hypochlorite). Amoxicillin and streptomycin did not exert toxic effects. Sulfadiazine was the most toxic chemical; the EC₅₀ values were 0.11 mg/L and 1.44 mg/L for P. tricornutum and I. galbana respectively. As expected, the disinfectants displayed high toxicity, and P. tricornutum was particularly sensitive to these compounds. Although the differences in microalgal sensitivity depended on the chemical considered, both species were highly sensitive to most of the compounds tested. We recommend the inclusion of mini-scale microalgal toxicity tests in environmental risk assessment (ERA) and environmental monitoring plans because they are cost-effective and rapid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIsochrysis galbana 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aamoxicillin 3aaquatic environment 3acost effectiveness 3adisinfectants 3aenvironmental monitoring 3afish culture 3afish farms 3aflumequine 3aformaldehyde 3amarine fish 3amicroalgae 3aoxytetracycline 3arisk assessment 3astreptomycin 3asulfadiazine 3atoxicity 3atoxicity testing 0abioassay 0aecotoxicity 0agrowth test 0amicroplate 0aphytoplankton 0abiomonitoring1 aCarballeira, C.1 aViana, I.

Despite a quite similar cheese‐making process, both types of cheeses exhibit specific sensory attributes. Salers and Cantal cheeses are produced with either Salers milk or with milk from “other cow breeds.” The aim of this study is to evaluate the specific sensory properties in order to differentiate both types of cheese: Cantal versus Salers combining a consumer test (n = 152) using the CATA method and a sensory profile with a trained panel (n = 9). Ten cheeses (Salers cheeses; n = 6 and Cantal cheeses; n = 4) were selected, after 12 months of ripening and storage in the same maturing cellar. A clear discrimination of Cantal cheeses and Salers cheeses was achieved by using sensory and CATA terms. More precisely, Cantal cheeses were characterized by their texture, whereas Salers cheeses were differentiated by aromatic profile and appearance. The CATA method offers a good description of cheeses (14 attributes out of 16 were discriminant) even if consumer preference scores were slightly close. Although the sensory profile allows a more detailed product characterization than CATA terms, both methods provided similar information about the sensory characterization. Overall, these results suggest the validity of CATA method and once again, show the interest of using it for the sensory characterization by consumers applied on cheese samples with subtle differences. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The findings of this study are useful for French artisanal cheese producers as they make it possible to use a sensory approach to differentiate cheese categories from different cheese‐making process. This sensory distinction contributes to the improvement of qualities of PDO French cheeses. Hence, these specific sensory attributes could be useful to the supply chain to communicate and to better explain to consumers the sensory differences between these two cheese categories, which are sometimes poorly distinguished by consumers during purchase. In addition, the good agreement between sensory profile and the CATA method demonstrated similarities about the sensory description of cheeses. In spite of the fact that the liking scores were very close between the cheeses, consumers were able to distinguish the Salers and Cantal cheeses by using the CATA method.  aPublisher supplied data  cFEADER 3aSalers 3aartisan cheese 3aconsumer preferences 3acows 3amilk 3aprotected designation of origin 3asensory evaluation 3asupply chain 3atexture1 aLenoir, Louis1 aSchmidt‐Filgueras, Renata1 aBenoit, Julie1 aDechambre, Gilles1 aChassard, Christophe0 tJournal of sensory studies.g2021 Dec., v. 36, no. 6 p.e12698-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl66238x0887-82507nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joss.126983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245019200172300001800364520174400382592002802126650001402154650001602168650001402184650001702198650001902215650001602234650002502250650001602275650001502291650001102306650002202317650001602339650001902355700001802374700001902392773008902411856008102500852000902581655001202590IND60082502520221121230213.0141026e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008250252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00709-014-0652-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStamenković, Marija10aUltrastructure of Cosmarium strains (Zygnematophyceae, Streptophyta) collected from various geographic locations shows species-specific differences both at optimal and stress temperatures  ap. 1491-1509.  aPlant species collected from various climatic zones and stressed in vitro at various temperatures reveal changes in cellular ultrastructure which are in accordance with the climate at their sampling sites. This observation initiated the investigation to establish if stress at different temperatures may cause diverse extents of changes in the ultrastructure of microalgal strains originating from different geographic zones. The study revealed that the six Cosmarium strains demonstrated ultrastructural characteristics that were consistent with their source location under optimal, low and high temperature conditions, pointing to their preference to specific climatic niches. Interestingly, chloroplasts of all of the Cosmarium strains correspond to a sun-adapted type, which is concomitant with earlier statements that these strains are rendered as high-light adapted algae. The Cosmarium strains developed multiple ultrastructural responses which enabled them to cope with excessive temperatures, occasionally occurring in desmid natural habitats. The appearance of cubic membranes and increased number of plastoglobules may represent the first line in protection against high-temperature stress, which is accompanied by the alteration of protein synthesis and the appearance of stress granules in order to preserve cell homeostasis. However, the prolonged warm- or cold-temperature stress obviously initiated the programmed cell death, as concluded from the appearance of several ultrastructural features observed in all of the Cosmarium strains. The fair acclimation possibilities and the ability to undergo programmed cell death in order to save the population, certainly favor the cosmopolitan distribution of the genus Cosmarium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCosmarium 3aacclimation 3aapoptosis 3achloroplasts 3aclimatic zones 3acold stress 3acytoplasmic granules 3ahomeostasis 3amicroalgae 3aniches 3aprotein synthesis 3atemperature 3aultrastructure1 aWoelken, Elke1 aHanelt, Dieter0 tProtoplasma.g2014 Nov., v. 251, no. 6 p.1491-1509dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-014-0652-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245011600131300001800247520121400265592002801479650000801507650002701515650001801542650003201560650001801592650001601610650001701626650001601643650002501659650000701684650003001691650001401721650001801735650001401753651001601767700002001783700001801803700001901821700002301840700001701863700001701880700001901897773017901916852000902095655001202104IND4490775320221121012331.0120501e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449077532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Jeong Chan10aPaenibacillus sacheonensis sp. nov., a xylanolytic and cellulolytic bacterium isolated from tidal flat sediment  ap. 2753-2757.  aA Gram-negative-staining, rod-shaped bacterium, designated strain SY01T, was isolated from tidal flat sediment from Sacheon Bay, South Korea. Strain SY01T was characterized with respect to its phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics. The novel strain was spore-forming, motile, catalase-negative and oxidase-positive. Optimal growth of the strain occurred at 30 °C and pH 7.0. The DNA G+C content was 56.1 mol%. The predominant menaquinone was MK-7. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and several unknown lipids were detected in the polar lipid profile. Anteiso-C15 : 0 (47.2 %), iso-C15 : 0 (18.9 %) and iso-C16 : 0 (10.5 %) were the major cellular fatty acids of strain SY01T. The highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities were found with Paenibacillus phyllosphaerae PALXIL04T (95.9 %), Paenibacillus tarimensis SA-7-6T (94.6 %) and Paenibacillus mendelii C/2T (94.4 %). Based on the phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and physiological characteristics presented in this study, strain SY01T represents a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus sacheonensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SY01T ( = DSM 23054T = KACC 14895T).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aPaenibacillus 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3achemotaxonomy 3afatty acids 3amenaquinones 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asediments 3aSouth Korea1 aJung, Young Jun1 aJung, Ji Hyun1 aJung, Hyun Suk1 aCheong, Young Ryun1 aJeon, Che Ok1 aLee, Kyun Oh1 aLee, Sang Yeol0 tInternational journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology.g2011 Nov., v. 61, no.

Experimental adsorption data were modeled using empirical models and artificial neural network. The GAB model gave the best fit among the empirical models with high R² (0.9908–0.9982) and low P% (4.71–8.40%) values. However, artificial neural network (ANN) model having 10 hidden neurons optimized using Lavenberg‐Marquardth training algorithm was superior to the empirical models with the highest R² (0.9965–0.9999) and lowest P% (0.74–8.52%) values. The ANN model explained the adsorption behavior of mahaleb powder ideally at all temperatures. In addition to the adsorption kinetics of mahaleb powder, thermodynamic properties such as isosteric heat of sorption, differential entropy and Gibbs free energy were also determined. Isosteric heat of sorption values were high when moisture contents of the powders were low. Also, differential entropy values followed the same trend which indicated that the adsorption process was driven by enthalpy. Gibbs free energy at the isokinetic temperature of 458.48 K was determined as −306.7 J/mol. Gibbs free energy values were below zero at all different temperatures. The results showed that ANN model can be suitable for predictive control systems in the food industry and the data obtained for thermodynamic properties can be useful for the storage of mahaleb powder in industrial scale. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: An intelligent model, which is artificial neural network was used for modeling of adsorption behavior of freeze‐dried mahaleb powder and it predicted the adsorption data better than empirical models. Thermodynamic properties which are mostly important for the prediction of energy consumption of a process were also determined. The data of the freeze‐dried mahaleb powder can be significant for the food industry in terms of prediction of shelf‐life and energy requirements.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aadsorption 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3afood industry 3afreeze drying 3agravimetry 3aheat 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3ashelf life 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature1 aIsleroglu, Hilal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4338-92420 tJournal of food process engineering.g2021 Aug., v. 44, no. 8 p.e13752-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl8651x0145-88767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.137523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03733naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009100165300001600256520205900272592002802331650002502359650001202384650001702396650001902413650001602432650002602448650001902474650002002493650001802513650002002531650002202551650001302573650002402586650001902610650001302629651001002642653002902652653002402681653002002705653002102725653000802746700001602754700001502770700002202785700001902807700001802826700001602844700002902860700002202889700002102911700002002932773009702952856008503049852000903134655001203143IND60615584320221121041525.0200427e20181101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061558432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Qiyuan10aDevelopment of a mobile groundwater desalination system for communities in rural India  ap. 642-655.  aThe consumption of saline groundwater has contributed to a growing incidence of renal diseases, particularly in coastal communities of India. Although reverse osmosis (RO) is routinely used to remove salt from groundwater, conventional RO systems (i.e. centralized systems using spiral wound RO elements) have limited utility in these communities due to high capital and maintenances costs, and lack of infrastructure to distribute the water. Consequently, there is a need to develop an appropriate solution for groundwater treatment based on small-scale, mobile and community-led systems.In this work, we designed a mobile desalination system to provide a simple platform for water treatment and delivery of goods to rural communities. The system employs tubular RO membranes packed in a single, low-profile vessel which fits below the cargo space. The low-profile enables minimal intrusion on the space available for the transportation of goods. Pressure is delivered by a belt driven clutch pump, powered by the engine. Water is treated locally by connecting the intake to the village well while the vehicle idles.A combined numerical and experimental approach was used to optimise the module/system design, resulting in ∼20% permeate flux enhancement. Experimental results revealed that the system can produce 16 L per square meter of membrane area per hour (LMH) at a salinity level of 80 ppm from a ∼2000 ppm groundwater when it is feed at 1 m³/h at 8 bars. This indicates that a vehicle equipped with 12 m² of tubular RO membranes can deliver 1 m³ of drinkable water by using ∼0.9 L of diesel. Assuming eight such systems could be implemented in a community to fulfil the water demands for a village with 2000 residents, a social business study revealed that a payback time of 2.5 years is achievable, even if the sale price of the water is relatively low, USD 0.18 (Rs 12, which is half of the lowest market price) per 20 L, including providing a goods transportation service at price of USD 5.25 (Rs 350) per 100 km.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3acapital 3adesalination 3adrinking water 3agroundwater 3agroundwater treatment 3ainfrastructure 3akidney diseases 3amarket prices 3areverse osmosis 3arural communities 3asalinity 3asystems engineering 3atransportation 3avillages 3aIndia 0aGroundwater desalination 0aMobile desalination 0aReverse osmosis 0aTubular membrane 0aCFD1 aLian, Boyue1 aWang, Yuan1 aTaylor, Robert A.1 aDong, Michelle1 aLloyd, Tracey1 aLiu, Xuefei1 aGentle Bonesc(Musician)1 aAshraf, Md Mahfuz1 aWaghela, Divyang1 aLeslie, Gregory0 tWater research.g2018 Nov. 01, v. 144 p.642-655dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2018.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02920naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245013100207300001600338520135500354592002801709650002801737650002201765650002901787650001501816650002401831650002201855650002001877650002501897650001301922651002601935653001601961653001701977653002301994653002902017653002202046700006402068700003002132700001602162700002302178700002302201700002302224773011002247856008402357852000902441655001202450IND60618088820221122044033.0181029e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061808882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2018.09.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbrams, Jesse1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1937-460610aDoes policy respond to environmental change events? An analysis of Mountain Pine Beetle outbreaks in the Western United States  ap. 102-109.  aUnderstanding how institutions respond in the face of environmental or social shocks is a central concern in the study of the adaptive governance of social-ecological systems. This study attempted to determine whether and how the US Congress responded to epidemics of the native mountain pine beetle (MPB, Dendroctonus ponderosae) in the federal land-dominated intermountain US West, including a ca. 2000–2010 epidemic that far outpaced any prior outbreak on record in terms of area affected. In addition, we categorized the causal narratives represented by MPB legislation and analyzed patterns over time and by political party. We found very limited evidence of specific legislative responses to MPB epidemics; of the 43 MPB-related bills introduced into Congress, only five were passed into law and of these, three had relatively limited scope or application. Our analysis of narratives shows a shift over time from bills that attempted to increase the capacity of government agencies to address MPB impacts toward bills focused on reducing or eliminating procedural and environmental analysis requirements on federal land management agencies and providing new contracting options. Our findings call into question the ability of high-level deliberative bodies to advance institutional reform to address emerging patterns of environmental change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3adisease outbreaks 3aenvironmental assessment 3agovernance 3agovernment agencies 3aissues and policy 3aland management 3alaws and regulations 3apolitics 3aWestern United States 0aLegislation 0aBark beetles 0aForest disturbance 0aInstitutional adaptation 0aPolicy narratives1 aHuber-Stearns, Heidi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0165-356X1 aPalmerin, Marlene Luviano1 aBone, Chris1 aNelson, Michael F.1 aBixler, R.

Here, we developed self-disinfecting materials through the covalent attachment of a porphyrin-based photosensitizer (PS) to nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and paper (Pap), imparting antimicrobial activity to these renewable scaffolds via photodynamically generated singlet oxygen. The facile covalent attachment of the free-base 5-(4-aminophenyl)-10,15,20-tris-(4-N-methylpyridinium)porphyrin (A₃B³⁺) and metallated [5-(4-aminophenyl)-10,15,20-tris-(4-N-methylpyridinium)porphyrinato]zinc(ii) (Zn-A₃B³⁺) photosensitizers was accomplished by aqueous cyanuric chloride coupling, avoiding the use of organic solvents of previous coupling strategies, while preventing PS leaching that is an issue with non-covalent PS incorportation strategies. Materials characterization and the degree of photosensitizer loading were determined by FTIR, elemental and TGA analyses, and UV-Visible Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS). The antimicrobial potencies of the resultant PS-NFC and PS-Pap materials were evaluated against four strains of bacteria recognized by the World Health Organization as either critical or high priority pathogens: Gram-positive strains methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; ATCC-44) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE; ATCC-2320), and Gram-negative strains multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDRAB; ATCC-1605) and NDM-1 positive K. pneumoniae (KP; ATCC-2146). Our results demonstrated broad photodynamic inactivation of all strains studied upon illumination (30 min; 65 ± 5 mW cm⁻²; 400–700 nm) by a minimum of 99.999%. Antiviral studies against two enveloped viruses, dengue-1 (DENV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), revealed complete inactivation by both materials. Taken together, the results demonstrate the potential for photoactive NFC as the basis for sustainable broad spectrum anti-infective materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aVesiculovirus 3aWorld Health Organization 3aantimicrobial properties 3abacteria 3acellulose 3acyanuric chloride 3adisease transmission 3agreen chemistry 3aleaching 3alighting 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amultiple drug resistance 3apaper 3apathogens 3aphotosensitizing agents 3aporphyrins 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asinglet oxygen 3asolvents 3athermogravimetry 3aviruses 3azinc1 aArgyropoulos, Dimitris S.1 aScholle, Francis H.,1 aPeddinti, Bharadwaja S.

Additionally, it is well known that chlorine is a disinfectant largely used in this industry. However, the risk assessment associated with the formation of carcinogenic by-products from this halogenated disinfection has not been widely studied. The aim of this study was to assess the trihalomethanes (THMs) exposure through the consumption of IV gamma products, more specifically, salad mixes, and potential health risk in Portuguese population using a deterministic method. The quantification of THMs in salad mixes from the most representative Portuguese brands was performed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The THMs exposures were estimated by combining the THMs concentration data with a ready-to-eat salad mix consumption survey (case study applied in the Lisboa e Vale do Tejo area; n = 271). The concentration of THMs in all samples was below the limit of quantification of the equipment (1 μg/L), and this limit was used for the evaluation of the exposure. It was found that it is very small for the consumption pattern of these products in the studied population categories, suggesting that there is no risk for consumers due to the halogenated disinfection process. The highest estimated daily exposure was 7,65X10⁻⁵ mg/ kg bw/ week, which corresponds to a person who consumes such products daily.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenicity 3acase studies 3achlorine 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3aequipment 3aindustry 3aready-to-eat foods 3aregional surveys 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asalads 3atoxicology 0aTrihalomethanes 0aFood safety 0aExposure 0aChlorine disinfection 0aReady-to-eat vegetables 0aIV gamma products1 aMendes, Susana1 aMartins, Alice1 aGil, Maria M.0 tToxicology reports.g2020, v. 7 p.288-295dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2020.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01336naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245008200165300001600247520042900263592002800692650002700720650001500747650000900762650001400771650002100785650001400806700002100820700001800841773010600859856004800965852000901013655001201022IND4515817220221122003951.0151006e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451581722DNAL7 a10.1134/S10619348120600812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinina, G.

Ascorbate (AsA) is a highly abundant metabolite and a water-soluble antioxidant, which besides positively influencing various aspects in plants acts also as an enigmatic component of plant defense armory. As a significant component of the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) pathway, it performs multiple vital functions in plants including growth and development by either directly or indirectly metabolizing ROS and its products. Enzymes such as monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR, EC 1.6.5.4) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR, EC 1.8.5.1) maintain the reduced form of AsA pool besides metabolically controlling the ratio of AsA with its oxidized form (dehydroascorbate, DHA). Ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) utilizes the reduced AsA pool as the specific electron donor during ROS metabolism. Thus, AsA, its redox couple (AsA/DHA), and related enzymes (MDHAR, DHAR, and APX) cumulatively form an AsA redox system to efficiently protect plants particularly against potential anomalies caused by ROS and its products. Here we present a critical assessment of the recent research reports available on metal/metalloid-accrued modulation of reduced AsA pool, AsA/DHA redox couple and AsA-related major enzymes, and the cumulative significance of these antioxidant system components in plant metal/metalloid stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant growth 3ametabolism 3ametalloids 3amonodehydroascorbate reductase (NADH) 3agrowth and development 3aascorbate peroxidase 3areactive oxygen species 3aglutathione dehydrogenase (ascorbate) 3ametabolites 3astress tolerance 0aantioxidants1 aGill, Sarvajeet S.1 aGill, Ritu1 aHasanuzzaman, Mirza1 aDuarte, Armando C.1 aPereira, Eduarda1 aAḥmad, Iqbāl,1 aTuteja, Renu1 aTuteja, Narendra0 tProtoplasma.g2014 Nov., v. 251, no. 6 p.1265-1283dSpringer-Verlagx0033-183X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00709-014-0636-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001500135245007800150300001600228500001500244520146600259592002801725650001701753650001601770650002201786650003001808650001501838650001801853650002701871650001701898650001301915651001301928651001701941653002001958700001601978700001801994700002002012700002102032773011402053856007102167852000902238655001202247IND4363134620221119182754.0160328e20040401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436313462DNAL7 a10.4141/P02-1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMay, W.

Little information exists on the best management practices for producing high-quality, high-yielding oat using direct seeding systems and cropping practices developed and adopted over the past 15 yr. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of early seeding on grain yield and quality of oat cultivars currently grown in the eastern prairie region. Four seeding dates and four cultivars were tested at Indian Head, Melfort, and Brandon over 3 yr. Moving the seeding date from mid-June to early May increased oat yield, seeds per panicle, kernel weight, test weight and plump seed by 76, 33, 10, 13 and 11%, respectively, when averaged across all locations and years. This increase in yield and quality was probably due to improved environmental conditions and a reduction in crown rust infection (Puccina coronata Corda). Crown rust has a larger effect on seed yield and quality as one moves east and south from Melfort, Saskatchewan, and as seeding was delayed from early May. Early seeding of oat decreases the risk of obtaining low yield and/or quality, and should be considered a best management practice for growing milling oats, especially in the southeastern prairies of Canada.

How genetically independent the regulation of these transitions is can influence the expression of life cycles. This study tested whether genes in the autonomous flowering-time pathway pleiotropically regulate flowering time and seed germination in the genetic model Arabidopsis thaliana, and tested whether the interactions among those genes are concordant between flowering and germination stages. Several autonomous-pathway genes promote flowering and impede germination. Moreover, the interactions among those genes were highly concordant between the regulation of flowering and germination. Despite some degree of functional divergence between the regulation of flowering and germination by autonomous-pathway genes, the autonomous pathway is highly functionally conserved across life stages. Therefore, genes in the autonomous flowering-time pathway are likely to contribute to genetic correlations between flowering and seed germination, possibly contributing to the winter-annual life history.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSF-IOS-11-46383cNational Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/5011000089820 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aflowering date 3agenes 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic models 3alife history 3aseed germination 0aArabidopsis 0athaliana 0aautonomous pathway 0aflowering time 0agenetic pathway 0agermination 0aphenotypic plasticity 0apleiotropy1 aBlair, Logan K1 aKarediya, Aleena1 aDonohue, Kathleen0 tAnnals of botany.g2018 Jan. 25, v. 121, no. 1 p.183-191dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44715x1095-82907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcx1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02886naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245009200154300001600246520184300262592002802105650002002133650001102153650002102164650001602185650001602201650001802217650001402235650002202249651001102271651001402282700001802296700001602314773011402330856007102444852000902515655001202524IND4363135420221119182918.0160328e20040401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436313542DNAL7 a10.4141/P02-1542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaynter, B. H.10aLeaf development in two-row spring barley under long-day and short-day field conditions  ap. 477-486.  aTo gain an understanding of the adaptation of Australian and Canadian barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars to the environments of western Canada and Western Australia, phyllochron and number of leaves on the mainstem in eight cultivars of two-row, spring barley were examined when sown at two dates in two locations. The locations were a short-day environment at Northam, Western Australia, Australia in 1997 and a long-day environment at Lacombe, Alberta, Canada in 1998. At each location highly significant relationships between leaf number on the mainstem and thermal time were found (r² > 0.94). Using linear estimates, the phyllochron of barley under short days was longer than under long days and was correlated to time to awn emergence. Later sowing shortened phyllochron under short days, but generally not under long days. Error messages from the linear regression analysis suggested that residuals were not random for all cultivars. Bilinear models were fitted to those datasets. Bilineal responses were observed under both short and long days, being independent of cultivar, date of seeding, final leaf number, phenological development pattern and time to awn emergence. The occurrence of a bilinear response was also independent of any ontogenetic events. The change in phyllochron occurred between leaves 4–7 at Northam and between leaves 6–9 at Lacombe. The leaf number at which the phyllochron change occurred was positively related to final leaf number and time to awn emergence. The phyllochron of early forming leaves was positively related to time to awn emergence and shorter than later forming leaves. Leaf emergence patterns in spring barley under both long-day and short-day conditions may therefore be linear or bilinear.

Extensive crosses within and among three lineages of wild tomatoes (Solanum section Lycopersicon) were performed to address the incidence, developmental timing and histological manifestations of hybrid seed failure. These lineages encompass different, yet fairly recent, divergence times and both allopatric and partially sympatric pairs. Mature seeds were scored visually 2 months after hand pollinations, and viable-looking seeds were assessed for germination success. Using histological sections from early-developing seeds from a sub-set of crosses, the growth of three major seed compartments (endosperm, embryo and seed coat) was measured at critical developmental stages up to 21 d after pollination, with a focus on the timing and histological manifestations of endosperm misdevelopment in abortive hybrid seeds. For two of three interspecific combinations including the most closely related pair that was also studied histologically, almost all mature seeds appeared ‘flat’ and proved inviable; histological analyses revealed impaired endosperm proliferation at early globular embryo stages, concomitant with embryo arrest and seed abortion in both cross directions. The third interspecific combination yielded a mixture of flat, inviable and plump, viable seeds; many of the latter germinated and exhibited near-normal juvenile phenotypes or, in some instances, hybrid necrosis and impaired growth. The overall results suggest that near-complete hybrid seed failure can evolve fairly rapidly and without apparent divergence in reproductive phenology/biology. While the evidence accrued here is largely circumstantial, early-acting disruptions of normal endosperm development are most probably the common cause of seed failure regardless of the type of endosperm (nuclear or cellular).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asympatry 3atomatoes 3agermination 3ahybrids 3aphenotype 3ahistology 3anecrosis 3aphenology 3aallopatry 3aseed development 3acrossing 3aendosperm 3aseed abortion 3aSolanum 3aseed coat 3apollination 3ajuveniles 0aSolanum chilense 0aSolanum peruvianum (wild tomato) 0ahybrid necrosis 0aseeds 0aSolanum arcanum ‘marañón’ 0ahybrid seed failure 0apost-zygotic isolation1 aFlorez-Rueda, Ana M1 aGriesser, Stephan1 aParis, Margot1 aStadler, Thomas,0 tAnnals of botany.g2018 Jan. 25, v. 121, no. 1 p.107-118dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44715x1095-82907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcx1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02066naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245006700169300001800236520097500254592002801229650001501257650001301272650001701285650001501302650000901317650001701326650001501343650002601358650001301384650000901397650002601406700001901432700001701451700002101468773009701489856008501586852000901671655001201680IND60087979620221121122614.0141102e20121001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008797962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.06.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Ming-Wei10aPhotocrosslinkable gellan gum film as an anti-adhesion barrier  ap. 1132-1138.  aThe purpose of this study was to develop a gellan gum-based film which could be photocrosslinked for medical applications. Gellan gum was grafted with cinnamate to yield the photo crosslinkable polymer (gellan gum-cin). This material had 14.7% of its d-galacturonic residues reacted with cinnamate groups and displayed maximum absorption at 254nm. Investigation of the photochemical properties showed that the crosslinking efficiency was 82% after 16min of UV irradiation. The anti-adhesion films prepared from gellan gum-cin polymers exhibited high gel contents (88±2%) and suitable mechanical properties. When implanted into rats, the gellan gum-cin film exhibited the most promising anti-adhesion potential in 2 out of 10 rats without forming any tissue adhesion. Furthermore, the gellan gum-cin film could effectively inhibit inflammation in rats based on the results of fluid leukocyte analyses. The gellan gum-cin film thus has potential in clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aadhesion 3acrosslinking 3agellan gum 3agels 3ainflammation 3aleukocytes 3amechanical properties 3apolymers 3arats 3aultraviolet radiation1 aTsai, Hui-Fang1 aWen, Shu-Min1 aWong, Catherine,0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2012 Oct. 1, v. 90, no. 2 p.1132-1138dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2012.06.0643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03829naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245015800156300001800314520215300332592002802485650002302513650001502536650001302551650001302564650002302577650001202600650001102612650001302623650001502636650001402651650000902665650001002674650001202684650001402696650001202710650001602722650002802738650001102766650001502777650001402792650001802806650001402824650001102838650001502849700001702864700001702881700001402898700001802912700001602930700001302946700001302959700001502972700001402987773013103001856007403132852000903206655001203215IND60639833520221119144544.0190503e20161208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063983352DNAL7 a10.1039/c6em00547k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlanoca, L.10aSynergistic effects of mining and urban effluents on the level and distribution of methylmercury in a shallow aquatic ecosystem of the Bolivian Altiplano  ap. 1550-1560.  aLake Uru Uru (3686 m a.s.l.) located in the Bolivian Altiplano region receives both mining effluents and urban wastewater discharges originating from the surrounding local cities which are under rapid development. We followed the spatiotemporal distribution of different mercury (Hg) compounds and other metal(oid)s (e.g., Fe, Mn, Sb, Ti and W) in both water and sediments during the wet and dry seasons along a north-south transect of this shallow lake system. Along the transect, the highest Hg and metal(oid) concentrations in both water and sediments were found downstream of the confluences with mining effluents. Although a dilution effect was found for major elements during the wet season, mean Hg and metal(oid) concentrations did not significantly differ from the dry season due to the increase in acid mine drainage (AMD) inputs into the lake from upstream mining areas. In particular, high filtered (<0.45 μm) mono-methylmercury (MMHg) concentrations (0.69 ± 0.47 ng L⁻¹) were measured in surface water representing 49 ± 11% of the total filtered Hg concentrations (THgF) for both seasons. Enhanced MMHg lability in relation with the water alkalinity, coupled with abundant organic ligands and colloids (especially for downstream mining effluents), are likely factors favoring Hg methylation and MMHg preservation while inhibiting MMHg photodegradation. Lake sediments were identified as the major source of MMHg for the shallow water column. During the dry season, diffusive fluxes were estimated to be 227 ng m⁻² d⁻¹ for MMHg. This contribution was found to be negligible during the wet season due to a probable shift of the redox front downwards in the sediments. During the wet season, the results obtained suggest that various sources such as mining effluents and benthic or macrophytic biofilms significantly contribute to MMHg inputs in the water column. This work demonstrates the seasonally dependent synergistic effect of AMD and urban effluents on the shallow, productive and evaporative high altitude lake ecosystems which promotes the formation of natural organometallic toxins such as MMHg in the water column.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid mine drainage 3aalkalinity 3aaltitude 3aantimony 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abiofilm 3acities 3acolloids 3adry season 3aeffluents 3airon 3alakes 3aligands 3amanganese 3amercury 3amethylation 3amethylmercury compounds 3amining 3aphotolysis 3asediments 3asurface water 3asynergism 3atoxins 3awet season1 aGuédron, S.1 aAmouroux, D.1 aAudry, S.1 aMonperrus, M.1 aTessier, E.1 aGoix, S.1 aAcha, D.1 aSeyler, P.1 aPoint, D.0 tEnvironmental science.g2016 Dec. 8, v. 18, no. 12 p.1550-1560dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6em00547k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016300167300001600330520129600346592002801642650001401670650001401684650001401698650001301712650001501725650002201740650001301762650001201775650001701787653001001804653002401814653001301838653001401851653001801865700002201883700001901905773012301924856008202047852000902129655001202138IND60618089420221123044410.0190412e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061808942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.asd.2018.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYahata, Kensuke10aMorphological study of the ovary in Hanseniella caldaria (Myriapoda; Symphyla): The position of oocyte-growth and evolution of ovarian structure in Arthropoda  ap. 655-661.  aIn Arthropoda, the ovary is classified into Chelicerata-type and Mandibulata-type, based on the oocyte-growth position within the ovary. By contrast, oocytes of Diplopoda and Chilopoda grow within the hemocoelic space. However, as the position of oocyte-growth in Symphyla and Pauropoda has not been confirmed, whether the hemocoelic nature of oocyte-growth is common among myriapods remains ambiguous. This study described the ovarian structure of Hanseniella caldaria to reveal the oocyte-growth position in Symphyla. The oocyte is surrounded by the follicle epithelium, and the inner surface of the follicle epithelium, i.e., the space between follicle cells and oocytes, is lined with a basement membrane. The follicle epithelial layer continues to the ovarian epithelium via the follicle extension with a continuous layer of basement membrane. Data on the architecture of the follicle suggest that the follicle pouch opens to the hemocoel. Hence, the oocyte of H. caldaria grows within the hemocoelic space. Based on our findings in H. caldaria and previous studies in a millipede and in centipedes, the hemocoelic nature of oocyte-growth is considered as a common feature among myriapods and a synapomorphy of the Myriapoda for which morphological synapomorphies have been ambiguous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChilopoda 3aDiplopoda 3aPauropoda 3aSymphyla 3aarthropods 3abasement membrane 3ahemocoel 3aoocytes 3asynapomorphy 0aOvary 0aFollicle epithelium 0aSymphyla 0aMyriapoda 0aOocyte-growth1 aChikami, Yasuhiko1 aUmetani, Erika0 tArthropod structure & development.g2018 Nov., v. 47, no. 6 p.655-661dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl67358x1467-80397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asd.2018.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00876naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245005400133300001600187520015000203592002800353650000900381650001100390650002000401650002000421650000900441650001500450700002000465773010400485852000900589655001200598IND60612383420221120233611.0180905e199707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061238342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRAINEY, CHARLENE10aNuts—Nutrition and Health Benefits of Daily Use  ap. 157-163.  aThis article about the nutritive value and uses of nuts is part of a series on fruits, vegetables, and nuts and their place in the American diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiet 3afruits 3ahuman nutrition 3anutritive value 3anuts 3avegetables1 aNYQUIST, LESLIE0 tNutrition today.g1997 , v. 32, no. 4 p.157-163dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:13904x1538-98397nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02246naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245008500186300001800271520080600289592002801095650001501123650001201138650001501150650001901165650000901184650001801193650000701211650002301218650001301241650001501254650002301269650003001292650004201322650002301364653001301387653001501400653004201415653000701457700002201464700002501486700002801511700002201539773013101561856005101692852000901743655001201752IND50076449120221118015406.0140410e20130824xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007644912DNAL7 a236471182pmid7 a10.1080/10934529.2013.7769162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Junfeng10aAdsorption of AsIII, AsV and dimethylarsinic acid onto synthesized lepidocrocite  ap. 1272-1279.  aThe trapping of arsenic by zero valent iron is strongly dependant on iron by-products.

Langmuir model was used to simulate As adsorption isotherms. Our results showed that lepidocrocite offers high adsorption capacities: up to 0,25, 0,41 and 1 mol for Asⱽ, DMA and Asᴵᴵᴵ could be respectively trapped per kilogram of zero-valent iron. pH influence varied from one arsenic species to another: increasing pH improve Asᴵᴵᴵ and DMA sorption whereas it has a very low effect on Asⱽ sorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aarsenic 3abyproducts 3acacodylic acid 3airon 3alepidocrocite 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atrapping 2aAdsorption 2aArsenicxchemistry 2aCacodylic Acidxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aWater Purification 0aSorption 0airon oxide 0ainorganic and organic arsenic species 0apH1 aSimon, Stéphane,1 aDeluchat, Véronique1 aDictor, Marie-Christine1 aDagot, Christophe0 tJournal of environmental science and health.g2013 Aug. 24, v. 48, no. 10 p.1272-1279dTaylor & Francis Groupx1532-41177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10934529.2013.776916  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245008300181300001600264520175600280592002802036650001602064650002002080650001702100650002202117650002002139650002602159650002002185650001002205650001402215650001702229650002302246650002402269650002302293650002202316650001502338650001802353650000902371650002002380650001102400650001802411651001002429653002402439653002702463653002302490653003502513653001002548773009602558856008902654852000902743655001202752IND60589412620221118090813.0180222e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058941262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou-El-Naga, Iman F.10aTowards elimination of schistosomiasis after 5000 years of endemicity in Egypt  ap. 112-121.  aSchistosomiasis is a snail-transmitted infectious disease caused by a long lasting infection with a blood fluke of the genus Schistosoma. S. haematobium and S. mansoni are the species endemic in Egypt. The country has been plagued and seriously suffered from schistosomiasis over the past 5000 years. Great strides had been done in controlling the disease since 1922. The history, epidemiology and the different control approaches were reviewed. Currently, Egypt is preparing towards schistosomiasis elimination by 2020. The new strategy depends on four main axes; large scale treatment in all areas of residual transmission by targeting entire populations with PZQ, intensified snail control, heath education and behavioral changes and expansion of the complementary public health interventions. While on the road towards elimination, we addressed here the important challenges, lessons and the key issues from the different control strategies to help the achievement of our goal. Notably, frangibility of the drug based control, emergence of resistance against PZQ, persistence of some hot spots areas, the need of further control efforts to the high risk individuals and community involvement in the control programs, reconsideration of diagnostic tests used in surveillance, and continous monitoring of the field to detect changes in the snail intermediate host. Importantly, the adaptation between the parasite and its intermediate snail host throughout water bodies in Egypt merits attention as Schistosoma infection can be introduced to the new reclaimed areas. This review may help supplying information for the policy makers to tailor control measures suitable to the local context that could help in the transfer from control to elimination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma 3abehavior change 3ablood flukes 3acommunity service 3acontrol methods 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease control 3adrugs 3aeducation 3aepidemiology 3aindigenous species 3ainfectious diseases 3aintermediate hosts 3aissues and policy 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3arisk 3aschistosomiasis 3asnails 3asurface water 3aEgypt 0aSchistosoma mansoni 0aSchistosoma hematobium 0aControl strategies 0aElimination of schistosomiasis 0aEgypt0 tActa tropica.g2018 May, v. 181 p.112-121dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245008300156300001800239520083900257592002801096650001501124650002201139650002101161650001801182650002301200650002301223650001501246653000901261653000801270653001801278653002201296653001201318653001801330700001401348700001701362700001701379700001901396700001701415700003001432700002301462700001801485700001501503700002501518773012301543856007501666852000901741655001201750IND60527380620170718000000.0160715e20120328xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052738062DNAL7 a10.1021/am201424d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, Ka Kan10aEffect of ZnO Nanoparticle Properties on Dye-Sensitized Solar Cell Performance  ap. 1254-1261.  aWe have investigated the effect of ZnO nanoparticle properties on the dye-sensitized solar cell performance.

The field of plant‐soil feedback (PSF) research has become an integral subdiscipline of terrestrial ecosystem ecology, and in recent decades has rapidly evolved by deepening and broadening its scope. We review the major developments in the field, discuss methodological considerations and present a way forward for new approaches to PSF research that will lead to a more generalized and predictive understanding of PSFs. We illustrate that the field of PSF research has pursued multiple dimensions, including temporal scales, biogeographic perspectives, environmental context and the level of biological resolution. Plant‐soil feedbacks have been related to successional species turnover, but our inferences are often constrained by experimental time‐scales, and anthropogenic impacts can alter or disrupt the temporal interactions between plants and soil biota. Plant‐soil feedbacks also have been used to explain spatial patterns of plant recruitment, coexistence and diversity, and have increasingly been linked to the patterns of spread and abundance of non‐native and invasive plants. In recent years, more consideration also has been given to the sensitivity of PSF to environmental context, in particularly to gradients of resource availability and changing climatic conditions (including extreme events). Here, of particular interest are the differential responses of mutualistic and antagonistic soil biota. How plants interact with different groups of soil biota has further been predicted from species' phylogenetic relatedness and increasingly also from plant chemical and morphological shoot, root and litter traits. Synthesis. In moving the field forward, future PSF research should take a multidimensional approach by explicitly considering cross‐connections between dimensions, including, for example, spatio‐temporal variation in resource availability, and trait–environment relationships across taxonomic and functional groups of plants and soil organisms. This forward movement will be accelerated by further methodological advances utilizing new types of experiments in the laboratory and in the field, as well as establishing global collaborative networks.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015‐04214cVetenskapsrådet  a2016‐03819cVetenskapsrådet  a864287cH2020 European Research Council  a2017‐00364cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas 3acommunity structure 3ageographical distribution 3aphylogeny 3apopulation distribution 3asoil 3asoil biota 3asoil-plant interactions 3aspecies recruitment 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aKardol, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7065-34350 tjournal of ecology.g2021 Oct., v. 109, no. 10 p.3446-3465dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.136793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245012000159300001800279520092100297592002801218650002201246650001401268650002701282650001701309650001301326650001201339650001901351650001301370650001301383650002101396650001101417650001901428650002301447650001601470700001201486700001501498700001501513700005601528773017001584856008001754852000901834655001201843IND60630812520221121220931.0190214e20190116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063081252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b038422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRan, Ran10aEsterification of Methacrylic Acid with Methanol: Process Optimization, Kinetic Modeling, and Reactive Distillation  ap. 2135-2145.  aThe esterification of methacrylic acid with methanol catalyzed by NKC-9 resin (a cation-exchange resin with sulfonate groups) was conducted in a stainless stirred batch reactor.

A kinetic model based on the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism was developed in which methacrylic acid and methanol were considered to be uniformly adsorbed on the surface of catalysts. Model parameters, including reaction equilibrium constants, activation energy, enthalpy change, entropy change, and rate constants, were solved. The accuracy of the model was validated by means of both experimental proofs and standard deviation between the predicted and experimental data.

As a chemotherapeutic drug for NSCLC, docetaxel (DTX) can synergize with PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors but increase haematoxicity and neurotoxicity. Herein, anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-conjugated and docetaxel-loaded multifunctional lipid-shelled microbubbles (PDMs), which were designed with biologically safe phospholipids to produce synergistic antitumour effects, reduced the incidence of side effects and promoted therapeutic effects under ultrasound (US) irradiation. The PDMs were prepared by the acoustic-vibration method and then conjugated with an anti-PD-L1 mAb. The material features of the microbubbles and their cytotoxic effects, cellular apoptosis and cell cycle inhibition were studied. A subcutaneous tumour model was established to test the drug concentration-dependent and antitumour effects of the PDMs combined with US irradiation, and an orthotopic lung tumour model simultaneously confirmed the antitumour effect of this synergistic treatment. The PDMs achieved higher cellular uptake than free DTX, especially when combined with US irradiation. The PDMs combined with US irradiation also induced an increased rate of cellular apoptosis and an elevated G2-M arrest rate in cancer cells, which was positively correlated with PD-L1 expression. An in vivo study showed that synergistic treatment had relatively strong effects on tumour growth inhibition, increased survival time and decreased adverse effect rates. Our study possibly provides a well-controlled design for immunotherapy and chemotherapy and has promising potential for clinical application in NSCLC treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3adrug toxicity 3adrugs 3agrowth retardation 3aimmunotherapy 3ain vivo studies 3airradiation 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3amicrobubbles 3amodels 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aneoplasm cells 3aneurotoxicity 3apatients 3aphospholipids 3asynergism 3atraditional medicine 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics1 aHu, Zhongqian1 aWang, Chao1 aYang, Jian1 aZeng, Chuhui1 aFan, Rui1 aGuo, Jinhe0 tBiomaterials science.g2020 Mar. 3, v. 8, no. 5 p.1418-1430dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9bm01575b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02502naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001200146245016200158300001800320520111900338592002801457650001301485650001401498650002001512650001701532650001301549650001701562650001901579650002201598650001101620650001701631650001301648700001601661700001601677700001501693700001301708700001901721700001601740700005301756773017001809856008001979852000902059655001202068IND60630812620221121220853.0190214e20190117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063081262DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.8b038582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Zhe10aSilicalite-1 Derivational Desilication-Recrystallization to Prepare Hollow Nano-ZSM-5 and Highly Mesoporous Micro-ZSM-5 Catalyst for Methanol to Hydrocarbons  ap. 2146-2158.  aMesoporous ZSM-5 zeolites were directly synthesized by desilication–recrystallization of silicalite-1 with NaAlO₂ as Al source and TPAOH as template. The fabrication mechanism of mesopores was studied based on the different crystal size of silicalite-1 and liquid-to-solid ratio. This revealed that TPA⁺ played a protective role in the controllable desilication while Na⁺ induced the production of mesopores during the recrystallization. When silicalite-1 with a crystal size of 200 nm was treated in a liquid-to-solid ratio of 10 mL/g, hollow structured nano-ZSM-5 with many mesopores (∼23 nm) in the shell was produced and its external surface area reached 121 m² g–¹. In comparison, homogeneous mesopores (∼15 nm) were introduced into the bulk of micro-ZSM-5 under a higher liquid-to-solid ratio of 30 mL/g, providing a maximal external surface area of 171 m² g–¹. The catalytic lifetime reached 192 h in methanol to hydrocarbons reaction at a weight hourly space velocity of 4.7 h–¹, four times greater than that of the micro-ZSM-5 synthesized via the traditional hydrothermal synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acatalysts 3acrystallization 3ahydrocarbons 3amethanol 3aporous media 3aprocess design 3aprotective effect 3asodium 3asurface area 3azeolites1 aFu, Tingjun1 aWang, Yujie1 aShao, Juan1 aMa, Qian1 aZhang, Chunmei1 aCui, Liping1 aLi, Zhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6087-68540 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Jan. 17, v. 58, no. 6 p.2146-2158dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b038583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03768naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245016700165300001600332520248800348592002802836650002502864650001202889650001602901650001202917650001102929650002302940650001902963650001502982650002502997653001403022653001503036653002103051653002403072653002903096700002403125773012703149856008503276852000903361655001203370IND60601491820221122231700.0200607e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060149182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2017.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Quan10aMolecular-level insight of the differences in the diffusion and solubility of penetrants in polypropylene, poly(propylmethylsiloxane) and poly(4-methyl-2-pentyne)  ap. 173-183.  aIn order to design optimal polymer membranes it is important to have a molecular level understanding of penetrant transport in such membranes. As such, molecular dynamics simulation was employed to study the diffusion and solubility of gas molecules in polypropylene (PP), poly(propylmethylsiloxane) (PPMS) and poly (4-methyl-2-pentyne) (PMP). After the structures of PP, PPMS and PMP were established and relaxed, the average amplitudes of the oscillation of the main and branch chains of PP, PPMS and PMP were evaluated with a proposed analysis method; in addition the cavity size distributions of PP, PPMS and PMP were determined. PPMS has the largest average cavity size and accessible cavity fraction for penetrants, followed by PMP and PP, which has the smallest. The logarithm plot of mean-squared displacements (MSDs) versus time for the transport of methane in the three polymers revealed three regimes, namely the ballistic, the subdiffusive and the Fickian diffusive regimes. The ballistic regime of PMP is longer than that of PP and shorter than that of PPMS, because the average cavity size and accessible cavity fraction of PMP are larger than that of PP and smaller than that of PPMS and the penetrants have less space in PP and more space in PPMS to move freely than they do in PMP before they hit any matrix units. Statistical tests showed that the random walk on a fractal (RWF) model was the most appropriate model to explain the subdiffusion phenomena. The subdiffusive regime is induced by the trap of penetrants in cavities before they get the chances to jump from cavities to cavities nearby. Next the diffusivities of methane and n-butane were estimated from the plot of MSDs versus time for the penetrant transport in the Fickian diffusive regime. The diffusivities of penetrants are much smaller in PP than they are in PPMS and PMP and these values are larger in PPMS than they are in PMP. With both unbiased and biased Widom insertion methods, the solubility coefficients K of gas molecules in the polymers were calculated, though biased Widom insertion method has significantly faster calculation speed. PPMS has the largest solubilities of methane and n-butane, followed by PMP and PP, which has the smallest. Though the permeabilities of both methane and n-butane in PPMS are larger than the corresponding values in PMP, the selectivity of n-butane over methane in PPMS is lower than that in PMP. The research results may be employed in membrane design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial membranes 3abutanes 3adiffusivity 3amethane 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apolypropylenes 3asolubility 3astatistical analysis 0aDiffusion 0aSolubility 0aBallistic regime 0aSubdiffusive regime 0aFickian diffusive regime1 aWhiting, William I.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 549 p.173-183dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2017.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245009600151300001800247520178300265592002802048650001402076650002402090650001802114650001902132700001802151773011102169856003902280852000902319655001202328IND4466941320221120235322.0120727e20111115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446694132DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.80922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaltas, I.10aScale invariance and selfâsimilarity in kinematic wave overland flow in space and time  ap. 3659-3665.  aFractals are famous for their selfâsimilar nature at different spatial scales. Similar to fractals, solutions of scale invariant processes are selfâsimilar at different spaceâtime scales. This unique property of scaleâinvariant processes can be utilized to translate the solution of the processes at a much larger or smaller spaceâtime scale (domain) based on the solution calculated on the original spaceâtime scale. This study investigates scale invariance conditions of kinematic wave overland flow process in oneâparameter Lie group of point transformations framework. Scaling (stretching) transformation is one of the oneâparameter Lie group of point transformations and it has a unique importance among the other transformations, as it leads to the scale invariance or scale dependence of a process. Scale invariance of a process yields a selfâsimilar solution at different spaceâtime scales. However, the conditions for the process to be scale invariant usually dictate various relationships between the scaling coefficients of the dependent and independent variables of the process. Therefore, the scale invariance of a process does not assure a selfâsimilar solution at any arbitrary space and time scale. The kinematic wave overland flow process is modelled mathematically as initialâboundary value problem. The conditions to be satisfied by the system of governing equations as well as the initial and boundary conditions of the kinematic wave overland flow process are established in order for the process to be scale invariant. Also, selfâsimilarity of the solution of the kinematic wave overland flow under the established invariance conditions is demonstrated by various numerical example problems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amathematical models 3aoverland flow 3aspace and time1 aKavvas, M.

Here, a comparative study of two process intensification configurations—a coupling reaction and separation in the transesterification route for PGMEA production—is presented. Reactive distillation (RD), despite being technically feasible for the transesterification reaction, poses severe challenges owing to its operational/design limitations. For instance, the homogeneous catalyst sodium methoxide is insoluble in the reaction mixture and deposited on the reactive packing surface of the RD column. An intensified configuration of the side-reactor column (SRC) configuration is analyzed as an alternative to mitigate the operational limitations of RD. An economic evaluation is conducted for both configurations, showing that the SRC configuration can match the performance of an RD column with only a 5% increase in total annual cost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acatalysts 3adistillation 3aeconomic evaluation 3aindustry 3aprocess design 3apropylene glycol 3asemiconductors 3asodium 3asolvents 3atransesterification1 aChaniago, Yus Donald1 aRiaz, Amjad1 aLee, Moonyong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3218-14540 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2019 Jan. 22, v. 58, no. 6 p.2246-2257dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.8b040523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245009100206300001600297500002000313520132400333592002801657596005001685596005001735650000801785650002201793650002401815650001401839650000901853650001701862650001001879650001601889700007001905700006801975700006902043773013202112856007402244852000902318655001202327IND60788598520221120220619.0220815e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078859852DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.141362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonachesi, Norma Estela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8684-328110aEvaluation of DNA fragmentation in dog sperm using the sperm chromatin dispersion test  ap. 893-901.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe study's objective was to adapt the Sperm Chromatin Dispersion (SCD) protocol to evaluate sperm DNA fragmentation and implement a fragmentation control in dogs. Correlation between DNA status and routine sperm parameters was also analysed. To adapt the SCD, two different mercaptoethanol (ME) concentrations were assayed (2.5% and 5%) in fourteen ejaculates from seven dogs and semen incubation with 0.3 M NaOH for 15 min at room temperature was assayed as a control for sperm DNA fragmentation. Data were analysed using a Mann–Whitney test and either Pearson's or Spearman's correlation. The selected ME concentration to use in the SCD test was 5%, as it produced the largest DNA dispersion halo while preserving the core nucleus structure. Four DNA halo patterns were identified as follows: large dispersion halos, medium halos, small halos and nuclei without halos. Semen incubated with NaOH showed 100% sperm without halos (damaged DNA). A significant positive correlation was observed between sperm with fragmented DNA and sperm with coiled tails. Thus, it was possible to adapt the SCD protocol to evaluate dog sperm DNA fragmentation in raw semen without using a commercial kit and establish incubation with NaOH as a DNA fragmentation control. Only coiled tails showed correlation with DNA fragmentation.  aPublisher supplied data  a20720190200004BAcUniversidad de Buenos Aires  a20020190200084BAcUniversidad de Buenos Aires 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aambient temperature 3achromatin 3adogs 3areproduction 3asemen 3aspermatozoa1 aGallelli, María Florencia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3090-60521 aNeild, Deborah Margarita1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4436-81171 aCarretero, María Ignacia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4997-05800 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2022 Aug., v. 57, no. 8 p.893-901dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.141363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02555naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011000160300001600270520160600286592002801892653002501920653002001945653001701965700001901982700001502001700001702016700001702033773011502050856007902165852000902244655001202253IND60555886820221119113535.0161219e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055588682DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2016.21702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yingxi10aSalmonella Infection in Middle-Aged and Older Adults: Incidence and Risk Factors from the 45 and Up Study  ap. 689-694.  aBackground: Salmonella infection is one of the most common foodborne bacterial pathogens, and causes a significant health burden globally. We investigated the incidence and risk factors for notification and hospitalization due to Salmonella infection in older adults.Materials and Methods: We used the 45 and Up Study, a large-scale Australian prospective study of adults aged ≥45 years, with record linkage to multiple databases for the years 2006–2012 to estimate the incidence of notification and hospitalization for Salmonella infection and estimate hazard ratios using Cox regression.Results: Over a total follow-up of 1,120,242 person-years, 333 adults had laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infection and 101 were hospitalized; the notification and hospitalization incidence were 29.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 26.9–33.3) and 9.0 (95% CI: 7.4–10.9) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. The risk of Salmonella infection notification did not differ by age, but risk of hospitalization increased with age. Elderly males had the highest risk of infection-related hospitalization. The risk of notification was higher for those living in rural or remote areas (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.2), those taking proton pump inhibitors (aHR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4–2.4), and those reporting chicken/poultry intake at least seven times per week (aHR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3–7.9).Conclusions: Chicken consumption remains a significant risk factor for Salmonella infection, highlighting the importance of reducing contamination of poultry and improving food safety advice for older people.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSalmonella infection 0ahospitalization 0aolder adults1 aGlass, Kathryn1 aLiu, Bette1 aHope, Kirsty1 aKirk, Martyn0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 13, no. 12 p.689-694dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Ffpd.2016.21703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03910naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245008600198300001800284500002000302520214300322592002802465596005902493596005902552596004502611650001202656650001102668650001202679650001502691650001102706650001902717650001302736650002602749650001902775650001502794650001902809650002002828650001602848650001602864650000902880650001402889650003702903700006502940700005503005700005903060700006203119773012203181856008003303852000903383655001203392IND60753292320221120154226.0211012e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075329232DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.137462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pi,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8654-667710aCarbon allocation to the rhizosphere is affected by drought and nitrogen addition  ap. 3699-3709.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhotosynthetic carbon (C) allocated below‐ground can be shared with mycorrhizal fungi in exchange for nutrients, but also added into soil as rhizodeposits that potentially increases plant nutrient supply by supporting microbial nutrient mineralization from organic matter. How water and nitrogen (N) availability affects plant C allocation to the rhizosphere, including both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) symbionts and rhizodeposits, remains largely unknown. We used a ¹³CO₂ pulse labelling experiment to assess the effects of drought and N addition on below‐ground allocation of C to soils and roots (quantified as excess ¹³C) and tested their relationships with AMF colonization in an Australian grassland. We also examined relationships between AMF and previously reported root respiration and decomposition of rhizodeposits in this study. We found that drought decreased the absolute amount of excess ¹³C allocated to both soils and roots, likely due to less photosynthetic C fixation. In contrast, proportionally more excess ¹³C was allocated to soils but less to root biomass with drought, suggesting that relatively more C was allocated to rhizodeposits and to AMF hyphal growth and extension. However, N addition reversed drought effects on below‐ground C allocation by retaining proportionally more excess ¹³C in roots and less in soils, congruent with higher soil N and phosphorus availability, root biomass and number of root tips compared to drought without N addition. This suggests that the alleviation of nutrient limitation promoted plants to expend relatively more C on root growth and root trait adjustment, but less C on rhizodeposition and mycorrhizal symbiosis. Synthesis. Mycorrhizal colonization related negatively to rhizodeposit decomposition rate but positively to both excess ¹³C in root biomass and root respiration, suggesting a possible trade‐off in C allocation between mycorrhizal symbiosis and rhizodeposition. We conclude that below‐ground C allocation in this grassland can be mediated by mycorrhizal colonization and is strongly affected by water and nutrient availability.  aPublisher supplied data  a31870441cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a32071563cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aDP190102262cAustralian Research Council 3abiomass 3acarbon 3adrought 3agrasslands 3ahyphae 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3arhizodeposition 3arhizosphere 3aroot growth 3asoil 3asymbionts 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aCavagnaro, Timothy R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9922-56771 aJiang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7518-58101 aKeitel, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3101-75291 aDijkstra, Feike A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6191-60180 tjournal of ecology.g2021 Oct., v. 109, no. 10 p.3699-3709dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.137463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011100174300001800285520138600303592002801689650002101717650001501738650001301753650001601766650001301782650001701795650002101812650001901833650001101852653002101863653001601884700002801900700002501928700001701953700002401970773013701994856008702131852000902218655001202227IND60754543320221120104819.0211114e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075454332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.10.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchio, Rejiane R.10aDevelopment of a biosponge based on Luffa cylindrica and crosslinked chitosan for Allura red AC adsorption  ap. 1117-1122.  aA new bioadsorbent from Luffa cylindrica and cross-linked chitosan was proposed in the present study. Luffa was used as a natural support medium for chitosan crosslinked with glutaraldehyde (LCsG) and epichlorohydrin (LCsE). Biosponges were applied to remove Allura red from aqueous solutions. LCsG and LCsE were produced using different concentrations of chitosan (1%, 3% and 5% (m v⁻¹)) and crosslinking agents (0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% (v v⁻¹)). Based on the FT-IR spectra, functional groups characteristic of chitosan crosslinked with glutaraldehyde and epichlorohydrin confirmed the crosslinking. In addition, the biosorbent revealed highly efficient functional groups and morphology with irregularities favorable for adsorption. It was found that the increase in the percentage of glutaraldehyde and epichlorohydrin increased the sample's swelling degree, and the degree of cross-linking was greater than 80% for all LCsG. The results regarding the degree of swelling and degree of crosslinking corroborated with the evaluation of the biosponge's adsorptive potential. The Sips model predicted the equilibrium isotherms, with a maximum adsorption capacity of 89.05 mg g⁻¹ for LCsG and 60.91 mg g⁻¹ for LCsE. The new procedure was successful. Luffa was excellent support for chitosan, resulting in an attractive, low-cost bioadsorbent, preventing renewable sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLuffa aegyptiaca 3aadsorption 3aazo dyes 3abiosorbents 3achitosan 3acrosslinking 3aepichlorohydrins 3aglutaraldehyde 3amodels 0aLuffa cylindrica 0aCrosslinked1 aGonçalves, Janaína O.1 aMallmann, Evandro S.1 aPinto, Diana1 aDotto, Guilherme L.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 192 p.1117-1122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.10.0963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03031naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009100167300001600258520194100274592002802215650002502243650001202268650001402280650000902294650001902303650001602322700002602338700002302364700002602387700002302413700002002436700003002456700002302486773009102509856004802600852000902648655001202657IND4466845520221122031126.0120607e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446684552DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-012-0458-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Vliet, Jasper10aCopenhagen Accord Pledges imply higher costs for staying below 2°C warming : A Letter  ap. 551-561.  aThis study compares emission pathways aimed at limiting temperature increase to 2°C under varying constraints. In a first set of pathways, the timing of emission reductions is such that over the 2010–2100 period, assuming full participation from 2013 onwards, mitigation costs are minimized. In a second set of pathways, we set emissions in 2020 at a level based on the pledges of the Copenhagen Accord. In the ‘Copenhagen Potential’ scenario, climate talks result in satisfying conditions linked by countries to their ‘most ambitious’ proposals. Contrasting, in the ‘Copenhagen Current’ scenario, climate talks fall short of satisfying the conditions to move beyond current unilateral pledges. We include scenarios with and without the availability of bio-energy in combination with carbon capture and storage. We find that for a ‘Copenhagen Potential’ scenario, emissions by 2020 are higher (47 GtCO2eq/yr) than for a least-cost pathway for 2°C (43 GtCO2eq/yr with a 40–46 GtCO2eq/yr literature range). In the ‘Copenhagen Potential’ scenario the 2°C target can still be met with a likely chance, although discounted mitigation costs over 2010–2100 could be 10 to 15 % higher, and up to 60 % in the 2040–2050s, than for least-cost pathways. For the ‘Current Copenhagen’ scenario, maintaining an equally low probability of exceeding 2°C becomes infeasible in our model, implying higher costs due to higher climate risks. We conclude that there is some flexibility in terms of 2020 emissions compared to the optimal pathways but this is limited. The 2020 emission level represents a trade-off between short-term emission reductions and long-term dependence on rapid reductions through specific technologies (like negative emission reductions). Higher 2020 emissions lead to higher overall costs and reduced long-term flexibility, both leading to a higher risk of failing to hold warming below 2°C.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate 3aemissions 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3atemperature1 avan den Berg, Maarten1 aSchaeffer, Michiel1 avan Vuuren, Detlef P.1 aElzen, Michel den,1 aHof, Andries F.1 aMendoza Beltran, Angelica1 aMeinshausen, Malte0 tClimatic change.g2012 July, v. 113, no. 2 p.551-561dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-012-0458-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01770naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245009600178300001200274520059700286592002800883650001800911650001300929650001000942650001200952650001000964650000900974650001600983650001500999650001001014651001301024653001401037653001301051653001601064653001301080700002201093700001701115700002401132773009301156856009001249852000901339655001201348IND60589413120221118093755.0200419e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058941312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYa’cob, Zubaidah12aA new species of Simulium (Simulium) (Diptera: Simuliidae) from Genting Highlands, Malaysia  ap. 1-3.  aSimulium (Simulium) rasuli sp. nov. is described from two females collected by a Malaise trap in Genting Highlands, Peninsular Malaysia.

For a better understanding of the metabolic potential of the strain, whole genome sequencing of Rhodococcus DSSKP-R-001 and annotation of the functional genes were performed. The genomic sketches included a predicted protein-coding gene of approximately 5.4 Mbp with G + C content of 68.72% and 5180. The genome of Rhodococcus strain DSSKP-R-001 consists of three replicons: one chromosome and two plasmids of 5.2, 0.09, and 0.09, respectively. The results showed that there were ten steroid-degrading enzymes distributed in the whole genome of the strain. The existence and expression of estradiol-degrading enzymes were verified by PCR and RTPCR. Finally, comparative genomics was used to compare multiple strains of Rhodococcus. It was found that Rhodococcus DSSKP-R-001 had the highest similarity to Rhodococcus sp. P14 and there were 2070 core genes shared with Rhodococcus sp. P14, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, Rhodococcus opacus B4, and Rhodococcus equi 103S, showing evolutionary homology. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of Rhodococcus DSSKP-R-001 in estradiol-efficient degradation of these assays for Rhodococcus. DSSKP-R-001 in bioremediation and evolution within Rhodococcus has important meaning.  aPublisher supplied data  a20180101083JCcNatural Science Foundation of Jilin Province  a51478096cNational Natural Science Foundation of China0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRhodococcus equi 3aRhodococcus jostii 3aRhodococcus opacus 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3achromosomes 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aevolution 3agenes 3agenomics 3aplasmids 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis1 aTian, Kejian1 aQiu, Qing1 aWang, Yu1 aZhang, Hongyan1 aMa, Shuang1 aJin, Shenbao1 aHuo, Hongliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1022-82310 tInternational Journal of Genomics.g2018 Oct. 28, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:26808x2314-43787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/35054283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245010200204300001800306500002000324520171400344592002802058596003202086596005502118650001602173650001502189650001802204650001302222650002402235700002302259773013202282856007702414852000902491655001202500IND60789893420221118105222.0220822e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078989342DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JB0160532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrench, Melodie E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1466-614010aLocalized Slip and Associated Fluidized Structures Record Seismic Slip in Clay‐Rich Fault Gouge  ap. 8568-8588.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFault rocks can weaken dramatically with increasing slip rate, which results in localization of slip and earthquakes. Exhumed fault zones and fault rocks deformed at seismic rates in the laboratory both show that deformation can become extremely localized to zones less than or equal to millimeters thick. However, localization can occur during aseismic slip, so evidence of localization cannot necessarily be interpreted as having occurred coseismically. Dynamic weakening that occurs during earthquakes is the result of processes that are unique to seismic slip rates, and previous results from carbonates show that these processes produce unique microstructures. We evaluate whether coseismic deformation at low normal stress produces unique structures within the localized slip zones and adjacent gouge that develop in clay‐rich gouge from the Central Deforming Zone of the San Andreas fault. We measured the thickness and orientations of localized slip zones and their internal lamina, particle orientations, and particle size distributions of gouge sheared from 0.35 to 1.3 m/s velocity, up to 25‐m displacement, and 1‐MPa normal stress, under water‐wet and room‐dry conditions. We find that the thicknesses of localized slip zones and their internal laminae are consistent with numerical formulations for thermal pressurization in wet gouge and both thermal decomposition and cataclastic deformation in dry gouge. Localized zones form coincident with a zone of fluidized gouge that accommodates at most 10% of the shear strain. We conclude that the combined occurrence of foliated localized shear zones with a zone of fluidized gouge may provide a record of seismicity in clay‐rich gouges.  aPublisher supplied data  aEAR-0643339cNSF Earthscope  aEAR-0529922cSouthern California Earthquake Center 3adeformation 3ageophysics 3aparticle size 3aresearch 3athermal degradation1 aChester, Judith S.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Oct., v. 123, no. 10 p.8568-8588dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JB0160533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03642naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245013100209300001100340520217600351592002802527596015502555650000902710650001602719650002702735650001802762650001002780650001402790650002502804650000902829650001502838650001602853650001102869650001202880650001002892650001202902650001302914651001002927700002902937700002902966773010902995856008303104852000903187655001203196IND60771996220221118063245.0220924e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077199622DNAL7 a10.1186/s13570-021-00212-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGai, Abraham Biar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3451-671310aImpact of resettlement on livestock production and performance among the Maasai pastoralists of RAPland village, Olkaria Kenya  ap. 15.  aDisplacements from developmental-related projects such as dams, conservancies, and geothermals displace 15–20 million people annually, necessitating the relocation of project-affected persons (PAPs). Most resettlement action plans (RAPs) fail in resettling the PAPs fully, causing loss of livelihoods and impoverishment. In 2014, Kenya Electricity Generating Company Limited (KenGen) displaced 155 Maasai pastoral households to create space for the expansion of existing geothermal electricity generation plants at Olkaria. The PAPs were relocated into a newly created area called RAPland village. The study aimed at answering the question: how did displacement and relocation affect livestock production and performance of the resettled pastoralists. Data on livestock population structures and cattle herd structures and performance (age at first calving, calving interval, lactation length, and milk yields) before and after the relocation were collected by a survey of 105 household heads of the intended census of 155. Data collected were summarised using Excel and analysed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results showed that daily milk yield per cow decreased from a mean of 3.8 ± 0.19 to 2.38 ± 0.19 l, while total livestock populations reduced from 8383 to 3124 tropical livestock units (TLU) after the relocation. The mean livestock holding per household (TLU) before the relocation was 75.7 ± 8.83, 15.5 ± 1.78, 5.83 ± 0.67, 1.46 ± 0.22, and 0.14 ± 0.02; this decreased after the relocation to 26.4 ± 8.3, 4.62 ± 1.7, 2.5 ± 0.63, 0.34 ± 0.21, and 0.3 ± 0.02 for cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and poultry, respectively. Young cattle proportions reduced from 27.6 to 20%, while that of cows increased from 51.7 to 60% after resettlement. Relocation affected livestock production and performances through reduced daily milk yield and livestock populations, thus reducing pastoralists’ resilience for food, nutritional security, and coping with catastrophes. As such, future displacement and resettlement programmes involving pastoral communities should address grazing needs and pastoral resilience to avoid impoverishment.  aPublisher supplied data  aBFS-G-11-00002 and EEM-G-00-04-00013cusaid, feed the future initiative, under the cgiar fund and fund the food security and crisis mitigation ii gran 3acows 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3afood security 3aherds 3alactation 3alivestock production 3amilk 3amilk yield 3apastoralism 3apeople 3apoultry 3asheep 3asurveys 3avillages 3aKenya1 aWahome, Raphael Githaiga1 aBett, Rawlynce Cheruiyot0 tPastoralism.g2022 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.15-15dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2262x2041-71367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13570-021-00212-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245009200177300001800269520169500287592002801982650002002010650002002030650001902050650002002069650001202089650001302101650001502114650002402129650001102153650002202164700001902186700002002205773012102225856008502346852000902431655001202440IND60624747220221117004913.0181206e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062474722DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw3852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreenfield, Daniel L.10aGeneCodeq: quality score compression and improved genotyping using a Bayesian framework  ap. 3124-3132.  aMotivation: The exponential reduction in cost of genome sequencing has resulted in a rapid growth of genomic data. Most of the entropy of short read data lies not in the sequence of read bases themselves but in their Quality Scores—the confidence measurement that each base has been sequenced correctly. Lossless compression methods are now close to their theoretical limits and hence there is a need for lossy methods that further reduce the complexity of these data without impacting downstream analyses. Results: We here propose GeneCodeq, a Bayesian method inspired by coding theory for adjusting quality scores to improve the compressibility of quality scores without adversely impacting genotyping accuracy. Our model leverages a corpus of k-mers to reduce the entropy of the quality scores and thereby the compressibility of these data (in FASTQ or SAM/BAM/CRAM files), resulting in compression ratios that significantly exceeds those of other methods. Our approach can also be combined with existing lossy compression schemes to further reduce entropy and allows the user to specify a reference panel of expected sequence variations to improve the model accuracy. In addition to extensive empirical evaluation, we also derive novel theoretical insights that explain the empirical performance and pitfalls of corpus-based quality score compression schemes in general. Finally, we show that as a positive side effect of compression, the model can lead to improved genotyping accuracy.

The study was performed using the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme immobilised by covalent binding through an array composed of carbon Toray paper as support and a layer of poly(methylene blue)/tetrabutylammonium bromide/Nafion and glutaraldehyde (3D bioanode electrode). The single MMFC was tested in a hybrid microfluidic fuel cell using Pt/C as the cathode. A cell voltage of 1.035V and power density of 3.154mWcm⁻² were observed, which is the highest performance reported to date. The stability and durability were tested through chronoamperometry and polarisation/performance curves obtained at different days, which demonstrated a slow decrease in the power density on day 10 (14%) and day 20 (26%). Additionally, the cell was tested for ethanol oxidation in simulated body fluid (SBF) with ionic composition similar to human blood plasma. Those tests resulted in 0.93V of cell voltage and a power density close to 1.237mWcm⁻². The double cell MMFC (Stack) was tested using serum and human blood enriched with ethanol. The stack operated with blood in a serial connection showed an excellent cell performance (0.716mWcm⁻²), demonstrating the feasibility of employing human blood as energy source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3adurability 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3aethanol 3aethanol fuels 3afuel cells 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahumans 3aimmobilized enzymes 3amethylene blue 3aoxidation 3apaper 0aAlcohol dehydrogenase enzyme 0aStack membraneless enzymatic fuel cells 0aEthanol electro-oxidation 0aSimulated body fluid 0aHuman serum and blood1 aArjona, N.1 aMoreno-Zuria, A.1 aOrtiz-Ortega, E.1 aGuerra-Balcázar, M.1 aLedesma-García, J.1 aArriaga, L.G.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 June 15, v. 92 p.117-124dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002600166245011200192300001600304520148500320592002801805650001901833650001301852650001601865650001101881650000901892650001201901650001901913650001401932650002701946650001201973650001201985650001101997650001602008650001602024650001802040650001702058650001202075650001302087650001002100650001002110650001402120650001502134650001002149650001202159650001502171650001102186650001202197650007802209650002102287650003902308650001302347650005902360650004302419650005202462650006402514650007602578650007502654650003502729650006902764700002502833700002502858773010102883856004802984852000903032655001203041IND50063352220221119154841.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006335222DNAL7 a230862322pmid7 a10.1007/s10265-012-0525-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGavelienė, Virgilija10aEffect of auxin physiological analogues on rapeseed (Brassica napus) cold hardening, seed yield and quality  ap. 283-292.  aThe effect of the auxin physiological analogues analogues 1-[2-chloroethoxycarbonylmethyl]-4-naphthalenesulfonic acid calcium salt (TA-12) and 1-[2-dimethylaminoethoxicarbonylmethyl]naphthalene chlormethylate (TA-14) TA-14 on different winter rapeseed cultivars were studied with regard to their autumnal growth, cold hardening, accumulation of the stress-protective metabolites proline and saccharide in plant organs: apical bud and root collum, winter survival and productivity formation. The test cultivars were the very early ‘Libea’ medium-resistant to wintering, the medium-early ‘Sunday’ resistant to wintering, the medium–early ‘Valesca’ less than medium resistant to wintering, and the early ‘Hornet’ (hybrid) tolerant to stress growth conditions. During the period of cold hardening in natural field conditions, the test compounds TA-12 (2 mM) and TA-14 (4 mM), applied to different winter rapeseed cultivars at the 4th–5th leaf stage, stimulate accumulation proline and saccharides (sucrose and glucose) in the root collum and apical bud tissues, influence plants acclimation to cold, overwintering and productivity formation. Compounds TA-12 and especially TA-14 produced a stable effect on seed and crude fat yield in cvs. ‘Hornet’, ‘Sunday’ and ‘Libea’. The genotypic peculiarities of a cultivar and the meteorological conditions of the plant vegetation period were the factors that mostly determined fatty acid content in seed oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aVespidae 3aacclimation 3aauxins 3abuds 3acalcium 3acold tolerance 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3aglucose 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3anaphthalene 3aoverwintering 3aplant organs 3aproline 3arapeseed 3aroots 3asalts 3aseed oils 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3asucrose 3avegetation 3awinter 2aBiomass 2aBrassica napusxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCold Temperature 2aFatty Acidsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aGenotype 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxagonistsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aNaphthalenesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aNaphthalenesulfonatesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxagonistsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aProlinexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism.1 aNovickienė, Leonida1 aPakalniškytė, Lina0 tJournal of plant research.g2013 Mar., v. 126, no. 2 p.283-292dSpringer-Verlagx0918-94407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10265-012-0525-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02321naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245011600164300001600280520112400296592002801420650001401448650001801462650001901480650001801499650001501517650002101532650001801553653002801571653000901599653001701608653001801625700005801643700001601701700001501717773010801732856008601840852000901926655001201935IND60524471320221122234859.0190318e20160820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052447132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeng, Ye10aTransparent cellulose/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane nanocomposites with enhanced UV-shielding properties  ap. 171-177.  aThe solubility of eight types of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) derivatives in an ionic liquid 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (AmimCl) and the dispersion of POSS in cellulose matrix were examined. Only a special POSS containing both aminophenyl and nitrophenyl groups (POSS-AN, NH2:NO2=2:6) was selected to prepare nanocomposites, because of its good solubility in AmimCl and high stability during the preparation process. POSS-AN nanoparticles were uniformly dispersed in a cellulose matrix with a size of 30–40nm, and so the resultant cellulose/POSS-AN nanocomposite films were transparent. The mechanical properties of the films achieved a maximum tensile strength of 190MPa after addition of 2wt% POSS-AN. Interestingly, all of the cellulose/POSS-AN films exhibited high UV-absorbing capability. For the 15wt% cellulose/POSS-AN film, the transmittance of UVA (315–400nm) and UVB (280–315nm) was only 9.1% and nearly 0, respectively. The UV aging and shielding experiments showed that the transparent cellulose/POSS-AN nanocomposite films possessed anti-UV aging and UV shielding properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aionic liquids 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3asolubility 3atensile strength 3atransmittance 0aCellulose nanocomposite 0aPOSS 0aUV-shielding 0aAnti-UV aging1 aZhang, Jinming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3404-45061 aHe, Jiasong1 aZhang, Jun0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 147 p.171-177dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02165naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003100148245007100179300001600250520089700266592002801163650001501191650001501206650002601221650001901247650001401266650001301280650001001293653001901303653002001322653002401342653001001366653002301376700002001399700001901419700001501438700002801453700002501481700002201506773011101528856008301639852000901722655001201731IND60563287720221121230015.0180831e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056328772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacgregor-Ramiasa, Melanie12aA platform for selective immuno-capture of cancer cells from urine  ap. 373-380.  aUrothelial cancers are amongst the 10 most common types of cancer and represent a major health problem worldwide.

In this work, proofs of concept for a selective cancer cell capture platform are presented with the aim to achieve the first generation of specific urinary tests for the detection of cancer cells in urine specimen. The unique reactivity of plasma deposited polyoxazoline was used to covalently bind cancer specific antibodies in microchannels. Cancer cells dispersed in patient urine were successfully captured with up to 99% selectivity and 100% sensitivity over a wide range of cell concentrations. The streamlined two steps preparation process of the capture platform represents an important advance in medical diagnostics, with broader potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3abiosensors 3adiagnostic techniques 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aurine 0aPolyoxazolines 0aPlasma polymers 0aCancer cell capture 0aUrine 0aDiagnostic devices1 aMcNicholas, Kym1 aOstrikov, Kola1 aLi, Jordan1 aMichael, M.q(Michael),1 aGleadle, Jonathan M.1 aVasilev, Krasimir0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 96 p.373-380dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245008000164300001600244520117300260592002801433650001201461650002201473650002001495650003001515650001601545650000901561650001001570651001701580653001401597653001701611653001901628653001301647653001201660700002101672700002001693773010401713856007801817852000901895655001201904IND60520252920221122002356.0180620e20041001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052025292DNAL7 a10.1515/mamm.2004.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullin, Sarah K.10aSkull size and shape of Dasymys (Rodentia, Muridae) from sub-Saharan Africa  ap. 185-220.  aThree morphological datasets (traditional measurements, dorsal and ventral skull shape coordinates) were used to examine craniometric variation in the water rat Dasymys, a genus found throughout sub-Saharan Africa. This study is the first to examine the entire genus as well as to statistically compare taxa within the genus to the nominate species D. incomtus. Morphological data confirmed that the five species recognised by Musser & Carleton (1993); D. incomtus, D. foxi, D. nudipes, D. montanus and D. rufulus, represent valid morphological species although two of the species do not encompass the geographic areas presently assigned to them. Dasymys rufulus occupies a larger range and D. incomtus a much smaller range than previously suggested with D. rufulus appearing to be part of a species complex. Furthermore, we discerned six additional morphological species resulting from the elevation of four subspecies (D. i. capensis, D. i. griseifrons, D. i. medius and D. i. longipilosus) and the recognition of two new species: D. shortridgei (restricted to the Okavango Delta) and D. robertsii (occurring in the Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces of South Africa).  aPublisher supplied data 3aMuridae 3aanimal morphology 3adata collection 3ageographical distribution 3anew species 3arats 3askull 3aSouth Africa 0aTaxonomy, 0asystematics, 0amorphometrics, 0arodents, 0aAfrica.1 aTaylor, Peter J.1 aPillay, Neville0 tMammalia.g2004 Oct. 01, v. 68, no. 2-3 p.185-220dWalter de GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.2004.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245015900170300001400329500001500343520153500358592002801893650001601921650002901937650001501966650002001981650002702001650001702028650003402045650001102079650000702090650000902097650001502106650001902121650001502140650002102155653001902176653001102195653001902206653002002225653001902245653003802264700001702302700001502319773009702334856009002431852000902521655001202530IND60592249020221119115912.0190318e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059224902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.03.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, J.R.14aThe effects of acute and long-term exposure to CO2 on the respiratory physiology and production performance of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in freshwater  ap. 20-27.  a2019-12-06  aA high-level of free CO2 is a prevalent feature of intensive RAS and chronic exposure is common for most species during the production process. Currently, standard operating procedures, regulations and “safe” levels of CO2 are based on values that do not necessarily represent a point at, up to which, production and fish performance are unaffected. The high solubility of CO2 in water and the large input from fish respiration also means that current practices for the removal of CO2 are often inadequate for the scale of production. High CO2 levels can be addressed by the control of alkalinity, thereby creating a scenario where the majority of CO2 exists as carbonate and bicarbonate. Any acute reduction in pH can shift the equilibrium towards a large and sudden conversion of inorganic carbon to free CO2, which can have a detrimental effect on fish. The current investigations aimed to determine the effects of both; acute increases in dissolved CO2 on the physiological capacity of Atlantic salmon, as well the effects of chronic exposure to different CO2 concentrations on production in freshwater. Results show that acute exposure (up to 40 mg L−1) significantly reduces aerobic capacity and the rate of recovery from stress. They also show that these effects are driven primarily by CO2 exposure, and to a much lesser extent by the associated reduction in pH. Growth and feed conversion experiments during chronic exposure suggest that there is no CO2 concentration where production performance is unaffected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3adissolved carbon dioxide 3afreshwater 3afeed conversion 3arespiratory physiology 3abicarbonates 3astandard operating procedures 3acarbon 3apH 3afish 3aalkalinity 3aacute exposure 3asolubility 3achronic exposure 0acarbon dioxide 0aGrowth 0aCarbon dioxide 0aAtlantic salmon 0aMetabolic rate 0aRecirculating aquaculture systems1 aJohansen, D.1 aSkov, P.V.0 tAquaculture.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 491 p.20-27dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.03.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010300177520178200280592002802062650001502090650001402105650001902119650002302138650001102161650001702172650002002189650001802209650001602227650001102243650001102254650001302265650002202278650001102300650001502311650001702326650001602343650000902359650001502368651000902383653002002392653001502412653001902427653001502446653002102461653002402482700002202506700002802528773011302556856008602669852000902755655001202764IND60689098120221123043139.0200601e20200810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068909812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1216112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMirzamohammadi, Saeed10aLong-term planning of supplying energy for greenhouses using renewable resources under uncertainty  aGlobal climate change and significant population growth highlight the importance of food security through emerging techniques including cultivation in greenhouses. This, in turn, calls for cost effective energy supply approaches to provide the greenhouse conditions appropriate. This study addresses energy supply planning for greenhouse farming with a focus on renewable energies. At first, the optimum exploitation of renewable energy units along with energy storage units is presented in mathematical programming in both modes micro-grid and grid-connected. Then due to uncertainty of the energy received from renewable resources, the scenario-based robust optimization approach is adopted with the purpose of income maximization is in grid-connected mode and minimization of cost in micro-grid mode. Because of significant size of data and calculations, an algorithm is developed and it will be analyzed through sensitivity analysis of parameters on the optimal solution with Makran region in Iran as a case. By comparing the results of different categories of problems in micro-grid mode, it can be seen that the lowest values of the objective function are when the investment cost of CHPs is half the investment cost of solar energy and 4 times the investment cost of batteries. Also in case of simultaneous use of wind and solar equipment in Makran region, the model suggests that wind resources contribute more in energy production than solar resources do. In grid-connected, the results suggest that in the case of equal price of selling to the grid and buying power from it, all of the energy will be consumed in the greenhouse. Also, in cases where the cost of solar and wind power is higher than each other, it would not justify selling energy resource to the grid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abatteries 3aclimate change 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3afarming systems 3afood security 3agreenhouses 3aincome 3amodels 3aplanning 3apopulation growth 3aprices 3apurchasing 3asolar energy 3auncertainty 3awind 3awind power 3aIran 0aEnergy planning 0aGreenhouse 0aGrid-connected 0aMicro-grid 0aRenewable energy 0aRobust optimization1 aJabarzadeh, Armin1 aShahrabi, Mehran Salehi0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 264 p.121611-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1216113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245014000171300001600311520122300327592002801550650001501578650001501593650002101608650002301629650001301652650002001665650001701685650001501702650001501717650002601732650001401758650001801772653002301790653002401813653002501837653001001862653001201872653001801884700002201902700001801924700001901942700002201961700001901983700002402002700002202026700002002048700002402068700002602092773011102118856008302229852000902312655001202321IND60563287820221120211444.0180831e20170615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056328782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2017.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSinibaldi, Alberto10aDetection of soluble ERBB2 in breast cancer cell lysates using a combined label-free/fluorescence platform based on Bloch surface waves  ap. 125-130.  aWe report on the use of one-dimensional photonic crystals to detect clinically relevant concentrations of ERBB2/neu/Her2 in cell lysates. ERBB2 is a pivotal breast cancer biomarker and targetable oncogenic driver associated with aggressive breast cancer subtypes. To quantitate soluble ERBB2, we developed an optical platform that combines label-free and fluorescence detection modes. Such platform makes use of a sandwich assay in which the one-dimensional photonic crystals sustaining Bloch surface waves are tailored with a monoclonal antibody for highly specific biological recognition (BSW biochip). In a second step, a second antibody to ERBB2 quantitatively detects the bound analyte. The strategy of the present approach takes advantage of the combination of label-free and fluorescence techniques, making bio-recognition more robust and sensitive. In the fluorescence operation mode, the platform can attain the limit of detection 0.3ng/mL (1.5pM) for ERBB2 in cell lysates. Such resolution meets the international guidelines and recommendations (15ng/mL) for diagnostic ERBB2 assays that in the future may help to more precisely assign therapies counteracting cancer cell proliferation and metastatic spread.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3acrystals 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3aguidelines 3ametastasis 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aphotonics 3asurface waves 0aOptical biosensors 0aBloch surface waves 0a1D photonic crystals 0aERBB2 0aSK-BR 3 0aBreast cancer1 aSampaoli, Camilla1 aDanz, Norbert1 aMunzert, Peter1 aSibilio, Leonardo1 aSonntag, Frank1 aOcchicone, Agostino1 aFalvo, Elisabetta1 aTremante, Elisa1 aGiacomini, Patrizio1 aMichelotti, Francesco0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2017 June 15, v. 92 p.125-130dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2017.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245014200164300002000306520137500326592002801701650001101729650001301740650001101753650001101764650001401775650001101789650001601800650003701816653001601853653001401869653001801883653002201901653002101923700002501944700002301969700002001992700002502012773012602037856008002163852000902243655001202252IND60528382220221121030654.0160716e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052838222DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b043412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chong-Min10aDirect in Situ TEM Observation of Modification of Oxidation by the Injected Vacancies for Ni–4Al Alloy Using a Microfabricated Nanopost  ap. 17272-17277.  aVacancy injection and selective oxidation of one species in bimetallic alloy at high temperature is a well-known phenomenon. However, detailed understanding of the behavior of the injected vacancies and consequently their effect on oxidation remains elusive. The current research examines the oxidation of high-purity Ni doped with 4.1 at. % Al using in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Experiments are performed on nanoposts fabricated from solution-annealed bulk material that are essentially single crystal samples. Initial oxidation is observed to occur by multisite oxide nucleation, formation of an oxide shell followed by cavity nucleation and growth at the metal/oxide interface. One of the most interesting in situ TEM observations is the formation of a cavity that leads to the faceting of the metal and subsequent oxidation occurring by an atomic ledge migration mechanism on the faceted metal surface. Further, it is directly observed that metal atoms diffuse through the oxide layer to combine with oxygen at the outer surface of the oxide. The present work indicates that injection of vacancies and formation of cavity will lead to a situation where the oxidation rate is essentially controlled by the low surface energy plane of the metal, rather than by the initial terminating plane at the metal surface exposed to the oxidizing environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3aenergy 3anickel 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0ain situ TEM 0aoxidation 0aNi−Al alloy 0avacancy injection 0acavity formation1 aSchreiber, Daniel K.1 aOlszta, Matthew

This poses more challenges for correcting interferograms for atmospheric effects since the spatial‐temporal variations of tropospheric delay may dominate over large scales and completely mask the actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. To overcome this, we have developed a generic interferometric synthetic aperture radar atmospheric correction model whose notable features comprise (i) global coverage, (ii) all‐weather, all‐time useability, (iii) correction maps available in near real time, and (iv) indicators to assess the correction performance and feasibility. The model integrates operational high‐resolution European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data (0.125° grid, 137 vertical levels, and 6‐hr interval) and continuous GPS tropospheric delay estimates (every 5 min) using an iterative tropospheric decomposition model. The model's performance was tested using eight globally distributed Sentinel‐1 interferograms, encompassing both flat and mountainous topographies, midlatitude and near polar regions, and monsoon and oceanic climate systems, achieving a phase standard deviation and displacement root‐mean‐square (RMS) of ~1 cm against GPS over wide regions (250 by 250 km). Indicators describing the model's performance including (i) GPS network and ECMWF cross RMS, (ii) phase versus estimated atmospheric delay correlations, (iii) ECMWF time differences, and (iv) topography variations were developed to provide quality control for subsequent automatic processing and provide insights of the confidence level with which the generated atmospheric correction maps may be applied.  aPublisher supplied data  a201506270155cChina Scholarship Council (CSC)  a32244cEuropean Space Agency (ESA)  acome30001cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  aNE/K010794/1cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  aNE/N012151/1cNatural Environment Research Council (NERC)  cESA‐MOST DRAGON‐4  cLICS and CEDRRIC  cCOMET 3adeformation 3ageophysics 3ainterferometry 3alatitude 3amaritime climate 3amodels 3amonsoon season 3amountains 3aquality control 3aresearch 3astandard deviation 3asynthetic aperture radar 3atectonics 3atopography 3atroposphere1 aLi, Zhenhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8054-74491 aPenna, Nigel T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6719-19781 aCrippa, Paola1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3248-96750 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Oct., v. 123, no. 10 p.9202-9222dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JB0153053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100001500192245011500207300001800322506007600340520105100416592002801467506003701495650002801532650001901560650002201579650001401601650001901615700002001634700001501654700001901669700002001688700002301708773012101731856008501852852000901937655001201946IND60624747620221207085320.0181206e20161015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062474762DNAL7 a10.1093/bioinformatics/btw3902doi7 aPMC50480712pmcid7 a273547012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDao, David10aCellProfiler Analyst: interactive data exploration, analysis and classification of large biological image sets  ap. 3210-3212.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSummary: CellProfiler Analyst allows the exploration and visualization of image-based data, together with the classification of complex biological phenotypes, via an interactive user interface designed for biologists and data scientists.

We document the first occurence of this species from Guyana. A single sub-adult male was collected in lowland tropical rainforest near the headwaters of the Essequibo River. Although smaller in external and cranial size than the two adult females of the type description, our third known specimen represents the basal lineage to the type-series clade, with an average sequence difference of 1.72% based on cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA sequences. However, the degree of morphological and genetic divergence (2.67%) between I. sinnamariensis and its sister taxon I. pagurus is substantially less than the chromosomal differences originally used to distinguish them as two separate species. In contrast, distinctive karyotypes, morphological differences, and higher levels of mtDNA divergence (13.48%) between the other two species recognized, I. negrensis that was recently separated from I. bistriata , suggest an earlier and deeper diversification for these taxa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acytochrome b 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3akaryotyping 3amales 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aorganisms 3arivers 3atropical rain forests 3aFrench Guiana 3aGuyana 0aAmazonia 0acyt b 0aGuyana 0aRodentia 0aphylogeny 0aspecies 0aAmazonie 0acyt b 0aespèce 0aGuyana 0aphylogénie 0aRongeurs1 aEngstrom, Mark D.1 aPatton, John C.1 aBickham, John W.0 tMammalia.g2007 Apr. 3, v. 70, no. 1-2 p.120-125dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100002400151245010100175300001800276520140200294592002801696650001701724650002601741650001101767650001601778700002001794700001701814773010001831856008701931852000902018655001202027IND4475764320221120040013.0150808e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447576432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStokland, Jogeir N.10aSpecies distribution modelling—Effect of design and sample size of pseudo-absence observations  ap. 1800-1809.  aWe explored the effect of varying pseudo-absence data in species distribution modelling using empirical data for four real species and simulated data for two imaginary species. In all analyses we used a fixed study area, a fixed set of environmental predictors and a fixed set of presence observations. Next, we added pseudo-absence data generated by different sampling designs and in different numbers to assess their relative importance for the output from the species distribution model. The sampling design strongly influenced the predictive performance of the models while the number of pseudo-absences had minimal effect on the predictive performance. We attribute much of these results to the relationship between the environmental range of the pseudo-absences (i.e. the extent of the environmental space being considered) and the environmental range of the presence observations (i.e. under which environmental conditions the species occurs). The number of generated pseudo-absences had a direct effect on the predicted probability, which translated to different distribution areas. Pseudo-absence observations that fell within grid cells with presence observations were purposely included in our analyses. We discourage the practice of excluding certain pseudo-absence data because it involves arbitrary assumptions about what are (un)suitable environments for the species being modelled.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3aenvironmental factors 3amodels 3aprobability1 aHalvorsen, Rune1 aStøa, Bente0 tEcological modelling.g2011 June 10, v. 222, no. 11 p.1800-1809dElsevier B.V.x0304-38007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2011.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03135naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245010900214300001600323500001500339520178300354592002802137650001502165650001502180650002002195650002402215650001002239650001202249650002302261650001302284650003002297650001002327650002102337700007702358700007502435700002102510773011502531856008202646852000902728655001202737IND60728173620221117061405.0210218e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072817362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10452-020-09827-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos, Mateus Pereira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3555-404910aResource partitioning and adequacy among ontogenetic groups in a hermit crab and gastropod shell network  ap. 253-264.  agolden set  aIn ecology, interaction networks allow the investigation of how interactions among species affect community structure and functioning. The structure of interaction networks can be nested and/or modular. Ecologically, the nested structure minimizes competition and increases the number of coexisting species, creating high diversity, while the modular structure occurs when there are non-overlapping groups of highly interacting consumer-resource species. Despite the importance of gastropod shells to hermit crabs, currently, few studies explored the structure of hermit crabs communities through a resource-usage perspective. Therefore, network analyses appear as an important tool to unveil how the use of empty shell as a resource rules hermit crabs communities through competition among species and rules hermit crabs populations through competition among distinct ontogenetic groups. This study investigated the resource usage pattern of empty gastropod shells by distinct ontogenetic stages of the hermit crab Calcinus tibicen from two different locations, using a network approach and the “Shell Adequacy Index” (SAI) analysis. The present results show that the interaction network between ontogenetic groups and gastropod shells was non-nested and modular and the SAI reflected the differences between males and ovigerous females in both locations, regarding shell size adequacy. We suggest that the modular structure may be a result of resource partitioning, which, in turn, is favored in habitats with a high degree of heterogeneity. The modular network structure may indicate habitat heterogeneity and resource partitioning. Future studies including other hermit crab species from the same areas should help determine how shells are partitioned interspecifically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGastropoda 3aPaguroidea 3aanimal behavior 3acommunity structure 3acrabs 3afemales 3agender differences 3ahabitats 3aintraspecific competition 3amales 3ashell (molluscs)1 aRodrigues, Gabriel Fellipe Barros1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1679-92701 aNegreiros-Fransozo, Maria Lucia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8070-80891 aFransozo, Vivian0 tAquatic ecology.g2021 Mar., v. 55, no. 1 p.253-264dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870034x1386-25887nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-020-09827-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03962naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001900142245015000161300001800311500002000329520180400349592002802153596009202181596010502273596005902378596005402437650002402491650001502515650001602530650001702546650001602563650001402579650001802593650001302611650001502624650001202639650001202651650002802663650001402691650001302705650001402718651001002732700002402742700005202766700005902818700001402877700005702891700002002948700005902968700002403027700005703051700001803108700001603126773013203142856007703274852000903351655001203360IND60789894120221118105144.0220822e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078989412DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JB0157612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongsheng10aIncremental Emplacement of the Late Jurassic Midcrustal, Lopolith‐Like Qitianling Pluton, South China, Revealed by AMS and Bouguer Gravity Data  ap. 9249-9268.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aModes of magma emplacement may provide key information on geodynamic‐tectonic settings of magmatism, when the threshold of magma volume and duration of emplacement process is crossed, brittle/ductile crustal deformation behavior, and volumes and rates of magma transfer in the crust. The majority of upper‐crustal granitic intrusions are incrementally emplaced as laccoliths or sills, while midcrustal or deeper‐level granitic intrusions appear to be predominantly emplaced as sills or lopoliths, but relatively few examples have been studied. We present a case study on the Jurassic Qitianling pluton from South China, which was constructed in the upper part of the middle crust (at a depth of ~10–15 km). To characterize its emplacement mechanism and evolution, we have combined field and microscopic observations, Anisotropy of Magnetic Susceptibility measurements and Bouguer gravity anomaly modeling. The main findings are (1) the generally undeformed granite‐country rock contacts with a narrow thermal aureole, (2) irregularly wavy and gradational contacts between the main granite facies, (3) dominant subhorizontal magnetic fabrics in the granites with a scattered magnetic foliation, (4) rare occurrence of dykes, and (5) a subcircular surface and lopolith‐like pluton geometry. Accordingly, we suggest that the Qitianling pluton forms an ~25‐km wide and ~5‐km thick lopolith that was incrementally emplaced during a period of tectonic quiescence, most likely by under‐accretion of multiple magma sheets deflected from magma pulses that ascended through pipe‐like channels. The mineralogical and compositional variation of the pluton may be the result of in situ fractionation, fractionation at deeper crustal level, or variation in source‐derived melt compositions.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistére de l’Education Nationale, de l’Enseignement Superieur et de la Recherche  aZZKT‐201603cOpen Fund of State Key Laboratory for Mineral Deposits Research of Nanjing University  a2012CB416701cNational Basic Research Program of China  a2016YFC0600202cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aLate Jurassic epoch 3aanisotropy 3abrittleness 3acase studies 3adeformation 3aevolution 3afractionation 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3agranite 3agravity 3amagnetic susceptibility 3amagnetism 3aresearch 3atectonics 3aChina1 aMartelet, Guillaume1 aWang, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5579-68301 aErdmann, Saskia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1083-92511 aChen, Yan1 aFaure, Michel1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1880-81151 aHuang, Fangfang1 aScaillet, Bruno1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1561-02261 ale‐Breton, Nicole1 aShu, Liangshu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0433-49911 aWang, Rucheng1 aZhu, Jinchu0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Oct., v. 123, no. 10 p.9249-9268dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JB0157613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01050naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245019000167300001200357500002200369520007400391592002800465650001300493650001300506650001200519650001700531650001400548773010800562856008100670852000900751655001200760IND60596608820221119204643.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059660882DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617180300372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPankratov, T.A.10aErratum to: “Bacterial Complexes of Khibiny Mountains Lichens Revealed in Cladonia uncialis, C. portentosa, Alectoria ochroleuca, and Nephroma arcticum” [Microbiology 87, 79 (2018)]  ap. 441.  aPublished Erratum  aIn section ACKNOWLEDGMENTS, project number should read 16-04-00966а.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladonia 3aNephroma 3alichens 3amicrobiology 3amountains0 tMicrobiology.g2018 May, v. 87, no. 3 p.441-441dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl46286x0026-26177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00262617180300373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005200142245012600194300001800320500002000338520133700358592002801695596004801723650001701771650002601788650002401814650001101838650001301849650001501862650001401877650001301891651001201904700005601916700001401972700005901986700001902045700002002064700005702084700001502141700001202156700005702168700001902225773013202244856007702376852000902453655001202462IND60789894220221118105224.0220822e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078989422DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JB0163752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3981-958510aFrom Continental Hyperextension to Seafloor Spreading: New Insights on the Porcupine Basin From Wide‐Angle Seismic Data  ap. 8312-8330.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe deep structure and sedimentary record of rift basins provide an important insight into understanding the geological processes involved in lithospheric extension. We investigate the crustal structure and large‐scale sedimentary architecture of the southern Porcupine Basin, offshore Ireland along three wide‐angle seismic profiles, supplemented by 13 selected seismic reflection profiles. The seismic velocity and crustal geometry models obtained by joint refraction and reflection traveltime inversion clearly image the deep structure of the basin. Our results suggest the presence of three distinct crustal domains along the rifting axis: (a) continental crust becoming progressively hyperextended from north to south through the basin, (b) a transitional zone of uncertain nature, and (c) a 7‐ to 8‐km‐thick zone of oceanic crust. The latter is overlain by an ~8‐km compacted Upper Paleozoic‐Mesozoic succession and ~ 2 km of Cenozoic strata. Due to the lack of clear magnetic anomalies and in the absence of well control, the precise age of interpreted oceanic crust is unknown. However, we can determine an age range of Late Jurassic to Late Cretaceous from the regional context. We propose a northward propagating rifting process in the Porcupine Basin, resulting in variations in strain along the rift axis.  aPublisher supplied data  cIrish Shelf Petroleum Studies Group (ISPSG) 3aCenozoic era 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aLate Jurassic epoch 3abasins 3ageometry 3ageophysics 3amagnetism 3aresearch 3aIreland1 aWatremez, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7350-49451 aPrada, M.1 aMinshull, T.

High ammonium removal efficiency, stable nitrite accumulation rate and total nitrogen removal efficiency was higher than 95.0%, 90.0% and 66.4%, respectively, implying potential application of this process for nitrogen removal of mature landfill leachate. Efficient nitrite accumulation in the first oxic reactor depended on low DO conditions and sufficient alkalinity. However, operational limit was mainly decided by actual hydraulic retention time (AHRT) of the first oxic reactor and appeared with AHRT less than 13.9h under DO of 0.3–0.5mg/L. High-throughput sequencing analysis demonstrated significant change of bacterial diversity in the first oxic reactor after a long-term operation and dominant bacteria genus Nitrosomonas was shown to be responsible for NH4+-N removal and nitrite accumulation under low DO levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aactivated sludge 3aalkalinity 3abacteria 3acost effectiveness 3adenitrification 3adissolved oxygen 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3alandfill leachates 3anitrification 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 0aMature landfill leachate 0aNitrogen removal 0aNitrite pathway 0aLow dissolved oxygen 0aBacterial community analysis1 aWang, Xiaojun1 aYang, YongYuan1 aMirino, Markus W.1 aYuan, Yanlei0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Oct., v. 218 p.580-588dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2016.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143242012100167245011400288300001200402520105600414592002801470650001201498650001401510650002001524650001401544650001201558650002601570650002101596650001701617650001601634650002601650650002401676650001301700653001201713653001401725653001701739653001601756653001701772653001201789653002601801653001501827653001701842653002201859700002201881700002201903700001901925700001901944773009301963856007702056852000902133655001202142IND60520253720221120234516.0160519e20070329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052025372DNAL7 a10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraripe, Luciana O.10aAnalyse comparative des traits d'histoire de vie de deux espèces de Calomys (Rodentia: Sigmodontinae) en captivité10aComparative analysis of life-history traits in two species of C alomys (Rodentia: Sigmodontinae) in captivity  ap. 2-8.  aWe analyzed life-history traits (fertility, growth and rate of postnatal development) in captive-bred colonies of two closely related sympatric species: Calomys expulsus and C. tener (Rodentia, Sigmodontinae). We found significant differences between the species in growth rate and several reproductive traits. C. tener had a smaller litter size and litter mass, smaller proportion of litter mass to maternal mass, lower growth rate and higher infant mortality. We also found an apparent difference in correlation patterns of life history parameters between the two species of Calomys . The strong correlation between body size and fecundity found in other studies of life history traits and in selection experiments seems to be disrupted in C. tener . We found a significant positive correlation between maternal mass and litter size and mass only for C. expulsus, which means that in C. tener the fertility of females does not depend strongly on body mass. We discuss inbreeding depression and stress reactions as possible reasons for these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalomys 3abody size 3acaptive animals 3afecundity 3afemales 3ainbreeding depression 3ainfant mortality 3alife history 3alitter size 3apostnatal development 3areproductive traits 3asympatry 0aCalomys 0afertility 0agrowth curve 0alitter size 0areproduction 0aCalomys 0acourbes de croissance 0afertilité 0areproduction 0ataille de portée1 aAprigliano, Paula1 aOlifiers, Natalie1 aBorodin, Pavel1 aCerqueira, Rui0 tMammalia.g2007 Mar. 29, v. 70, no. 1-2 p.2-8dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03573naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245021300164300001800377520202000395592002802415650003402443650003102477650001102508650001202519650001302531650001002544650004302554650001702597650002202614650000902636653001302645653003302658653002302691653002402714653004002738653002702778700001702805700001302822700001202835700001502847700001202862700001202874700001502886773008502901856008402986852000903070655001203079IND60553249320221123042435.0161021e20140925xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055324932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2014.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Q.L.10aPharmacological investigation of a HPLC/MS standardized three herbal extracts containing formulae (Bu-Shen-Yi-Qi-Tang) on airway inflammation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in asthmatic mice  ap. 1439-1450.  aBu-Shen-Yi-Qi-Tang (BSYQT) which is prescribed on the basis of clinical experience is commonly used in clinic of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for asthma treatment. The components of BSYQT include Radix Astragali (RA), Herba Epimedii (HE) and Radix Rehmanniae (RR). The aim of this study was to screen extracts of BSYQT with best anti-inflammatory activity in asthmatic mice, and separate and identify the chemical compounds in them. Our results suggested that 60% ethanol extract of herbs (H60) and granules (G60) of BSYQT were the two extracts with best anti-inflammatory activity and effects of H60 were a little better than that of G60. High-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC–ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) analysis of the major chemical compounds of H60 and G60 revealed that 56 and 42 peaks were identified separately in H60 and G60. Further analysis revealed that 38 compounds were identified shared by H60 and G60, and 18 compounds were only in H60. There were 25 compounds in HE, 6 compounds in RR and 7 compounds in RA in the 38 compounds shared by G60 and H60. These 38 chemical components were tentatively considered the material basis of the anti-inflammatory activity of G60 and H60. The differences in the amount of the 38 chemical components as well as the 18 chemical components only in H60 were tentatively considered responsible for the activity differences between H60 and G60. In conclusion, these results suggested that extracts of BSYQT had inhibitory effects on airway inflammation in asthmatic mice, and H60 and G60 demonstrated the best anti-inflammatory activity. The 38 chemical compounds shared by H60 and G60 were responsible for their anti-inflammatory activity in asthmatic mice, and the differences in chemical compounds contents and amounts between H60 and G60 were responsible for this activity differences. This work would provide support for further pharmacodynamic material basis study of BSYQT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aasthma 3aethanol 3agranules 3aherbs 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ainflammation 3amass spectrometry 3amice 0aExtracts 0aTraditional Chinese medicine 0aBu-Shen-Yi-Qi-Tang 0aAirway inflammation 0aHypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 0aHPLC–ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS1 aNurahmat, M.1 aLi, M.H.1 aSun, J.1 aChen, M.X.1 aLiu, F.1 aWei, Y.1 aDong, J.C.0 tPhytomedicine.g2014 Sept. 25, v. 21 p.1439-1450dElsevier GmbHx0944-71137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2014.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01898naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245009600157300002000253520075400273592002801027650001501055650001101070650001201081650002201093650001501115650002301130653001401153653003401167653001201201653001401213653002401227700001701251700001501268700001401283773012601297856008001423852000901503655001201512IND60528382720221121041324.0160716e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052838272DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b044212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Jie10aThree-Dimensional Cu2ZnSnS4 Films with Modified Surface for Thin-Film Lithium-Ion Batteries  ap. 17311-17317.  aCu₂ZnSnS₄ (CZTS) is an important material in low-cost thin film solar cells and is also a promising candidate for lithium storage. In this work, a novel three-dimensional CZTS film coated with a lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) film is fabricated for the first time and is applied to thin-film lithium-ion batteries. The modified film exhibits an excellent performance of ∼900 mAh g–¹ (450 μAh cm–² μm–¹), even after 75 cycles. Morphology integrity is still maintained after repeated lithiation/delithiation, and the main reaction mechanism is analyzed in detail. The significant findings from this study indicate the striking advantages of modifying both the surface and structure of alloy-based electrodes for energy storage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3aphosphorus 3aphotovoltaic cells 0aCu2ZnSnS4 0alithium phosphorus oxynitride 0aNi foam 0athin film 0alithium-ion battery1 aGuo, Jianlai1 aLiu, Chang1 aGuo, Hang0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Aug. 12, v. 7, no. 31 p.17311-17317dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b044213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011300157300001800270520137300288592002801661650002801689650001601717650001501733650001501748650001301763650002101776650001101797650002201808700001901830700001801849773012101867856007501988852000902063655001202072IND60558198320170926000000.0161111e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055819832DNAL7 a10.1021/jp30287582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsiao, Ya-Wen14aThe Central Role of Gln63 for the Hydrogen Bonding Network and UV–Visible Spectrum of the AppA BLUF Domain  ap. 8064-8073.  aIn blue-light sensing using flavin (BLUF) domains, the side-chain orientation of key residues close to the flavin chromophore is still under debate. We report quantum refinements of the wild-type AppA BLUF protein from Rhodobacter sphaeroides starting from two published X-ray structures (1YRX and 2IYG) with different arrangements of the residues around the chromophore. Quantum refinement uses the same experimental X-ray raw data as conventional refinement, but includes data from quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations as restraints, which is expected to be more reliable than the normally employed MM data. In addition to quantum refinement, pure QM/MM geometry optimizations are performed for the 1YRX and 2IYG structures and for five models derived therefrom. Vertical excitation energies are computed at the QM(DFT/MRCI)/MM level to assess the resulting structures. The experimental absorption maximum of the dark state of wild-type AppA is well reproduced for structures that contain the Gln63 residue in 1YRX-type orientation. The computed excitation energies are red-shifted for structures with a flipped Gln63 residue in 2IYG-type orientation. The calculated 1YRX- and 2IYG-type hydrogen-bonding networks are discussed in detail, particularly with regard to the orientation of the chromophore and the Gln63, Trp104, and Met106 residues.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodobacter sphaeroides 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3ablue light 3ageometry 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3aquantum mechanics1 aGötze, Jan P.1 aThiel, Walter0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 July 19, v. 116, no. 28 p.8064-8073dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp30287583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245022900169300001800398520144000416592002801856650001901884650002201903650002401925650001801949650001001967650001301977650001901990650002402009650001802033650000902051650000902060650001002069650001202079650002002091650000902111651001002120651002402130653003102154653004102185653004502226653001902271653003302290700001602323700001702339700001902356700001602375700002102391773014602412856008602558852000902644655001202653IND60771997020221117045758.0220330e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077199702DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2022.20433402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Sushil10aTillage based Crop Establishment Methods and Zinc Application Enhances Productivity, Grain Quality, Profitability and Energetics of Direct-Seeded Rice in Potentially Zinc-Deficient Soil in the Subtropical Conditions of India  ap. 1085-1099.  aDirect-seeded rice is becoming an alternative to puddled transplanted rice in Indo-Gangetic Plain due to looming water scarcity and shortage of labor. But poor crop establishment and zinc nutrition hinder realizing its full yield potential. Thus, an experiment on direct-seeded rice allocating three crop establishment methods in main plots and five zinc application treatments in subplots was conducted in a split-plot design with three replicates with the aim to evaluate the effect of crop establishment methods and zinc application on productivity, profitability and energetics. Conventional till-wet direct-seeded rice increased effective tillers by 16.89 and 22.98%, panicle length by 5.33 and 10.48% and panicle weight by 7.83 and 13.41% over conventional till-direct seeded rice and zero till-direct seeded rice, respectively. Furthermore, conventional till-wet direct-seeded rice yielded highest grain and straw yield. Basal application of zinc (6.0 kg ha⁻¹) recorded higher grain (4.70–19.50%), straw (3.22–12.92%) and biological yield (3.82–15.51%) over the rest of the treatments. Besides, basal application of zinc (6.0 kg ha⁻¹) also proved profitable and energy-efficient. Therefore, conventional till-wet direct-seeded rice with the basal application of zinc (6.0 kg ha⁻¹) is suggested to realize higher productivity, profitability and energetics of direct-seeded rice in potentially zinc-deficient soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3adirect seeding 3aenergy efficiency 3aexperimental design 3agrain quality 3alabor 3apanicles 3aplant analysis 3aplant establishment 3aprofitability 3arice 3asoil 3astraw 3atillage 3awater shortages 3azinc 3aIndia 3aIndo-Gangetic Plain 0aCrop establishment methods 0aconventional till-direct seeded rice 0aconventional till-wet direct seeded rice 0aZn application 0azero till-direct seeded rice1 aVerma, S.K.1 aYadav, Ashok1 aTaria, Sukumar1 aAlam, Badre1 aBanjara, Tej Ram0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 May 15, v. 53, no. 9 p.1085-1099dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20433403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245013400157300001800291520206300309592002802372650002302400650002202423650002402445650001502469650001402484650002702498650001202525650001802537650001102555650002302566650001902589650001302608700001902621700001802640773012102658856007502779852000902854655001202863IND60558198420221121183356.0161111e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055819842DNAL7 a10.1021/jp302974x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Rakwoo10aDegree of Polymerization of Glucan Chains Shapes the Structure Fluctuations and Melting Thermodynamics of a Cellulose Microfibril  ap. 8074-8083.  aA Staggered LATtice (SLAT) model is developed for modeling cellulose microfibrils. The simple representation of molecular packing and interactions employed in SLAT allows simulations of structure fluctuations and phase transition of cellulose microfibrils at sufficiently long and large scales for comparison with experiments. Glucan chains in the microfibril are modeled as connected monomers, each corresponding to a cellobiose subunit, and the surrounding space around the cellulose is composed of solvent cells. Interaction parameters of monomer–monomer interactions were parametrized based on the results of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The monomer–solvent interaction was optimized to give a melting temperature of ∼695 K for the 36-glucan chain model cellulose microfibril, which is consistent with the estimation based on experimental data. Monte Carlo simulations of the SLAT model also capture experimentally measured X-ray diffraction patterns of cellulose as a function of temperature, including the region of melting transition, as well as predict the highly flexible regions in the microfibril. Beyond the diameter of ∼3 nm, we found that melting temperature of the cellulose microfibril is not significantly shifted by changing the thickness. On the other hand, a slight decrease in the degree of polymerization of glucan chains is shown to enhance structure fluctuations through the ends of glucan chains, i.e., the defect sites, and thereby significantly reduce the melting temperature. Analysis of the sizes, densities, and lifetimes of defect structures in the microfibril indicates a significant extent of fluctuations on the surfaces even at room temperature and that defect statistics are strong but distinct functions of temperature and solvent quality. The SLAT model is the first of its kind for simulating cellulosic materials, and this work shows that it can be used to incorporate information obtained from atomistic simulations and experimental data to enable the aforementioned findings through computation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3acellobiose 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3amelting 3amelting point 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3apolymerization 3asolvents1 aGross, Adam S.1 aChu, Jhih-Wei0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 July 19, v. 116, no. 28 p.8074-8083dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp302974x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006700142245018600209300001800395500002000413520177700433592002802210596005602238596007802294650001502372650001602387650001302403650001502416650001302431650001402444650001302458650001402471650001502485650001602500651001502516700006502531700005802596700002602654700002602680700006902706773013202775856007702907852000902984655001202993IND60789894720221123002024.0220822e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078989472DNAL7 a10.1029/2017JB0153982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurzawski, Robert Marek1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2377-286610aFrictional Properties of Subduction Input Sediments at an Erosive Convergent Continental Margin and Related Controls on Décollement Slip Modes: The Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project  ap. 8385-8408.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe spectrum of slip modes occurring along shallow portions of the plate boundary décollement in subduction zones includes aseismic slip, slow slip, and seismogenic slip. The factors that control slip modes directly influence the hazard potential of subduction zones for generating large‐magnitude earthquakes and tsunamis. We conducted an experimental study of the frictional behavior of subduction input sediments, recovered from two Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions to the erosive subduction margin offshore Costa Rica (Expeditions 334 and 344), employing rotary shear under hydrothermal conditions. The velocity dependence of friction was explored, using simulated gouges prepared from all major lithologies, covering a wide range of conditions representative for the initial stages of subduction. Temperature, effective normal stress, and pore fluid pressure were varied systematically up to 140 °C, 110 MPa, and 120 MPa, respectively. Sliding velocities up to 100μm/s, relevant for earthquake rupture nucleation and slow slip, were investigated. The only sediment type that produced frictional instabilities (i.e., laboratory earthquakes) was the calcareous ooze carried by the incoming Cocos Plate, which by virtue of its slip‐weakening behavior is also a likely candidate for triggering slow slip events. We evaluate this mechanism of producing unstable slip and consider alternatives. Therefore, locking and unlocking of plate boundary megathrusts are not only related to variations in pore fluid pressure but may also depend on the presence of pelagic carbonate‐rich lithologies. Subduction systems containing such input are likely low latitude, where extensive deposition of carbonates takes place above the carbonate compensation depth.  aPublisher supplied data  aSTI298/7-1,2cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)  a854.12.011cNederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO) 3acarbonates 3aearthquakes 3afriction 3ageophysics 3alatitude 3alithology 3aresearch 3asediments 3asubduction 3atemperature 3aCosta Rica1 aNiemeijer, André Rik1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3983-93081 aStipp, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7468-13261 aCharpentier, Delphine1 aBehrmann, Jan Hinrich1 aSpiers, Christopher James1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3436-89410 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Oct., v. 123, no. 10 p.8385-8408dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017JB0153983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009900167300001800266520150600284536022001790592002802010596002102038596001202059650002202071650001102093650001602104650002302120650002202143650002502165650001802190650002102208650002502229650001102254650002002265650001902285650001402304650001302318650001602331650001702347650001602364651001102380651001202391653002202403653002602425653002402451653002302475700001402498700001602512700001602528700001402544700001602558773014602574856008602720852000902806655001202815IND60771997120221117050430.0220330e20220515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077199712DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2022.20433412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarwish, T.10aEffect of Potassium Supply and Water Stress on Potato Drought Tolerance and Water Productivity  ap. 1100-1112.  aPotato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of major food crops grown worldwide and in Lebanon. The response of field grown potato to 0, 200, 300 kg of potassium (K) ha⁻¹ was examined under deficit irrigation (imposed water stress). Trials were conducted under Near East-North Africa (NENA) pedo-climatic conditions found in the semiarid central Bekaa of Lebanon. Irrigation water was provided by a drip irrigation system. A mild deficit irrigation, corresponding to 68% of calculated ET0 in 2015 and 85% of it in 2016, was started at the flowering stage and lasted till foliar senescence. Canopy temperature, at maximum development, showed a slight decrease with the increase of potassium levels. During physiological maturity, the midday leaf temperature was significantly lower at the higher K dose, indicating improved leaf water potential. The highest K dose showed a non-significant, higher, chlorophyll content in the leaves, notably in the first year. A significant increase in the weight of one commercial tuber was found in K300 (247.6 g). The commercial yield ranged between 33.05 and 34.78 Mg ha⁻¹ (K300) and 23.31 and 25.53 Mg ha⁻¹ (K0) in 2015 and 2016 respectively. During the 2016 trial, 8 plots out of 16 had an agronomic water yield between 9 and 13 kg.m⁻³ against 12 out of 16 plots in 2015, competing with the reported values for potato in the region. Optimizing nutrient and water input in the NENA region can contribute to food security with minimal environmental impact.  aThis work was supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), ARASIA Program, [RAS5072/9002/01/]; International Potash Institute [10/2014];Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique, Beirut, Lebanon.;  aPublisher supplied data  aRAS5072/9002/01/  a10/2014 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3adeficit irrigation 3adrought tolerance 3aenvironmental impact 3afood security 3airrigation water 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3amicroirrigation 3aplant analysis 3apotassium 3apotatoes 3atemperature 3awater stress 3awater yield 3aAfrica 3aLebanon 0awater consumption 0aagronomic water yield 0achlorophyll content 0acanopy temperature1 aFadel, A.1 aChahine, S.1 aBaydoun, S.1 aJomaa, I.1 aAtallah, T.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2022 May 15, v. 53, no. 9 p.1100-1112dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2022.20433413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010000164300002000264520092700284592002801211650002001239650002601259650001301285650001701298650000901315650001901324650001901343650001601362650004801378650001301426650001901439650001401458650002801472650001901500653001901519653002101538653003601559653002801595653000901623653004801632653001901680700002001699700001801719700002101737700001901758700002901777700002101806700002001827700001801847700001801865773012901883856007802012852000902090655001202099IND60528382820221121030629.0160716e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052838282DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b044312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Wen-Tsan10aEffect of Size-Dependent Photodestructive Efficacy by Gold Nanomaterials with Multiphoton Laser  ap. 17318-17329.  aThe photostability, photodestructive efficacy, two-photon excitation cross section, and two-photon fluorescence of gold nanoparticles conjugated with a hydrophilic photosensitizer, indocyanine green, via multiphoton laser exhibited an increased size effect in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and A549 cancer cells that was dependent on the size of multifunctional gold nanomaterials, but the effect only occurred when nanomaterials within 100 nm in diameter were used.

Twenty Marwari rams were divided into five groups of four each designated as T₁-Complete feed without any herb (control), T₂-Complete feed + 4% Shatavari, T₃-Complete feed + 3% Brahmi, T₄-Complete feed + 3% Bhringraj, T₅-Complete feed + 3% Jiwanti. Average dry matter and organic matter intake (g/d and g/kgW⁰.⁷⁵) were higher in the groups receiving herb supplemented diet than control. The digestibility coefficient of DM, OM and CP was higher (P<0.05) in the rams receiving herbs as feed additives. However, digestibility coefficient of EE, CF, NFE, NDF, ADF and hemicellulose did not differ among the five groups of rams. The average daily gain was 52.34, 62.39, 60.66, 59.53 and 58.29 g/d in control, Asparagus racemosus, Bacopa monnieri, Eclipta alba and Leptadenia reticulata fed groups. All the rams were in positive nitrogen, calcium and phosphorus balance. Higher (P<0.05) nitrogen balance (g/d) was observed on account of herb supplementation in complete feed. The results revealed that supplementation of herbs like Asparagus racemosus, Bacopa monnieri, Eclipta alba and Leptadenia reticulata as a feed additive improved the nutrient utilization in rams.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsparagus racemosus 3aBacopa monnieri 3aEclipta prostrata 3aLeptadenia reticulata 3aanimal nutrition 3aaverage daily gain 3acalcium 3adiet 3adigestibility 3afeed additives 3ahemicellulose 3anitrogen 3anitrogen balance 3anutrient utilization 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus 3awheat straw 0aHerbs 0aRams 0aComplete feed1 aDhuria, R.K.1 aSharma, T.1 aKarnani, M.1 aRai, Kuldeep1 aSingh, Sakainder0 tIndian journal of animal nutrition.g2013 Sept., v. 30, no. 3 p.281-284dAnimal Nutrition Society of IndiawJournal:2071x2231-67447nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144242016200168245012900330300001400459520090800473592002801381650002001409650001701429650001501446650002201461650001501483650001201498650001801510650001501528650002401543650001301567650001501580650001001595650001301605650002201618651001101640653001101651653001401662653001601676653001501692653002001707653001501727653001201742653001401754653001201768653001801780653001401798700002301812700002901835700002501864773009401889856007801983852000902061655001202070IND60520254120221120224046.0160519e20070403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052025412DNAL7 a10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichalski, Fernanda10aNotes sur le territoire et l'utilisation de l'habitat de trois espèces de petits carnivores dans une végétation mosaïque perturbée au Sud Est du Brésil10aNotes on home range and habitat use of three small carnivore species in a disturbed vegetation mosaic of southeastern Brazil  ap. 52-57.  aThe home range and habitat use of three carnivore species was investigated in a disturbed forest of southeastern Brazil. Three jaguarundis (Herpailurus yagouaroundi), two crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous), and two tayras (Eira barbara) were radio-tracked to test the hypothesis that home ranges and habitat use would differ between the proportion of habitat types available. The largest home ranges were those of one male jaguarundi (2047 ha) and the male crab-eating fox (1053 ha). The smallest were those of the females of crab-eating fox (48 ha) and jaguarundi (188 ha). The female jaguarundi was the only individual to show a significant difference between observed and expected habitat use. All species used disturbed habitats (secondary forest, grassland savanna, and Eucalyptus plantation) to varying degrees. Thus, these species showed great flexibility in their use of disturbed habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCerdocyon thous 3aEira barbara 3aEucalyptus 3aPuma yagouaroundi 3acarnivores 3afemales 3aforest damage 3agrasslands 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahome range 3amales 3asavannas 3asecondary forests 3aBrazil 0aBrazil 0aCarnivora 0ahabitat use 0ahome range 0aradio-telemetry 0aSão Paulo 0aBrésil 0aCarnivora 0aHabitat 0aRadio-Pistage 0aSao Paulo1 aCrawshaw, Peter G.1 aOliveira, Tadeu Gomes de1 aFabián, Marta Elena0 tMammalia.g2007 Apr. 3, v. 70, no. 1-2 p.52-57dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02056naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010000162300002000262520081200282592002801094650002201122650001501144650001901159650002301178650002801201650001101229653002601240653001401266653001901280653001601299653001801315653003001333700001901363700001601382700001601398700001701414773012601431856008001557852000901637655001201646IND60528382920221121030656.0160716e20150812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052838292DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.5b044902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHwang, Insung10aEnhancing Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells to Moisture by the Facile Hydrophobic Passivation  ap. 17330-17336.  aIn this study, a novel and facile passivation process for a perovskite solar cell is reported. Poor stability in ambient atmosphere, which is the most critical demerit of a perovskite solar cell, is overcome by a simple passivation process using a hydrophobic polymer layer. Teflon, the hydrophobic polymer, is deposited on the top of a perovskite solar cell by a spin-coating method. With the hydrophobic passivation, the perovskite solar cell shows negligible degradation after a 30 day storage in ambient atmosphere. Suppressed degradation of the perovskite film is proved in various ways: X-ray diffraction, light absorption spectrum, and quartz crystal microbalance. This simple but effective passivation process suggests new kind of approach to enhance stability of perovskite solar cells to moisture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3ahydrophobicity 3aphotovoltaic cells 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3aquartz 0aperovskite solar cell 0astability 0ahydrophobicity 0apassivation 0aencapsulation 0adegradation of perovskite1 aJeong, Inyoung1 aLee, Jinwoo1 aKo, Min Jae1 aYong, Kijung0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Aug. 12, v. 7, no. 31 p.17330-17336dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b044903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144242011600168245011200284300001400396520132700410592002801737650001601765650001501781650001501796650001901811650001101830650001201841653001401853653001601867653001001883653001801893653001701911653001101928653001601939653002401955700002201979773009402001856007802095852000902173655001202182IND60520254220221120224119.0160519e20060201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052025422DNAL7 a10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrzeziński, Marcin10aObservations des épreintes de la loutre (Lutra lutra) sur les montagnes du Bieszczady au sud-est de la Pologne10aExperiments on sprainting activity of otters (Lutra lutra) in the Bieszczady Mountains, southeastern Poland  ap. 58-63.  aConsecutive surveys of otter spraints of both banks along a 28-km stretch of the River San showed an average of 4.18 deposited spraints/km per day during a 3-week pre-experimental period. The variation in spraint density on particular 1-km-long sections of the river was high and varied from 40 to 145 spraints/km after 3 weeks. Spraint deposition was positively correlated with the proportion of steep and rocky riverbanks, which were characterised by a higher number of potential sprainting sites than those with many flat and undermined banks. Average daily deposition of spraints on the whole 28-km stretch after experimental removal of spraints (experimental period) did not significantly differ compared to the pre-experimental period. However, in sections where otter spraints were removed (n=14), sprainting intensity increased 1.6-fold, while in the control sections (n=14) the defecation ratio decreased 1.5-fold during the first week after removal. Placement of additional spraints of unfamiliar individuals on half the experimental sections did not stimulate otters to increase defecation on these sections compared to those where only old spraints were removed. Otter response to the removal of spraints has a spatial character and is expressed by differentiation in spraint deposition within the home range.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3adefecation 3ahome range 3ariparian areas 3arivers 3asurveys 0abehaviour 0aLutra lutra 0aotter 0ascent marking 0acomportement 0aloutre 0aLutra lutra 0amarquage à l'odeur1 aRomanowski, Jerzy0 tMammalia.g2006 Feb. 1, v. 70, no. 1-2 p.58-63dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010200157300001800259520169500277592002801972650002202000650001002022650001702032650003102049650001802080650002402098650001102122650002302133650001902156650001302175650001402188700002002202773012102222856007502343852000902418655001202427IND60558198620221121183456.0161111e20120719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055819862DNAL7 a10.1021/jp30330662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Thomas10aMean-Field Modeling of the Encapsulation of Weakly Acidic Molecules in Polyelectrolyte Dendrimers  ap. 8269-8281.  aThe unique architecture of dendrimers has attracted interest in a wide variety of biomedical applications such as drug delivery. In order to gain insight into the solubilization of drugs inside dendrimer architectures, we have developed and numerically implemented a self-consistent field theory model for the equilibrium characteristics of charged dendrimer molecules in the presence of weakly acidic drug molecules. Using such a model, we examine the relative influence of excluded volume, electrostatic, and local enthalpic interactions upon the solubilization of drugs in dendrimers. When only excluded volume interactions are accounted, there is no driving force for drug solubilization inside the dendrimer, and hence depletion of the drug from the dendrimer molecule (relative to the bulk drug concentration) is observed. The inclusion of electrostatic interactions within the model results in solubilization of drugs within the dendrimer. The solubilization of the drugs is shown to increase with increasing drug charge density and increasing dendrimer generation number. We probe the effect of enthalpic interactions and demonstrate that the number of drug molecules encapsulated through enthalpic interaction is dependent upon the number of dendrimer monomers, the enthalpic interaction parameters between the dendrimer and drug (χPD), and the drug and solvent (χDS). We also analyze the combined effects of the preceding interactions to identify the synergism in their influence and delineate the relative importance of different parameters such as pOH, size of the drugs, and the Bjerrum length of the solution in influencing the encapsulation of drugs by dendrimer molecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical elements 3adrugs 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aencapsulation 3amathematical theory 3amodels 3aphysical chemistry 3asolubilization 3asolvents 3asynergism1 aGanesan, Venkat0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2012 July 19, v. 116, no. 28 p.8269-8281dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp30330663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245009900202300001800301500002000319520164800339592002801987596006902015596009202084596001902176596001902195650001002214650002002224650001302244650001402257650001502271650001302286650001902299700006102318700006002379700002202439700001902461773013202480856007702612852000902689655001202698IND60789895020221123001937.0220822e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078989502DNAL7 a10.1029/2018JB0159102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUshioda, Masashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1321-672X10aEvolution of Magma Plumbing System in Miyakejima Volcano: Constraints From Melting Experiments  ap. 8615-8636.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe evolution of the magma plumbing system of Miyakejima volcano, an island arc basaltic volcano located on the volcanic front of the Izu arc, Japan, was investigated by combining (i) melting experiments of hydrous basaltic magma, (ii) analysis of melt inclusions in the volcanic rocks, and (iii) thermodynamic modeling using the thermodynamic program (MELTS) to understand the temporal evolution of the magma plumbing system. Basalts of the Ofunato Stage (10,000–4,000 year BP) show limited compositional variation without evidence of magma mixing, and seem to be parental to volcanic rocks of later stages. Hydrous melting experiments were conducted using the Ofunato Scoria (OFS), which represents the most undifferentiated basaltic magma during the past 10,000 years. The magma chamber conditions required to crystallize the phenocryst assemblage of the OFS were constrained to ~150 MPa, ~1100 °C, and ~3 wt% H₂O in melt. The constrained H₂O content is consistent with H₂O content of olivine‐hosted melt inclusions in the OFS. Here we propose that a simple magma plumbing system existed beneath Miyakejima volcano during the Ofunato Stage, comprising a single magma chamber. The MELTS calculations show that andesites of the Tsubota Stage (4,000–2,500 year BP; representing the later part of the Ofunato Stage after a period of dormancy of 3,000 years), can be derived from the Ofunato basalts, provided that H₂O content in magma is <1 wt%. The results of modeling indicate that a new magma chamber formed at a shallower depth after the Ofunato Stage, in which the differentiation of degassed basaltic magmas occurred.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017VSA0001cCAS President's International Fellowship Initiative  aXDB18000000cStrategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences  a25247088cMEXT  a21109004cMEXT 3aJapan 3acrystallization 3adormancy 3aevolution 3ageophysics 3aresearch 3athermodynamics1 aTakahashi, Eiichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6500-18271 aHamada, Morihisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6224-39511 aSuzuki, Toshihiro1 aNiihori, Kenji0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2018 Oct., v. 123, no. 10 p.8615-8636dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018JB0159103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011400163300001600277520187800293592002802171650002202199650002102221650001302242650002802255650002702283650002502310650002602335650001302361650002202374650002302396650001502419650002002434650002102454650001602475650002902491650002202520650002002542650001002562650004102572650001002613650001402623650002102637650001902658650001102677650002502688650000702713650001402720650001402734650001502748650002202763700002002785773010802805856008102913852000902994655001203003IND60596609320221119204700.0180619e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059660932DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617180300622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNallala, V.10aProbiotic Evaluation of Antimicrobial Lactobacillus plantarum VJC38 Isolated from the Crop of Broiler Chicken  ap. 350-362.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate probiotic properties of antimicrobial Lactobacillus plantarum VJC38 in vitro. L. plantarum VJC38 was isolated from the crop of broiler chicken and characterized using dnaK gene sequence. The inhibitory activities of L. plantarum VJC38 against bacterial and fungal pathogens were evaluated. Antifungal compounds secreted by the strain VJC38 were identified using Gas Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The strain was evaluated for its tolerance to low pH, resistance to bile salts, auto-aggregation, co-aggregation with pathogenic Escherichia coli, cell surface hydrophobicity, cholesterol lowering activity, β-galactosidase production, adhesion ability to Caco-2 cells, mucin degradation, hemolytic activity and biogenic amine production. Phylogenetic analysis of dnaK gene of bacterial strain VJC38 showed 99% sequence similarity to Lactobacillus plantarum var. plantarum. It showed effective inhibition against food spoiling and pathogenic organisms like Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium expansum and Eurotium species. The antifungal compound phenol- 2,4-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl) (PD) was identified in the culture filtrate of L. plantarum VJC38 and reported to have inhibition against Aspergillus species. L. plantarum VJC38 exhibited tolerance to low pH, resistance to bile salts, bile salt hydrolase activity, auto-aggregation (87.5%), co-aggregation with Escherichia coli (55.7%), cholesterol lowering activity (64%), β-galactosidase production (1206 MU), adherence to Caco-2 cells (11%), negative for mucin degradation, hemolytic activity and biogenic amine production. L. plantarum VJC38 could be a good candidate for further investigation in vivo to elucidate its health benefits and to evaluate its technological properties as a bio-protective strain.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aEscherichia coli 3aEurotium 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPenicillium expansum 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aadhesion 3aantifungal agents 3abeta-galactosidase 3abile salts 3abiogenic amines 3abroiler chickens 3acholesterol 3acholoylglycine hydrolase 3aculture filtrates 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agenes 3ahemolysis 3ahuman cell lines 3ahydrophobicity 3amucins 3anucleotide sequences 3apH 3apathogens 3aphylogeny 3aprobiotics 3asequence homology1 aJeevaratnam, K.0 tMicrobiology.g2018 May, v. 87, no. 3 p.350-362dPleiades PublishingwJournal:jnl46286x0026-26177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00262617180300623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245017800165300001600343520101700359592002801376650001401404650002201418650002301440650001301463650001901476650001601495653002001511653001901531653002501550653001801575653001301593700001301606700001901619773010801638856008601746852000901832655001201841IND60524472220221122230413.0190318e20160820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052447222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.04.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Hua10aEthyl cellulose amphiphilic graft copolymers with LCST-UCST transition: Opposite self-assembly behavior, hydrophilic-hydrophobic surface and tunable crystalline morphologies  ap. 261-271.  aNovel and well-defined graft copolymer with block copolymer side chain, ethyl cellulose-graft-(poly(ε-caprolactone)-block-poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethylmeth acrylate)) (EC-g-(PCL-b-PDMAEMA)) with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) was successfully synthesized via the combination of ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).

In this report, a general and facile strategy to combat surface fouling is developed by grafting of amino acids onto polymer substrates to form zwitterionic structure through amino groups induced epoxy ring opening click reaction. First of all, a library of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) hydrogels with zwitterionic surfaces were prepared, resulting in the formation of pairs of carboxyl anions and protonated secondary amino cations. The analysis of attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the successful immobilization of amino acids on the hydrogel surfaces. After that, the contact angle and equilibrium water content of the modified hydrogels showed that the hydrogels exhibited improved hydrophilicity compared with the parent hydrogel. Furthermore, the protein deposition was evaluated by bicinchoninic acid assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme as models. The results indicated that the performance of the hydrogels was determined by the nature of incorporated amino acid: the hydrogels incorporated with neutral amino acids had nonspecific antiadsorption capability to both BSA and lysozyme; the hydrogels incorporated with charged amino acids showed antiadsorption behaviors against protein with same charge and enhanced adsorption to the protein with opposite charge; the optimal antiadsorption performance was observed on the hydrogels incorporated with polar amino acids with a hydroxyl residual. The improvement of antiprotein fouling of the neutral amino acids grafted hydrogels can be ascribed to the formation of zwitterionic surfaces. Finally, a couple of soft contact lenses grafted with amino acids were fabricated having improved antifouling property and hydrophilicity. The result demonstrated the success of amino acids based zwitterionic antifouling strategy in ophthalmology. This strategy is also applicable to substrates including filtration membranes, microspheres and nanofibers as well. It is a versatile method for amino acids grafting onto polymer substrates to construct zwitterionic surfaces and achieve antifouling properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aamino acids 3aanions 3abiofouling 3abiosensors 3abovine serum albumin 3acatheters 3acations 3acontact angle 3aepoxides 3ahydrogels 3ahydrophilicity 3alysozyme 3amodels 3ananofibers 3aophthalmology 3apolymers 3aprotein deposition 3awater content 3azwitterions 0aamino acids 0azwitterionic 0aantifouling surfaces 0ahydrophilicity 0aclick reaction1 aHu, Xin1 aWang, Jie1 aZhang, Ye-Min1 aLiu, Xiao-Jiu1 aXie, Bin-Bin1 aYao, Zhen,1 aLi, Yi1 aLi, Xin-Song0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2015 Aug. 12, v. 7, no. 31 p.17337-17345dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.5b045203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02180naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144242014900163245013100312300001400443520075000457592002801207650001301235650001101248650001501259650001201274650001001286650001901296650001401315651001001329653001501339653001401354653001001368653001301378653001301391653002301404653001001427653001501437653001301452653001501465700002101480700002801501773009401529856007801623852000901701655001201710IND60520254520221120193238.0160519e20070403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052025452DNAL7 a10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKojima, Nozomu10aStabilité annuelle et differences individuelles des cris d'appels longs des mâles de pikas du Japon Ochotona hyperborea yesoensis (Lagomorpha)10aYear-long stability and individual differences of male long calls in Japanese pikas Ochotona hyperborea yesoensis (Lagomorpha)  ap. 80-85.  aLong calls of three adult male Japanese pikas were tape-recorded in the Taisetsuzan National Park, Hokkaido, Japan, from July 1996 to July 1998. A long call consisted of 3–13 elements, each with a characteristic W-shaped wave. There was apparent individual variation in sonographic patterns and the fundamental frequencies. Such individual variation did not differ with animal age, or through the reproductive and non-reproductive seasons. The complicated structure of W-shaped waves may involve much information concerning individual difference, and the repetition of elements in the long call may advertise sexual activity, location, and territorial ownership to opponents and mates, based on individual identification only by hearing calls.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchotona 3aadults 3aanimal age 3ahearing 3amales 3anational parks 3aownership 3aJapan 0aLagomorpha 0along call 0aJapan 0aOchotona 0asonogram 0acris d'appel longs 0aJapon 0aLagomorpha 0aOchotona 0asonogramme1 aOnoyama, Keiichi1 aKawamichi, T.q(Takeo),0 tMammalia.g2007 Apr. 3, v. 70, no. 1-2 p.80-85dDe GruyterwJournal:1950x1864-15477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/mamm.70.1-2.803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03864naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245009300172520222200265592002802487650002402515650003202539650001602571650001002587650002002597650002302617650001302640650001902653650001202672650001102684650001302695650001502708650001202723650000902735653000802744653000802752653000702760653001102767653001102778653001002789653001002799653001102809653000702820653001002827653000702837653000902844653001502853653001202868653001502880653001402895700002102909700002102930700002202951700002502973700002402998773011803022856008903140852000903229655001203238IND60763064620221120082918.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076306462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1152072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNg, Theros T.10aEffects of zinc glycinate on growth, immunity, and intestinal health in broiler chickens  aThe objective is to investigate the effects of dietary zinc form and concentration in broiler chickens. Day-old broiler chicks (n = 6) were allotted to treatments in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement to examine supplemental zinc from sulfate (ZS) and glycinate (ZG) and concentration (40, 80, and 120 mg/kg). In healthy conditions, no difference in poultry performances is to be expected between organic and inorganic zinc sources, supplemented at the same zinc dose to the diets. We found that on day 21, zinc supplemented at 80 mg/kg increased body weight gain (BWG) by 113 g compared to zinc supplemented at 40 mg/kg (P < 0.01). Similarly, on day 35, zinc supplemented at 120 mg/kg increased BWG by 155 g compared to zinc supplemented at 40 mg/kg (P < 0.05). On day 35, zinc supplemented at 120 mg/kg increased feed intake by 239 g compared to zinc supplemented at 40 mg/kg (P < 0.05). The villi length on day 21 was increased by 63 µm in birds supplemented at 120 mg/kg compared to 40 mg/kg (P < 0.05). On day 21, cecal tonsil gene expression of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) was higher by 2.5 and 2.4-fold in the ZG-80 mg/kg group than the ZG-40 mg/kg and ZS-120 mg/kg groups (P < 0.01), and interleukin 10 (IL-10) was lower by 2-fold in the ZS-120 mg/kg group than ZS-40 mg/kg, while IL-10 was lower in the ZG-40 mg/kg than ZS-40 mg/kg group (P < 0.01). On day 35, cecal tonsil gene expression of IL-1β was overall higher by 1.3-fold in the ZG group compared to ZS (P < 0.05). On day 21, spleen gene expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) was higher by 1.4-fold in the ZG-80 mg/kg group compared to ZG-40 mg/kg (P < 0.05). On day 35 spleen gene expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF factor (LITAF) was lower in the ZG-80 mg/kg group compared to ZS-80 mg/kg (P < 0.05). On day 35 jejunum gene expression of claudin-2 was higher by 2.1-fold in the ZG-80 mg/kg group than ZS-80 mg/kg (P < 0.05). This study supports that zinc supplementation at 120 mg/kg improves the growth performance of broiler chickens. This is accompanied by improvements in intestinal morphology and modulation in immunity through an altered cytokine production profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody weight changes 3adietary mineral supplements 3afeed intake 3afeeds 3agene expression 3agrowth performance 3aimmunity 3ainterleukin-10 3ajejunum 3aspleen 3asulfates 3atechnology 3atonsils 3azinc 0aBWG 0aFCR 0aFI 0aIFN-γ 0aIL-1β 0aIL-10 0aLITAF 0aTGF-β 0aZG 0aZIP-9 0aZS 0aZinc 0aGut health 0aBroiler 0aImmunology 0aNutrition1 aMortada, Mohamad1 aAkerele, Gabriel1 aOxford, Jarred H.1 aBlanchard, Alexandra1 aSelvaraj, Ramesh K.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2022 Mar., v. 285 p.115207-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7460x0377-84017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2022.1152073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002900112245011700141300001600258500001400274520088500288592002801173650002101201650002101222650002001243650001801263650001301281650000701294650001201301650002901313650001801342653001901360653001901379653001801398653002601416653001901442700002401461773014201485852000901627655001201636IND60710030620221120145903.0200908e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071003062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMageshwaran, Vellaichamy10aDetoxification of gossypol in cottonseed meal by Pleurotus flabellatus strain M-1 under solid state fermentation  ap. 313-319.  aNAL-light  aA solid state fermentation (SSF) process was optimized for the reduction of free gossypol (FG) and bound gossypol (BG) in cottonseed meal (CSM) using Pleurotus flabellatus strain M-1. The optimization of SSF process showed that CSM autoclaved at 110°C, inoculated with P.flabellatus M-1, maintained with 80% initial moisture content, pH in nature, incubated for 48 hours at 30°C resulted in reduction of BG from 3.0 to 1.4% and FG from 1.0 to 0.3% which corresponds to 53.3 and 70.0%, respectively. The study also revealed the crude protein content (%) of inoculated CSM increased from 27.67 to 33.40 compared to uninoculated CSM. Thus, the P. flabellatus M-1 treated CSM is having potential for use in non-ruminants feed; however, the future work may be focused on evaluation of the treated CSM in feed trials like poultry to find its suitability for use in non-ruminants feed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPleurotus djamor 3aanimal nutrition 3acottonseed meal 3acrude protein 3agossypol 3apH 3apoultry 3asolid state fermentation 3awater content 0aBound Gossypol 0aDetoxification 0aFree Gossypol 0aPleurotus flabellatus 0aTotal Gossypol1 aKathe, Arati Arvind0 tIndian journal of animal nutrition.g2013 Sept., v. 30, no. 3 p.313-319dAnimal Nutrition Society of IndiawJournal:2071x2231-67447nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001300166245015500179300001800334520137900352592002801731650001101759650002801770650003201798650002501830650001001855650002101865650002601886650002201912650001501934650001701949650002201966650002501988650001302013650001402026650001002040651001002050653001502060653003102075653002602106653002902132700001502161700001602176700001602192700001602208700001102224700001702235700001502252700001402267700001402281773011402295856008102409852000902490655001202499IND60652467220221123023606.0190713e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065246722DNAL7 a291437142pmid7 a10.1017/S175173111700297X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, P.10aNew insights into mitogenomic phylogeny and copy number in eight indigenous sheep populations based on the ATP synthase and cytochrome c oxidase genes  ap. 1341-1349.  aThe origins and phylogeny of different sheep breeds has been widely studied using polymorphisms within the mitochondrial hypervariable region. However, little is known about the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content and phylogeny based on mtDNA protein-coding genes. In this study, we assessed the phylogeny and copy number of the mtDNA in eight indigenous (population size, n=184) and three introduced (n=66) sheep breeds in China based on five mitochondrial coding genes (COX1, COX2, ATP8, ATP6 and COX3). The mean haplotype and nucleotide diversities were 0.944 and 0.00322, respectively. We identified a correlation between the lineages distribution and the genetic distance, whereby Valley-type Tibetan sheep had a closer genetic relationship with introduced breeds (Dorper, Poll Dorset and Suffolk) than with other indigenous breeds. Similarly, the Median-joining profile of haplotypes revealed the distribution of clusters according to genetic differences. Moreover, copy number analysis based on the five mitochondrial coding genes was affected by the genetic distance combining with genetic phylogeny; we also identified obvious non-synonymous mutations in ATP6 between the different levels of copy number expressions. These results imply that differences in mitogenomic compositions resulting from geographical separation lead to differences in mitochondrial function.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDorper 3aH+/K+-exchanging ATPase 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3agenetic distance 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3amutation 3aphylogeny 3asheep 3aChina 0aOvis aries 0amitochondrial coding genes 0alineages distribution 0anon-synonymous mutations1 aNiu, L.

To investigate whether AHL signal molecules also affect the success and rate of zoospore germination in addition to zoospore attraction, the epiphytic bacteria associated with mature Ulva linza were characterized and bacterial isolates representative of this community tested for the ability to produce AHLs. Two of these AHL‐producing isolates, Sulfitobacter spp. 376 and Shewanella spp. 79, were transformed with plasmids expressing the Bacillus spp. AHL lactonase gene aiiA to generate AHL‐deficient variants. The germination and growth of U. linza zoospores was studied in the presence of these AHL‐deficient strains and their AHL‐producing counterparts. This revealed that the AHLs produced by Sulfitobacter spp. and Shewanella spp. or the bacterial products they regulate have a negative impact on both zoospore germination and the early growth of the Ulva germling. Further experiments with Escherichia coli biofilms expressing recombinant AHL synthases and synthetic AHLs provide data to demonstrate that zoospores germinated and grown in the absence of AHLs were significantly longer than those germinated in the presence of AHLs. These results reveal an additional role for AHLs per se in the interactive relationships between marine bacteria and Ulva zoospores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aEscherichia coli 3aShewanella 3aSulfitobacter 3aUlva 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3aepiphytes 3agenes 3agermination 3azoospores 2aAcyl-Butyrolactonesxchemistry 2aBacillusxenzymology 2aBiofilms 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aLigasesxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aQuorum Sensing 2aRhodobacteraceaexgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aShewanellaxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aUlvaxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology.1 aTait, Karen1 aWilliams, Paul1 aAtkinson, Steve1 aCámara, Miguel0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2014 Feb., v. 16, no. 2 p.445-453dBlackwell Sciencex1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.122033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007400158300001800232520125400250592002801504650002301532650005201555650003001607650001301637650001601650650002301666650002101689650002101710650001301731700001901744700002101763773012901784856007501913852000901988655001201997IND60758080820221119050351.0211126e20211125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075808082DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ay01519b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Mukti10aAptamer-based biosensors and their implications in COVID-19 diagnosis  ap. 5400-5417.  aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel infectious member of the coronavirus family, has caused millions of cases of infection and deaths all over the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Conventional laboratory-based diagnostic testing has faced extreme difficulties in meeting the overwhelming demand for testing worldwide, and this has brought about a pressing need for cost-effective rapid diagnosis. There has been a surge in the number of prototypes of diagnostic kits developed, although many of these have been found to be lacking in terms of their accuracy and sensitivity. One type of chip-based diagnostic platform is the aptamer-based biosensor. Aptamers are artificially synthesized oligonucleotides that are capable of specifically binding to a target antigen. As of now, some aptamers have been reported for SARS-CoV-2. Although many ultrasensitive aptasensors have been developed for viruses, few have been successfully adapted for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our review discusses the recent developments in the domain of SARS-CoV-2 specific aptamer isolation, the design of electrochemical and optical aptasensors, and the implications of aptasensor-based COVID-19 diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aWorld Health Organization 3aantigens 3aaptasensors 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aoligonucleotides 3apandemic1 aDutta, Nirmita1 aDutta, Gorachand0 tAnalytical methods.g2021 Nov. 25, v. 13, no. 45 p.5400-5417dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ay01519b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01758naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001600156245008800172300001600260520075800276592002801034650003001062650001501092650001701107650001101124650001501135650003301150650003701183700001901220773010601239856009001345852000901435655001201444IND60120398920221119045127.0150202e198705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012039892DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1987.tb06728.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHOOD, S.

When observed with SEM, all strains adhered to glass coverslips; however, no attachment fibrils were seen. When viewed with TEM, strain BG2F04 showed a polysaccharide (PS) material outside the cell wall. This strain had previously been shown to adhere strongly to human intestinal tissue cells, while strain Lac 12 had shown weak adherence, and strain NCFM did not adhere. The PS layer on strain Lac 12 was variable, and a PS layer on NCFM could not be seen. These observations suggested that this PS material may be involved in the adherence of strain BG2F04 to surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3acell walls 3afood science 3ahumans 3aintestines 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aZOTTOLA, E.

Despite sporadic reports, no systemic study has been carried out on CRE in companion animals in Indian subcontinent. In total, 237 canine specimens collected from five veterinary polyclinics in and around Kolkata were analyzed for isolation, antimicrobial resistance profiling and molecular characterization of carbapenem-resistant (CR) E. coli. Of the 29 CR isolates, 19 were identified as metallo-β-lactamase producers (MP-CRE) and 10 as metallo-β-lactamase non-producers (MNP-CRE). Eleven of them were extended spectrum β-lactamase and/or AmpC type β-lactamase producers and harboured fluoroquinolone-, tetracycline-, sulfonamide- and aminoglycoside-resistant genes. Beside uropathogenic virulence determinants, they carried the adhesion factors mediating biofilm production which was remarkably higher in 6 MP-CRE and one MNP-CRE isolates. Although the CRE were of diverse origin including the healthy and the diseased dogs, these were more frequently isolated from canine pyometra. The MP-CRE harboured plasmids of IncF and IncA/C types. Phylo-type B1 was observed in 38% of the CR isolates, followed by A0 in 31% and rest were attributed to A1 and D1. The Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus-PCR (ERIC-PCR) revealed that these isolates were genetically diverse and constituted of a heterogenous population. Detection of CRE in pet dogs despite the fact that carbapenems are not used in animals in India emphasizes the need for active surveillance to identify the transmission and dynamics of such pathogens in companion animals.  aPublisher supplied data  a711/CRC-PMU/TANUVAS/2018cDepartment of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology 3aEscherichia coli 3aadhesion 3aantibiotic resistance 3abiofilm 3acarbapenems 3adogs 3amicrobiology 3amonitoring 3aplasmids 3apublic health 3apyometra 3avirulence 3aIndia1 aBanerjee, Jaydeep1 aBhattacharyya, Debaraj1 aTudu, Rahul1 aSamanta, Indranil1 aDandapat, Premanshu1 aNanda, Pramod K.1 aDas, Arun K.1 aMondal, Bimalendu1 aBatabyal, Subhasis1 aDutta, Tapan K.0 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 Mar., v. 78, no. 3 p.1006-1016dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02355-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01438naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245010400165300001800269520045400287592002800741650001400769650002300783650002300806650002500829650002200854650001900876700002400895700001600919773010500935856007501040852000901115655001201124IND60578378920221122074952.0170813e20120518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057837892DNAL7 a10.1021/ol300794a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJordan-Hore, James A.10aMild and Ligand-Free Pd(II)-Catalyzed Conjugate Additions to Hindered γ-Substituted Cyclohexenones  ap. 2508-2511.  aLigand-free cationic Pd(II) catalyst with NaNO₃ as an additive is a highly active catalytic system for conjugate additions to sterically hindered γ-substituted cyclohexenones.

Its toxic effects are associated with inflammatory cell accumulation and increased pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. In this study, we aimed to investigate the efficiency of melatonin (MEL) and S-methylisothiourea (SMT) on mechlorethamine (MEC) induced lung toxicity. METHODS: Thirty-six male rats were randomly divided into four groups: control, MEC, MEC+MEL, and MEC+SMT. Control group was given saline only via transdermal route. Other groups were exposured to a single dose of MEC (3.5mg/kg) via transdermal route. MEL (100mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally 30min after the application of MEC, and after the same dose of MEL was given every 12h for a total of six doses. SMT (50mg/kg) was also given intraperitoneally 30min after the application of MEC. RESULTS: MEC injection resulted in alveolar epithelial injury, hemorrhage, inflammation, edema and interalveolar septal thickening in the lung tissues. The tissue TNF-α, IL-1β, and nitrate/nitrite (NOx) levels were found significantly different for all groups (p<0.001). TNF-α and IL-1β levels increased significantly with MEC exposure, and MEL and SMT ameliorated these increases in lung tissues. MEC also elevated NOx levels in lung tissue. Melatonin showed meaningful protection against lung injury. But protection of SMT was weaker. CONCLUSION: Inflammation plays an important role in the MEC induced lung toxicity as well as oxidative and nitrosative stress. Melatonin has also anti-inflammatory properties similar to SMT, as well as anti-oxidant properties. But melatonin treatment was found more efficient than SMT treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aedema 3ahemorrhage 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3amales 3amelatonin 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atissues 3atoxicity 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aYaren, Hakan1 aAydın, İbrahim,1 aKunak, Zeki Ilker1 aYaman, Halil1 aOnguru, Onder1 aUysal, Bulent1 aKorkmaz, Ahmet1 aTurel, Samet1 aKenar, Levent0 tEnvironmental toxicology and pharmacology.g2013 Nov., v. 36, no. 3 p.1283-1290dElsevier B.V.x1382-66897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2013.10.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245005800171300001600229520095400245592002801199650001601227650001201243650001401255650001301269650001701282650001301299650000901312650001801321650001901339650001101358650001401369700001501383773010601398856009001504852000901594655001201603IND60120399020221119045120.0150202e198705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012039902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1987.tb06711.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKIM, J.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between the heat stability of thylakoids and loss of chlorophyll in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under heat stress, and to examine whether chlorophyll loss can be used as an indicator of heat tolerance in wheat. We assessed heat tolerance and measured chlorophyll content in 12 cultivars of winter wheat at flowering stage during exposure to 16-d-long heat stress. Heat tolerance was assessed using fluorescence to determine the heat stability of thylakoids, and chlorophyll content was measured with a chlorophyll meter. Experiments were conducted under controlled conditions. Heat stress caused damage to thylakoids in all cultivars as indicated by the increase in the ratio of constant fluorescence (O) and the peak of variable fluorescence (P). Heat stress also caused a decline in chlorophyll content in most cultivars. A strong negative correlation between heat-induced increases in O/P and chlorophyll content was seen. The results suggest that heat-induced damage to thylakoids and chlorophyll loss are closely associated in winter wheat. Measurements of chlorophyll content with a chlorophyll meter could be useful for high throughput screening for heat tolerance in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3achlorophyll 3aheat stress 3athylakoids 3aheat stability 3aheat tolerance 3agermplasm screening 3abiomarkers 3acultivars 3aflowering 3afluorescence 3achemical constituents of plants 3ameasuring devices1 aBukovnik, Urska1 aPrasad, P.V.

The quality of the current BeiDou demonstration system (BDS) ultra-rapid orbits is lower than that of GPS, especially for the new generational BDS-3 satellites due to the fact that the availability of the number of ground tracking stations is limited, the geographic distribution of these stations is poor, and the data processing strategies adopted are not optimal. In this study, improved data processing strategies for the generation of ultra-rapid orbits of BDS-2/BDS-3 satellites are investigated. This includes both observed and predicted parts of the orbit. First, the predicted clock offsets are taken as constraints in the estimation process to reduce the number of the unknown parameters and improve the accuracy of the parameter estimates of the orbit. To obtain more accurate predicted clock offsets for the BDS&rsquo; orbit determination, a denoising method (also called the Tikhonov regularization algorithm), inter-satellite correlation, and the partial least squares method are all incorporated into the clock offsets prediction model. Then, the Akaike information criterion (AIC) is used to determine the arc length in the estimation models by taking the optimal arc length in the estimation of the initial orbit states into consideration. Finally, a number of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the ultra-rapid orbits resulting from the proposed methods. Results showed that: (1) Compared with traditional models, the accuracy improvement of the predicted clock offsets from the proposed methods were 40.5% and 26.1% for BDS-2 and BDS-3, respectively; (2) the observed part of the orbits can be improved 9.2% and 5.0% for BDS-2 and BDS-3, respectively, by using the predicted clock offsets as constraints; (3) the accuracy of the predicted part of the orbits showed a high correlation with the AIC value, and the accuracy of the predicted orbits could be improved up to 82.2%. These results suggest that the approaches proposed in this study can significantly enhance the accuracy of the ultra-rapid orbits of BDS-2/BDS-3 satellites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3ageographical distribution 3aglobal positioning systems 3ainformation processing 3aleast squares 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asatellites1 aHu, Zhao,1 aZhang, Kefei 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 July 25, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111517583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01442naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245003800164300001800202520053000220592002800750650002000778650001200798650001300810653001200823653002300835653002100858653002000879653001800899773012200917856008001039852000901119655001201128IND60620886220221122001901.0181114e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062088622DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642083276722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahnel, Robin10aWhy the Market Subverts Democracy  ap. 1006-1022.  aProponents of neoliberalism contend that promoting free markets is nearly synonymous with promoting democracy.

This study highlighted the most profitable CI and innovated by describing this optimum as a function of the feeding system of the farm. On-farm data were used to represent real farm conditions. A total of 1832 accounts of farms recorded from 2007 to 2014 provided economic, technical and feeding information per herd and per year. A multiple correspondence analysis created four feeding groups: extensive, low intensive, intensive and very intensive herds. The gross margin and some of its components were corrected to account for the effect of factors external to the farm, such as the market, biological status, etc. Then the corrected gross margin (cGMc) and its components were modelled by CI parameters in each feeding system by use of GLM. The relationship between cGMc and the proportion of cows with CI<380 days in each feeding group showed that keeping most of the cows in the herd with CI near to 1 year was not profitable for most farms (for the very intensive farms there was no effect of the proportion). Moreover, a low proportion of cows (0% to 20%) with a near-to-1-year CI was not profitable for the extensive and low intensive farms. Extending the proportion of cows with CI beyond 459 days until 635 days (i.e. data limitation) caused no significant economic loss for the extensive and low intensive farms, but was not profitable for the intensive and very intensive farms. Variations of the milk and feeding components explained mainly these significant differences of gross margin. A link between the feeding system and persistency, perceptible in the milk production and CI shown by the herd, could explain the different relationships observed between the extent of CI and the economic results in the feeding groups. This herd-level study tended to show different economic optima of CI as a function of the feeding system. A cow-level study would specify these tendencies to give CI objectives to dairy breeders as a function of their farm characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalving interval 3acorrespondence analysis 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3afarms 3afinancial economics 3aherds 3amarkets 3amilk 3amilk production 3aprofits and margins 0adairy 0aeconomic 0afeeding1 aBeckers, Y.1 aMayeres, P.1 aReding, E.1 aWyzen, B.1 aColinet, F.1 aDelhez, P.1 aSoyeurt, H.0 tAnimal.g2018 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.1662-1671dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311170030203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01287naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010700159300001800266520029000284592002800574650002300602650002300625650001100648650002200659650002300681700001700704700001500721700002000736700001600756773010500772856007500877852000900952655001200961IND60578379220221120091319.0170813e20120518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057837922DNAL7 a10.1021/ol300807x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Chuanjiang12aA Novel Organic Sensitizer Combined with a Cobalt Complex Redox Shuttle for Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells  ap. 2532-2535.  aA novel donor-π-acceptor organic dye (HIQ7) was used in dye-sensitized solar cells with a cobalt redox shuttle.

Although the involvement of ethylene in AM formation is unclear, it is considered very important for several aspects of plant growth and development. The effect of a suspected inhibitory level of ethylene was investigated to help elucidate its role in regulating the formation of AM. In particular, the morphology of AM fungal structures at various stages of the colonization process was documented. Exogenous application of 5.5 ppm ethylene to the substrate resulted in typical morphological changes to Pisum sativum and a significant reduction in the colonization of roots by the AM fungus Glomus aggregatum. Elevated substrate-ethylene did not affect the number of appressoria formed; however, it did result in the formation of abnormal appressoria, which appeared swollen and highly branched. Deformation of appressoria was correlated with a reduction of AM fungal entry into the root tissue, resulting in less colonization by intraradical hyphae and arbuscules. Colonization generally proceeded normally provided the fungal hyphae breached the epidermis, although the extension of colonization units was restricted.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus aggregatum 3aPisum sativum 3aappressoria 3adeformation 3aethylene 3agrowth and development 3ahyphae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apeas 3aplant growth 3aroots 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae1 aPeterson, Larry R.1 aGuinel, Frédérique C.0 tMycorrhiza.g2001 Aug., v. 11, no. 3 p.137-143dSpringer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0057201001203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03280naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013800168500001900306520177400325592002802099650002402127650001602151650002102167650001402188650002202202650001802224650001302242650001902255650000702274650001502281650003002296650001302326650001702339650001602356653002102372653003702393653002102430653002502451700001302476700001602489700001602505700001802521700001602539700002802555773009702583856008502680852000902765655001202774IND60690518120221119191906.0200913e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069051812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Shiqing10aUV365 induced elimination of contaminants of emerging concern in the presence of residual nitrite: Roles of reactive nitrogen species  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe presence of nitrite (NO₂⁻) is inevitable with concentrations of several mg L⁻¹ in some typical water bodies. In this study, UV at wavelength of 365 nm was investigated to degrade contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) in the presence of NO₂⁻ at environmentally relevant concentrations (0.1–5.0 mg L⁻¹). Six selected CECs with different structures were efficiently removed because of the generation of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and hydroxyl radical (HO•) from photolysis of NO₂⁻. Contributions of UV₃₆₅ photolysis, RNS, and HO• to CEC degradation in UV₃₆₅/NO₂⁻ system were calculated, and RNS were found to be the predominant species that are responsible for CEC degradation. The second major contributor is HO• for the degradation of selected CECs except for the case of sulfadiazine. Impacts of water matrix components (including dissolved oxygen, solution pH, and natural organic matter) on CEC degradation in UV₃₆₅/NO₂⁻ system were evaluated. Furthermore, evolution profiles of CECs and NO₂⁻ in UV₃₆₅/NO₂⁻ system were tracked when actual water samples were used as background, and a simultaneous removal of CECs and NO₂⁻ was observed. Transformation products of bisphenol A and carbamazepine were proposed according to the results of HPLC/MS and quantum chemistry calculations. Nitration induced by RNS and hydroxylation induced by HO• are main reactions occurred during CEC degradation in UV₃₆₅/NO₂⁻ system. Overall, UV₃₆₅ is a potential technology to remove CECs and NO₂⁻ in aquatic environment when residual NO₂⁻ is present.

The Ta-cap layer protects the Co catalyst from oxidation. This protection potentially eliminated the need for additional processing steps to control the size and activity of the Co catalyst, which are two critical parameters for CNT formation. The Ta-cap layer was observed to remain on the top of the multi-walled CNTs as a contact layer after the synthesis at 400°C. The Ta-cap layer self-formed a continuous interface between the electrode layer and the CNT layer. Besides, it can avoid the conventional chemical mechanical polishing process. The Ta-cap layer thickness was found to be the key parameter affecting CNT growth and was optimized. O₂ plasma treatment was implemented to remove residual amorphous carbon accumulated on the top of Ta-cap layer after CNT formation. The electrical properties were also measured to verify the feasibility of this CNT-via structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3aelectrical properties 3aelectrodes 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3avapors1 aWu, Hsin-Wei1 aWang, Chiu-Yen1 aChen, Szu-Ying1 aHung, Min-Hsiu1 aYew, Tri-Rung0 tCarbon.g2013 May, v. 56 p.366-373dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.01.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02102naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008300165300001600248520098500264592002801249650001101277650001301288650002001301650001801321650001001339650001101349650001801360650001401378650001401392650002601406651001301432653001701445653001001462653001101472653001201483653003001495773007701525856008101602852000901683655001201692IND60519798820221120080632.0160511e20061001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051979882DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-006-0093-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVogrin, Milan10aMicro-habitat use within a guild of newt larvae (Trituridae) in an Alpine lake  ap. 579-584.  aPopulation and ecological parameters such as numbers of larvae, microhabitat use, niche breadth and niche overlap of three species of syntopic larval newts (Alpine newt Triturus alpestris, Italian crested newt T. carnifex, and common newt T. vulgaris) were studied for two years in a small pond at 1160 m a.s.l. in NE Slovenia. Differences in microhabitat partitioning among larval newts were small. The largest niche breadth was estimated for larval T. alpestris, and the narrowest estimate was for larval T. carnifex in both years. Ecological differences seem to be very small and quite variable among sites and years. It appears that the developmental stage and size of newt larvae are more important in explaining resource partitioning than the characteristics of each species. Because of the absence of potential invertebrate predators and adult newts in the second half of the breeding season, the injuries could only be caused by intra-and interspecific predation attempts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aaltitude 3abreeding season 3ainvertebrates 3alakes 3alarvae 3amicrohabitats 3apredation 3apredators 3asalamanders and newts 3aSlovenia 0aTriturus spp 0anewts 0alarvae 0aecology 0amicrohabitat partitioning0 tBiologia.g2006 Oct. 1, v. 61, no. 5 p.579-584dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-006-0093-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245008900169300001800258520091300276592002801189650001901217650001501236650002201251650001801273650002701291650001901318653002701337653001801364653001901382653001901401773012201420856008001542852000901622655001201631IND60620886620221121230420.0181114e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062088662DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642083276762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnheier, Helmut K.10aWhat Kind of Nonprofit Sector, What Kind of Society?bComparative Policy Reflections  ap. 1082-1094.  aNonprofit organizations and the nonprofit sector more generally are part of a complex dual transition from industrial to postindustrial society and from national state to transnational policy regimes.

Methane-fed selenate reduction has proven to be of great interest for the bioremediation of selenate-contaminated waters even with the coexistence of nitrate and dissolved oxygen. However, it is unclear if the common concurrent sulfate anion affects selenate removal. To address this question, we first introduced selenate (SeO₄²⁻) as the sole influent electron acceptor in a CH₄-fed membrane biofilm reactor (CH₄-MBfR); then we added different concentrations of sulfate (SO₄²⁻). The initial selenate removal efficiency (∼90%) was decreased by 50% in the presence of 15.6 μM of sulfate and completely inhibited after loading with 171.9 μM of sulfate. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the selenate-reducing bacteria decreased after the addition of sulfate. Metagenomic sequencing showed that the abundance of genes encoding molybdenum (Mo)-dependent selenate reductase reduced by >50% when exposed to high concentrations of sulfate. Furthermore, the decrease in the total genes encoding all Mo-oxidoreductases was much greater than that of the genes encoding molybdate transporters, suggesting that the inhibition of selenate reduction by sulfate was most likely via the direct competition with molybdate for the transport system, leading to a lack of available Mo for Mo-dependent selenate reductases and thus reducing their activities. This result was confirmed by a batch test wherein the supplementation of molybdate mitigated the sulfate effect. Overall, this study shed light on the underlying mechanism of sulfate inhibition on selenate reduction and laid the foundation for applying the technology to practical wastewaters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3abioremediation 3adissolved oxygen 3agenes 3ametagenomics 3amolybdates 3amolybdenum 3anitrates 3aoxidoreductases 3apollution 3aresearch 3aselenates 3aselenium 3asulfates 3awater 0aSelenate reduction 0aSulfate 0aCompetitive inhibition 0aMolybdate transport 0aMolybdenum-dependent selenate reductase1 aLv, Pan-Long1 aNiu, Zi-Fan1 aLai, Chun-Yu1 aZhao, He-Ping0 tWater research.g2020 July 01, v. 178 p.115832-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002400188245009700212300001600309520127700325592002801602650002101630650001201651650001901663650001201682650001301694700002001707700002301727700002301750773009601773856008101869990002301950852000901973655001201982IND60091300520221120085814.0141103e20110720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009130052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bpj.2011.05.0582doi7 aPMC31367892pmcid7 a217674862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalcolm, Hannah R.10aDefining the Role of the Tension Sensor in the Mechanosensitive Channel of Small Conductance  ap. 345-352.  aMutations that alter the phenotypic behavior of the Escherichia coli mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) have been identified; however, most of these residues play critical roles in the transition between the closed and open states of the channel and are not directly involved in lipid interactions that transduce the tension response. In this study, we use molecular dynamic simulations to predict critical lipid interacting residues in the closed state of MscS. The physiological role of these residues was then investigated by performing osmotic downshock assays on MscS mutants where the lipid interacting residues were mutated to alanine. These experiments identified seven residues in the first and second transmembrane helices as lipid-sensing residues. The majority of these residues are hydrophobic amino acids located near the extracellular interface of the membrane. All of these residues interact strongly with the lipid bilayer in the closed state of MscS, but do not face the bilayer directly in structures associated with the open and desensitized states of the channel. Thus, the position of these residues relative to the lipid membrane appears related to the ability of the channel to sense tension in its different physiological states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aalanine 3ahydrophobicity 3amutants 3amutation1 aHeo, Yoon-Young1 aElmore, Donald E.1 aMaurer, Joshua A.0 tBiophysical journal.g2011 July 20, v. 101, no. 2 p.345-352dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2011.05.0583Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03653naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009400158520210600252592002802358650001702386650001002403650002502413650001902438650002102457650002602478650002002504650001502524650002502539650001202564650001302576650002402589650001902613650000902632650002002641650001202661650001402673650002902687650001502716700001502731700003002746700002102776700001602797700001802813700002002831700001402851700001802865700001602883773012902899856007403028852000903102655001203111IND60656352020221122173704.0190812e20190726xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065635202DNAL7 a10.3390/rs111517632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Songyang 10aCombining Color Indices and Textures of UAV-Based Digital Imagery for Rice LAI Estimation  aLeaf area index (LAI) is a fundamental indicator of plant growth status in agronomic and environmental studies. Due to rapid advances in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and sensor technologies, UAV-based remote sensing is emerging as a promising solution for monitoring crop LAI with great flexibility and applicability. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of combining color and texture information derived from UAV-based digital images for estimating LAI of rice (Oryza sativa L.). Rice field trials were conducted at two sites using different nitrogen application rates, varieties, and transplanting methods during 2016 to 2017. Digital images were collected using a consumer-grade UAV after sampling at key growth stages of tillering, stem elongation, panicle initiation and booting. Vegetation color indices (CIs) and grey level co-occurrence matrix-based textures were extracted from mosaicked UAV ortho-images for each plot. As a solution of using indices composed by two different textures, normalized difference texture indices (NDTIs) were calculated by two randomly selected textures. The relationships between rice LAIs and each calculated index were then compared using simple linear regression. Multivariate regression models with different input sets were further used to test the potential of combining CIs with various textures for rice LAI estimation. The results revealed that the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) based on three visible bands and the NDTI based on the mean textures derived from the red and green bands were the best for LAI retrieval in the CI and NDTI groups, respectively. Independent accuracy assessment showed that random forest (RF) exhibited the best predictive performance when combining CI and texture inputs (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.87, MAE = 0.69). This study introduces a promising solution of combining color indices and textures from UAV-based digital imagery for rice LAI estimation. Future studies are needed on finding the best operation mode, suitable ground resolution, and optimal predictive methods for practical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3acolor 3adevelopmental stages 3adigital images 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3aleaf area index 3amonitoring 3anitrogen fertilizers 3apaddies 3apanicles 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3arice 3astem elongation 3atexture 3atillering 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avegetation1 aYuan, Fei 1 aAta-UI-Karim, Syed  Tahir1 aZheng, Hengbiao 1 aCheng, Tao 1 aLiu, Xiaojun 1 aTian, Yongchao 1 aZhu, Yan 1 aCao, Weixing 1 aCao, Qiang 0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 July 26, v. 11, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs111517633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005700142245012200199520147300321592002801794596005001822650001601872650001901888650001101907650001401918650002301932650002101955650001601976650001401992650001802006650001802024650002102042651001302063700001702076700002002093700001602113700002002129773010802149856007602257852000902333655001202342IND60624321220221119220426.0181203e20181114xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062432122DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/29732862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbera, Tolera1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9335-990610aEffect of Integrated Inorganic and Organic Fertilizers on Yield and Yield Components of Barley in Liben Jawi District  aBarley is an important food and beverage crop in the highlands of Ethiopia, although intensive cultivation and suboptimal fertilizer application have caused nutrient depletion and yield decline. With this in view, integrated inorganic and organic fertilizer sources on yield and yield components of barley were studied. Ten treatments involving the sole NP, vermicompost, conventional compost, and farmyard manure based on N equivalency were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications in 2015 and 2016 cropping seasons. Significantly higher grain yield and biomass yield of barley were obtained with the application of sole recommended NP and the integrated use of 50 : 50% vermicompost and conventional compost with recommended NP. Mean grain yield of 2567 and 2549 kg·ha⁻¹ barley was obtained from application of 50 :50% conventional compost and vermicompost based on N equivalence with recommended NP fertilizer rate, which markedly reduce the cost of chemical NP fertilizer required for the production of barley. The economic analysis confirmed the profitability of the integrated use of 50 : 50% conventional compost and vermicompost with recommended NP fertilizer for barley production. Therefore, the integrated use of 50 : 50% conventional compost and vermicompost based on N equivalency with recommended NP fertilizer was recommended for sustainable barley production in Chelia district and similar agroecology.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Resources Management Research Process 3aagroecology 3aanimal manures 3abarley 3abeverages 3abiomass production 3afertilizer rates 3agrain yield 3ahighlands 3aprofitability 3avermicomposts 3ayield components 3aEthiopia1 aTufa, Tolcha1 aMidega, Tesfaye1 aKumbi, Haji1 aTola, Buzuayehu0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2018 Nov. 14, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/29732863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009500166300001600261520100700277592002801284650002001312650002501332650001301357650002701370650001401397650001601411650001501427650001001442650001901452650001001471650001901481650002201500650000901522650001701531650001701548650000901565650001401574700001701588700002201605700002501627700002101652773011401673856008201787990002301869852000901892655001201901IND60084560020221123025324.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etap.2013.07.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaswal, Amita10aTherapeutic potential of thymoquinone against anti-tuberculosis drugs induced liver damage  ap. 779-786.  aHepatotoxicity is the most serious adverse effect related to tuberculosis treatment which interrupts the successful completion of tuberculosis treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess therapeutic effect of thymoquinone (TQ) against anti-tuberculosis drugs (ATD) induced liver damage. Rats were treated with ATD for 8 weeks (3 days/week) as given for the treatment of TB. This was followed by therapy of TQ for 8 weeks (3 days/week). Administration of combined ATD induced hepatotoxicity was evident from a significant elevation in the AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, albumin, cholesterol, urea, uric acid, creatinine, LPO and decreased activities of enzymes. These altered variables were significantly reversed toward control after treatment with TQ. Histological studies also supported biochemical findings. Results of this study strongly indicated protective effect of TQ and thus, can be expected as promising protective agent in maintenance of normal hepatic function during treatment with ATD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aalanine transaminase 3aalbumins 3aaspartate transaminase 3abilirubin 3acholesterol 3acreatinine 3adrugs 3ahepatotoxicity 3aliver 3aliver function 3aprotective effect 3arats 3atherapeutics 3atuberculosis 3aurea 3auric acid1 aSinha, Neelu1 aBhadauria, Monika1 aShrivastava, Sadhana1 aShukla, Sangeeta0 tEnvironmental toxicology and pharmacology.g2013 Nov., v. 36, no. 3 p.779-786dElsevier B.V.x1382-66897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2013.07.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01630naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245005300164300001600217500001100233520063600244592002800880650001600908650001500924650001100939650002100950650001300971650001500984650001700999700001401016700001601030700001701046700001501063700001501078773007001093856008401163852000901247655001201256IND60092345520221119074355.0141103e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009234552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2012.12.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Tian10aX-ray induced carbon coating on carbon nanotubes  ap. 385-388.  aLETTER  aThe formation of a carbon coating on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was observed in X-ray microscopy experiments. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy showed that the coating originated from the lacey carbon on the substrate, which was heated by the X-ray beam and then deposited on CNTs. The coating shows some fingerprint features around the π* peak of the C 1s XANES spectrum, which were widely observed in literature but attributed to chemical modification or interfacial interaction in carbon nanomaterials. Our results suggest that the X-ray induced coating could be a possible reason for those XANES features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3amicroscopy 3aspectroscopy1 aBai, Lili1 aLiu, Jinyin1 aZhao, Guanqi1 aSun, Xuhui1 aZhong, Jun0 tCarbon.g2013 May, v. 56 p.385-388dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2012.12.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100001700183245014500200506007600345520132500421592002801746596005501774506003701829650002201866650001701888650001601905650002001921650002801941650002001969650001501989650001802004700005802022700002802080700001902108700001702127700002602144700002502170773010302195856007602298852000902374655001202383IND60624321320221207092340.0181203e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062432132DNAL7 a10.1155/2018/30245322doi7 aPMC60312002pmcid7 a300269052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWahyuni, Sri10aCharacterization of Seminiferous Epithelium Stages in the Wild Javan Muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak muntjak) Using the Tubular Morphology Method  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStages of the seminiferous epithelium of the testis of the wild Javan muntjac (Muntiacus muntjak muntjak) in hard antler period were characterized based on the tubular morphology method. The number and the relative frequencies of seminiferous epithelium stages and the morphometry of germinal cell nuclei were identified microscopically. We identified eight stages of seminiferous epithelium in testicular tissue of the Javan muntjac and found that the relative frequencies of stages I to VIII were 14.87, 15.12, 17.75, 6.87, 7.37, 12.37, 13, and 12.62%, respectively. The diameter of the nuclei of germinal cells varied in each stage of seminiferous epithelium. Diplotene-stage primary spermatocytes had prominent and large nuclei ~8.97 ± 1.0 μm in stages III and IV. Pachytene primary spermatocytes appeared in most stages, except stage IV, whereas leptotene- and diplotene-stage primary spermatocytes were found in stages I and II, and III and IV, respectively. Round spermatids were observed in stages IV to VIII and in stage I but were absent in stages II and III, while elongated spermatids were observed in all stages except stage I. Our findings show that the stages of seminiferous epithelium in the Javan muntjac are similar to those found in neotropical cervids, small ruminants, and other domestic animals.  aPublisher supplied data  cDirectorate General of High Education of Indonesia0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMuntiacus muntjak 3acell nucleus 3amorphometry 3apachytene stage 3aseminiferous epithelium 3asmall ruminants 3aspermatids 3aspermatocytes1 aGholib, Gholib1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8139-97431 aAdnyane, I Ketut Mudite1 aAgil, Muhammad1 aHamny, Hamny1 aAgungpriyono, Srihadi1 aYusuf, Tuty Laswardi0 tVeterinary medicine international.g2018 June 20, v. 2018dHindawiwJournal:21537x2042-00487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/30245323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010000163300001800263520115300281592002801434650002001462650002001482650001101502650002301513650002201536650001001558650003101568650001501599650000901614650000901623650001001632650001201642650001301654700002101667700001701688773011601705856008201821990002301903852000901926655001201935IND60084560120221123025213.0141101e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008456012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.etap.2013.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJan, Janja10aLevels and distribution of organochlorine pollutants in primary dental tissues and bone of lamb  ap. 1040-1045.  aThis study examined the bioconcentration of selected organochlorine pollutants, tetra- and hexa-chlorobiphenyls with planar (PCB-80, PCB-169) and non-planar (PCB-54, PCB-155) structure, and persistent organochlorine pesticides with planar [hexachlorobenzene (HCB)] and non-planar [1,1-bis (4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene (4,4′-DDE)] structure in primary dental tissues (pulp, dentine, and enamel) and mandibular bone of lactationally exposed lambs, and compared it with the organochlorines distribution pattern in permanent dental tissues and bone. Also, the role of pollutants physicochemical properties and tissue specific characteristics in the bioconcentration was assessed. Residual levels of individual pollutants were analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron-capture detection. Our results showed that transfer of organochlorines to primary hard dental tissues was higher than to permanent hard dental tissues. Metabolically more stable, planar, and toxic organochlorines (e.g. PCB-169 and HCB) predominated in primary hard dental tissues, where they may represent a potential risk for developmental dental defects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDE (pesticide) 3abioaccumulation 3aenamel 3agas chromatography 3ahexachlorobenzene 3alambs 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3apulp 3arisk 3ateeth 3atissues 3atoxicity1 aUršič, Matjaž1 aVrecl, Milka0 tEnvironmental toxicology and pharmacology.g2013 Nov., v. 36, no. 3 p.1040-1045dElsevier B.V.x1382-66897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2013.09.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245011200170300001600282520076300298592002801061650001001089650001901099650000901118650001501127650001301142650001201155650001201167650001701179650001401196650001901210653001401229653000801243653001901251653001201270700002101282700002501303700001901328773011301347856008301460852000901543655001201552IND60619849820221117183910.0200612e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061984982DNAL7 a10.2478/macvetrev-2018-00142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGjurovski, Ivica10aPoisoning of Dogs in the Republic of Macedonia- Pathomorphological Changes and the Impact on Animal Welfare  ap. 203-207.  aThe illegal poisoning of dogs and other domestic and wild animals presents a worldwide problem causing animal suffering and R.

However, complete understandings of cholesterol homeostasis in the cell remains elusive, partly due to the wide variability in reported values for intra- and intermembrane cholesterol transport rates. Here, we used time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering to measure cholesterol intermembrane exchange and intramembrane flipping rates, in situ, without recourse to any external fields or compounds. We found significantly slower transport kinetics than reported by previous studies, particularly for intramembrane flipping where our measured rates are several orders of magnitude slower. We unambiguously demonstrate that the presence of chemical tags and extraneous compounds employed in traditional kinetic measurements dramatically affect the system thermodynamics, accelerating cholesterol transport rates by an order of magnitude. To our knowledge, this work provides new insights into cholesterol transport process disorders, and challenges many of the underlying assumptions used in most cholesterol transport studies to date.  aPublisher supplied data 3acholesterol 3ahomeostasis 3aphysiological transport 3athermodynamics1 aPorcar, L.1 aWoodka, A.C.1 aButler, P.D.1 aPerez-Salas, U.0 tBiophysical journal.g2011 July 20, v. 101, no. 2 p.370-377dElsevier Inc.x0006-34957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2011.06.0143Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02752naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245012100168500001900289520157500308592002801883650001201911650001801923650001301941650001701954650001001971650002301981653002002004653004002024653002202064653001402086653002102100700001602121700002002137700001802157773009702175856008502272852000902357655001202366IND60690518520221119192200.0200913e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069051852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimunič, Urh14aThe limitations of hydrodynamic removal of biofilms from the dead-ends in a model drinking water distribution system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBiofilm formation and removal from dead-ends is a particularly difficult and understudied area of water distribution system biology. In this work, we have built a model drinking water distribution system to probe the effect of different hydrodynamic flow regimes on biofilm formation and removal in the main pipe and in the dead-end. The test rig was built to include all major drinking water distribution system components with materials and dimensions used in standard plumbing systems. We have simulated the effect of stagnant, laminar, turbulent, and intense turbulent flushing conditions on the growth and removal of biofilms from the main pipe and the dead-end. The growth of the biofilm in the main pipe was not prevented at a volumetric flow rate of 9.4 L min⁻¹ and flow velocity of 2 m s⁻¹. Mature biofilms were more difficult to remove. Biofilms grown under shear stress conditions could withstand significantly higher shear stresses than those to which they were exposed to during growth. The biofilms grew twice as fast in the dead-end when flow in the main pipe was turbulent compared to stagnant conditions. Biofilms in the dead-end were not affected by the flushing conditions in the main pipe (Q = 52 L min⁻¹, Re = 9.0 · 10⁴). The computational fluid dynamics simulation suggests that biofilms cannot be hydrodynamically removed from the dead-end at depths that are larger than one pipe diameter. Biofilms beyond this limit present a possible source for reinoculation and recolonization of the rest of the water distribution system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3ahydrodynamics 3aresearch 3ashear stress 3awater 3awater distribution 0aBiofilm control 0aDrinking water distribution systems 0aHydrodynamic flow 0aDead-ends 0aEscherichia coli1 aPipp, Peter1 aDular, Matevž,1 aStopar, David0 tWater research.g2020 July 01, v. 178 p.115838-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009200167300001400259500001500273520100000288592002801288650001201316650001701328650001501345650000901360650002201369650001101391650001301402650001601415650001801431650001301449650002701462650002001489650002301509650002101532653002601553653001001579653001901589653002501608653001801633653002501651653001901676700001501695700001701710700003001727700002401757700002901781700001801810700001601828773011201844856008601956852000902042655001202051IND60088090720221120095634.0190318e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008809072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2013.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArchana, G.10aPreparation and characterization of mucilage polysaccharide for biomedical applications  ap. 89-94.  a2019-12-06  aIn the present investigation, the polysaccharide/mucilage from waste of Abelmoscus esculentus by modification in hot extraction using two different solvents (Acetone, Methanol) were extracted, characterized and further compared with seaweed polysaccharide for their potential applications. The percentage yield, emulsifying capacity and swelling index of this mucilage were determined. The macro algae and okra waste, gave high % yield (22.2% and 8.6% respectively) and good emulsifying capacity (EC%=52.38% and 54.76% respectively) with acetone, compared to methanol (11.3% and 0.28%; EC%=50%) (PH=7) while swelling index was greater with methanol than acetone extracts respectively. The infrared (I.R.) spectrum of the samples was recorded to investigate the chemical structure of mucilage.

Thus, monitoring E. coli concentrations is critical to evaluate current conditions, determine restoration effectiveness, and inform model development and calibration. An often overlooked component of these monitoring and modeling activities is understanding the inherent random and systematic uncertainty present in measured data. In this research, a review and subsequent analysis was performed to identify, document, and analyze measurement uncertainty of E. coli data collected in stream flow and stormwater runoff as individual discrete samples or throughout a single runoff event. Data on the uncertainty contributed by sample collection, sample preservation/storage, and laboratory analysis in measured E. coli concentrations were compiled and analyzed, and differences in sampling method and data quality scenarios were compared. The analysis showed that: (1) manual integrated sampling produced the lowest random and systematic uncertainty in individual samples, but automated sampling typically produced the lowest uncertainty when sampling throughout runoff events; (2) sample collection procedures often contributed the highest amount of uncertainty, although laboratory analysis introduced substantial random uncertainty and preservation/storage introduced substantial systematic uncertainty under some scenarios; and (3) the uncertainty in measured E. coli concentrations was greater than that of sediment and nutrients, but the difference was not as great as may be assumed. This comprehensive analysis of uncertainty in E. coli concentrations measured in streamflow and runoff should provide valuable insight for designing E. coli monitoring projects, reducing uncertainty in quality assurance efforts, regulatory and policy decision making, and fate and transport modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3abirds 3abridges (infrastructure) 3adecision making 3afate and transport models 3aindicator species 3aissues and policy 3amicrobial contamination 3amonitoring 3anesting 3anutrients 3aquality control 3asediments 3astormwater 3astream flow 3astreams 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aE. coli 0aUncertainty 0aTMDL 0aError propagation 0aMonitoring1 aHathaway, J.M.1 aWagner, K.L.1 aWolfe, J.E.1 aKarthikeyan, R.1 aFrancesconi, W.1 aMcCarthy, D.T.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2016 Mar., v. 534 p.524-533dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.01.0403Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/619843Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/313192.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle01451naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245008300162300001600245520063800261592002800899650001500927650002200942650001900964773013000983856007501113852000901188655001201197IND60693499520221116144510.0200507e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069349952DNAL7 a10.4296/cwrj28034812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChatila, Jean G.10aMuskingum Method, EXTRAN and ONE-D for Routing Unsteady Flows in Open Channels  ap. 481-498.  aIn the present study the numerical modelling aspects of unsteady flow in simple and compound channels are examined through the application to a laboratory data set of the simple hydrologic routing method Muskingum and the unsteady flow dynamic routing models EXTRAN and ONE-D.

Significant differences in weight, body length and tail length were recorded in adult and subadult shrews. Adult individuals and males had higher mean somatometric values (apart from tail length of subadults). The hind foot length was the least variable characteristic, which can be considered as the most stable taxonomic somatic characteristic of shrews. Weight and body length varied considerably. Values of somatic characteristics in S. araneus and S. minutus increased with increasing altitude, apart from hind foot length in S. araneus, which decreased with increasing altitude. The values of somatic characteristics declined with increasing continentality, but tail length gradually increased in the direction west — east at the highland level. Sorex minutus was characterized by the greatest reproductive activity (length of reproductive cycle April–October, average number of embryos 6.97). The lowest reproductive activity was observed in S. alpinus (average number of embryos 5.72). The mating season of S. araneus began at the end of March and ended in August with an average number of embryos of 6.12.  aPublisher supplied data 3ashrews 3aSorex araneus 3amorphometry 3abody weight 3amales 3atail 3abreeding season 3abody length 3aaltitude 3aadults 3afeet 3aSlovakia 0aSlovakia 0ahypsographic level 0aSorex sp 0areproduction 0amating season 0ashrew 0asomatometry1 aAmbros, Michał,0 tBiologia.g2006 Oct. 1, v. 61, no. 5 p.611-620dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-006-0098-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03855naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100006400190245008900254300001400343506007600357520210400433592002802537506003702565650002502602650002602627650000902653650001902662650001102681650001302692650001302705650001502718650002902733650002302762650001202785650001502797653002002812653002302832653002502855653002202880700002802902700003002930700002702960700002802987700002203015700002103037700002103058700002503079773010403104856008403208852000903292655001203301IND60530689320221207095118.0180905e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053068932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2016.03.0362doi7 aPMC49088262pmcid7 a270955962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalmon, Cristiane R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3304-506410aGlobal proteome profiling of dental cementum under experimentally-induced apposition  ap. 12-23.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDental cementum (DC) covers the tooth root and has important functions in tooth attachment and position. DC can be lost to disease, and regeneration is currently unpredictable due to limited understanding of DC formation. This study used a model of experimentally-induced apposition (EIA) in mice to identify proteins associated with new DC formation. Mandibular first molars were induced to super-erupt for 6 and 21days after extracting opposing maxillary molars. Decalcified and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mandible sections were prepared for laser capture microdissection. Microdissected protein extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the data submitted to repeated measure ANOVA test (RM-ANOVA, alpha=5%). A total of 519 proteins were identified, with 97 (18.6%) proteins found exclusively in EIA sites and 50 (9.6%) proteins exclusively expressed in control sites. Fifty six (10.7%) proteins were differentially regulated by RM-ANOVA (p<0.05), with 24 regulated by the exclusive effect of EIA (12 proteins) or the interaction between EIA and time (12 proteins), including serpin 1a, procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer, tenascin X (TNX), and asporin (ASPN). In conclusion, proteomic analysis demonstrated significantly altered protein profile in DC under EIA, providing new insights on DC biology and potential candidates for tissue engineering applications.Dental cementum (DC) is a mineralized tissue that covers the tooth root surface and has important functions in tooth attachment and position.

This approach identified proteins associated with new cementum formation that may be targets for promoting cementum regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3aliquid chromatography 3amice 3amineralization 3amodels 3aproteins 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atissue engineering 3atissues 3atooth root 0aDental cementum 0aProteomic analysis 0aPeriodontal ligament 0aTissue apposition1 aGiorgetti, Ana Paula O.1 aPaes Leme, Adriana Franco1 aDomingues, Romênia R.1 aSallum, Enilson Antonio1 aAlves, Marcelo C.1 aKolli, Tamara N.1 aFoster, Brian L.1 aNociti, Francisco H.0 tJournal of proteomics.g2016 June 01, v. 141 p.12-23dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12134x1874-39197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2016.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01985naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014300174300001600317520077300333592002801106650003001134650001501164650001101179650001301190650001101203650001601214650001801230650001801248650001401266653002801280653001101308653001001319653001401329653001001343653003001353700002501383773007701408856008101485852000901566655001201575IND60519799420221120080646.0160511e20061001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051979942DNAL7 a10.2478/s11756-006-0099-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPakdeenarong, Noppakun10aEffects of All-trans retinoic acid on germ cell development of embryos and larvae of the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii  ap. 621-625.  aEmbryos of the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, were treated with 1, 10 or 50 µg ml−1 all-trans retinoic acid (AtRA) for 2 days. Survival and hatching rates were not affected. However, an increase in the number of primordial germ cells (PGCs), progenitors of gametes, and a slightly more advanced stage of the gonads were found in those treated with 10 or 50 µg ml−1 AtRA. Newly hatched larvae were treated with 0.1, 0.5 or 1 µg ml−1 AtRA for 2 days. Survival rates were lower in those treated with 0.5 or 1 µg ml−1 AtRA; nevertheless, the gonads were slightly more developed. The results indicated that AtRA, an active metabolite of vitamin A, affected germ cell and gonad development of embryos and the larvae of giant freshwater prawn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrobrachium rosenbergii 3agerm cells 3agonads 3ahatching 3alarvae 3ametabolites 3aretinoic acid 3asurvival rate 3avitamin A 0aAll-trans retinoic acid 0aembryo 0alarva 0agerm cell 0aprawn 0aMacrobrachium rosenbergii1 aDamrongphol, Praneet0 tBiologia.g2006 Oct. 1, v. 61, no. 5 p.621-625dVersitax1336-95637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-006-0099-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02843naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011800166300001600284500001900300520119300319592002801512650001801540650002601558650001901584650002001603650001401623650000901637650004301646650001401689650001801703650001401721650001701735650001401752650001201766650001901778650000901797650002001806650001101826650002001837650002701857650001701884650001701901650001501918650000901933700001901942700001901961700001501980700001801995700002102013700001802034773012302052856008102175852000902256655001202265IND60730818220221121183834.0210312e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073081822DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-020-9246-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLow, Kyleyoung10aPrevalence and risk assessment of antibiotics in riverine estuarine waters of Larut and Sangga Besar River, Perak  ap. 122-134.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAntibiotics released into the environment through anthropogenic activities exert selective pressure, driving bacteria towards increasing antimicrobial resistance. The prevalence of antibiotics and the ecological risks posed in the riverine estuarine of Larut River and Sangga Besar River, which included wastewater effluents from hospital, zoo, and poultry slaughterhouse sources were investigated. Solid phase extraction (SPE) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass chromatography (HPLC-MS/MS) were used to extract and quantify the antibiotic residues from 22 antibiotics belonging to six major antibiotic classes (sulfonamide, macrolide, fluoroquinolone, phenicol, trimethoprim, and tetracycline). Sixteen antibiotic residues were detected with concentrations ranging from limit of detection (LOD) to 1 262.3 ng/L. Fluoroquinolones and macrolides were the most frequently detected compounds. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, and ofloxacin detected in hospital and zoo effluents posed a high risk to algae while tetracycline had low to medium ecological risks toward all the relevant organisms from aquatic environments (algae, invertebrate Daphnia magna, and fish).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aantibiotic resistance 3aclarithromycin 3adetection limit 3aestuaries 3afish 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahospitals 3ainvertebrates 3alimnology 3aoceanography 3aofloxacin 3apoultry 3ariparian areas 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3aslaughterhouses 3asolid phase extraction 3atetracycline 3atrimethoprim 3awastewater 3azoos1 aChai, Layching1 aLee, Choonweng1 aZhang, Gan1 aZhang, Ruijie1 aVahab, Vaezzadeh1 aBong, Chuiwei0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2021 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.122-134dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-020-9246-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02883naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010300167500001900270520160000289592002801889650002401917650001101941650001401952650001801966650001101984650001101995650002602006650001302032650001702045650001702062650001902079650001502098650001002113653002202123653003002145653002502175653001002200700002202210700001402232773009702246856008502343852000902428655001202437IND60690518820221119191926.0200913e20200701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069051882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRobles, Ivan10aWaste-to-Resource value chain optimisation: Combining spatial, chemical and technoeconomic aspects  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDue to complex composition of carbohydrates, lipid, protein, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, wastewater (WW) and organic fraction municipal solid waste (OFMSW) represent nutrient and carbon rich resources. Conventionally, value chains in the waste sector have considered OFMSW and WW as unwanted by-products as opposed to potential valuable resources. Full exploitation of these resources calls for a value chain transformation towards proactive resource recovery. This study focuses on the waste supply chain optimisation to recover value added products from OFMSW.The research leads to a systems-modelling approach, which integrates spatial data analyses, mathematical mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimisation and technology performance evaluation to inform the design of waste-to-resource value chains. A UK based study on OFMSW is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the approach. The study captures variation in OFMSW quantity and composition, incorporating over 600 existing anaerobic digestion (AD) operational plants in the UK, while potential sites for new waste-recovery facilities are identified, accounting for transportation and logistics, using a GIS-based analysis. Key outcomes are analysed (technology type, size, location, logistical connections), placing emphasis on the need to consider the value of the resource recovery potential over the lifetime of an AD or thermochemical treatment facility in the design process. Such an approach offers a promising pathway for tackling the open challenges currently hindering the waste-to-resource transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3acarbon 3acellulose 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3alipids 3amunicipal solid waste 3aresearch 3aspatial data 3asupply chain 3atransportation 3awastewater 3awater 0aResource recovery 0aMathematical optimisation 0aGIS spatial Analysis 0aOFMSW1 aO’Dwyer, Edward1 aGuo, Miao0 tWater research.g2020 July 01, v. 178 p.115842-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2020.1158423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011800165300001800283520145800301592002801759650001501787650002001802650002801822650002101850650001501871650000901886650001301895650001301908650001801921650003101939650002401970700001701994700001602011700001902027700001102046700001602057773011702073856008102190852000902271655001202280IND60082007720221120235611.0150211e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008200772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-014-7904-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Chun-Xuan12aA novel electrochemical DNA biosensor construction based on layered CuS–graphene composite and Au nanoparticles  ap. 6943-6951.  aA novel CuS–graphene (CuS-Gr) composite was synthesized to achieve excellent electrochemical properties for application as a DNA electrochemical biosensor. CuS-Gr composite was prepared by a hydrothermal method, in which two-dimensional graphene served as a two-dimensional conductive skeleton to support CuS nanoparticles. A sensitive electrochemical DNA biosensor was fabricated by immobilizing single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) labeled at the 5′ end using 6-mercapto-1-hexane (HS-ssDNA) on the surface of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) to form ssDNA-S–AuNPs/CuS-Gr, and hybridization sensing was done in phosphate buffer. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were performed for the characterization of the modified electrodes. Differential pulse voltammetry was applied to monitor the DNA hybridization using an [Fe(CN)₆]³⁻/⁴⁻solution as a probe. Under optimum conditions, the biosensor developed exhibited a good linear relationship between the current and the logarithm of the target DNA concentration ranging from 0.001 to 1 nM, with a low detection limit of 0.1 pM (3σ/S). The biosensor exhibited high selectivity to differentiate one-base-mismatched DNA and three-base-mismatched DNA. The results indicated that the sensing platform based on CuS-Gr provides a stable and conductive interface for electrochemical detection of DNA hybridization, and could easily be extended to the detection of other nucleic acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3agraphene 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anucleic acid hybridization 3asingle-stranded DNA1 aZhai, Qiu-Ge1 aLiu, Yu-Jie1 aHuang, Ke-Jing1 aLu, Lu1 aLi, Ke Xin,0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2014 Nov., v. 406, no. 27 p.6943-6951dSpringer-Verlagx1618-26427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-014-7904-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245006300168300001800231520104500249592002801294650001401322650002401336650001201360650001901372650001301391653001901404653002501423653001601448653002001464773012301484856008001607852000901687655001201696IND60620887220221116143029.0181114e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062088722DNAL7 a10.1177/00027642093315292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrank, Kenneth A.10aQuasi-TiesbDirecting Resources to Members of a Collective  ap. 1613-1645.  aResearch on social capital has found that individuals who access resources through social relations gain competitive advantage and systems with high levels or desirable distributions of social capital are more effective. These effects depend on actors allocating resources to others in their social system at-large instead of to others with whom they share specific social relationships. It is hypothesized that actors who identify with others in a social system as a collective are more likely to allocate resources uniformly throughout the system. Thus, identification with the collective can serve as a quasi-tie, directing the allocation of resources, but not defined by specific social relations. Findings from a longitudinal, multilevel network study of teachers' use of computers support multiple theories of resource allocation and, in particular, confirm that teachers who identify with the collectives of their schools are less likely to favor close colleagues and close colleagues of close colleagues, in their provision of help.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputers 3aresource allocation 3aschools 3asocial capital 3ateachers 0aidentification 0aresource allocations 0asocial ties 0asocial exchange0 tAmerican behavioral scientist.g2009 Aug., v. 52, no. 12 p.1613-1645dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2328x0002-76427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00027642093315293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01553naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245013900161300001600300520053100316592002800847650001300875650001100888650001200899650001400911650000900925650001300934650001100947650001600958651001100974651001600985773013001001856007501131852000901206655001201215IND60693499720221116144553.0200507e20030101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069349972DNAL7 a10.4296/cwrj28045672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMote, Philip W.10aTwentieth-Century Fluctuations and Trends in Temperature, Precipitation, and Mountain Snowpack in the Georgia Basin-Puget Sound Region  ap. 567-585.  aClimate and snow data for the United States and Canada are combined and used in this paper to describe climate trends in the ecologically- and economically-vital land areas of the estuaries of Georgia Basin and Puget Sound.

P.10aUnravelling the physical, technological and economic factors driving the intensification trajectories of livestock systems  ap. 1652-1661.  aOver the past 100 years, the French livestock sector has experienced significant intensification that has occurred in different ways across the country. Specifically, France has changed from a homogeneous state with most of the agricultural area covered by grasslands and a uniform distribution of animals, to a heterogeneous state characterised by an uneven distribution of grasslands, livestock numbers and livestock species. Studying the dynamics of this change is fundamental to the identification of drivers that shaped the various intensification trajectories and led to these different states, as well as to the prediction of future changes. Hence, the objective of this study was to characterise the trajectories undertaken by the French livestock sector to understand the intensification process and the role of socioeconomic, land use and production-related factors. A set of 10 indicators was employed to analyse the main changes between 1938 and 2010, using principal component analysis followed by a clustering of the 88 French departments. Between 1938 and 2010, significant increases in farm size, mechanisation, labour productivity and the stocking rates of monogastrics enabled the French livestock sector to double its production. The most important changes involved mechanisation (with the number of tractors per hectare (ha) rising from 0.0012 to 0.0053), labour productivity (improving from 8.6 to 35.9 ha/worker), livestock production (e.g. milk production increasing from 758 to 1856 l/ha of fodder area) and stocking rates (rising from 0.57 to 0.98 livestock units (LU) per ha). The increased heterogeneity apparent in the patterns of change throughout France’s departments was captured by clustering four trajectories. Two trajectories were formed by departments that experienced strong specialisation towards livestock production, with one type mainly orientated towards high-intensive dairy, poultry and pig landless production systems, and a second type orientated towards extensive beef grazing production systems. Another trajectory corresponded to departments that specialised in crop production with high labour productivity; mixed crop-livestock systems were still maintained at the margins of this group of departments. The fourth trajectory corresponded to the lowest livestock population and productivity levels. The increase in mechanisation during the period was important but uniform, with no significant differences between the trajectories. This typology of intensification trajectories will enable the targeting of specific areas in which the detrimental impacts of livestock intensification require mitigation and provide guidance for future livestock sector developments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3acrop production 3aeconomic factors 3afarm size 3aforage 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3aherd size 3alabor productivity 3aland use 3alivestock and meat industry 3alivestock production 3amechanization 3amilk production 3apoultry 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3aproduction technology 3astocking rate 3aswine 3atractors 3aFrance 0alivestock farming systems 0adrivers of change 0aintensification dynamics 0aland use change 0along-term trajectories1 aRyschawy, J.1 aBonaudo, T.1 aGabrielle, B.1 aTichit, M.0 tAnimal.g2018 Aug., v. 12, no. 8 p.1652-1661dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3938811x1751-732X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17517311170031233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245015300165300001800318500002000336520152500356592002801881650002501909650002001934650002001954650001201974650002101986650001402007650001302021650001802034650000902052650000902061650000702070650001502077650002502092650001602117650001202133650002302145650001402168650002702182650001802209700001702227773012702244856007402371852000902445655001202454IND60571607320221120112330.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057160732DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.127202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad Malik, Mudasir10aEffect on Physicochemical and Thermal Properties of Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) Starch by Acid Hydrolysis Combined with Heat Moisture Treatment  ap. 1352-1363.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aStarch extracted from buckwheat was modified by acid hydrolysis combined with heat moisture treatment (AH‐HMT) and evaluated for physicochemical and thermal properties. A three‐level, five‐factor central composite design was used to study the individual and combined effects of pH (2 to 4), moisture content (25 to 35%) and temperature (90 to 110C). After modification swelling power and oil binding capacity decreased, whereas solubility, amylose content and water‐binding capacity increased. Textural properties were found to be largely affected by modification. Post AH‐HMT, a decline in peak viscosity (PV) was noticed while trough and final viscosity were increased. It was also observed that AH‐HMT increased onset (Tₒ), peak (Tₚ) and conclusion (Tc) temperature to 87.04C, 93.60C and 95.88C, respectively. However, a significant decrease in enthalpy (ΔH) from 1.046 to 0.211 J/g was observed. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The present study deals with the combined effect of two modifications on functionality of buckwheat starch. Native starch possesses some inherent properties which limits their application in food industry. The combined effect of both the modification could improve the properties and reduce the side effect of one another. A better understanding of the effect of combined modification on the properties of buckwheat starch can lead to the development of tailor‐made starches for specific applications opening the avenues for better exploitation for this cheaply available crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aacid hydrolysis 3aadverse effects 3aamylose 3abinding capacity 3abuckwheat 3aenthalpy 3afood industry 3aheat 3aoils 3apH 3asolubility 3aswelling (materials) 3atemperature 3atexture 3athermal properties 3aviscosity 3awater binding capacity 3awater content1 aSaxena, D.C.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2016 Dec., v. 40, no. 6 p.1352-1363dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.127203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001600142245016200158300001800320500002000338520175800358592002802116650001102144650002002155650001002175650001302185650001102198650001602209650001102225651001202236700005802248700001502306773013202321856007702453852000902530655001202539IND60789891320221118104853.0220822e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078989132DNAL7 a10.1002/2017JB0140672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaddadi, B.10aMagma storage beneath Grímsvötn volcano, Iceland, constrained by clinopyroxene‐melt thermobarometry and volatiles in melt inclusions and groundmass glass  ap. 6984-6997.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBasalt eruptions at Grímsvötn volcano, Iceland, are generally of low intensity; however, occasionally, an order of magnitude larger eruptions occur. In order to discuss the reasons for this difference, the degassing budget of S and Cl and crystallization conditions of the eruptive magma were determined from volatile concentration measured in melt inclusion (MI) and groundmass glass and thermobarometry, respectively. Tephra of two of the largest historical eruptions (2011 and 1873) and two much smaller eruptions (2004 and 1823) were investigated. Sulfur and Cl concentrations are higher in groundmass glass of the smaller eruptions due to incomplete outgassing caused by melt quenching in contact with glacial water. Sulfur concentration and degassing budget correlate with erupted magma volumes. Higher volatile concentrations of MI from the larger eruptions reflect important recharge of gas‐rich magma from depth. The recharge causes a high‐magnitude eruption followed by increased eruption frequency over the following decades. Pressure and temperature estimates of crystallization are obtained through equilibrium clinopyroxene‐glass pairs, where crystals adjacent to, and in textural equilibrium with, both groundmass glass and that of MI were measured. An average crystallization pressure of 4 ± 1 kbar corresponding to approximately 15 ± 5 km depth was obtained together with a considerable temperature range, 1065–1175°C. Similar crystallization depths are obtained for the basalt of the 2014–2015 Bárðarbunga rifting event and to a low resistivity layer revealed by magnetotelluric surveys. Therefore, an important magma storage depth is inferred at lower crustal depth above the center of the Iceland mantle plume.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3acrystallization 3aglass 3aresearch 3asulfur 3atemperature 3atephra 3aIceland1 aSigmarsson, O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0639-61871 aLarsen, G.0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2017 Sept., v. 122, no. 9 p.6984-6997dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017JB0140673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03506naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007000164300001800234500002000252520193400272592002802206650002002234650002102254650002702275650002602302650001202328650002602340650002902366650001402395650001502409650001802424650001902442650001602461650001102477650002802488650001902516650003702535650001802572650001902590650000702609650002302616650002002639650001802659650002002677650002302697650001302720700002102733773012702754856007402881852000902955655001202964IND60571607420221121175540.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057160742DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.127312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarabiyikli, Şeniz10aInhibitory Effect of Unripe Grape Products on Foodborne Pathogens  ap. 1459-1465.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLow quality unripe grapes can be processed into various products such as verjuice and sour grape sauce. In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of five verjuice and five sour grape sauce samples on Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, S. Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined. The microbiological quality of the samples and the presence of the test cultures in them were determined before analysis. The pH, titratable acidity (%), and the MIC values of the samples ranged from 2.14 to 2.74, 2.29–7.09%, and, 1:2(50%)−1:16(6.25%), respectively. The MIC values of the neutralized unripe grape products (UGPs) were determined, and it was detected that the inhibitory effects of UGPs mainly depends on the acidity. The inhibitory effect is related to the concentration and it decreases through dilution. It was concluded that UGPs could be considered as good alternatives for functional and safe foods with their antimicrobial properties. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In recent years, consumer demands have increased regarding safety and natural foods. Food producers have been avoiding the use of chemical preservatives, and tend to use nonthermally processed foods. Thus, researchers have been studying on examining natural antimicrobial agents to ensure food safety. The natural antimicrobial agents may be obtained from animals, microorganisms, and plants. The effects of plant based antimicrobials are based on the composition of organic acid and phenolic compounds in the materials. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of unripe grape products while they were neutralized and un‐neutralized were investigated to evaluate their potential as natural antimicrobials in this study. While the unripe grape products are widely used as acidifying and flavoring agents in foods and beverages, they are also considered as natural antimicrobial agents on foodborne pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aanimals 3aanti-infective agents 3aantimicrobial properties 3abeverages 3aflavorings 3afood industry 3afood pathogens 3afood safety 3agrapes 3amicrobiological quality 3amicroorganisms 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3anatural foods 3aneutralization 3apH 3aphenolic compounds 3aplants (botany) 3apreservatives 3aprocessed foods 3atitratable acidity 3averjuice1 aÖncül, Nilgün0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2016 Dec., v. 40, no. 6 p.1459-1465dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.127313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01477naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245006900191300001400260520051800274592002800792653002200820653003600842653001100878653002200889653003800911773012400949856011701073852000901190655001201199IND60129315220221119194800.0151124e200403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012931522DNAL7 a10.1898/1051-1733(2004)085<0016:MOMAFB>2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFloyd W, Weckerly10aMovement of male and female black-tailed deer foraging on acorns  ap. 16-19.  aMovement and cropping rate influences forage selectivity of deer.

The microstructural analysis of the synthesized bionanocomposite was carried out by TEM, XRD and FTIR studies, which confirmed the incorporation of the nanoscaled ZnO and CeO2 in the polymeric nanocellulose:polyaniline matrix. The bionanocomposite exhibited a remediation efficiency above ∼95% against As under different adsorbent concentrations and pH conditions. The biosorption mechanism of As on the nanobiosorbent was found to conform to the Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherms. Antibacterial assays for the bionanocomposite showed a high antibacterial activity with MIC50 values of 10.6μgml−1 against the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis and 10.3μgml−1 against the Gram-negative Escherichia coli. Thus, the bionanocomposite shall be of high interest as a novel and sustainable matrix for the design of coats/devices that effectuate arsenic adsorption and microbial control, to generate contaminant free potable water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3aarsenic 3abiosorption 3aceric oxide 3adrinking water 3ananocomposites 3apH 3aremediation 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc oxide 0aNanocellulose 0aPolyaniline 0aArsenic 0aAdsorption 0aAntibacterial1 aChaliha, C.1 aKalita, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-93471 aKalita, M.C.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2016 Sept. 05, v. 148 p.397-405dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2016.03.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245017300177520128400350592002801634650001501662650001601677650001101693650001001704650001101714650001101725650002401736650001201760650001401772650001901786650001501805650001501820653001401835653002401849653001501873653002201888653002401910700001901934773009001953856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60763061820221121221908.0220824e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076306182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2022.1231882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMasoudi, Seiied Mohsen10aLayout optimization of a wind farm considering grids of various resolutions, wake effect, and realistic wind speed and wind direction data: A techno-economic assessment  aThis study investigates the wind farm layout optimization problem utilizing realistic wind speed and wind direction data with 10 min time interval instead of using hypothetical wind scenarios. The PARK method, Genetic Algorithm, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) were considered as the wake model, optimization method, and objective function, respectively. Optimal layouts for the wind farm were found by considering 36 Cartesian wind farm grids of different resolutions. After finding the optimal layout, an economic analysis was performed to investigate the impacts of governmental incentives on viability of the optimized wind farm. Among the 36 optimal layouts, the one with 10 turbines optimally located in 9 × 8 grid has the lowest LCOE of 19.5 Cent/kWh. Moreover, optimal arrangements for any number of turbines in the range of 5–25 were found. Results showed that providing 50–100% of the initial investment by a 20-year interest-free loan can reduce the LCOE by 19.3–38.5%. To achieve a 10 year of payback period, the guaranteed purchase tariff must reach 15.8 Cent/kWh when incentives including an interest-free loan equal to 50% of the initial investment, land rental price of 2000 $/hectare, and tax rebate of 12 $/MWh are simultaneously implemented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aloans 3amodels 3aprices 3asystem optimization 3atariffs 3aviability 3awind direction 3awind farms 3awind speed 0aWind farm 0aLayout optimization 0aPARK Model 0aGenetic algorithm 0aEconomic assessment1 aBaneshi, Mehdi0 tEnergy.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 244 p.123188-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2022.1231883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245013100215300001800346520182700364592002802191650001802219650002502237650001602262650001902278650001902297650002302316650002002339650002002359650001602379650002102395650001402416650002302430650001002453650002202463650000902485650001202494700001802506700002002524700002402544700001802568773011002586856008202696852000902778655001202787IND60677354620221119154109.0191127e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067735462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-019-02801-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarış, Veysel Özgür1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3021-861210aProtective effect of taurine against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats: echocardiographical and histological findings  ap. 1649-1655.  aDoxorubicin (DOXO) may cause serious cardiotoxic effects that limit its use as an antineoplastic agent. We aimed to evaluate the protective role of taurine (TAU), a beta amino acid with antioxidant activity, against DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity in a rat model. Thirty-one male Sprague–Dawley rats (300–400 g) were randomized into four groups: control (n = 7, intraperitoneal [ip] saline for 14 days), TAU (n = 8, 150 mg/kg body weight TAU ip for 14 days), DOXO (n = 8, 25 mg/kg body weight DOXO ip on 12th, 13th, and 14th days), and DOXO + TAU (n = 8, TAU for 14 days and DOXO on 12th, 13th, and 14th days). The left ventricular functions were evaluated on 15th day by echocardiography. The heart tissues were then excised for histological evaluation. In DOXO group, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fractional shortening (FS), and mitral lateral annulus (s') velocity were significantly lower, and the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters (LVEDD, LVESD) were significantly higher than control group (p < 0.05), indicating a significant deterioration in left ventricular functions. However, in comparison to DOXO group, LVESD, LVEDD, LVEF, FS, and s' were significantly improved in DOXO + TAU group (p < 0.05). On histological evaluation, contrary to the normal cellular structure of cardiomyocytes in control and TAU groups, DOXO group showed increased nuclear or cytoplasmic changes and infiltrative cell proliferation (p < 0.001), which were remarkably reduced in DOXO + TAU group (p < 0.001). TAU treatment has a protective effect against DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity on echocardiographical and histological evaluation. For common use of TAU to prevent DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity, our findings should be confirmed by clinical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3aantioxidant activity 3abody weight 3acardiomyocytes 3acardiotoxicity 3acell proliferation 3acell structures 3aclinical trials 3adoxorubicin 3aechocardiography 3ahistology 3alaboratory animals 3amales 3aprotective effect 3arats 3ataurine1 aGedikli, Esra1 aYersal, Nilgün1 aMüftüoğlu, Sevda1 aErdem, Ayşen0 tAmino acids.g2019 Nov., v. 51, no. 10-12 p.1649-1655dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-019-02801-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245016400169300001800333500002000351520148000371592002801851650001501879650002901894650001701923650001201940650001201952650001501964650001201979650001201991650001802003650001702021650002102038650002302059650001202082650001302094650001302107650000702120650001802127650000902145650001502154650001502169650001302184650002302197700003302220700001802253700002602271700003602297773012702333856007402460852000902534655001202543IND60571607620221121175533.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057160762DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.127022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpinosa, Wilma Aparecida10aFermentation Kinetics of Rice Syrup, with High Content of Dextrose Equivalent, by Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Characterization of Volatile Compounds from Wine  ap. 1199-1205.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRice wine was made from broken rice (by‐product of rice processing), which was hydrolyzed by amylolytic enzymes, producing syrup with high content of dextrose equivalent (51.04% DE). The must presented 164 g/L of glucose (15 ºBx) and pH of 2.67 was fermented for 22 h at 25C by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fermented alcoholic (rice wine) reached yield value of 74.94% (Y₁), 91.71% (Y₂) and productivity (Pₚ) of 2.85 g/Lh in alcohol, with alcohol concentration of 62.8 g/L, 28.0 g/L of glucose, 2.5 °Bx and pH of 3.0. The kinetic parameters – Yₚ/ₛ 27.75%, μN 0.008 h⁻¹, gt 3.99 h, PN 0.13 logUFC/mLh – were determined. The wine contained a total of 11 volatile compounds identified by GC‐FID, 7 alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n‐propanol, n‐butanol, iso‐amylic alcohols, iso‐butanol and glycerol), 2 aldehydes (acetaldehyde and acetol), 1 ester (ethyl acetate) and 1 ketone (acetone). PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The product obtained showed potential features to be employed not only as alcoholic beverage, but also as a raw material in the production of other products such as vinegar, adding value to rice processing. Considering the production outlook and the amount of generated by‐product, it is a lower cost substrate for such application. The characterization of volatile flavor compounds might be made use not only for a better understanding of this new‐type product, but also for the further utilization in other wine or alcohol production.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetone 3abutanol 3abyproducts 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3afermentation 3aflavor compounds 3agas chromatography 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3amethanol 3apH 3araw materials 3arice 3arice syrup 3arice wines 3avinegars 3avolatile compounds1 ados Santos Júnior, Vitório1 aGalvan, Diego1 aFiorio, Jhonatan Luiz1 aGomez, Raul Jorge Hernan Castro0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2016 Dec., v. 40, no. 6 p.1199-1205dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.127023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015000169300001400319520220600333592002802539650001502567650001402582650001302596651001502609700002302624700002202647773010602669856008202775852000902857655001202866IND60771994820221118063143.0220330e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077199482DNAL7 a10.1134/S20790961220101032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaribaeva, Sh. U.10aOntogenesis and Ontogenetic Structure of Local Populations of the Astragalus holargyreus Bunge (Fabaceae) of the Narrow-Local Endemic Of Kyzylkum  ap. 78-84.  aAstragalus holargyreus Bunge is a narrow-local endemic of Kyzyl Kum. It grows in the outlier mountains of Bukantau. It has status 1 in the Red Book of the Republic of Uzbekistan (2019). The purpose of the article is to assess the current state of local populations. When describing ontogenesis, we used the method of Rabotnov (1950), Uranov (1975), and Local Plant Populations (1976). The structure of local populations was studied with the generally accepted method (Uranov, 1975; Tsenopopulyatsiya rastenii…, 1976). Local populations were characterized according to the classification of ontogenetic structure proposed by Uranov and Smirnov (1969); age and effectiveness were characterized according to L.A. Zhivotovsky (2001). The ecological density was determined according to W. Odum (1986). Relevés were carried out according to the standard technique on 100-m² areas (Polevaya geobotanika, 1964). Astragalus holargyreus is a monocentric, vegetatively nonmotile, tap-root, herbaceous polycarpic with sympodially renewing, monocyclic shoots. The ontogenetic spectrum of the first local population is typical and reflects the biological characteristics of the species: a gradual increase in the life span in the pregenerative and generative periods, which culminates in the middle-aged state, and rapid aging with an absolute maximum in individuals of a middle-aged generative state. The proportion of individuals with an absolute maximum occurs in individuals of the middle-aged generative state (29.06%). The ontogenetic spectrum in the second local population does not coincide with the characteristic one, which is unimodal with an absolute maximum for virginal individuals (23.40%). The average density of individuals is 0.86 pcs. per 1 m² in local population 1 and 1.17 pcs./m² in CP2. The ecological density ranges from 1.28 to 2.76. According to the sum of the points of organism and population characteristics, all surveyed local populations are in a stable state. It is recommended that the habitats of the species(Bukantau ridge) should be introduced into the system of protected natural areas of the republic in order to preserve the natural population of Astragalus holargyreus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAstragalus 3alongevity 3aontogeny 3aUzbekistan1 aShomurodov, Kh.

All the Groups were fed oats hay ad lib and commercial pelleted feed 300 g per animal as basal diet, while group II was fed 2.5 ppm Cu, 10ppm Zn; and group III was fed 5 ppm Cu and 20ppm Zn per animal per day along with basal diet for 120 days. Hemetological parameters viz., haemoglobin, packed cell volume (PCV), total erythrocyte count (TEC), total and leukocyte counts (TLC) and differential counts were statistically similar in all the groups. Biochemical parameters viz., plasma urea nitrogen, glucose, total protein, cholesterol, triglyceride level was also statistically similar in all the groups. Dry matter, DCP and TDN intakes were higher in groups II and III (P<0.05). Digestibility of DM, OM, CP, CF and NDF, ADF was higher in groups II and III as compared to group I. Initial body weight of groups I, II and III lambs were 16.31 kg, 16.56 kg and 16.48 kg, respectively, while average daily gain in the respective groups were 45.5 g, 57.67 g and 62.67 g, respectively. There was significant higher average daily gain in group II and III (P<0.05) as compared to group I. Wool shedding was decreased in group II and III animals as compared to group animals.

The objective of this work consists of decarbonizing a University Campus and neighboring communities by producing electricity from solar photovoltaic systems integrated with an energy storage system and local grid station. A new mathematical model is developed to maximize the system power generation and balance the load demand. The simulation and optimization software System Advisor Model (SAM) is used to develop and test model results. The software is used to analyze and optimize the solar energy generation, the energy demand, and the economic performance: capital cost, overall investment, net present value, and the Levelized Cost of Energy of the project. A novel approach decentralized load centers is adopted to share power with adjacent communities. At the aim of improving the system flexibility, reliability, and climate resilience, the established model is grid-connected.

Although a wide variety of physiological systems have been studied using this paradigm, little is known regarding the effects of ER on skeletal health and reproductive aging. Studies in rhesus monkeys have reported that ER delays sexual and skeletal maturation in young male monkeys and reduces bone mass in adult males. No studies have examined the chronic effects on bone health and reproductive aging in female rhesus monkeys. The present cross-sectional study examined the effects of chronic (6 y) ER on skeletal and reproductive indices in 40 premenopausal and perimenopausal (7-27 y old) female rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Although ER monkeys weighed less and had lower fat mass, ER did not alter bone mineral density, bone mineral content, osteocalcin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D or parathyroid hormone concentrations, menstrual cycling or reproductive hormone concentrations. Body weight and lean mass were significantly related to bone mineral density and bone mineral content at all skeletal sites (total body, lumbar spine, mid and distal radius; P less than or equal to 0.04). The number of total menstrual cycles over 2 y, as well as the percentage of normal-length cycles (24-31 d), was lower in older than in younger monkeys (P less than or equal to 0.05). Older monkeys also had lower estradiol (P = 0.02) and higher follicle-stimulating hormone (P = 0.02) concentrations than did younger monkeys. We conclude that ER does not negatively affect these indices of skeletal or reproductive health and does not alter age-associated changes in the same variables. 3aenergy intake 3adiet 3abone density 3abone mineralization 3amineral content 3abody composition 3aestrous cycle 3asex hormones 3amenopause 3ablood serum 3aMacaca mulatta 3aanimal models 3afemales 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCalcification, Physiologicxphysiology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEstradiolxblood 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexblood 2aFood Deprivationxphysiology 2aLinear Models 2aMacaca mulattaxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMenstrual Cycle 2aOsteocalcinxblood 2aParathyroid Hormonexblood 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aVitamin Dxanalogs & derivativesxblood. 0aage differences 0aaging1 aBlack, A.1 aHandy, A.M.1 aShapses, S.A.1 aTilmont, E.M.1 aKiefer, T.L.1 aIngram, D.K.1 aRoth, G.S.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Mar., v. 131, no. 3 p.820-827x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle04009naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245016000143300001600303500001500319520177300334650002002107650001202127650002302139650000802162650001002170650001702180650002502197650002502222650001802247650003202265650005302297650002002350650001402370650002302384650000902407650002202416650001002438650001802448650002802466650003402494650001102528650004702539650003702586650006202623650001802685650001102703650002502714650000902739650002902748650002502777650002202802650002302824650006602847650002302913650002402936651001302960651001802973651003302991653001803024653001803042653003203060700002403092773007903116852000903195930003303204945001303237946001303250655001203263IND2325620320221117231819.0020226e200103  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232562032DNAL7 a112387572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, J.S.10aUnderstanding needs is important for assessing the impact of food assistance program participation on nutritional and health status in U.S. elderly persons  ap. 765-773.  a2019-12-05  aThis study aimed to assess the impact of food assistance programs on nutritional and health status of nutritionally needy elderly persons. Two cross-sectional and one longitudinal data sets were used: Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-94), Nutrition Survey of the Elderly in New York State (1994) and Longitudinal Study of Aging (1984-1990). Multiple logistic and linear regression analyses were used to examine whether food assistance participants among food insecure elderly (i.e., those whose needs for food assistance programs are met) have better nutrient intake, skinfold thickness and self-reported health status and less nutritional risk, hospitalization and mortality than nonparticipants (i.e., those whose needs are unmet) and whether the benefit is larger than that among food secure elderly persons. Across three data sets, food insecure elderly persons had poorer nutritional and health status than food secure elderly persons. Contrary to the hypotheses, among food insecure elderly persons, food assistance participants had similar or poorer nutrient intakes, skinfold thickness, nutritional risk, self-reported health status, hospitalization and mortality than nonparticipants. Food secure participants had similar nutritional and health status as food secure nonparticipants. Lack of information on the dynamic nature and changes in needs with program participation in the three data sets likely did not allow accurate estimation of the impact of food assistance participation. Different study designs, as well as theory and knowledge of needs that clarifies need status and its change within each older individual across an appropriate time interval, are necessary to accurately assess impacts of food assistance programs. 3anutrient intake 3aelderly 3anutritional status 3amen 3awomen 3arisk factors 3alongitudinal studies 3aHealth and Pathology 3afood security 3afood and nutrition programs 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3adietary surveys 3amortality 3askinfold thickness 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAging 2aAnthropometry 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEpidemiologic Research Design 2aFemale 2aFood Servicesxstatistics & numerical data 2aHealth Services Needs and Demand 2aHealth Services for the Agedxstatistics & numerical data 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aNational Health Programs 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutrition Surveys 2aNutritional Status 2aOutcome Assessment, Health Carexstatistics & numerical data. 2aProgram Evaluation 2aRegression Analysis 3aNew York 0aUnited States 0aUnited Statesxepidemiology. 0ahospital care 0aparticipation 0alongitudinal study of aging1 aFrongillo, E.A.

No population-based studies on the possible influence of prandial status on tHcy have been published. The aim of this study was to investigate the variation in plasma tHcy levels in relation to time since last meal. A cross-sectional, population-based study including 18,044 individuals in Western Norway was conducted. Most subjects were in the age groups 40-42 and 65-67 y. Participants who had not eaten during the past 6 h before the blood sampling had significantly higher mean tHcy levels compared with those who had eaten; 11.7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 11.4-12.1] vs. 11.2 (95% CI: 11.1-11.3) micromol/L among men (P = 0.03) and 10.2 (95% CI: 9.9-10.6) vs. 9.7 (95% CI: 9.6-9.7) micromol/L among women (P = 0.003). In all groups except older women, tHcy concentrations were generally higher with increasing time after a meal (P-trend < 0.01 in all 3 groups). These findings suggest that fasting status and time since last meal may influence levels of tHcy and should be considered in studies of tHcy as a risk factor for cardiovascular and other diseases, and when comparing tHcy values among studies. 3ahomocysteine 3ablood plasma 3aingestion 3aamino acid metabolism 3agender differences 3apostprandial state 3aNorway 0aage differences 0atiming1 aTell, G.S.1 aNygard, O.1 aRefsum, H.1 aUeland, P.M.1 aVollset, S.E.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2001 Apr., v. 131, no. 4 p.1214-1216x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle04092naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001500154245010500169300001400274500029400288520214400582650001902726650002002745650001202765650001702777650002202794650001002816650002202826650001502848650001402863650001002877650002202887650001302909650001002922650001802932650001602950650001502966650002602981650001403007650001503021650002203036650002003058650001803078650001303096650001703109700001903126700001503145700001403160700001503174700001403189700001303203700001703216700001603233700002203249773014303271856005503414852000903469655001203478IND60558044020221117231726.0161107e20160322xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055804402DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1114.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKissel, E.10aAbiotic stress research in crops using -omics approaches: drought stress and banana in the spotlight  ap. 81-90.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and landscapes (IHC2014): IX International Symposium on Banana: ISHS-ProMusa Symposium on Unravelling the Banana's Genomic Potential held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  aEvaluating crop biodiversity is a challenging task and needs to integrate knowledge from different levels. This overview paper offers ways to tackle this challenge, illustrated by the case for drought tolerance in banana. KU Leuven hosts the International Musa Germplasm Collection managed by Bioversity International for safe storage and distribution in order to secure the crop's genepool and encourage its use. The latter, however, requires an in-depth knowledge of the variability among the accessions for coping with varying environmental limitations. Our research focuses on variations in drought tolerance by integrating information from different biological levels (genome, transcriptome, metabolome and phenome). Banana originated in the humid tropics, and yields decrease dramatically when the crop is grown in dryer areas. Circumstantial evidence suggests that elements of the Musa balbisiana (B) genome confer greater drought tolerance on banana than those of the Musa acuminata (A) genome. Hence the genomic constitution may affect the stress response. To phenotype different Musa accessions belonging to different genomic groups, we monitored multiple non-destructive and destructive phenotypic plant variables in response to changing water availability. We used multivariate analysis to classify the different variables according to their contribution in explaining the observed variance between accessions. Ultimately, plant phenotype is driven by genes operating to regulate growth combined with environmental limitations. As such, gene and cell function must always be considered in the whole-plant context. Our brief overview of recent applications of -omics approaches in banana research also covers the challenges of applying such -omics approaches to a non-model crop, with a special focus on abiotic stress. As a general workflow, we propose to combine RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolite analysis to characterize the cellular phenotype and link to the differential genotype. An interdisciplinary network in plant phenotyping should be established to characterize genetic diversity in genebanks and breeding programs. 3aMusa acuminata 3aMusa balbisiana 3abananas 3abiodiversity 3abreeding programs 3acrops 3adrought tolerance 3agene banks 3agene pool 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahosts 3ahumid tropics 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3amultivariate analysis 3aphenotype 3aproteomics 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atranscriptome 3avariance 3awater stress1 aVanhove, A.

Subsequently, the channels were subjected to a combination of treatments including wetting and drying of the whole soil block and the passage of water down through the soil to the channel and along the channel itself. Erosion from within the channel was monitored by measurement of sediment yield and the structure of the channel was itself examined by use of an endoscope. Mole channels produced with polyacrylamide, had smoother walls initially than those without and also after subsequent testing by water flow. Additionally, channels treated with polyacrylamide, also produced less sediment than untreated channels. Such models were used to study the beneficial effects of polyacrylamide on mole channel stability but could also be used to study other aspects of mole channel production and stability under varying controlled conditions. 3amole drainage 3apolyacrylamide 3alaboratory techniques 0amole plows 0atreatment 0astabilizing 0asoil blocks 0achannels1 aAdey, M.A.0 tJournal of agricultural engineering research.g1991 Apr., v. 48, no. 4 p.303-314x0021-86347nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01875naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010000125300001600225520084500241650001601086650001101102650001001113650001001123650001201133650002001145650001601165650001501181650002501196653002801221700001601249700001601265700001501281700001301296773013901309852000901448939003301457946001101490655001201501IND9200456820221117231543.0920128s1991    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920045682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeda, N.10aBiogenic amine levels in the central nervous system and haemolymph of the silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 677-682.  aA wide range of biogenic amines and related metabolites were quantified in the silkworm, Bombyx mori from fourth instar to post-spinning stage using a three-dimensional HPLC system with multiple coulometric electrochemical detection.

Metabolic pathways of biogenic amines in the central nervous system and haemolymph were discussed. 3aBombyx mori 3alarvae 3apupae 3abrain 3aganglia 3abiogenic amines 3ametabolites 3ametabolism 3abiochemical pathways 0asub-esophageal ganglion1 aTakaoka, H.1 aShimizu, T.1 aYazawa, M.1 aYagi, S.0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology : C : Comparative pharmacology and toxicology.g1991, v. 100, no. 3 p.677-682x0306-44927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03232naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010800167300001600275520174300291650002202034650001302056650002502069650001302094650001102107650001302118650002502131650001502156650002102171650000902192650001502201650001902216650001502235650001302250650001802263650001802281650001302299650002602312650001802338651001202356700001602368700001902384773007202403852000902475856009202484856010402576939003302680946001302713655001202726IND4478147420221117231341.0140305e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447814742DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-200209000-000052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPant, H.K.10aPhosphorus Retention in Soils From A Prospective Constructed Wetland Site: Environmental Implications 1  ap. 607-615.  aThe phosphorus (P) retention characteristics of soil layers are critical for predicting the effectiveness of a constructed wetland, built in high water table soils, in reducing P transport to the receiving water body. Soil samples were collected from surface and subsurface horizons for P sorption and mineralogical studies directed to the assessment of a proposed site for stormwater treatment area (STA) construction in the Okeechobee Basin, Florida. The P sorption maxima were positively correlated with oxalate-extractable aluminum (ox-Al) and citrate dithionite bicarbonate-extractable aluminum (CDB-Al) under anaerobic conditions, but there was no significant correlation with either ox- or CDB-extractable iron (Fe). The ox/CDB ratio for extractable Fe was relatively high (>0.5), indicating that most of the Fe was in noncrystalline form, i.e., highly reactive and prone to rapid dissolution under reducing conditions. The X-ray Diffraction (XRD) patterns indicated that smectite was the dominant mineral in the clay-size fraction. The permanent negative charge of smectite limits contribution to P sorption. The equilibrium P concentrations (EPC(0)) of the soils were significantly correlated to CDB-Al but not to CDB-Fe, suggesting that Al-associated P is involved primarily in elevating EPC(0) in these soils. Both P sorption capacity and EPC0 were fairly low for soils from most locations, indicating that the proposed STA cannot remove P from the rerouted water to a significant extent under ambient conditions and would not also cause significant P loading to the water table aquifer. Thus, alternatives for effective P sequestration, such as establishment of vegetative communities or chemical amendment, would be required. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaquifers 3abasins 3acitrates 3aconstructed wetlands 3adithionite 3ahigh water table 3airon 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3aprediction 3asmectite 3asoil horizons 3asoil sampling 3asorption 3astormwater management 3asurface water 3aFlorida1 aReddy, K.R.1 aSpechler, R.M.0 tSoil science.g2002 Sept., v. 167, no. 9 p.607-615x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-200209000-000053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://journals.lww.com/soilsci/pages/issuelist.aspx?year=20023Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140307  aOther US 7aarticle03447naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245011900173300001600292520192500308650001502233650004402248650001802292650002602310650001702336650001702353650001602370650001302386650004402399650002602443650001602469650003102485650001402516650001802530650001202548700001902560700002002579700003102599700002502630773007102655852000902726856009202735856010402827939003302931946001302964655001202977IND4478144620221117231336.0140305e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447814462DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-200208000-000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgnelli, Alberto14aThe Changes With Depth of Humic and Fulvic Acids Extracted From the Fine Earth and Rock Fragments of A Forest Soil  ap. 524-538.  aAlthough much is known about the transformation of humic substances in the fine earth fraction of surface horizons, little is known about these processes in the coarse fragments (>2 mm) or about the changes with depth of humic and fulvic acids extracted from an entire soil profile. For each horizon of a forest soil developed on sandstone, the humic acids (HAs) and fulvic acids (FAs) were extracted from four fractions: fine earth, washing (i.e. fine material adhering to the clasts) and highly altered and slightly altered rock fragments. The HAs and FAs were also extracted from samples of the parent rock. The humic substances were then analyzed for their elemental composition and chemical structure by FT-IR and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. In the A horizons (upper 20 cm of the profile), the HAs from all the fractions appeared highly aromatic, with a high degree of C substitution and an abundance of carboxyl groups; however, the HAs of the rock fragments were more aromatic and richer in carbohydrate and proteinaceous residues than those of the fine earth. The HAs showed a more condensed and unsubstituted aromatic pattern at depth than in surface horizons. In the Bw and BCb horizons the contribution of biological residues to the humic substances seems to be progressively replaced by the contribution of organic materials derived from the sedimentary parent rock. The presence of features ascribable to the HAs and FAs of the parent rock decreased following the order: slightly altered clasts > highly altered clasts > washing > fine earth. Conversely, FAs showed a high homogeneity throughout the profile and are considered mostly of pedogenic origin. The chemical characteristics of both HAs and FAs showed a break in the trend with depth between Bw and BCb horizons, confirming the presence of a pedogenic discontinuity between the upper modern soil (A-Bw2 horizons) and the buried paleosol (BCb horizons). 3aA horizons 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbohydrates 3aelemental composition 3aforest soils 3afulvic acids 3ahumic acids 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apaleosolic soil types 3aparent rock 3aphysicochemical properties 3asandstone 3asoil profiles 3awashing1 aCeli, Luisella1 aCorti, Giuseppe1 aDegl'Innocenti, Alessandro1 aUgolini, Fiorenzo C.0 tSoil science.g2002 Aug., v. 167, no. 8 p.524-538x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-200208000-000043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://journals.lww.com/soilsci/pages/issuelist.aspx?year=20023Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140305  aOther US 7aarticle03249naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001800163245021600181300001600397520139100413650001401804650002501818650002601843650002301869650002701892650002301919650001501942650001901957650002001976650002501996650001902021650002402040650001202064650003302076650003602109650007702145650004502222650003002267650004602297650002402343651001202367651001202379653003302391700001702424700001502441773008702456852000902543856008402552930003302636945001302669946001302682655001202695IND2205512620221117231604.0000629e199911  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220551262DNAL7 a105930712pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.6.7152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteiner, F.E.10aInfection rates of Amblyomma americanum (Acari: Ixodidae) by Ehrlichia chaffeensis (Rickettsiales: Ehrlichieae) and prevalence of E. chaffeensis-reactive antibodies in white-tailed deer in southern Indiana, 1997  ap. 715-719.  aTo monitor the percentage and stability of Ehrlichia chaffeensis-infected ticks in southern Indiana over time, pools of Amblyomma americanum (L.) ticks were screened for infection in southern Indiana for a 2nd time. Nested polymerase chain reaction (with 6% DMSO included only in the 2nd reaction) was performed on 920 ticks in pools of 5 individuals from 9 sites (sites previously examined and 4 new ones) in 6 counties. The average minimum infection rate for all sites for 1997 was 1.6%, lower than that of 4.9% previously observed for 1995. However, when only the 5 sites that were positive for infected ticks in 1995 were reexamined, the average minimum infection rate was even more disparate (1.4% in 1997 and 5.1% in 1995). To correlate the presence of infected ticks with the presence of exposed deer, which serve as a reservoir, dried blood samples collected from hunter-killed deer at 2 locations in southern Indiana were tested for E. chaffeensis-reactive antibodies using an indirect immunofluorescent assay. Antibodies were detected in 45 and 47% of 98 samples examined from the 2 stations. These data provide support to our previous report of a population of E. chaffeensis-infected A. americanum in southern Indiana and the high proportion of deer previously exposed to E. chaffeensis suggests a stable maintenance of E. chaffeensis in this tick-vertebrae zoonotic system. 3ainfection 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aEhrlichia chaffeensis 3atemporal variation 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3adisease reservoirs 3aantibodies 3aseroprevalence 3adisease vectors 3arickettsial diseases 3ahuman diseases 3atick-borne diseases 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aDeerximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aEhrlichia chaffeensisximmunologyxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aTicksxmicrobiology 3aIndiana 0aIndiana 0ahuman monocytic ehrlichiosis1 aPinger, R.R.1 aVann, C.N.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 Nov., v. 36, no. 6 p.715-719x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.6.7153Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle04031naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001500163245012600178300001600304520210600320650002702426650001102453650001402464650002202478650002102500650002002521650002502541650002202566650001202588650004502600650002502645650001902670650001202689650003502701650001802736650004102754650001902795650001102814650002502825650003102850650000902881650002802890650004902918650004902967651001503016653003003031653002703061653002803088700001703116700001803133700001603151773008603167852000903253856008403262930003303346945001303379946001303392655001203405IND2201676520221117231359.0991119e199905  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220167652DNAL7 a103371042pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.3.3292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLane, R.S.10aLife history of Ixodes (Ixodes) jellisoni (Acari: Ixodidae) and its vector competence for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato  ap. 329-340.  aIxodes (Ixodes) jellisoni Cooley, & Kohls, a nonhuman biting and little known tick, is one of 4 members of the I. ricinus complex in the United States. A localized population of I. jellisoni inhabiting a grassland biotope in Mendocino County, CA, was studied from 1993 to 1997. Rodent trapping in all seasons revealed that the only host of both immature and adult I. jellisoni was the heteromyid rodent Dipodomys californicus Merriam. Field investigations suggested that I. jellisoni is nidicolous in habit, and laboratory findings demonstrated that it reproduces parthenogenetically. Known parthenogenetic females (n = 4) produced an average of 530 eggs of which 74% hatched, which was comparable to the fecundity and fertility of wild-caught females (n = 8). After the transstadial molt, 57 F(1) or F(2) nymphs derived from 2 wild-caught or 4 laboratory-reared, unmated females produced only females. Ixodes jellisoni males were not found on 112 wild-caught D. californicus individuals that were captured an average of 2 times. Collectively, these findings suggest that I. jellisoni may be obligatorily parthenogenetic. Borrelial isolates were obtained from 85% of 58 D. californicus and 33% of 21 I. jellisoni females removed from this rodent. None of the 7 infected female ticks passed borreliae ovarially to its F(1) larval progeny. Eight D. californicus and 5 I. jellison-derived isolates that were genetically characterized belonged to 2 restriction pattern groups of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Neither restriction pattern group has been assigned to a particular genospecies yet. After placement on naturally infected D. californicus, noninfected larval ticks acquired and transstadially passed spirochetes as efficiently as (group 1 borreliae) or 6 times more efficiently (group 2 borreliae) than Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls. As few as 1-4 infected I. jellisoni nymphs were capable of transmitting group 1 or group 2 borreliae to naive D. californicus. We conclude that I. jellisoni is a competent vector of both restriction fragment groups when D. californicus is used as the animal model. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aIxodes 3aDipodomys 3atick infestations 3ahost specificity 3aparthenogenesis 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3avector competence 3astrains 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3anucleotide sequences 3aintergenic DNA 2aAnimals 2aArachnid Vectorsxmicrobiology 2aBase Sequence 2aBorrelia burgdorferi Groupxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aFemale 2aIxodesxmicrobiology 2aLyme Diseasextransmission 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRodent Diseasesxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aTick Infestationsxparasitologyxveterinary. 3aCalifornia 0atransstadial transmission 0adipodomys californicus 0amolecular sequence data1 aPeavey, C.A.1 aPadgett, K.A.1 aHendson, M.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.329-340x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.3.3293Available from publisher's Web site  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02401naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001500163245009400178300001600272500001500288520083500303650001201138650002301150650002001173650001001193650001301203650001701216650003001233650001601263650002401279650002301303650001201326650003101338650001401369650002901383650001201412651001101424651001101435653001701446653002401463653002201487700002201509700001601531700001901547700001501566700001501581773008701596852000901683856008401692930003301776945001301809946001301822655001201835IND2202594820221117231450.0000216e199907  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220259482DNAL7 a104677672pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.4.4202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBourel, B.10aNecrophilous insect succession on rabbit carrion in sand dune habitats in northern France  ap. 420-425.  a2019-12-04  aSix freshly killed rabbit carcasses were exposed in different habitats in the coastal dune massif of Ambleteuse (northern France) during the spring seasons of 1996 and 1997. In total, 66 arthropod species were collected during the decomposition of these carcasses, and particular attention was paid to taxa of necrophilic significance. The pattern of insect activity was recorded and is discussed in relation to meteorological conditions. One significant feature in this study was the delay in initial oviposition by flies during 1996, which demonstrates the need for caution in estimation of postmortem interval by entomological techniques in early spring. Although daily temperatures may be favorable for adult fly activity, flies may be absent because of small population size and low nocturnal temperatures during this period. 3arabbits 3apostmortem changes 3acarrion insects 3adunes 3ahabitats 3adead animals 3ameteorological parameters 3adegradation 3aforensic entomology 3ainsect communities 2aAnimals 2aArthropodsxclassification 2aEcosystem 2aInsectaxclassification. 2aRabbits 3aFrance 0aFrance 0acolonization 0apostmortem interval 0acommunity ecology1 aMartin-Bouyer, L.1 aHedouin, V.1 aCailliez, J.C.1 aDerout, D.1 aGosset, D.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.420-425x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.4.4203Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03246naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001500163245013800178300001600316520166200332650001401994650002502008650002702033650002902060650002602089650001402115650002402129650002002153650002002173650002402193650001202217650003502229650006302264650001102327650001202338650002402350650001702374653002702391653002202418700001402440700001802454700001702472773008702489852000902576856008402585930003302669945001302702946001302715655001202728IND2202594720221117231520.0000216e199907  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220259472DNAL7 a104677662pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.4.4142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRechav, Y.10aComparison of methods for introducing and producing artificial infection of ixodid ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) with Ehrlichia chaffeensis  ap. 414-419.  aOnly 29.5 +/- 8.91% of engorged Amblyomma americanum (L.) nymphs that we inoculated with Ehrlichia chaffeensis molted successfully to adults compared with 75.8 +/- 7.46% of engorged nymphs that were not inoculated. However, 65.4 +/- 6.02% of unfed nymphs of this species were exposed for 2 h to E. chaffeensis suspension introduced to them through glass capillaries gained weight. These nymphs were placed on rabbits, and approximately equal to 50% of them completed their feeding and molted successfully to adults. Weight gained was higher (71.8 +/- 17.33% and 69.8 +/- 23.26%) for unfed A. americanum females that fed from capillaries for 2 and 24, h respectively, than for nymphs. Similar values were recorded for Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (61.0 +/- 16.23%) and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Latreille) (59.0 +/- 18.62%) females after 24 h of capillary feeding. The amount of E. chaffeensis suspension taken in by females of A. americanum, D. variabilis, and R. sanguineus during 24 h of feeding was 11.2 +/- 3.56, 10.9 +/- 4.29 and 6.3 +/- 2.35 microliter, respectively. This volume is equivalent to approximately equal to 12,969, 12,622, and 7,295 infected cells ingested by the species mentioned above. Positive correlation between the volume taken in by the ticks and the weight gained by the females was found, but the initial weight of the unfed females did not effect the weight they gained. The pathogen was found in the females of all 3 species by polymerase chain reaction procedures for at least 7 d, indicating that the capillary feeding method can be successfully used for infecting unfed ticks. The potential use of this method is discussed. 3anutrition 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aDermacentor variabilis 3aRhipicephalus sanguineus 3aEhrlichia chaffeensis 3ainjection 3aoral administration 3aliveweight gain 3adisease vectors 3anutritional support 2aAnimals 2aArachnid Vectorsxmicrobiology 2aEhrlichia chaffeensisxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFemale 2aRabbits 2aTicksxmicrobiology 2aTime Factors 0aexperimental infection 0acapillary feeding1 aZyzak, M.1 aFielden, L.J.1 aChilds, J.E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.414-419x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.4.4143Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02831naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001800163245013100181300001600312520114500328650003001473650003001503650002201533650002201555650002101577650001801598650001901616650001301635650000901648650002501657650001101682650002301693650001201716650001401728650002801742650003301770650001001803650003801813650002101851650001101872650000901883650002201892651001201914651001201926653000901938653002101947700001601968700001801984773008702002852000902089856008402098930003302182945001302215946001302228655001202241IND2202597020221117231759.0000216e199907  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220259702DNAL7 a104677742pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.4.4622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkett, D.A.10aSugar meal composition of five north central Florida mosquito species (Diptera: Culicidae) as determined by gas chromatography  ap. 462-467.  aGas chromatography was used to analyze sugars found in individual crops fed on by wild caught adult Anopheles quadrimaculatus s.l. (Say), Coquillettidia perturbans (Walker), Culex nigripalpus Theobald, Culiseta melanura (Coquillett), and Psorophora ferox (von Humboldt) from several north central Florida locations. A wide range of sugars was found, including fructose, glucose, sucrose, maltose, turanose, melezitose, trehalose, raffinose, erlose, and traces of arabinose, rhamnose, and several unknowns. The frequency of individuals testing positive for crop sugars ranged from 9-10% in An. quadrimaculatus and Ps. ferox to 46% in Cq. perturbans. Based on the presence of melezitose or erlose in the crop, honeydew feeding was shown to be an important dietary component in An. quadrimaculatus (57%), Cs. melanura (31%), Cx. nigripalpus (15%), Cq. perturbans (10%), and Ps. ferox (7%). Gas chromatography of crude crop contents is a rapid one-step process that can address important questions such as the source and occurrence of sugar feeding in Diptera. Unique sugar feeding field observations were recorded for several mosquito species. 3aAnopheles quadrimaculatus 3aCoquillettidia perturbans 3aCulex nigripalpus 3aCuliseta melanura 3aPsorophora ferox 3asugar feeding 3anectar feeding 3ahoneydew 3adiet 3achemical composition 3asugars 3agas chromatography 2aAnimals 2aAnopheles 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aCulex 2aCulicidaexchemistryxphysiology. 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPlantsxchemistry 3aFlorida 0aFlorida 0acrop 0ahoneydew feeding1 aKline, D.L.1 aCarlson, D.A.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.462-467x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.4.4623Available from publisher's Web site  a20000602b20000608c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01608naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001900163245009100182300001600273520038100289650000800670650002500678650001900703650002000722650003000742650001200772650001100784650003600795650002500831650002500856653001500881700001700896700001500913700001900928773008700947852000901034856008401043930003301127945001301160946001301173655001201186IND2202601120221117231806.0000216e199907  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220260112DNAL7 a104677852pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.4.5302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurkhart, C.N.10aHistochemical analysis of the nit of Pediculus humanus capitis (Anoplura: Pediculidae)  ap. 530-532.  aHistochemical stainings of head louse nits were performed and observations indicated that the nit sheath was nonchitinous.

Seven container-inhabiting mosquito species were collected in residential areas, including Ae. albopictus, Culex quinquefasciatus Say, C. pallidothorax Theobald, C. neomimulus Lien, C. bicornutus Theobald, C. fuscanus Wiedemann, and Tripteroides aranoides Theobald. Ae. albopictus was the most abundant species and was collected in 18.49% of the containers examined. Other mosquito species were found in 0.02-0.16% of the total numbers of water containers checked. Of the positive water containers, 97.33% contained Ae. albopictus larvae. Sixteen species were collected in open areas away from residential sites. Ae. albopictus was most abundant and was present in 24.50% of the total number of containers examined. C. bicornutus, C. quinquefasciatus, and C. pallidothorax were present in 2.17, 1.48, and 1.08%, respectively. Ae. albopictus larvae were found in 74.78% of the mosquito-positive water containers. The mean Breteau index (+/-SE) in 1997 (17.22 +/- 1.59 mosquito-positive containers per 100 premises) per village in residential areas was not significantly higher than the index in 1996 (16.86 +/- 1.33). The frequency of occurrence of Ae. albopictus in different containers is presented. A greater preference for containers in outdoor habitats was found. The ratio of the total number of containers indoors and outdoors per premises was 1.15:1.00, whereas the ratio of mosquito-positive containers indoors and outdoors was 1.00:1.83. Most indoor breeding containers (86.11%) in residential areas were used for planting purposes and for recreation (12.50%). The number of breeding containers in residential areas that were classified as trash increased from 0.35% indoor to 39.03% outdoor, whereas the number used for planting reduced to 34.95%. Most breeding containers (63.02%) in open areas were trash; natural containers (11.86%) were the 2nd most common breeding site followed by temporarily unused (8.84%), watering (6.98%), and planting containers (5.81%). 3aAedes albopictus 3adisease vectors 3ahabitat preferences 3adengue 3abreeding sites 3aresidential areas 2aAedesxclassification 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCulexxclassification 2aCulicidaexclassification 2aDengue Virus 2aInsect Vectorsxclassification 2aWater 3aTaiwan 0aTaiwan 0aCulicidae 0aopen spaces 0acontainer breeding mosquitoes 0awater containers1 aWu, Y.L.1 aLin, T.H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.468-472x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.4.4683Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02068naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009200126300001600218500016500234520084700399650001001246650001001256650001301266650000901279650001701288650002101305650002201326650001801348650002201366650002001388653001201408653002301420700001701443700001901460773012301479852000901602930003301611945001301644946001301657655001201670IND2042136220221117230210.0940920e199407  mau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204213622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBingham, B.10aRegulation of growth hormone receptor and binding protein exression in domestic species  ap. 195-199.  aPaper presented at a workshop on the "Superfamily of receptors for growth hormone, prolactin, erythropoietin and cytokines," November 7-11, 1993, Haifa, Israel.  aGrowth hormone receptor (GHR) ecpression has been analyzed at the RNA level. In the rat, relative expression of the RNA species encoding the GHR and the GH-binding protein (GHBP) appears to be sensitive to endocrine status. Full-length GHR cDNA clones from ovine, procine, and chicken were used as probes to investigate the existence of unique RNAs for GHBPs in these species. In the sheep and pig, only a single, approximately 4.5-kb RNA is apparent. Although quite high levels of GH binding activity are found in pig serum, a variety of methods failed to isolate a separate GHBP message, suggesting that porcine GHBP is produced via a mechanism different from that which is known for rat. One class of chicken GHR cDNA resulting from alternative use of a splice acceptor 17 bases upstream of the Intron 6/Exon 7 junction, is also presented. 3asheep 3aswine 3achickens 3arats 3asomatotropin 3abinding proteins 3ahormone receptors 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3agene expression 0acloning 0agenetic regulation1 aOldham, E.R.1 aBaumbach, W.R.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1994 July, v. 206, no. 3 p.195-199x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02441naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002000162245009900182300001400281500001500295520105100310650002501361650001201386650001301398650001801411650000801429650001101437650001601448650001801464650002201482650002201504650001201526650001001538650002801548650001101576650001101587653000901598653001101607653002001618653001801638700001601656700001501672773008501687852000901772856008301781930003301864945001301897946001301910655001201923IND2199384620221117230532.0990620e199901  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219938462DNAL7 a100714872pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.1.132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaksathit, A.T.10aUtilization of human blood and sugar as nutrients by female Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 13-17.  a2019-12-04  aWe examined the utilization of sugar and human blood as nutrient sources for small and large female Aedes aegypti (L.) when they were fed blood 2 or 5 d after emergence.

We conclude that there is an energetic advantage to Ae. aegypti when they feed on blood early in adult life ("< or ="day 2 after emergence). 3achemical composition 3asucrose 3aglycogen 3aAedes aegypti 3aage 3alipids 3ahematophagy 3asugar feeding 3anutrient reserves 2aAedesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBlood 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aFemale 2aHumans 0asize 0asugars 0aenergy reserves 0aconcentration1 aEdman, J.D.1 aScott, TW.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.13-17x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.1.133Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03002naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001700162245015300179300001400332520160000346650001401946650001701960650001301977650002701990650001202017650001102029650002202040650001502062650001102077650002802088651001502116651001502131653002302146653001702169653002302186653001402209653002402223700001802247700001902265773008502284852000902369856008302378930003302461945001302494946001302507655001202520IND2199384920221117230505.0990620e199901  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219938492DNAL7 a100714902pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.1.302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalton, W.E.10aDispersal, survivorship, and host selection of Culex erythrothorax (Diptera: Culicidae) associated with a constructed wetland in southern California  ap. 30-40.  aThree mark-recapture studies were carried out at a constructed wetlands facility in San Jacinto, CA, to examine the dispersal and population ecology of the most abundant host-seeking mosquito, Cullex erythrothorax Dyar, collected in carbon dioxide-baited traps. Recapture rates were 0.3, 7.4, and 13.9% for August, September, and October, respectively. The mean distance traveled per night was approximately 0.5 km, and females were not recaptured farther than 2 km from the release site. Most marked individuals ("> or ="99.5%) were recaptured within 0.5 km of the release point. Marked individuals were recaptured for 33 d after release. Horizontal estimates of survival calculated using recapture data were 0.89, 0.87, and 0.84/d for August, September, and October, respectively. Temporal differences in the recapture rate were attributed to the effects of blood meal acquisition on host-seeking activity versus effects of mortality and strong developmental site fidelity on weekly recapture rates. Partially engorged females collected by CO2-baited traps at the wetland fed predominantly on cattle indicating that host-seeking females were using hosts at dairies surrounding the wetland and were returning to the wetland for resting before seeking an additional blood meal. Estimates of the gonotrophic cycle length and survivorship (vertical estimates) were problematical because of the low parity rates for females collected by CO2-baited traps. Limited dispersal and long survival of Cx. erythrothorax are important factors in the development of large populations at constructed wetlands. 3amortality 3ahost seeking 3awetlands 3amark-recapture studies 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCulexxphysiology 2aDemography 2aFemale 2aMeteorological Concepts 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0agonotrophic cycles 0aparous rates 0adistance travelled 0adispersal 0aculex erythrothorax1 aWorkman, P.D.1 aTempelis, C.H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.30-40x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.1.303Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02389naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100001900162245006900181300001400250520129400264650002101558650001901579650002001598650002001618650001101638650001201649650001101661650000901672650001201681650002001693650002201713700002001735773008501755852000901840856008301849930003301932945001301965946001301978655001201991IND2199385120221117230536.0990620e199901  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219938512DNAL7 a100714922pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.1.502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, L.M.F.10aPresence of sex pheromones in Anocentor nitens (Acari: Ixodidae)  ap. 50-54.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate whether there are sex pheromones in the tropical horse tick, Anocentor nitens (Neumann). When virgin males and females, fed on rabbits for 3-6 d, were tested reciprocally, there was a direct correlation between attractiveness and the period of feeding; attraction was greater (and with the fastest responses) in males and females fed for at least 6 d (sexually active males and confirmed attractive females). The capacity of sexually active males to orient toward confirmed attractive females decreased as the emission distance increased; the maximum distance that evoked a response by males was 6 cm. Confirmed attractive females lost their attractiveness approximately 2 h after being separated from the host, or after being killed by ethanol injection, although some females continued to attract sexually active males up to 4 h after death. An extract was produced by immersing confirmed attractive females in hexane and submitting them to ultrasound. Sexually active males were more attracted to and spent more time on glass bead dummies treated with this extract when compared with those treated with the hexane alone. Our results indicate the presence of at least 2 sex pheromones (attractant and mounting) in attractive females of A. nitens. 3aAnocentor nitens 3asex pheromones 3asex attractants 3amating behavior 3aweight 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aMale 2aRabbits 2aSex Attractants 2aTicksxphysiology1 aRibeiro, M.F.B.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.50-54x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.1.503Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03322naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001900163245013900182300001600321500001500337520158300352650003001935650002401965650002001989650001602009650002502025650001402050650002702064650003002091650002502121650001402146650002202160650001402182650001202196650003502208650002302243650004102266650004402307650002402351651003102375653001702406700001702423700001902440700001902459700002202478700001702500773008702517852000902604856008402613930003302697945001302730946001302743655001202756IND2201098520221117230153.0991014e199903  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220109852DNAL7 a100837572pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/36.2.1902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrandsma, A.R.10aNovel Ehrlichia organism (Rickettsiales: Ehrlichieae) in white-tailed deer associated with lone star tick (Acari: Ixodidae) parasitism  ap. 190-194.  a2019-12-04  aPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence of a novel Ehrlichia organism was found recently in wild white-tailed deer. Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann, and lone star ticks, Amblyomma americanum L., from the southeastern United States. To evaluate whether lone star tick parasitism was associated with the presence of this novel Ehrlichia organism in deer, 2 retrospective studies were conducted using specific nested PCR to test archived deer serum samples. The 1st study of 150 serum samples collected from a single deer population over a 15-yr period examined the temporal association between the presence of the Ehrlichia organism in deer and parasitism by lone star ticks. The deer Ehrlichia was not detected in serum samples collected before 1986, when lone star ticks were absent or rare, but was detected in samples collected in 1986 and every year thereafter, when lone star ticks became increasingly abundant. In the 2nd study, serum samples from 120 deer from 24 sites in 14 southeastern states were tested to evaluate if a site-specific, spatial association existed between the presence of the deer Ehrlichia and lone star ticks. All 60 serum samples from the 12 deer populations without evidence of lone star tick infestation were negative for the deer Ehrlichia, whereas 83% of the 12 populations infested by lone star ticks had PCR evidence of infection. These data suggest that lone star ticks may be a vector of the deer Ehrlichia; however, they do not preclude the involvement of other arthropods in maintaining infection with this organism in deer populations. 3ageographical distribution 3atick-borne diseases 3adisease vectors 3ablood serum 3aAmblyomma americanum 3aEhrlichia 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arickettsial diseases 3adetection 3atick infestations 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aArachnid Vectorsxmicrobiology 2aDeerxmicrobiology 2aEhrlichiaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aEhrlichiosisxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aTicksxmicrobiology 3aSoutheastern United States 0aepidemiology1 aLittle, S.E.1 aLockhart, J.M.1 aDavidson, W.R.1 aStallknecht, D.E.1 aDawson, J.E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 Mar., v. 36, no. 2 p.190-194x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.2.1903Available from publisher's Web site  a19991201b19991209c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02374naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245009000168300001400258500001500272520128000287650002401567650002001591650001901611650001101630650001101641650001401652653001601666700002101682700002201703700002201725773012701747852000901874856008501883930003301968946001102001655001202012IND4415127520221117230340.0090120e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441512752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00359-008-0385-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuillfeldt, Petra 10aAcute stress hyporesponsive period in nestling Thin-billed prions Pachyptila belcheri  ap. 91-98.  a2019-12-04  aWhen confronted with acute stressors, vertebrates show a highly conserved evolved sequence of physiological, hormonal and behavioural responses, including the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Many young vertebrates show a stress hyporesponsive period, where they exhibit a reduced glucocorticoid response. Here, we analyzed the stress response of nestling Thin-billed prions Pachyptila belcheri and compared chicks with different previous experience with capture and handling. We found that chicks had a stress response, but baseline and peak levels were below those measured in adults. The stress response of the chicks was rapid and followed by fast recovery, such that the total amount of corticosterone released in response to handling was very much lower in chicks than adults. These results indicate that nestling Thin-billed prions exhibit a stress hyporesponsive period. This was not due to habituation, as CORT measurements at baseline and elevated levels were similar in chicks handled daily and naïve chicks. The comparison with other published studies showed that the stress response of chicks usually peaks earlier and lower than in adults, and researchers should take care to measure stress-induced levels at an appropriate sampling time. 3aPachyptila belcheri 3astress response 3acorticosterone 3achicks 3aadults 3anestlings 0avertebrates1 aPoisbleau, Maud 1 aChastel, Olivier 1 aMasello, Juan F. 0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2009 Jan., v. 195, no. 1 p.91-98dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-008-0385-43Available from publisher's Web site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02391naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245008600187300001600273520077000289650001501059650002001074650001901094650001401113650001201127650001501139650001601154650001401170650001101184650001201195650004101207650005701248650001101305650001201316650001201328650003001340650001401370650004001384650002401424651001801448653002801466653004001494653002201534653001401556700002601570773011501596852000901711856008501720930003301805946001101838655001201849IND4409359620221117230343.0080822e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440935962DNAL7 a184462572pmid7 a10.1007/s00114-008-0385-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeatty, Brian Lee 10aDecompression syndrome and the evolution of deep diving physiology in the Cetacea  ap. 793-801.  aWhales repetitively dive deep to feed and should be susceptible to decompression syndrome, though they are not known to suffer the associated pathologies.

Vertebrae of 331 individual modern and 996 fossil whales were subjected to macroscopic and radiographic examination. Avascular osteonecrosis was found in the Oligocene basal odontocetes (Xenorophoidea) and in geologically younger mysticetes, such as Aglaocetus [a sister taxon to Balaenopteridae + (Balaenidae + Eschrichtiidae) clade].

The two soils were treated with Minjingu phosphate rock (MPR) at 0 and 400 mg P kg(-1) soil and planted to T. vogelii, which grew for 12 weeks. The parameters assessed were plant height and nodule numbers for seedling performance, shoot and root dry matter yield for biomass quantity, and shoot N and P contents for biomass quality. Both soil pH and application of MPR significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) affected all the parameters assessed. Increase in soil pH from 5.0 to 5.9 increased plant height by 13%, nodule number by 256%, shoot biomass by 110%, and N and P uptake by 121% and 125%, respectively. Minjingu PR application in the soil of pH 5.0 increased plant height by 14%, nodule number by 31%, shoot biomass by 94%, N uptake by 193% and P uptake by 200%. In the soil of pH 5.9 the corresponding increases due to MPR application were 5% for plant height, 65% for nodule number, 36% for shoot biomass, 35% for N and 100% for P uptake. The results indicated that in acidic ferralsols with low available P, biomass yield and quality of T. vogelii were enhanced when such soil conditions were corrected. 3aFerralsols 3aTephrosia vogelii 3abiomass 3adry matter accumulation 3agreenhouses 3aplanting 3arock phosphate 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asoil pH1 aSemoka, J.M.R.1 aMaliondo, S.M.S.0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2004, v. 22, no. 1 p.57-67dA B Academic Publishersx0144-87657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2004.97549883Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02635naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001400149245008200163300001400245500002400259520159600283650002201879650002401901650000901925650001601934650001301950650002001963650001001983650001601993650001102009650001702020650000902037700001602046773011302062852000902175856008902184655001202273IND4372585420221117230254.0050721s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437258542DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2004.97549872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaziq, F.10aAntagonistic activities of selected fungal isolates against Armillaria mellea  ap. 41-56.  aIncludes references  aThe antagonistic activities of six selected fungal isolates against Armillaria mellea were studied on two different concentrations of three media, on fungicides-amended malt extract agar (MEA) medium, and in glasshouse pots filled with John Innes No.2 compost and natural field soil. Trichoderma hamatum isolate Thaml was found the most effective in reducing Armillaria growths on both the low and high concentrations of malt extract, potato dextrose and V-8 juice in MEA, potato dextrose agar (PDA) and V-8 juice agar (VJA), respectively, followed by T. harzianum isolate Th2 and T. viride isolate Tv3. Neither dose rate (200 or 2000 mg 1(-1)) of fenpropidin allowed any growth of Armillaria on MEA, while that of the antagonists was also completely inhibited or greatly restricted. However, both dose rates of fosetyl-Al allowed the growth of Armillaria and almost all the antagonists. Data on colony diameters of Armillaria showed Thaml as the most effective antagonist along with Th2, Th23 and Tv3. Thaml was also found the most effective in protecting hazel billets from colonization by Armillaria, followed by Th2 and Th23. Compared with 7.1 colonized billets in the inoculated controls, only 1.3, 2.6 and 2.7 billets (out of ten) were colonized, respectively, when protected with these antagonists. The results indicate that the Trichoderma isolates are able to maintain their antagonistic effects on A. mellea under a variety of nutritional, chemical and edaphic regimes. More investigations are needed to develop a system of control for the disease with these potential antagonists. 3aArmillaria mellea 3aTrichoderma hamatum 3aagar 3aantagonists 3acomposts 3adisease control 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3ajuices 3amalt extract 3asoil1 aFox, R.T.V.0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2004, v. 22, no. 1 p.41-56dA B Academic Publishersx0144-87657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2004.97549873Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03123naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245021400168300001400382500002400396520158600420650001502006650002102021650001102042650001102053650002402064650001602088650001902104650001402123650001802137650001802155650001602173650001102189650002202200650002002222650001402242650001002256650001102266650001202277650001102289650001102300650001902311650001402330700002102344700001302365700001602378773011302394852000902507856008902516655001202605IND4372586720221117230402.0050721s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437258672DNAL7 a10.1080/01448765.2004.97549892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoicoechea, N.14aThe association of barley with AM fungi can result in similar yield and grain quality as a long term application of P or P-K fertilizers by enhancing root phosphatase activity and sugars in leaves at tillering  ap. 69-80.  aIncludes references  aThe annual application of P and K in cereal culture causes environmental pollution, increasing cost in crop production and reduction of plant roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). In barley, AMF can improve both nutrient uptake and yield. It is also known that stored assimilates before and after anthesis are a source of carbon for grain filling, tillering being a stage strongly related to yield. The objectives of this work were to determine the influence of P and/or K fertilization on AMF colonization of barley roots and to study the relationship between organic solutes in leaves at tillering and yield. The experimental design included three treatments: (a) 0 P2O5 and 120 K2O (200 kg KCI 60% ha(-1)), (b) 160 P2O5 (360 kg superphosphate 45% ha(-1)) and 120 K2O, and (c) 160 P2O5 and 0 K2O. After 10 years, P and K in shoots, grain yield and protein in grain did not differ among treatments. As AMF can increase P absorption, the mycorrhizal colonization at tillering and harvest was studied. The highest colonization was reached in plants without any P addition, and was associated with the greatest acid phosphatase activity in roots and total soluble sugars (TSS) content in leaves at tillering. By contrast, the lowest starch and protein concentrations were measured in leaves from barley that received the highest P and K additions. Therefore, the association of barley with AMF may have resulted in similar yield and grain quality as the application of P by improving the accumulation of TSS in leaves and root acid phosphatase activity at tillering. 3aabsorption 3aacid phosphatase 3abarley 3acarbon 3aexperimental design 3afertilizers 3afilling period 3aflowering 3agrain protein 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3aleaves 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrient uptake 3apollution 3aroots 3ashoots 3asolutes 3astarch 3asugars 3asuperphosphate 3atillering1 aSanchez-Diaz, M.1 aSaez, R.1 aIraneta, J.0 tBiological agriculture & horticulture.g2004, v. 22, no. 1 p.69-80dA B Academic Publishersx0144-87657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01448765.2004.97549893Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02643naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011000124300001600234500002400250520155500274650001401829650002401843650002301867650004301890650001301933650002601946650002201972650001101994650002702005650004702032650001302079650001702092650001602109700001902125700001902144700001602163773006902179852000902248655001202257IND4372661820221117230341.0050725s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437266182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBudak, H.10aApplication of sequence-related amplified polymorphisms markers for characterization of turfgrass species  ap. 955-958.  aIncludes references  aA simple marker technique called sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) provides a useful tool for estimation of genetic diversity and phenetic relationships in natural and domesticated populations. Previous studies and our initial screen showed SRAP is highly polymorphic and more informative when compared to AFLP, RAPD and SSR markers. In this study, applicability of the SRAP markers to obtain an overview of genetic diversity and phenetic relationships present among cool-season (C3) and warm-season (C4) turfgrass species and their relationship with other Gramineae species were tested. Phenetic trees based on genetic similarities (UPGMA, N-J) were consistent with known taxonomic relationships. In some cases, well-supported relationships as well as evidence by genetic reticulation could be inferred. There was widespread genetic variation among C3 and C4 turfgrass species. In Dice based cophenetic matrix, genetic similarities among all species studied ranged from 0.08 to 0.94, whereas in Jaccard based cophenetic matrix, genetic similarities ranged from 0.05 to 0.85. C3 and C4 species were clearly distinguishable and a close relationship between italian ryegrass and tall fescue were obtained based on SRAP. Genome structures of turfgrasses are comparable to other Gramineae species. This research indicates that the SRAP markers are useful for estimating genetic relationships in a wide range of turfgrass species. The SRAP markers identified in this study can provide a useful reference for future turfgrass breeding efforts. 3aC4 plants 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aLolium multiflorum 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abreeding 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agenome 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ataxonomy 3aturf grasses 3awarm season1 aShearman, R.C.1 aGaussoin, R.E.1 aDweikat, I.0 tHortScience.g2004 Aug., v. 39, no. 5 p.955-958x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001600162245013400178300001600312500007600328520120800404650002701612650002001639650002501659650002301684650002401707650003501731650002001766650001701786650001201803650001101815650004301826650004501869650000901914650003901923650001301962650003201975653001702007653002902024700002002053700001602073700002002089700001702109700001702126700002702143700002102170700002002191773008702211852000902298856008402307930003302391945001302424946001302437655001202450IND2196601220221117230258.0990122e199807  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219660122DNAL7 a97019442pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.4.5562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyint, K.S.10aImmunocytochemical methods to study the distribution of Orientia tsutsugamushi in Leptotrombidium (Acari: Trombiculidae) chiggers  ap. 556-560.  aIn the special issue dedicated to Robert Traub / edited by C.

Rickettsial antigen was detected by application of a simple direct or amplified immunocytochemistry procedure and an indirect immunofluorescent procedure. In the direct procedure alkaline phosphatase conjugation to the mouse polyclonal antibody to the Karp strain was followed by the HistoMark Red test system to detect rickettsial antigen. The amplification procedure used a similar method but used an unlabeled primary antibody followed by secondary biotinylated antimouse IgG, streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase, and the HistoMark Red test system. The immunofluorescent procedure included a biotinylated secondary antibody followed by addition of a streptavidin-FITC conjugate. Specific tissue tropisms in infected chiggers were observed in the salivary glands, nervous tissue, and ovaries of adult female mites in all procedures; however, nonspecific fluorescence of the chigger limited definitive identification of tissue tropisms with the indirect immunofluorescent procedure. 3aOrientia tsutsugamushi 3aLeptotrombidium 3aspatial distribution 3abacterial antigens 3aimmunocytochemistry 3afluorescent antibody technique 3adisease vectors 3ascrub typhus 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect 2aMice 2aOrientia tsutsugamushiximmunology 2aRodentia 2aTrombiculidaexmicrobiology 0alocalization 0aleptotrombidium imphalum1 aLinthicum, K.J.1 aTanskul, P.1 aLerdthusnee, K.1 aVaughn, D.W.1 aManomuth, C.1 aMongkolsirichaikul, D.1 aHansukjariya, P.1 aHastriter, M.W.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 July, v. 35, no. 4 p.556-560x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.4.5563Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01684naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010800127300001600235500001500251520078200266650002401048653002201072700001801094700001801112700001601130700001701146700001501163773012401178852000901302930003301311945001301344946001301357655001201370IND2059635420221117230308.0970914e199709  mau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205963542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurayama, T.10aDirect action of melatonin on hen ovarian granulosa cells to lower responsiveness to luteinzing hormone  ap. 386-392.  a2019-12-05  aThe presence of a melatonin-binding component in the membrane fraction of the ovarian granulosa cells of hens that has characteristics of a receptor such as high affinity, limited capacity, reversible binding, and binding specificity was demonstrated by radioligand binding assays. When the cells were incubated in vitro with various concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the presence and absence of melatonin (1 and 5 nM), the dose-response curve for the LH-stimulated progesterone production was shifted to a higher concentration of LH: ED50 of LH was approximately two times greater in the presence of melatonin. The results suggest a direct action of melatonin on the ovarian granulosa cells of the hen to lower the responsiveness to LH for progesterone production. 3aanimal reproduction 0aanimal physiology1 aKawashima, M.1 aTakahashi, T.1 aYasuoka, T.1 aKuwayama, T.1 aTanaka, K.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1997 Sept., v. 215, no. 4 p.386-392x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01855naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001900162245009800181300001600279500001500295520049300310650002300803650001600826650001300842650002100855650001200876650005400888650001400942650001400956650004800970651001101018653001401029653001301043653002101056653001401077700001801091700001801109700001801127773008801145852000901233856008401242930003301326945001301359946001301372655001201385IND2197165320221117230346.0990223e199809  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219716532DNAL7 a97756252pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.5.8912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, L.M.F.10aRecognition of the tick genus Anocentor Schulze, 1937 (Acari: Ixodidae) by numerical taxonomy  ap. 891-894.  a2019-12-04  aWe report on an evaluation of the systematic position of the tick Anocentor nitens (Neumann), examining particularly whether Anocentor should be regarded as a subgenus of Dermacentor or as a separate genus.

The temperature was kept at 16 degrees C, a common temperature on the ground floor of Dutch houses. Partially dehydrated mites were exposed to various humidity regimes in the absence of food and liquid water. Some mites gained weight when moist air was given for only 1.5 h every day. In the presence of food, egg production was recorded when moist air was given for at least 3 h daily, whereas the average relative humidity was quite low and less than the critical equilibrium humidity of D. pteronyssinus. Brief spells of elevated humidity allowed populations to survive much longer in a microclimate that was otherwise too dry, and may be decisive for survival during the winter months. We found that average relative humidity was misleading as an indicator of mite survival and growth conditions. 3aweight 3aDermatophagoides pteronyssinus 3adust mites 3aoviposition 3arelative humidity 3apopulation density 2aAcarixphysiology 2aAnimals 2aHousing 2aHumans 2aHumidity 2aMicroclimate 2aMitesxphysiology 2aSeasons 0aNetherlands 0adehydration (physiological) 0apopulation change 0acyclic fluctuations 0acritical equilibrium humidity 0awater balance1 aKuller, K.1 aKahl, O.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.905-910x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.6.9053Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03016naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001400162245013300176300001600309500001500325520132500340650002001665650001401685650003201699650001401731650003401745650001201779650002401791650001901815650001201834650004101846650001101887650002601898650004301924650000901967650002201976650001601998650002702014650002902041650003102070650002802101653001402129653001802143653002502161653001202186700001302198773008702211852000902298856008402307930003302391945001302424946001302437655001202450IND2198847520221117230415.0990521e199811  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219884752DNAL7 a98356862pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.6.9562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJahan, N.10aEffect of Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis (Haemosporidia: Plasmodiidae) on Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae) vitellogenesis  ap. 956-961.  a2019-12-04  aOur previous studies demonstrated a significant reduction in the egg production and survival of Anopeles stephensi Liston infected with Plasmodium yoelii nigeriensis Killick-Kendrick. We investigated the physiological mechanism underlying the malaria-induced curtailment of reproductive fitness. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against An. stephensi vitellin (Vn) and used in an enzyme immunoassay to quantify ovarian Vn and hemolymph vitellogenin (Vg) at 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 48 h postblood feeding in infected and noninfected mosquitoes. Initially, the concentration of Vg in the hemolymph and the accumulation of Vn in the ovaries of infected females were identical to females fed on noninfected mice, indicating that the synthesis of yolk protein by the fat bodies was initiated normally. However, there was a significant reduction in ovarian Vn at 24 and 48 h postblood feeding and a significant accumulation of Vg at 20 and 24 h postblood feeding in the hemolymph of infected mosquitoes. This increase in concentration of Vg in the hemolymph just before Vn reduction in the ovaries of infected mosquitoes indicated that synthesis at the fat body level may not be affected, but that sequestration of Vg by ovarian follicles of malaria-infected mosquitoes may be affected before resorbing follicles lose protein. 3adisease vectors 3afecundity 3ahost-parasite relationships 3ahemolymph 3aPlasmodium yoelii nigeriensis 3amalaria 3aAnopheles stephensi 3avitellogenesis 2aAnimals 2aAnophelesxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHemolymphxphysiology 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxphysiology 2aMice 2aOvaryxphysiology 2aOviposition 2aPlasmodiumxphysiology 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aVitellogenesisxphysiology 2aVitellogeninsxanalysis 0avitellins 0avitellogenins 0areproductive fitness 0aovaries1 aHurd, H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.956-961x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.6.9563Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03073naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001700163245015500180300001800335500001500353520128200368650002301650650001701673650002001690650001201710650002101722650002501743650002301768650002601791650002201817650001401839650001201853650004601865650002701911650003301938650001001971650002601981650004402007650001002051650005002061651001502111653002502126653002502151653002602176653001902202700001502221700001702236773008902253852000902342856008502351930003302436945001302469946001302482655001202495IND2198851120221117230530.0990521e199811  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219885112DNAL7 a98357002pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.6.10442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWright, S.A.10aInfestation of the southern alligator lizard (Squamata: Anguidae) by Ixodes pacificus (Acari: Ixodidae) and its susceptibility to Borrelia burgdorferi  ap. 1044-1049.  a2019-12-04  aTo investigate the reservoir potential of the southern alligator lizard, Elgaria multicarinata (Blainville), for the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner, 14 lizards were collected from 1 county on each side of the northern Central Valley of California. Seven animals were collected from a Placer County site (Drivers Flat) and a Yolo County site (Cache Creek) where B. burgdorferi had been isolated previously from Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls. Overall, the mean abundance of I. pacificus on all 14 lizards was 34.1 (range, 3-63) for larvae and 11.0 (range, 1-28) for nymphs. In captivity, field-attached I. pacificus larvae and nymphs required, on average, 12.6 (range, 1-37) and 14.4 (range, 5-44) d to feed to repletion, respectively. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi infection in host-seeking I. pacificus nymphs was 1.4% in Cache Creek Canyon and 9.9% in Drivers Flat. Attempts to isolate spirochetes from lizard blood or ticks that had fed on lizards and subsequently molted were unsuccessful as were efforts to cultivate spirochetes in lizard sera. These data suggest that the southern alligator lizard is not a competent reservoir for B. burgdorferi, although it is an important host for I. pacificus subadults. 3adisease reservoirs 3aLyme disease 3adisease vectors 3alizards 3aIxodes pacificus 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3apopulation density 3abiological resistance 3atick infestations 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aBorrelia burgdorferi Groupxpathogenicity 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aIxodesxgrowth & development 2aLarva 2aLizardsxparasitology 2aLyme Diseasextransmissionxveterinary. 2aNymph 2aTick Infestationsxcomplicationsxveterinary. 3aCalifornia 0ainfection prevalance 0areservoir competence 0aelgaria multicarinata 0aSpirochaetales1 aLane, R.S.1 aClover, J.R.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.1044-1049x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.6.10443Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03092naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001800163245015100181300001800332500001500350520137300365650002801738650001801766650001801784650001301802650001401815650001801829650002501847650002201872650001201894650002901906650003901935650003801974650001802012650001402030650002902044650002302073653002402096653002202120653001202142653002802154653001902182653002102201653002102222653002502243700001602268773008902284852000902373856008502382930003302467945001302500946001302513655001202526IND2198849820221117230338.0990521e199811  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219884982DNAL7 a98356932pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.6.10022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarreno, R.A.10aSmall subunit ribosomal RNA genes of tabanids and hippoboscids (Diptera: Brachycera): evolutionary relationships and comparison with other diptera  ap. 1002-1006.  a2019-12-04  aThe small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes of hippoboscid (Ornithoica vicina Walker) and tabanid (Chrysops niger Macquart) Diptera were sequenced to determine their phylogenetic position within the order and to determine whether or not extensive hypervariable regions in this gene are widespread in the Diptera. A parsimony analysis of an alignment containing 8 dipteran sequences produced a single most parsimonious tree that placed O. vicina as sister group to Drosophila melanogaster Meigen. The tabanid Chrysops niger was sister group to the asilomorphan taxa, and the sister group to the Brachycera was a Tipula sp. although this relationship was not supported by bootstrap analysis. The hippoboscid and tabanid sequences contain extensive hypervariable regions in the V2, V4, V6, and V7 regions as do other Diptera. When these regions of the alignment were excluded from the phylogenetic analysis, a single most parsimonious tree was found. This tree had an identical overall topology to the tree obtained from the total data set. The hypervariable regions in parts of the dipteran SSU rRNA genes were more extensive in the nematocerous dipteran sequences used in this study than in the other dipteran representatives; these hypervariable regions may be of more utility in inferring relationship among species and subspecies than at the suprageneric level. 3ainterspecific variation 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomal DNA 3aChrysops 3aphylogeny 3aHippoboscidae 3anucleotide sequences 3agenetic variation 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aDipteraxclassificationxgenetics. 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aGenes, Insect 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 0aspecies differences 0aornithoica vicina 0aDiptera 0amolecular sequence data 0achyrsops niger 0agenbank/af073888 0agenbank/af073889 0ahypervariable region1 aBarta, J.R.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Nov., v. 35, no. 6 p.1002-1006x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.6.10023Available from publisher's Web site  a19990702b19990709c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02300naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003500110040001800145100001700163245013200180300001800312520073200330650001901062650003801081650002201119650001201141650002501153650002101178650001401199650001301213650002001226650001201246650009801258650005701356650001901413650001401432651001501446651001501461653002801476653002601504700001701530700001701547773008901564852000901653856008501662930003301747945001301780946001301793655001201806IND2198850420221117230326.0990521e199811  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219885042DNAL7 a98356962pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.6.10202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKramer, L.D.10aVector competence of Aedes dorsalis (Diptera: Culicidae) from Morro Bay, California, for western equine encephalomyelitis virus  ap. 1020-1024.  aIn laboratory vector competence studies, Aedes dorsalis (Meigen) collected from Morro Bay, CA, did not vertically transmit sympatric strains of western equine encephalomyelitis virus (WEE). This population of Ae. dorsalis was highly susceptible to oral infection and was a competent horizontal vector of WEE. The E2 region of the viral genome of the 3 virus strains isolated from Ae. dorsalis in Morro Bay were closely related genetically to a strain of WEE isolated in 1953 from a geographically separate location that is used regularly in the laboratory.

Replicate groups of laboratory-reared teneral females ("< or ="1 d old) were allowed to feed ad libitum on a 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20% sucrose solution, and total glycogen, lipids, and sugars were assayed at 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after exposure to sugar. Mosquitoes fed sugar increased nutrient levels with time. The pattern of accumulation was significantly different between small and large mosquitoes. Large mosquitoes accumulated larger amounts of glycogen than small ones. Accumulation of lipid increased sooner in small (4 h) than large (48 h) Ae. aegypti. A significant size X time interaction for the amount of sugar per female indicated that small mosquitoes may need to feed more than once during a 72-h period to compensate for low energy reserves at emergence. We conclude that the pattern of energy utilization from sugar meals by Ae. aegypti is influenced by the amount of energy reserves that they have before feeding and not by the concentration of sugar on which they feed. 3atemporal variation 3achemical composition 3asucrose 3aglycogen 3aAedes aegypti 3alipids 3asugar feeding 3anutrient reserves 2aAedesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aFemale 2aGlycogenxmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aSucrose 0asize 0asugars 0aconcentration1 aEdman, J.D.1 aScott, TW.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1999 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.8-12x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/36.1.83Available from publisher's Web site  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02609naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001400162245011000176300001600286500001500302520096300317650001501280650002201295650002001317650001101337650001401348650001901362650001801381650001001399650002501409650002201434650003001456650002001486650001201506650001201518650001401530650002501544650001601569650001101585650002401596650002501620650001601645653002601661653002401687653001801711700002001729700001601749700001401765773008801779852000901867856008401876930003301960945001301993946001302006655001202019IND2197155420221117230448.0990222e199809  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219715542DNAL7 a97755862pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.5.6462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, S.10aNew procedures to estimate water temperatures and water depths for application in climate-dengue modeling  ap. 646-652.  a2019-12-04  aTwo new approaches have been developed to estimate water temperatures and water depths in containers that commonly are used as breeding sites for mosquitoes, the primary vectors of dengue viruses. These estimates are incorporated in recently developed stochastic simulation models used to describe the daily dynamics of dengue virus transmission in the urban environment. Water temperature estimates are provided through a regression model that includes meteorological variables not previously used; results show that they are significantly better than those used in previous dengue transmission models. Water depth models use a climatic water budget approach which estimates moisture storage within containers. The water depth models are less precise than those developed for water temperature; however, results are superior to those used in previous models. These new approaches should improve estimates of the impact of water conditions on dengue vectors. 3aestimation 3asimulation models 3adisease vectors 3adengue 3aequations 3abreeding sites 3aAedes aegypti 3adepth 3adisease transmission 3awater temperature 3ameteorological parameters 2aAedesxvirology 2aAnimals 2aClimate 2aCulicidae 2aDenguextransmission 2aFresh Water 2aHumans 2aRegression Analysis 2aStochastic Processes 2aTemperature 0aclimatic water budget 0astepwise regression 0awater balance1 aKalkstein, L.S.1 aFocks, D.A.1 aNnaji, A.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.646-652x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.5.6463Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02822naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100002000162245011500182300001600297520132000313650001801633650001801651650001801669650001701687650001901704650001601723650002301739650001301762650002301775650002401798650002001822650001201842650001001854650003401864650002101898650001101919650001601930650002301946650001201969651001901981651001902000653001702019700001602036773008802052852000902140856008402149930003302233945001302266946001302279655001202292IND2197157720221117230404.0990222e199809  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219715772DNAL7 a97755972pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.5.7042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomberlin, J.K.10aSeasonal colonization and decomposition of rat carrion in water and on land in an open field in South Carolina  ap. 704-709.  aDecomposition and insect colonization of rat, Rattus rartus L., carrion on land and in water were compared during summer and winter in a plowed field in northwestern South Carolina. During winter, carcasses on land reached the dried-remains stage of decomposition, whereas carcasses in water reached the early-floating stage. During summer, carcasses in both habitats entered the final-remains stage of decomposition in 1-2 wk. Fewer than 30 species of carrion insects were recorded from the carcasses over the duration of the study, probably reflecting the small size of the carcasses and the depauperate fauna of the habitat. Three species of blow flies-Cynomyopsis cadaverina (Rohineau-Desvoidy), Calliphora vicino Robineau-Desvoidy, and Lucilia illustris (Meigen)-colonized carrion on land during winter, but no insects colonized carrion in water during winter. Two species of blow flies, Cochliomyia macellaria (F.) and Phaenicia sericata (Meigen), and 1 species of flesh fly, Sarcophaca bullata Parker, colonized the carrion on land and in water during summer, the blow fly Phormia regina (Meigen), colonized only the carrion on land. This study demonstrated seasonal variation in decomposition and colonization patterns of carrion in contrasting habitats, with important implications for forensic entomology. 3aCalliphoridae 3aSarcophagidae 3aRattus rattus 3adead animals 3ameat carcasses 3adegradation 3apopulation density 3ahabitats 3aseasonal variation 3aforensic entomology 3acarrion insects 2aAnimals 2aDeath 2aDipteraxgrowth & development 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFresh Water 2aRatsxparasitology 2aSeasons 3aSouth Carolina 0aSouth Carolina 0acolonization1 aAdler, P.H.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.704-709x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.5.7043Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02845naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100002000162245012800182300001600310520124000326650002701566650001301593650002401606650002401630650002201654650001601676650002301692650002701715650001401742650001701756650001801773650002001791650001901811650001601830650001201846650001601858650001301874650001001887650001601897650002301913650001601936650003501952651001001987651001001997700001502007700001702022773008802039852000902127856008402136930003302220945001302253946001302266655001202279IND2197158320221117230332.0990222e199809  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219715832DNAL7 a97756032pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.5.7402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhrenfeld, M.J.10aPopulation parameters of Triatoma spinolai (Heteroptera: Reduviidae) under different environmental conditions and densities  ap. 740-744.  aPopulation parameters of Triatoma spinolai Porter were studied using specimens collected in the north and central region of Chile. Two cohorts of 17 and 44 first instars were maintained at a constant temperature of 28 degrees C and 70% RH. Two similar cohorts of bugs were exposed to 16-24 degrees C and 55-75% RH and maintained under a photoperiod of 14:10 (L:D) h for 16 mo. The preimaginal period ranged between 285 and 372 d under constant conditions. The lower-density cohort required 9.5 mo to reach the adult stage compared with 12.4 mo for the high-density cohort. Bugs placed under variable temperature and relative humidity conditions did not survive long. Cohorts with higher densities had similar mortality rates with greater mortality occuring in cohorts that had lower numbers of bugs. Cohorts under constant temperature and relative humidity reproduced and basic reproduction rates (Ro, intrinsic growth rate [r], and generation time [G]) were estimated. Cohorts with higher numbers of bugs had higher Ro and r, whereas values of C were similar for both groups. Apparently, 25 degrees C was a critical temperature threshold for T. spinolai and there appeared to be a minimal population density that allowed reproduction. 3alife cycle (organisms) 3aTriatoma 3apopulation dynamics 3aambient temperature 3arelative humidity 3aphotoperiod 3apopulation density 3abiological development 3amortality 3areproduction 3aage structure 3adisease vectors 3aChagas disease 3alife tables 2aAnimals 2aEnvironment 2aHumidity 2aLarva 2aPhotoperiod 2aPopulation Density 2aTemperature 2aTriatomaxgrowth & development 3aChile 0aChile1 aCanals, M.1 aCattan, P.E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.740-744x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.5.7403Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03646naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001500162245017500177300001600352520194000368650001802308650001602326650002802342650002702370650001102397650001002408650002302418650001502441650001602456650002502472650002402497650002202521650001202543650001202555650001302567650001102580650001602591650001102607650001002618650001602628650002302644650001502667653001602682653002302698653001302721653001502734653001702749653002402766700001402790773008802804852000902892856008402901930003302985945001303018946001303031655001203044IND2197158920221117230101.0990222e199809  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219715892DNAL7 a97756092pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.5.7822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZahiri, N.10aOviposition attraction and repellency of Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) to waters from conspecific larvae subjected to crowding, confinement, starvation, or infection  ap. 782-787.  aAs the biomass of Aedes aegypti (L.) larvae increased in relation to the volume of rearing waters, oviposition attraction of these waters to conspecific, gravid females first rose to a peak and then declined. Further increases in biomass rendered waters strongly repellent. Comparable responses were elicited by a decrease in the volume of rearing waters or an increase in the relative size or number of mosquito larvae. Low volumes of water reduced oviposition attraction and increased repellency, whereas larger volumes increased attraction. Excessively large volumes diluted attraction to neutrality. Constraints imposed by the physical dimensions of the larval environment which interfered with the normal postural movements and behaviors of the larvae also induced repellency, independent of rearing volume. Titration of repellent waters revealed that infection with the digenean Plagiorchis elegans (Rudolphi) generated the most powerful repellent effect, whereas crowding or starvation induced significantly weaker responses. At no time did dilution of repellent waters restore attractive properties. Repellents, even at minute concentrations, overrode attractants. The density-dependent action of oviposition attractants and repellents may help to maintain larval populations near optimal levels through their influence on recruitment. Oviposition repellency induced by sublethal infections with P. elegans may maintain population levels below the carrying capacity of the environment. Persistence of oviposition attraction and repellency varied inversely with temperature. The magnitude of the repellent effect induced by larvae appears to be a good indicator of their probability of survival and may be of selective significance. Repellency may deflect ovipositing females away from sites close to human habitation and may lead to new, and perhaps more effective, method, to control mosquitoes and the diseases they transmit. 3aAedes aegypti 3aoviposition 3aoviposition attractants 3aoviposition deterrents 3alarvae 3awater 3apopulation density 3astarvation 3aPlagiorchis 3atrematode infections 3aambient temperature 2aAedesxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBiomass 2aCrowding 2aFemale 2aFresh Water 2aHumans 2aLarva 2aOviposition 2aPopulation Density 2aStarvation 0aconstraints 0adensity dependence 0acrowding 0arepellency 0alarval water 0aplagiorchis elegans1 aRau, M.E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.782-787x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.5.7823Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02680naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001800162245012000180300001600300520106700316650002801383650002501411650002301436650001401459650002201473650002001495650001701515650001801532650001201550650003001562650002501592650005701617650002301674650001401697650001101711650002501722650001001747650003101757650002901788651001701817651001701834700001901851700001701870700001101887773008801898852000901986856008401995930003302079945001302112946001302125655001202138IND2197159220221117225944.0990222e199809  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219715922DNAL7 a97756122pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.5.8042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarkowski, D.10aReservoir competence of the meadow vole (Rodentia: Cricetidae) for the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi  ap. 804-808.  aThe reservoir competence of the meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus Ord, for the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner was established on Patience Island, RI. Meadow voles were collected from 5 locations throughout Rhode Island. At 4 of the field sites, M. pennsylvanicus represented only 4.0% (n = 141) of the animals captured. However, on Patience Island, M. pennsylvanicus was the sole small mammal collected (n = 48). Of the larval Ixodes scapularis Say obtained from the meadow voles on Patience Island, 62% (n = 78) was infected with B. burgdorferi. Meadow voles from all 5 locations were successfully infected with B. burgdorferi in the laboratory and were capable of passing the infection to xenodiagnostic I. scapullaris larvae for 9 wk. We concluded that M. pennsylvanicus was physiologically capable of maintaining B. burgdorferi infection. However,in locations where Peromyscus leucopus (Rafinesque) is abundant, the role of M. pennsylvanicus as a primary reservoir for B. burgdorferi was reduced. 3aMicrotus pennsylvanicus 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3adisease reservoirs 3ainfection 3aIxodes scapularis 3adisease vectors 3aLyme disease 3apathogenicity 2aAnimals 2aArvicolinaexparasitology 2aBorrelia burgdorferi 2aBorrelia burgdorferi Groupxisolation & purification 2aDisease Reservoirs 2aGeography 2aHumans 2aIxodesxmicrobiology 2aLarva 2aLyme Diseasextransmission 2aPeromyscusxparasitology 3aRhode Island 0aRhode Island1 aGinsberg, H.S.1 aHyland, K.E.1 aHu, R.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Sept., v. 35, no. 5 p.804-808x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.5.8043Available from publisher's Web site  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03003naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245013500145300001700280500001500297520096600312650001801278650002101296650002201317650002001339650001801359650002501377650002001402650001001422650002401432650001201456650002101468650002401489650001201513650001801525650002301543650002301566650002301589650002601612650002301638650004601661650001801707650002001725650003301745650004001778650002801818650003301846650003001879650003501909650000801944650001901952650002201971650002201993653002202015653002802037653002502065653001902090653001202109700001702121773010102138852000902239930003302248945001302281946001102294655001202305IND2045401420221117230043.0950405e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204540142DNAL7 a75356192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBinger, L.C.10aIdentification of the cDNA, gene and promoter for a major protein from flexible cuticles of the giant silkmoth Hyalophora cecropia  ap. 989-1000.  a2019-12-05  aWe have isolated and sequenced a cDNA and region of genomic DNA that encode HCCP12, a major protein found in flexible cuticles of all three metamorphic stages of the giant silkmoth, Hyalophora cecropia. The gene for HCCP12 contains two introns with the first intron interrupting the signal peptide. The 5' flanking region contains 478 base pairs (bp) with about 95% identity to the prototype of a common Cecropia insertion element. The RACE procedure was used to produce cDNAs corresponding to the 5' ends of mRNAs for HCCP12 isolated from larval, pupal and pharate adult epidermal cells. Sequences from 21 cloned cDNAs were almost identical. It was thus concluded that a single gene and a single promoter (as evidenced by a single transcriptional start site) for HCCP12 are used in all three metamorphic stages. Hence, neither stage-specific gene sets nor stage-specific promoters are essential for metamorphic transitions of cuticular protein gene expression. 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aanimal proteins 3ametamorphosis 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aexons 3aHyalophora cecropia 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aEpidermisxmetabolism 2aGene Amplification 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenes, Insect 2aInsect Proteins 2aLarvaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMetamorphosis, Biologicalxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMothsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aProteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRNA 2aRNA, Messenger 2aSequence Analysis 2aSequence Homology 0acuticular protein 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u08026 0acuticle1 aWillis, J.H.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1994 Dec., v. 24, no. 10 p.989-1000x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03054naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001700198245010800215300001800323500001500341520122100356650003501577650003301612650002101645650002001666650002301686650002201709650000901731650001001740650002101750650001701771650002701788650001201815650002101827650003301848650005001881650004201931650001101973650002001984650003302004650003902037650003602076653002902112700002702141700001902168700002502187773008902212852000902301856008502310930003302395945002502428946001102453655001202464IND4410042220221117225921.0080909e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441004222DNAL7 a186084992pmid7 a10.1080/026520307018818432doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The six PBDEs targeted were chosen on criteria of toxicity and occurrence in environmental matrices. Three methods of extraction were tested and compared in terms of lipid recovery yields and repeatability. The sample preparation process includes two steps: extraction by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and purification by solid phase extraction (SPE). The preferred method of extraction used a hexane/methylene chloride/methanol (5 : 2 : 1, v/v) solvent mixture. Three extraction cycles were carried out per sample at a temperature of 80°C and a pressure of 1500 psi. The method was validated on milk cream samples spiked with the specified PBDEs. Recoveries for the whole sample preparation process (extraction and cleanup) for cream samples spiked at 10 and 100 ng g-1 were greater than 80% (ranging from 81 to 106%) at both concentrations for BDE-99, -100, -153 and 154. Recoveries were lower (ranging from 65 to 75%) for BDE-28 and BDE-47. PBDEs were quantified by GC/MS detection with selected ion monitoring (SIM) using three ions formed by electron capture. The method was successfully tested on real samples. 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3acapillary gas chromatography 3aflame retardants 3asteroidogenesis 3afood contamination 3amass spectrometry 3amilk 3acream 3atoxicity testing 3acream cheese 3aenvironmental exposure 2aAnimals 2aCheesexanalysis 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometryxmethods 2aHalogenated Diphenyl Ethersxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMilkxchemistry 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aPolybrominated Biphenylsxanalysis 2aSolid Phase Extractionxmethods 0aflame retardant finishes1 aBouchonnet, Stéphane.1 aAbjean, Janine1 aCampargue, Christian0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2008 Aug., v. 25, no. 8 p.1007-1014x0265-203X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/026520307018818433Available from publisher's Web site  a20081027b20081101c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/10/26  aNon-US 7aarticle03115naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245018500145300001800330520165700348650002602005650001802031650001802049650001902067650001502086650001902101650001202120650002802132650003902160650001202199650002402211650002102235650003202256650002602288650006702314650003202381650004302413653001502456700001802471773010202489852000902591930003302600945001302633946001102646655001202657IND2045401620221117230115.0950405e199412  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204540162DNAL7 a77039842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakagawa, Y.10aDiflubenzuron affects gamma-thioGTP stimulated Ca2+ transport in vitro in intracellular vesicles from the integument of the newly molted American cockroach, Periplaneta americana L  ap. 1009-1015.  aTo study the mechanism of action of diflubenzuron (DFB) and other benzoylphenylureas, we have initially hypothesized that their action may be related to exocytosis: to test the hypothesis, we obtained an intracellular vesicle preparation from the homogenate of integument of newly molted American cockroaches (Periplaneta americana L.) in 10 mM MES buffer containing 250 mM sucrose (isotonic) and 2.5 mM MgSO4, at pH 6.6. By studying DFB's effect on various ion transporting activities, we demonstrated that calcium uptake in this intracellular particulate preparation was significantly inhibited by DFB at low concentrations (e.g., 10(-8) M). Such an inhibitory effect of DFB on Ca2+ uptake was eliminated by the addition of ionophores or membrane disruptors, as well as the sonication of vesicle preparation. On the other hand, oligomycin, protein phosphorylation modulators, Na+, and Li+ did not affect the calcium uptake. Among ionophores, agents disrupting H+ gradients (e.g. FCCP and NEM) totally eliminated 45 Ca uptaking activity by vesicles as well as the inhibitory effect of DFB. Among calcium ion modulators, calmodulin inhibitors such as calmidazolium and trifluoperazine decreased the Ca2+-uptake, whereas membrane calcium channel blocker, verapamil, did not. ATP and gamma-S-GTP stimulated Ca2+ uptake. However, the former increased only the DFB insensitive portion and the latter largely the DFB sensitive part of Ca2+. Together these data support the hypothesis that the action site of DFB in this preparation is the GTP-dependent Ca2+ transport process which is coupled to vacuolar type intracellular vesicles in the integument cells. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3adiflubenzuron 3aion transport 3acell membranes 3aintegument 3ainorganic ions 3acalcium 3ainsecticidal properties 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aCell-Free System 2aDiflubenzuronxpharmacology 2aEpidermisxmetabolism 2aGuanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)xmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aIon Transportxdrug effects 2aPeriplanetaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0ainhibition1 aMatsumura, F.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1994 Dec., v. 24, no. 10 p.1009-1015x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01896naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001800162245011200180300001600292520064100308650001600949650001200965650001000977650001600987650001201003650002001015650002101035650001101056650001201067651001501079651001101094651001501105651001101120653004801131700001601179700001601195773008701211852000901298856008401307930003301391945001301424946001301437655001201450IND2163782520221117225912.0980901e199711  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216378252DNAL7 a94391302pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/34.6.7352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullens, B.A.10aLizard feeding by Leptoconops (Brachyconops) californiensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) on desert sand dunes  ap. 735-737.  aAdult females of Leptoconops (Brachyconops) californiensis Wirth & Atchley and 1 female of Leptoconops (Holoconops) sp. near knowltoni were collected from 5 species of lizards in desert sand dune habitats in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, California, and northern Sonora, Mexico.

Some rods were treated basally or apically with substances r ubbed from pelage associated with the tarsal or interdigital glands of white-tai led deer, Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann). Except for the activity immediate ly following their release, tick activity on both days was greatest during the p eriod from 1700 to 2300 hours, which coincided with the onset of scotophase. Tic ks were most active when rods had interdigital gland substances applied to their basal 2 cm, whereas they were least active when confined with rods treated with tarsal gland substances on their apical 2 cm. Overall, ticks spent more time on the apical 2 cm of the glass rods during the scotophase than during the photoph ase. The highest level of apical arrestment among treated and untreated rods occ urred when the rod tips were treated with tarsal gland substances, with female t icks on the apical 2 cm of the rods 70-100% of every 3-h period beginning with t he period from 2000 to 2300 hours on day 1.

Such regulation may be important given that colony growth is often limited by protein availability. In this paper, we present what are, to our knowledge, the first data for social insects showing that thoracic temperatures (T th) of foragers increase with the protein content of food resources. In an introduced population of western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica), we measured T th of foragers collecting high-quality protein (100% canned chicken) and low-quality protein (50% canned chicken, 50% indigestible alpha-cellulose by volume) at different ambient air temperatures (T a). Wasps foraging on 100% chicken consistently exhibited higher T th compared to wasps foraging on 50% chicken. After correcting for T a, the mean T th for wasps collecting 100% chicken were 1.98°C higher than those of individuals collecting 50% chicken. We suggest that this mechanism may increase foraging efficiency in this and other social wasp species. 3aVespula pensylvanica 3aair temperature 3abody temperature 3acellulose 3achickens 3aforaging 3aprotein content 3aprotein value 3asocial insects 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aBeesxphysiology 2aBody Temperature 2aBody Temperature Regulation 2aChickens 2aDietary Proteins 2aFeeding Behavior 2aInsect Proteinsxphysiology 2aMeat 2aSocial Behavior 2aWaspsxphysiology 0aProtein 0aWasp1 aWilson, E.

Structural features of polysaccharides that induce intra-abdominal abscesses. SCIENCE: 262:416-419) and is stabilized by a zwitterionic charge motif (Kreisman LS, Friedman JH, Neaga A, Cobb BA. 2007. Structure and function relations with a T-cell-activating polysaccharide antigen using circular dichroism. GLYCOBIOLOGY: 17:46-55), suggesting a strong carbohydrate structure-function relationship. In this study, we show that PSA, the ZPS from Bacteroides fragilis, associates with MHCII at high affinity and 1:1 stoichiometry through a mechanism mirroring peptide presentation. Interestingly, PSA binding was mutually exclusive with common MHCII antigens and showed significant allelic differences in binding affinity. The antigen exchange factor HLA-DM that catalyzes peptide antigen association with MHCII also increased the rate of ZPS association and was required for APC presentation and ZPS-mediated T cell activation. Finally, the zwitterionic nature of these antigens was required only for MHCII binding, and not endocytosis, processing, or vesicular trafficking to MHCII-containing vesicles. This report is the first quantitative analysis of the binding mechanism of carbohydrate antigens with MHCII and leads to a novel model for nontraditional MHCII antigen presentation during bacterial infections.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBacteroides fragilis 3aT-lymphocytes 3aabscess 3aantigen presentation 3aantigen-presenting cells 3aantigens 3abacterial infections 3abinding capacity 3acatalytic activity 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aendocytosis 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amodels 3apeptides 3apolysaccharides 3aquantitative analysis 3astoichiometry 3astructure-activity relationships 3azwitterions1 aKasper, Dennis L.0 tGlycobiology.g2008 Sept., v. 18, no. 9 p.707-718x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwn0503Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02476naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003300110040001800143100002200161245011100183300001400294500001500308520099400323650000901317650002601326650002401352650002101376650001901397650001401416650001901430650002201449650001501471650001201486650001201498650002601510650001501536650002601551651001301577651001301590653002101603653002401624700001901648700001401667700001401681700001501695773008501710852000901795856008301804930003301887945001301920946001301933655001201946IND2164296120221117225958.0980926e199801  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216429612DNAL7 a95423502pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.1.822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunstermann, L.E.10aGenetic structure of local populations of Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) in central Colombia  ap. 82-89.  a2019-12-04  aLutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva), the sand fly vector of American visceral l eishmaniasis in the New World tropics, has a broad but discontinuous geographica l distribution from southern Mexico to Argentina. A baseline for population gene tic structure and genetic variability for this species was obtained by analyzing 5 local, peridomestic populations at the approximate center of its distribution , the Magdalena River Valley of central Colombia. Three populations of L. longip alpis from El Callejon, a small rural community, were compared with 2 population s from neighboring areas 12 and 25 km distant for genetic variation at 15 isoenz yme loci. The mean heterozygosity ranged from 11 to 16%, with 1.2 to 2.3 alleles detected per locus. Nei's genetic distances among the populations were very low , ranging from 0.001 to 0.007. Gene flow estimates based on F(ST) indicated high levels of gene flow among local L. longipalpis populations, with minimal popula tion substructuring. 3aloci 3aLutzomyia longipalpis 3aenzyme polymorphism 3agenetic distance 3aheterozygosity 3agene flow 3agene frequency 3agenetic variation 3apopulation 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aPopulation 2aPsychodidaexgenetics 3aColombia 0aColombia 0apolymorphic loci 0apopulation genetics1 aMorrison, A.C.1 aFerro, C.1 aPardo, R.1 aTorres, M.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.82-89x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.1.823Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02829naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002000158245016000178300001500338500002400353520125000377650001001627650001301637650001301650650001401663650001601677650001001693650001401703650001501717650002501732650002001757650001101777650001401788650001101802650003401813650002501847650001401872650003101886650002201917650003001939650002701969700001901996700002402015773013302039852000902172856007902181856006302260655001202323IND4372578120221117230058.0050720s2005    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437257812DNAL7 a159856352pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.007232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, Joanna L10aCytotrophoblast differentiation in the first trimester of pregnancy: evidence for separate progenitors of extravillous trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast  ap. 95-103.  aIncludes references  aIt is commonly accepted that a single pool of villous cytotrophoblasts are precursors of both syncytiotrophoblast and extravillous trophoblasts during the first trimester. Here we present evidence that these two trophoblast subpopulations arise from separate progenitors that have different survival characteristics when studied in villous explant cultures. Dual staining with chloromethylfluorescin diacetate and ethidium bromide revealed degeneration of the syncytiotrophoblast by non-apoptotic mechanisms within 4 h of culture. The syncytiotrophoblast had regenerated within 48 h but at this point the vast majority of the cytotrophoblast and cells of the mesenchymal core were dead. Despite this extensive cytotrophoblast death, explants are able to produce extravillous trophoblast outgrowth for up to 3 weeks in culture. We believe that the villous cytotrophoblasts in the tips of anchoring villi are resistant to the factors that cause the death of the majority of villous cytotrophoblasts in culture. We speculate that as early as 8 weeks of gestation there are two separate villous cytotrophoblast populations, one committed to differentiate into syncytiotrophoblast and the second committed to the extravillous differentiation pathway. 3adeath 3aethidium 3aexplants 3apregnancy 3atrophoblast 3avilli 2aApoptosis 2aCell Death 2aCell Differentiation 2aColoring Agents 2aFemale 2aFormazans 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Trimester, First 2aTetrazolium Salts 2aTissue Culture Techniques 2aTrophoblastsxcytology1 aStone, Peter R1 aChamley, Lawrence W0 tReproduction.g2005 July, v. 130, no. 1 p.95-103dJournals of Reproduction and Fertility, LtdwJournal:jnl68408x1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.007233Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.007233electronic resource 7aarticle02902naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072002000110100002300130245010100153300001600254520180300270650000802073650001302081650001402094650001402108650002502122650002002147650002502167650001502192650002002207650002002227650001402247650001802261653001402279700002502293700001802318700002602336773012002362852000902482946001302491655001202504IND4410026220221117230048.0080909s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441002622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

   1 aValentine, Rudy J.10aInfluence of carbohydrate-protein beverage on cycling endurance and indices of muscle disruption  ap. 363-378.  aCarbohydrate-protein (CHO+Pro) beverages reportedly improve endurance and indices of muscle disruption, but it is unclear whether these effects are related to total energy intake or specific effects of protein. Purpose: The authors examined effects of CHO+Pro on time to exhaustion and markers of muscle disruption compared with placebo (PLA) and carbohydrate beverages matched for carbo-hydrate (CHO) and total calories (CHO+CHO). Methods: Eleven male cyclists completed 4 rides to exhaustion at 75% VO2peak. Participants consumed 250 ml of PLA, CHO (7.75%), CHO+CHO (9.69%), or CHO+Pro (7.75%/1.94%) every 15 min until fatigue, in a double-blind design. Results: Time to exhaustion was significantly longer (p < .05) in CHO+Pro (126.2 ± 25.4 min) and CHO+CHO (121.3 ± 36.8) than PLA (107.1 ± 30.3). CHO (117.5 ± 24.2) and PLA were not significantly different. Similarly, CHO+Pro was not significantly different from CHO and CHO+CHO. Postexercise plasma creatine kinase was lower after CHO+Pro (197.2 ± 149.2 IU/L) than PLA (407.4 ± 391.3), CHO (373.2 ± 416.6), and CHO+CHO (412.3 ± 410.2). Postexercise serum myoglobin was lower in CHO+Pro (47.0 ± 27.4 ng/mL) than all other treatments (168.8 ± 217.3, 82.6 ± 71.3, and 72.0 ± 75.8). Postexercise leg extensions at 70% 1RM were significantly greater 24 hr after CHO+Pro (11.3 ± 4.1) than PLA (8.8 ± 3.7), CHO (9.7 ± 4.3), and CHO+CHO (9.5 ± 3.6). Conclusion: These findings suggest that at least some of the reported improvements in endurance with CHO+Pro beverages might be related to caloric differences between treatments. Postexercise improvements in markers of muscle disruption with CHO+Pro ingestion appear to be independent of carbohydrate and caloric content and were elicited with beverages consumed only during exercise. 3amen 3aathletes 3abicycling 3abeverages 3adietary carbohydrate 3adietary protein 3aathletic performance 3abiomarkers 3ablood chemistry 3acreatine kinase 3amyoglobin 3aenergy intake 0aendurance1 aSaunders, Michael J.1 aTodd, M.

Male (n = 24) and female (n = 18) participants with minimal resistance-exercise-training experience (=1 year) who were participating in at least 30 min of structured physical activity (i.e., walking, jogging, cycling) 3-5 x/wk volunteered for the study. Participants were randomly assigned in blocks (gender) to supplement with creatine (CR: 0.25 g/kg lean-tissue mass for 7 days; 0.06 g/kg lean-tissue mass for 49 days; n = 22, 12 males, 10 female) or isocaloric placebo (PL: n = 20, 12 male, 8 female) and engage in a whole-body RET program for 8 wk. Eighteen participants were classified as vegetarian (lacto-ovo or vegan; CR: 5 male, 5 female; PL: 3 male, 5 female). Muscle biopsies (vastus lateralis) were taken before and after the intervention and analyzed for IGF-I using standard immunohistochemical procedures. Stained muscle cross-sections were examined microscopically and IGF-I content quantified using image-analysis software. Results showed that RET increased intramuscular IGF-I content by 67%, with greater accumulation from CR (+78%) than PL (+54%; p = .06). There were no differences in IGF-I between vegetarians and nonvegetarians. These findings indicate that creatine supplementation during resistance-exercise training increases intramuscular IGF-I concentration in healthy men and women, independent of habitual dietary routine. 3atemporal variation 3astrength training 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3avegetarian diet 3aergogenic aids 3amen 3acreatine 3awomen 3amuscles 3aimmunohistochemistry 3agender differences 3ayoung adults 0aphysical activity 0adietary supplements1 aCandow, Darren G.1 aChilibeck, Philip D.1 aMacNeil, Lauren G.1 aRoy, Brian D.1 aTarnopolsky, Mark A.1 aZiegenfuss, Tim0 tInternational journal of sport nutrition & exercise metabolism.g2008 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.389-398x1526-484X7nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02687naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002800161245010000189300001600289500001500305520151200320650002401832650001301856650001401869650002001883650001801903650002301921650002101944650001701965650001501982650001701997653001702014653002602031653002802057700001602085773007202101852000902173930003302182945002502215946001302240655001202253IND4410025220221117230045.0080909e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441002522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMcNaughton, Alastair J.10aAdjacency Branches Used To Optimize Forest Harvesting Subject to Area Restrictions on Clearfell  ap. 442-454.  a2019-12-04  aConsider a forest containing units of various sizes for which a maximum clearfell area has been specified along with an associated green-up time period. For such an application it is customary to use adjacency constraints to produce a harvesting plan. These constraints control the availability for harvest of specific units relative to the harvesting of certain adjacent units. However, such constraints are difficult to formulate and often precipitate major difficulties in the implementation of the solution algorithm. A new concept, a nuclear set, is introduced. This concept allows the unit-specific aspects of the problem to be analyzed in an insightful manner. Any adjacency violation can be detected in relation to these nuclear sets. Suitable adjacency branches can be implemented to remove these violations. The form of these branches derives from the same nuclear sets. A remarkably small number of these branches are required to obtain a feasible solution. These ideas are incorporated into a column generation and constraint generation model. This new forest harvesting model solves the clearfell area restriction problem in an exact sense. Results are included for numerical trials involving simulated data representing moderately sized applications with a planning horizon of up to one rotation. The output from these trials suggests that this algorithm is suitable for large commercial applications. Several applications of 1,600 units are solved over 25 time periods with multiple green-up. 3amathematical models 3aplanning 3aequations 3aproblem solving 3aforest stands 3alinear programming 3astand management 3aforest roads 3aalgorithms 3aclearcutting 0aoptimization 0aadjacency constraints 0aarea restriction models1 aRyan, David0 tForest science.g2008 Aug., v. 54, no. 4 p.442-454x0015-749X7nnas  aDNAL  a20080915b20081011c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/09/15  aOther US 7aarticle03128naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245016000146300001600306500001500322520122700337650001201564650001201576650002201588650002101610650001101631650001801642650002501660650002001685650001201705650001601717650002201733650002401755650001201779650001801791650002301809650001501832650002301847650002101870650006701891650001101958650004401969650002802013650002802041650003602069650006002105653001202165653001902177653002802196653002502224700001502249700002102264700002402285700001602309773009902325852000902424930003302433945001302466946001102479655001202490IND2051343120221117230119.0960521e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205134312DNAL7 a88826542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoriega, F.G.10aEarly trypsin, a female-specific midgut protease in Aedes aegypti: isolation, amino-terminal sequence determination, and cloning and sequencing of the gene  ap. 119-126.  a2019-12-05  aEarly trypsin is a female-specific protease present in the Aedes aegypti midgut during the first hours after ingestion of a blood meal. It plays an essential role in the transcriptional activation of the late trypsin form, the major midgut endoprotease involved in the blood meal digestion. Early trypsin is the most abundant midgut polypeptide isolated by benzamidine-sepharose affinity chromatography 3 h after feeding. The amino-terminal sequence of the early trypsin protein matches that of the 3a1 cDNA for a putative trypsinogen described by Kalhok et al. (Insect. Molec. Biol., 2, 71-79, 1993). The early trypsin cDNA was over expressed in Escherichia coli. Polyclonal antibodies generated against this recombinant protein were used to show that the enzyme was present in the midgut during the first 4 h after feeding. A 2.5 kb genomic clone of the early trypsin was isolated, mapped and subcloned. A 1.56 kb subclone, corresponding to 1303 bp of the upstream regulatory region and 265 bp of the coding region, was sequenced. The gene contains a 64 nucleotide intron which interrupts the codon for Val at position 18 of the protein. This Val is located toward the end of the putative signal sequence of the protein. 3atrypsin 3afemales 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3amidgut 3aAedes aegypti 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aintrons 3atrypsinogen 2aAedesxenzymology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Probes 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDigestive System 2aEndopeptidasesxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Insectxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTrypsinxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 0acloning 0agenbank/x64362 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aWang, X.Y.1 aPennington, J.E.1 aBarillas-Mury, C.V.1 aWells, M.A.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1996 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.119-126x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02820naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011500144300001600259520140300275650001801678650001501696650001701711650002201728650002301750650001001773650002001783650001601803650002201819650002101841650001201862650002701874650002501901650003801926650003201964650002401996650000902020650002402029653003202053653001502085700001902100700001602119700001402135773009902149852000902248930003302257945001302290946001102303655001202314IND2051344920221117230311.0960521e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205134492DNAL7 a88826592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, W.A.10aCyclic AMP is a requisite messenger in the action of big PTTH in the prothoracic glands of pupal Manduca sexta  ap. 161-170.  aProthoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), a peptide produced by the insect brain, stimulates the prothoracic glands to secrete ecdysteroids. The big form of this peptide (25.5 kDa) has been postulated to act through cyclic AMP in larval Manduca sexta, but the role of the cyclic nucleotide in the action of PTTH in pupal glands has been less clear. Results of the present study indicate that PTTH-stimulated ecdysteroid secretion and protein phosphorylation by glands removed from pupal Manduca sexta are blocked by two inhibitors of cAMP-dependent protein kinase: Rp-cAMPS, an antagonist of cAMP binding to the regulatory subunit of the kinase, and H-89, an inhibitor of the catalytic subunit of the kinase. Further, PTTH stimulates significant accumulation of cAMP in pupal glands, although less than that previously seen in PTTH-stimulated larval glands. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is found in cytoplasmic and membrane-associated glandular subfractions, as measured by incorporation of [32P]8-N3cAMP into the regulatory subunit of the kinase. PTTH enhances cytoplasmic cAMP content and appears to increase the amount of cAMP bound to a cytoplasmic type II regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The results indicate that cAMP plays a requisite role in PTTH action in pupal glands, thus arguing in favor of a uniform mechanism of action for the peptide during Manduca development. 3aManduca sexta 3acyclic AMP 3aecdysteroids 3ahormone secretion 3aprothoracic glands 3apupae 3aphosphorylation 3aantagonists 3aenzyme inhibitors 3abinding proteins 2aAnimals 2aCyclic AMPxmetabolism 2aEcdysonexmetabolism 2aGanglia, Invertebratexmetabolism 2aInsect Hormonesxmetabolism 2aManducaxmetabolism 2aPupa 2aSignal Transduction 0aprothoracicotropic hormones 0aregulation1 aVarghese, A.H.1 aHealy, M.S.1 aLou, K.J.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1996 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.161-170x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02947naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245007400141300001600215520123000231650002001461650001101481650002001492650002001512650002101532650002201553650003001575650001801605650001301623650002001636650002501656650002501681650002401706650001201730650001801742650003701760650003001797650002801827650001301855650002801868650002001896650003001916650002901946650003401975653001202009653001502021653001202036653002802048653001902076653001902095700001202114700001402126700001602140773009902156852000902255930003302264945001302297946001102310655001202321IND2051345720221117230247.0960521e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205134572DNAL7 a88826602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, D.10aPCR differential display of immune gene expression in Trichoplusia ni  ap. 177-184.  aThe immune state of insects is defined by a set of proteins that is absent in the naive state. To explore the immune system of Trichoplusia ni in more detail we have employed a PCR differential display technique to compare the mRNA population of untreated last instar larvae to that of immunized animals. In the primary display, more than one hundred bands seemed induced upon bacterial challenge. When they were used as probes in Northern blots, 35% of these probes detected inducible mRNA species. Such probes were used to screen a cDNA library from immunized larvae. We isolated clones for T. ni homologs of cecropin A, lysozyme and attacin. One differentially expressed band hybridized to clones for BJHSP1, a hemacyanin-related protein which is hormonally up-regulated in last instar larvae; this induction is probably not related to the bacterial infection. Still other probes recognized inducible mRNAs of 1.6 and 1.0 kb. The corresponding cDNA clones did not show strong sequence homology to any known proteins. We have demonstrated the potential of this PCR technique to display both known and unknown genes specific for the immune state of whole insects against a background of genes involved in larval development. 3aTrichoplusia ni 3alarvae 3aimmune response 3agene expression 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3amessenger RNA 3alysozyme 3aanimal proteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aEnterobacter cloacaexmetabolism 2aGene Expressionxgenetics 2aGenes, Insectxgenetics 2aImmunity 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMothsxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acloning 0acecropin a 0aattacin 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u38782 0agenbank/u386451 aLiu, G.1 aGunne, H.1 aSteiner, H.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1996 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.177-184x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02876naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245014400145300001600289500001500305520105300320650002601373650000901399650002901408650001201437650001601449650001201465650002401477650002301501650001101524650002001535650002801555650001101583650001501594650003801609650004001647650002101687650004101708650001201749650001601761650007701777650001601854650002601870650001101896650001001907650002601917650001601943653002101959653002601980653002802006700002102034700001602055700001402071773009902085852000902184930003302193945001302226946001102239655001202250IND2051343820221117230110.0960521e199602  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205134382DNAL7 a88826562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPecsenye, K.10aDifferences in environmental temperature, ethanol and sucrose associated with enzyme activity and weight changes in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 135-145.  a2019-12-05  aActivity changes of three enzymes (ADH, ODH and AOX) of Drosophila melanogaster were followed under different environmental conditions. The influences of ethanol, starvation (no carbohydrates in the medium) and ethanol stress during starvation were studied at both 18 and 26 degrees C. Two strains that were monomorphic for different alleles at the Odh and Aldox loci but otherwise identical were used. The investigated environmental conditions affected ADH induction by exogenous ethanol differently in the two strains. The different allozymes of ODH and AOX also responded differently to the treatments. We observed that the sucrose content of the medium on which ethanol exposure took place and the temperature strongly affected the responses within any single strain. Correlations were estimated among the three enzymes in the larval and adult stages of each strain separately. At both temperatures, differences between strains were observed in the patterns of associations of the response variables, in the larval, but not in the adult stages. 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3adiet 3aaldehyde oxidoreductases 3aethanol 3abody weight 3asucrose 3aambient temperature 3astrain differences 3alarvae 3aenzyme activity 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aadults 3astarvation 2aAlcohol Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aAldehyde Oxidase 2aAldehyde Oxidoreductasesxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aDrosophila melanogasterxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aEnvironment 2aEthanolxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aLarva 2aSucrosexpharmacology 2aTemperature 0aaldehyde oxidase 0aoctanol dehydrogenase 0aalcohol oxidoreductases1 aLefkovitch, L.P.1 aGiles, B.E.1 aSaura, A.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1996 Feb., v. 26, no. 2 p.135-145x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle01859naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245006600121300001800187520102000205650001801225650001401243650001101257650001701268650001901285653001401304700001301318700001601331700001901347773010101366852000901467930003301476945001301509946001101522655001201533IND2049087820221117230046.0951204e199510  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204908782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, H.14aThe structure of dolichols isolated from Manduca sexta larvae  ap. 1019-1026.  aWe isolated and analyzed dolichols from fifth stadium larvae of Manduca sexta, in an effort to determine if M. sexta produces ethyl-branched dolichols. Like other lepidopterans, this animal is known to produce the ethyl-branched, homoisoprenoid juvenile hormones. However, we were unable to detect any ethyl-branched dolichol homologues. Manduca sexta larvae at this stage do contain the common eukaryotic dolichols, principally dolichols 17, 18, 19 and 20 in an approximate 3:7:5:2 ratio. Analysis of the yeast-containing artificial diet showed the presence of dolichols 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 in an approximate 2:6:8:6:3 ratio. We attempted to determine whether M. sexta synthesized dolichols de novo; preliminary experiments using [5-3H]mevalonate incubated with two M. sexta tissues in vitro were unsuccessful. In light of earlier studies on dolichol identity in two fly species, we conclude that insects can synthesize dolichols, even though they are known to be incapable to synthesizing sterols from acetate. 3aManduca sexta 3adolichols 3alarvae 3abiosynthesis 3amevalonic acid 0astructure1 aWang, H.1 aHackett, M.1 aSchooley, D.A.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 Oct., v. 25, no. 9 p.1019-1026x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03446naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245014000148300001800288500001500306520175600321650002002077650002302097650001802120650002002138650001602158650001402174650002602188650003002214650002002244650002402264650001202288650001802300650001602318650001802334650003502352650002802387650003102415650004202446650006702488650004602555650003602601653001602637653001302653653002402666700001702690700001702707773010202724852000902826930003302835945001302868946001102881655001202892IND2050019520221117230031.0960226e199512  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205001952DNAL7 a85809092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Houyuan.10aExpression and characterization of recombinant Manduca sexta serpin-1B and site-directed mutants that change its inhibitory selectivity  ap. 1093-1100.  a2019-12-05  aHemolymph of Manduca sexta contains a number of serine proteinase inhibitors from the serpin superfamily. During formation of a stable complex between a serpin and a serine proteinase, the enzyme cleaves a specific peptide bond in an exposed loop (the reactive-site region) at the surface of the serpin. The amino acid residue on the amino-terminal side of this scissile bond, the P1 residue, is important in defining the selectivity of a serpin for inhibiting different types of serine proteinases. M. sexta serpin-1B, with alanine at the position predicted from sequence alignments to be the P1 residue, was previously named alaserpin. This alanyl residue was changed by site-directed mutagenesis to lysine (A343K) and phenylalanine (A343F). The serpin-1B cDNA and its mutants were inserted into an expression vector, H6pQE-60, and the serpin proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Affinity-purified recombinant serpins selectively inhibited mammalian serine proteinases: serpin-1B inhibited elastase; serpin-1B(A343K) inhibited trypsin, plasmin, and thrombin; serpin-1B(A343F) inhibited chymotrypsin as well as trypsin. All three serpins inhibited human cathepsin G. This insect serpin and its site-directed mutants associated with mammalian serine proteinases at rates similar to those reported for mammalian serpins. Serpin-1B and its mutants formed SDS-stable complexes with the enzymes they inhibited. The scissile bond was determined to be between residues 343 and 344 in wild-type serpin-1B and in serpin-1B with mutations at residue 343. These results demonstrate that the P1 alanine residue defines the primary selectivity of serpin-1B for elastase-like enzymes, and that this selectivity can be altered by mutations at this position. 3arecombinant DNA 3aserine proteinases 3aManduca sexta 3agene expression 3aamino acids 3ahemolymph 3aproteinase inhibitors 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Primers 2aGenes, Insect 2aManducaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgenetics 2aSerine Proteinase Inhibitorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSerpinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0aselectivity 0amutation 0arecombinant serpins1 aMulnix, A.B.1 aKanost, M.R.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 Dec., v. 25, no. 10 p.1093-1100x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a20060204b00000000c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02182naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011300146300001800259500001500277520060300292650002300895650002800918650002500946650001500971650002900986650002001015650002801035650001201063650005501075650002201130650001101152650004001163650002901203650001301232650002201245650002101267650003001288650002101318653001701339653001601356653001401372653003201386700002001418700001801438700001601456773010201472852000901574930003301583945001301616946001101629655001201640IND2050019820221117230034.0960226e199512  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205001982DNAL7 a85809112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunaiti, A.A.10aDevelopmental studies on Drosophila melanogaster glutathione S-transferase and its induction by oxadiazolone  ap. 1115-1119.  a2019-12-05  aGlutathione S-transferase activity toward 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was detected in various developmental stages of Drosophila melanogaster.

Incorporation of the widely used herbicide oxadiazolone at concentrations of 375 and 563 part/million into the culture media caused 4 and 2.5-fold increase in the enzyme activity in pupa and adult stages respectively. 3aaromatic compounds 3aglutathione transferase 3adevelopmental stages 3aherbicides 3aorganochlorine compounds 3aenzyme activity 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAnimals 2aDrosophila melanogasterxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aEnzyme Activation 2aFemale 2aGlutathione Transferasexmetabolism 2aHerbicidesxpharmacology 2aKinetics 2aLarvaxenzymology 2aOvumxenzymology 2aOxadiazolesxpharmacology 2aPupaxenzymology 0apurification 0acomparisons 0ainduction 0a1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene1 aElbetieha, A.M.1 aObeidat, M.A.1 aOwais, W.M.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 Dec., v. 25, no. 10 p.1115-1119x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle03131naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011900145300001200264520146400276650002201740650002201762650002201784650002201806650002501828650002501853650002001878650001701898650002401915650001201939650001801951650001401969650002301983650001602006650003702022650001102059650003202070650002002102650002802122650005102150650005902201650003402260653001602294653001202310653001202322653002302334653002802357653001902385773009502404852000902499930003302508945001302541946001102554655001202565IND2050915320221117230147.0960422e199601  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205091532DNAL7 a86730742pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReagan, J.D.10aMolecular cloning and function expression of a diuretic hormone receptor from the house cricket, Acheta domesticus  ap. 1-6.  aInsect diuretic hormones regulate fluid and ion secretion and the receptors with which they interact are attractive targets for new insect control agents. Recently, a diuretic hormone receptor from the moth Manduca sexta was isolated by expression cloning and found to be a member of the calcitonin/secretin/corticotropin releasing factor family of G-protein coupled receptors [Reagan J.D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9-12]. Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based upon conserved regions in this receptor family and used to isolate a diuretic hormone receptor from the house cricket, Acheta domesticus. The complementary DNA isolated encodes a protein consisting of 441 amino acids with seven putative membrane spanning regions. Interestingly, unlike the M. sexta diuretic hormone receptor, the cricket diuretic hormone receptor contains a putative signal sequence. The receptor shares 53% and 38% sequence identity with the M. sexta diuretic hormone and human corticotropin releasing factor receptors respectively. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the receptor binds A. domesticus diuretic hormone with high affinity and stimulates adenylate cyclase with high potency. Four other insect diuretic hormones are considerably less effective at stimulating adenylate cyclase in COS-7 cells transfected with the receptor. This is in contrast to the M. sexta diuretic hormone receptor which is stimulated by all five insect diuretic hormones with high potency. 3aAcheta domesticus 3aadenylate cyclase 3ahormone receptors 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aAdenoviridae 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Line 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primers 2aGryllidaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aInsect Hormonesxmetabolism 2aInsect Proteins 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Invertebrate Peptidexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0astimulation 0abinding 0acloning 0aarthropod hormones 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/u159590 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1996 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.1-6x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19960503b19960510c00000000  aINDdNZM  aNon-US 7aarticle02742naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002200144245010100166300001600267500001500283520102300298650001401321650002201335650003901357650002701396650004301423650001101466650002001477650001501497650001501512650001201527650001101539650002201550650002101572650002201593650003001615650001101645650001101656650001201667650002201679650001601701650002101717650002001738650002201758650001201780650000901792650001801801650000701819653002901826653001701855653001401872700001901886700002101905773009801926852000902024930003302033945002502066946001302091655001202104IND4410005120221117230149.0080906e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441000512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The presence of glucose drastically decreases the β-xylosidase production level. The β-xylosidase of T. thermophilus was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-cellulose chromatography, and gel filtration (high-performance liquid chromatography). The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be 97 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration. The enzyme activity was optimum at 50 °C and pH 7. The apparent Michaelis constant K(m) of the β-xylosidase was 2.37 mM for p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside, with a V(max) of 0.049 μmol min⁻¹ per milligram protein. Enzyme activity was inhibited by Cu²⁺, Hg²⁺, and Zn²⁺ and activated by Ca²⁺, Mn²⁺, and Co⁺ at a concentration of 5 mM. At high xylose concentration, this enzyme catalyses the condensation reaction leading to xylobiose production. 3amanganese 3athermal stability 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3achemical precipitation 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3acarbon 3aenzyme kinetics 3awheat bran 3aestimation 3aglucose 3axylose 3aenzyme substrates 3amolecular weight 3aenzyme inhibition 3axylan 1,4-beta-xylosidase 3acobalt 3acopper 3acalcium 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aTalaromyces 3aammonium sulfate 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme activation 3amercury 3azinc 3abiotechnology 3apH 0aTalaromyces thermophilus 0apurification 0axylobiose1 aGargouri,  Ali1 aBelghith, Hafedh0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2008 Sept., v. 150, no. 3 p.267-279x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL  a20080929b20081011c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle03323naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100002300181245012400204300001600328500001500344520117100359650001601530650001701546650001801563650003501581650001701616650001701633650001501650650001101665650003801676650001501714650002101729650001901750650001901769650001201788650003901800650005801839650003001897650008801927650004402015650003002059650002502089650003702114650003902151650002402190650001602214653003202230653001902262653002902281700002202310700002102332700002202353700002302375773009802398852000902496856008502505930003302590945002502623946001302648655001202661IND4410004920141219000000.0080906e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441000492DNAL7 a186829012pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-007-8127-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A Membrane Biophysical Approach  ap. 243-257.  a2019-12-04  aThe Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus stearothermophilus, was used as a model organism to identify the non-selective toxic effects of the currently used insecticide methoprene (isopropyl(2E,4E)-11-methoxy-3,7,11-trimethyl-2,4-dodecadienoate). A significant decrease of the yield of bacterial cultures and a premature appearance of ultrastructural abnormalities in cells cultured in the presence of the insecticide were taken as indicators of cytotoxicity. A putative correlation of this cytotoxicity with methoprene-induced perturbations on membrane lipid organization was investigated, using differential scanning calorimetry and the fluorescence polarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) and its propionic acid derivative (DPH-PA). The membrane physical effects depended on the lipid bilayer composition and packing. The most striking effect was a progressive broadening and shifting to lower temperatures, with increasing methoprene concentrations, of the main transition phase of the dimyristoyl- or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers and of the lateral phase separation of liposomes reconstituted with the lipid extracts of B. stearothermophilus. 3atemperature 3ainsecticides 3aecotoxicology 3aGeobacillus stearothermophilus 3acytotoxicity 3alipid bodies 3abiophysics 3alipids 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3amethoprene 3atoxicity testing 3alipid bilayers 3aultrastructure 2aAnimals 2aCalorimetry, Differential Scanning 2aDiphenylhexatrienexanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aFluorescence Polarization 2aGeobacillus stearothermophilusxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aJuvenile Hormonesxchemistryxtoxicity. 2aLipid Bilayersxchemistry 2aLiposomesxchemistry 2aMethoprenexchemistryxtoxicity. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aMolecular Structure 2aTemperature 0aBacillus stearothermophilus 0acell membranes 0ajuvenile hormone analogs1 aVideira, Romeu A.1 aMatos, Manuel J.1 aDinis, Augusto M.1 aJurado, Amália S.0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2008 Sept., v. 150, no. 3 p.243-257x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-007-8127-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20080929b20081011c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/09/29  aOther US 7aarticle01916naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009800127300001600225520102000241650002301261650002101284650002201305650001101327650001401338653002301352700001601375700001801391700001601409773009901425852000901524930003301533945001301566946001101579655001201590IND2047730620221117230105.0950913e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204773062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlinka, A.V.14aThe use of a juvenille hormone binding protein for the quantitative assay of juvenile hormone  ap. 775-781.  aThe suitability of the haemolymph juvenile hormone binding protein (JHBP) of Locusta migratoria for use in a competition assay for juvenile hormone (JH)III has been investigated, and a simple quantitative assay procedure using this protein has been developed. JHBP partially purified from haemolymph of precocene treated adult locusts gives rapid and stable binding of [3H]10R-JH III, and can be separated from the unbound hormone with hydroxylapatite (HAP). The sensitivity of the method is such that 0.15 pmol (40 pg) 10R-JH III gives 50% displacement of [3H]10R-JH III from the binding protein. Competition by JH II is about 5 times less and JH I about 10 times less than that by JH III, while JH III diol and acid compete at least 1000 times less strongly. A procedure for extraction and assay of JH from 50 microliter haemolymph samples is described, the interference by non-specific haemolymph components is shown to be relatively small, and some data on JH III titres in maturing adult locusts are presented. 3aLocusta migratoria 3abinding proteins 3ajuvenile hormones 3aassays 3ahemolymph 0acompetition assays1 aBraun, R.P.1 aEdwards, J.P.1 aWyatt, G.R.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.775-781x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02923naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245011400147300001600261500001500277520120400292650001801496650002201514650001801536650001701554650001101571650002501582650002001607650002501627650002001652650002401672650001201696650001801708650002301726650006601749650002301815650003301838650003201871650003101903650001301934650003501947650002801982650003402010650002602044653001702070653002802087653002802115700002102143700001602164773009902180852000902279930003302288945001302321946001102334655001202345IND2047730520221117230239.0950913e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204773052DNAL7 a76334642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, A.M.10aPurification, characterization and cDNA sequence of an alkaline chymotrypsin from the midgut of Manduca sexta  ap. 765-774.  a2019-12-05  aThe chymotrypsin in the midgut of Manduca sexta has been purified, characterized and the cDNA encoding the protein has been cloned. The enzyme exists as a monomer of approx. 24 kDa and shows maximal activity between pH 10.5 and 11.0. Kinetic studies reveal that the Michaelis constant (Km) for the synthetic substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide varies only slightly between pH 7.5 and 11.5 and the Dixon plot shows a kinetically significant pKa at 9.2. The specificity of the purified enzyme was determined to be the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine, leucine, threonine and glycine. The protease is inhibited by TPCK, PMSF, chymostatin and DFP. A 1 kilobase chymotrypsin cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced. The cDNA sequence encodes a preproenzyme with a putative 17 amino acid signal sequence, a 41 amino acid activation peptide and a mature enzyme of 235 amino acids. The isolated clone encodes the highly conserved active site residues (His, Asp, Ser) and specificity pocket residues present in bovine chymotrypsinogen B. Northern analysis localizes the mRNA for the chymotrypsin to the anterior and middle third of the midgut. 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aManduca sexta 3achymotrypsin 3amidgut 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3anucleotide sequences 3aenzyme activity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aChymotrypsinxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxanalysis 2aDigestive Systemxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aManducaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubstrate Specificity 0apurification 0amolecular sequence data 0achymotrypsin inhibitors1 aFernando, G.J.P.1 aWells, M.A.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.765-774x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03184naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002100128245009700149300001600246500001500262520157800277650001901855650001701874650001801891650002101909650001401930650001201944650001901956650002201975650002601997650001202023650002702035650002502062650001702087650001102104650002502115650001302140650001202153650004502165650002102210650001202231650000902243650007902252650003002331653001702361653001802378653001202396700001502408700001802423773009902441852000902540930003302549945001302582946001102595655001202606IND2047731120221117230153.0950913e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204773112DNAL7 a76334682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSappington, T.W.10aMosquito vitellogenin receptor: purification, developmental and biochemical characterization  ap. 807-817.  a2019-12-05  aVitellogenin receptors (VgRs) play a critical role in egg development of oviparous animals by mediating endocytosis of the major yolk protein precursor, vitellogenin. A modification of the method for extracting the mosquito (Aedes aegypti) VgR from ovary membranes resulted in an 11-fold higher yield and 56-fold increase in relative purity of the VgR, in turn permitting purification, antibody production, and microsequencing. A Kd of 15 nM was estimated from binding assays for the enriched VgR, indicating a very high affinity for its ligand. Immunoprecipitation of [14C]VgR using anti-VgR polyclonal antibodies followed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and fluorography demonstrated that the 205 kDa VgR does not consist of subunits held together with disulfide bonds. However, an immunoblot of the native VgR suggests that it exists as a approximately 390 kDa noncovalent homodimer in its native state. Immunoblot assays confirmed that the VgR is present only in ovarian tissue. A quantitative immunoassay of VgR extracts showed that VgR was present in previtellogenic ovaries on the day of emergence, increasing from 2 ng to more than 10 ng per ovary by day 5. After initiation of vitellogenesis and onset of Vg uptake, VgR quantity increased rapidly between 8 and 24 h after a blood meal, then began to decline between 24 and 36 h. Immunocytochemistry confirmed the presence of substantial amounts of the VgR in 4-day-old previtellogenic oocytes. In both previtellogenic and vitellogenic ovaries, the VgR was present only in the oocyte, primarily in the cortex. 3aimmunoblotting 3aimmunoassays 3aAedes aegypti 3abinding proteins 3areceptors 3aoocytes 3avitellogenesis 2aAedesxmetabolism 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aAntibodiesximmunology 2aAntibody Specificity 2aEgg Proteins 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aKinetics 2aLigands 2aOvaryxcytologyximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPrecipitin Tests 2aRabbits 2aRats 2aReceptors, Cell Surfaceximmunologyxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aVitellogeninsxmetabolism 0apurification 0avitellogenins 0aovaries1 aHays, A.R.1 aRaikhel, A.S.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.807-817x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02019naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013000126300001600256500001500272520098600287650001001273650003501283650001301318650001301331650001601344650001101360650001801371650001301389653000801402653001501410700001701425700001301442700001301455773009901468852000901567930003301576945001301609946001101622655001201633IND2047731220221117230200.0950913e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204773122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagaoka, S.10aOccurrence and distribution of aldolase isozymes during embryonic and post-embryonic development of the silkworm, Bombyx mori  ap. 819-825.  a2019-12-05  aFructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (EC4.1.2.13) occurred as two distinct molecular varieties in Bombyx mori in zymogram analysis: a slowly migrating (S) band observed in the ovary and in yolk of the eggs during embryonic development until the stage of head pigmentation and a fast migrating (F) band appearing after this stage in the embryo. Organs during post-embryonic development exhibited three additional bands between the S and F bands on zymograms. The composition of the five bands was organ-specific, with S predominating in the fat bodies and F in the muscles. The partially purified S and F preparation differed in the activity ratio towards the two substrates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate/fructose 1-phosphate, the ratios being 3 for S and 10 for F. In vitro mixing of the S and F preparations produced intermediary migrating materials, indicating that the occurrence of five components in the organs may be due to the formation of heterotetramers of the S and F subunits. 3apupae 3afructose-bisphosphate aldolase 3afat body 3aegg yolk 3aBombyx mori 3alarvae 3aembryogenesis 3aisozymes 0aova 0abody parts1 aSugimoto, Y.1 aYara, M.1 aKoga, K.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.819-825x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03093naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245011400145300001600259500001500275520124900290650001801539650001001557650002201567650001801589650002201607650002501629650002001654650001601674650001101690650001201701650001001713650002401723650001201747650001801759650002301777650002301800650003801823650001301861650001801874650002201892650003501914650002801949650002101977650003101998650004602029650002102075653001702096653001902113653002802132653002502160700001502185700001502200700001602215700001502231700002002246773009902266852000902365930003302374945001302407946001102420655001202431IND2047731620221117230234.0950913e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204773162DNAL7 a76334692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara, H.10aCloning of an ecdysone receptor homolog from Manduca sexta and the developmental profile of its mRNA in wings  ap. 845-856.  a2019-12-05  aUsing the Drosophila melanogaster ecdysone receptor (DmEcR) B1 cDNA clone, we isolated three genomic clones for EcR from the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta. Subsequent isolation and sequencing of several cDNAs yielded a homolog of the B1 isoform with 50, 95 and 70% amino acid identities with DmEcR in the N-terminal A/B, the DNA binding and the ligand binding domains respectively. Unlike Drosophila, an intron occurs between the exons encoding the two zinc fingers of Manduca EcR (MsEcR). A 6.0 kb mRNA encoding MsEcR was found in both larval wing discs and prothoracic glands and in pupal wings. During the final larval instar, the mRNA was maximal in the wing discs at one day after wandering (W1), whereas in the prothoracic gland EcR mRNA increased rapidly to high levels on day 2 and remained high thereafter. During the onset of adult development, two peaks of EcR mRNA were observed in wings from day 3 to 5 and on day 8 after pupal ecdysis. These two peaks correlated with the time of increasing titers of ecdysone (E) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), respectively. The EcR mRNA peaks always preceded the large ecdysteroid peak, suggesting that the transcription of the EcR gene is induced by a low concentration of ecdysteroid in vivo. 3amessenger RNA 3apupae 3acomplementary DNA 3aManduca sexta 3ahormone receptors 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aecdysterone 3alarvae 3aintrons 3awings 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDrosophila melanogasterxgenetics 2aEcdysone 2aGenes, Insect 2aLarvaxmetabolism 2aManducaxembryologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPupaxmetabolism 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Steroidxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aWingxmetabolism 0aecdysteroids 0agenbank/u19812 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aJindra, M.1 aNewitt, R.1 aPalli, S.R.1 aHiruma, K.1 aRiddiford, L.M.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 July, v. 25, no. 7 p.845-856x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03297naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245012300143300001600266500011400282500013300396500001500529520139600544650001501940650001601955650002301971650001801994650001802012650002502030650001102055650001202066650001002078650002102088650001102109650002702120650001202147650004402159650003802203650001402241650001102255650003202266650004102298650003902339650003002378650001002408653002802418653001202446653002502458653001202483700001702495700001802512773009902530852000902629930003302638945001302671946001102684655001202695IND2047925120221117230156.0950925e199506  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204792512DNAL7 a76271992pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZitnan, D.10aParasitism-induced accumulation of FMRFamide-like peptides in the gut innervation and endocrine cells of Manduca sexta  ap. 669-678.  aIn the special issue: Biosynthesis and catabolism of insect hormones and pheromones / edited by D.A.

These fifth instar hosts linger for 2 to 3 weeks without resuming feeding, molting, or metamorphosis once the wasps emerge. Immunohistochemical staining with antiserum against FMRFamide revealed dramatic accumulation of FMRFamide-like peptide(s) in the gut nervous and endocrine systems of the developmentally arrested larvae when compared to that observed in unparasitized feeding or starved larvae. Specifically, the number of immunopositive cells and the intensity of staining was enhanced in the neurons of the frontal ganglion, the axons and axon terminals on the midgut surface, and in the gastric endocrine cells. These results were confirmed using ELISA to show that the relative amounts of FMRFamide-like peptides in midgut extracts were highly elevated in the parasitized larvae relative to the fed or starved unparasitized larvae. These data suggest that FMRFamide-like peptides in developmentally arrested larvae are produced in a significantly larger number of gastric endocrine cells, and that the rate of release of the peptides may be suppressed, or the rate of their synthesis may be elevated. Localization of FMRFamide-like peptides in the gastric endocrine cells of C. congregata is also described. 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aCotesia congregata 3aManduca sexta 3aneuropeptides 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amidgut 3aganglia 3aaxons 3aendocrine system 3alarvae 3abiological development 2aAnimals 2aEndocrine Glandsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFMRFamide 2aFemale 2aInsect Hormonesxmetabolism 2aIntestinesxinnervationxmetabolism. 2aManducaxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aNeuropeptidesxmetabolism 2aWasps 0agastric endocrine cells 0aneurons 0adevelopmental arrest 0aCotesia1 aKingan, T.G.1 aBeckage, N.E.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 June, v. 25, no. 6 p.669-678x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02317naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013800126300001600264500001500280520116200295650001901457650001901476650002201495650001801517650002201535650002101557650001101578650001601589650001401605650001401619650001101633650002101644653001701665653001501682653002101697700001301718773009801731852000901829930003301838945001301871946001101884655001201895IND2047970920221117230152.0950927e199505  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204797092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshiga, T.10aPurification and characterization of four biliverdin-binding proteins from larval haemolymph of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura  ap. 575-581.  a2019-12-05  aFour biliverdin-binding proteins (BPs) were purified from the larval haemolymph of Spodoptera litura by a combination of KBr gradient ultracentrifugation and chromatofocusing. In the order of highest isoelectric point, we named the proteins BP-1, BP-2, BP-3 and BP-4. All BPs were composed of subunits of 165 kDa and their native molecular weights were estimated as 390 kDa by gel filtration. In addition to biliverdin, they contained more than 3% lipids (cholesterol, cholesterol ester, triacylglycerol, diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol and phospholipid) and ca 3% carbohydrates (D-fucose, D-mannose, D-glucose, D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine). The amino acid composition of BP4 differed slightly from the other BPs. In Ouchterlony's immunodiffusion tests, antiserum against BP-2 showed cross-reactivities with BP-1, BP-2 and BP-3, and antiserum against BP-4 only reacted with BP-4. An immunoblotting test revealed strong reactivities between BP-2 antiserum and BP-1, BP-2 and BP-3, and weak cross-reactivity with BP-4.

In the initial decolorization study of 10 days, it was observed that S. commune IBL-6 was a better decolorizer of Cibacron Red FN-2BL. Various process parameters like composition of basal nutrient medium, pH, temperature, additional carbon and nitrogen sources, and initial dyestuff concentration were optimized to develop an economic decolorization process. The optimum dye decolorization was achieved in basal nutrient medium II containing 0.1% Cibacron Red FN-2BL and supplemented with 1% glucose after 3 days incubation at pH 4.5 and 30 °C. All the additional carbon sources were found to enhance decolorization process, whereas most of the nitrogen supplements caused fungal-growth inhibition. The pattern of enzymes involved in the biodegradation of this dye was studied, and manganese peroxidase was found to be the major peroxidase with minor lignin peroxidase and laccase activities. 3amanganese peroxidase 3alaccase 3atextile mill effluents 3aSchizophyllum commune 3anitrogen 3adecolorization 3alignin peroxidase 3awastewater treatment 3acarbon 3areactive dyes 3apH 3abiodegradation 3atemperature 3anutrients 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 2aColor 2aColoring Agentsxmetabolism 2aSchizophyllumxmetabolism 0aoptimization 0aCibacron Red FN-2BL1 aAkram, Nadia1 aAsgher, Muhammad0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2008 June, v. 149, no. 3 p.255-264x0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-007-8123-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080922b20081011c00000000  aINDdYLPe2008/09/22  aOther US 7aarticle02633naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245011200146300001600258520110600274650001801380650001601398650001301414650002001427650001801447650002201465650001801487650002001505650001201525650003201537650003201569650002801601650004001629650001101669650003101680650002001711650002901731650003301760650000901793650002801802653001801830653002301848653003401871700001501905700001801920773009901938852000902037930003302046945001302079946001102092655001202103IND2046343520221117230101.0950607e199504  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204634352DNAL7 a77428322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeitsch, K.W.10aIndirect control of yolk protein genes by 20-hydroxyecdysone in the fat body of the mosquito, Aedes aegypti  ap. 449-454.  aIn response to a blood meal, the fat body of the female mosquito, Aedes aegypti, begins massive production of several yolk proteins which are subsequently stored in the developing oocytes. Although 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) is important for initiation and maintenance of expression of the yolk protein genes encoding vitellogenin (Vg) and vitellogenic carboxypeptidase (VCP), the exact nature of 20E action has not been clearly defined. A primary question is whether this hormone directly stimulates expression of the genes for Vg and VCP or if it acts indirectly through a hormone response cascade. We have demonstrated that 10(-4) M cycloheximide (Chx) reversibly inhibits > 98% of protein synthesis in in vitro fat body culture. 10(-5) M 20E stimulates high levels of the mRNAs for Vg and VCP in previtellogenic fat bodies cultured in vitro, but initiation of this expression is eliminated by Chx. Thus, our results indicate that protein synthesis is required in response to 20E before increased levels of yolk protein mRNAs can be measured. We therefore conclude that the action of 20E is indirect. 3aAedes aegypti 3aecdysterone 3afat body 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3acarboxypeptidases 3acycloheximide 2aAedesxgenetics 2aAnimals 2aCarboxypeptidasesxgenetics 2aCycloheximidexpharmacology 2aEcdysteronexphysiology 2aFat Bodyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aInsect Proteins 2aOrgan Culture Techniques 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aRats 2aVitellogeninsxgenetics 0avitellogenins 0agenetic regulation 0avitellogenic carboxypeptidase1 aChen, J.S.1 aRaikhel, A.S.0 tInsect biochemistry and molecular biology.g1995 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.449-454x0965-17487nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01482naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011100124300001400235520059500249650001600844650001500860650001300875650001900888650001100907650002700918650001000945650001100955653001600966700001500982773008100997852000901078930003301087945001301120946001101133655001201144IND2059122620221117230224.0970825e199701  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205912262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzboy, O.10aUnexpected strengthening effects of a coarse wheat bran on dough rheological properties and baking quality  ap. 77-82.  aGrain from the wheat varieties Bezostaya and Gerek were milled in a Buhler laboratory mill to obtain straight-run flour, line bran and coarse bran.

The three N-terminal peptides, NT1, NT2 and NT3, differed by a single substitution at the sixth position and correspond, respectively, to the N-termini off Dx subunits, Ax and Bx subunits and By and Dy subunits. The anti-peptide sera did not cross react with gliadins or with low Mr glutenin subunits, and differed in their ability to recognise high Mr glutenin subunits. The antisera to the repetitive motifs recognised all high Mr glutenin subunits, whereas the antisera to the N-terminal peptides detected only some of the subunits. The antiserum directed against the N-terminal peptide from Dx subunits detected these subunits specifically, whereas the antiserum directed against the N-terminal peptide corresponding to y type subunits did not react with the homologous subunits although it did react with Dx or Bx subunits. Antisera were also produced against internal sequences present in the N-terminal domain specific for x and for y-type subunits, but these antisera did not react with the cognate proteins. The failure of some anti-peptide sera to recognise the homologous high Mr glutenin subunits may be due to differences in conformation between peptides and the corresponding regions in proteins. 3aglutenins 3asynthetic peptides 3across reaction 3agliadin 3aimmunochemistry 3aimmunoblotting 3awheat flour 3aantiserum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay1 aPopineau, Y.1 aQuillien, L.1 aRegenmortel, M.H.V. van.0 tJournal of cereal science.g1996 Mar., v. 23, no. 2 p.133-134x0733-52107nnas  aDNAL  a19971001b19971008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02111naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010100126300001400227500001500241520094500256650002501201650003001226650001101256650000901267650001101276650001401287650002001301650001201321650002001333650003201353653002701385653001701412653001201429653001701441653000901458653001301467700002001480700001801500773008101518852000901599930003301608945001301641946001101654655001201665IND2063069320221117230058.0980410e199707  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206306932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebyser, W.10aArabinoxylan and arabinoxylan hydrolysing activities in barley malts and worts derived from them  ap. 67-74.  a2019-12-05  aThe water-extractable and total arabinoxylan contents of six barley malts varied between 0.49-0.69% (all analytical data expressed as a proportion of dry malt) and 6.40-6.93% respectively.

Here we describe a new protocol for the isolation of intact and pure amyloplasts from developing wheat endosperm. The precursor and effector dependencies of fatty-acid synthesis were analysed for both types of cereal amyloplasts. Both wheat and maize-endosperm amyloplasts used [2 14C]pyruvate with the greatest efficiency for the synthesis of fatty acids. Malate was not converted to fatty-acids. The effects of various metabolites upon both pyruvate- and acetate-dependent fatty-acid synthesis were compared for maize or wheat plastids. In all cases, fatty-acid synthesis was dependent upon the additional presence of ATP in the incubation medium. [2 14C]pyruvate-driven fatty-acid synthesis in isolated wheat amyloplasts was not totally dependent upon the additional presence of reduced pyridine dinucleotide (NADH) in the incubation medium. Both pyruvate- and acetate-dependent fatty-acid synthesis in cereal amyloplasts could be stimulated to maximal rates by exogenous glucose 6-phosphate indicating an interaction of the oxidative pentose-phosphate pathway and fatty-acid synthesis. 3aZea mays 3aTriticum aestivum 3aendosperm 3aseed development 3alipid metabolism 3aplastids 3afatty acids 3apyruvic acid 3amalic acid 3ametabolites 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aculture media 3aacetic acid 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3apentose phosphate cycle 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 0asubstrates 0aprecursors1 aNeuhaus, H.E.0 tJournal of cereal science.g1997 Sept., v. 26, no. 2 p.161-167x0733-52107nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02277naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005400128300001600182500001500198520114200213650001101355650002501366650003301391650001001424650001601434650001801450650001101468650001901479650001301498650001501511650001101526650002101537650001801558650001001576653002201586653001301608700001401621700001701635700001701652773008401669852000901753930003301762945001301795946001101808655001201819IND2163635720221117230139.0980826e199709  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216363572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerrard, J.A.14aThe role of maltodextrins in the staling of bread  ap. 201-209.  a2019-12-05  aRecent reports suggest that dextrins produced by anti-staling alpha-amylases are directly involved in retarding the staling process. We report experiments that test this hypothesis using a new method of dextrin extraction at 90 degrees C in the presence of papain. Various dextrins were added to standard bread and extracted under a variety of conditions. No change in staling rate was observed, but, in most cases, there was little difference between the level of dextrins extracted from baked loaves and that from the control loaves, confirming that added dextrins are hydrolysed by native flour amylases. Adding a bacterial alpha-amylase of intermediate temperature stability (Novamyl) or a fungal glucoamylase of intermediate temperature stability (GA300N) or alpha-amylase plus glucoamylase to the dough, produced loaves with different dextrin profiles. Measured staling rates did not relate to the presence of dextrins in a specific size class. It appears that dextrins present in an amylase-treated loaf are symptomatic of a modification to the starch that retards staling, but are not the direct cause of the anti-staling effect. 3apapain 3achemical composition 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3adough 3awheat flour 3amaltodextrins 3astarch 3abaking quality 3afirmness 3ahydrolysis 3abreads 3amolecular weight 3aalpha-amylase 3afungi 0astorage disorders 0adextrins1 aEvery, D.1 aSutton, K.H.1 aGilpin, M.J.0 tJournal of cereal science.g1997 Sept., v. 26, no. 2 p.201-209x0733-52107nnas  aDNAL  a19981102b19981110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02527naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001100138245009200149300001800241520126400259650001301523650001401536650001701550650002201567650001201589650001101601650001301612650001501625650001501640650003401655650003301689650002101722650001401743700001601757700001301773700001601786700001601802773014201818852000901960856007801969930003302047946001302080655001202093IND4427899220221117225949.0091023e20091115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442789922DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.218152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Bo10aEffect of PPO-g-MA on structures and properties of PPO/PA6/short glass fiber composites  ap. 2188-2197.  aPoly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide)/polyamide 6 (PPO/PA6) blends were reactively compatibilized by maleic anhydride (MA) grafted PPO (PPO-g-MA) and reinforced by short glass fibers (SGF) via melt extrusion. An observation of the SGF-polymer interface by scanning electronic microscope (SEM) together with etching techniques indicated that the PPO-g-MA played a decisive role in the adhesion of polymers to SGF. The rheological behavior was investigated by capillary rheometer, and the addition of PPO-g-MA, and SGF could increase the viscosity of the PPO/PA6 blends. The analysis of fiber orientation and distribution in the PPO/PA6/SGF composites showed PPO-g-MA favored to the random dispersion of SGF. The statistic analysis of SGF length showed that PPO-g-MA was helpful to maintain the fiber length during melt-processing. For the composites at a given SGF content of 30 wt %, the addition of PPO-g-MA increased the tensile strength from 59.4 MPa to 97.1 MPa and increased SGF efficiency factor from 0.028 to 0.132. The experimental data were consistent with the theoretical predictions of the extension of Kelly-Tyson model for tensile strength. The fracture toughness of the composites was investigated by single edge notch three-point bending test. 3aadhesion 3aextrusion 3aglass fibers 3amaleic anhydrides 3amelting 3amodels 3apolymers 3aprediction 3arheometers 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atensile strength 3aviscosity1 aZhang, Yong1 aBai, Xin1 aWang, Shuai1 aJi, Jiliang0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 Nov. 15, v. 47, no. 22 p.2188-2197dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.218153Available from publisher's Web site  a20091023b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02120naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001300138245015200151300001800303520098600321650001701307650002101324650002401345650001301369650001301382700001501395700001501410700001501425700001501440700001401455700001401469773014201483852000901625856007801634930003301712946001301745655001201758IND4427899320221117230021.0091023e20091115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442789932DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.218162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNa, Bing10aEnhanced hydrogen bonding and its dramatic impact on deformation behaviors in a biomedical poly(carbonate urethane) with fluorinated chain extender  ap. 2198-2205.  aThe enhanced hydrogen bonding, manifested by significant frequency decreasing of both N----H and C==O stretching vibrations, is confirmed in a biomedical poly(carbonate urethane) with fluorinated chain extender. It gives rise to preferential association among hard segments and thus promoted microphase separation, which is responsible for the plastic deformation behaviors of the fluorinated poly(carbonate urethane). Furthermore, the segmental orientation, including both soft and hard segments, has been well correlated with the enhanced hydrogen bonding as well as promoted microphase separation. Under stretching large domains are prone to orient with their long axis along tensile direction and thus a negative orientation of hard segments is observed. Meanwhile, decreased orientation of soft segments can also find its origin in the reduced crosslinking density provided by hard domains because of preferential association among hard segments in such a biomedical material. 3acrosslinking 3ahydrogen bonding 3aplastic deformation 3apolymers 3aurethane1 aLv, Ruihua1 aXu, Wenfei1 aTian, Nana1 aLi, Jiehua1 aTan, Hong1 aFu, Qiang0 tJournal of polymer science.g2009 Nov. 15, v. 47, no. 22 p.2198-2205dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx0887-62667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/polb.218163Available from publisher's Web site  a20091023b20091106c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02320naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245014100173300001600314500015300330520095100483650002001434650002401454650002401478650001101502650001401513650001901527650001401546650001101560650001501571650002701586650001101613650001701624700001401641700001401655700001601669700001601685773014501701856005501846852000901901655001201910IND60564960220170801000000.0170320e20160812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056496022DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1137.342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLitschmann, T.10aDependence of leaf surface area and leaf number of apple trees on the sum of temperatures: utilization for protection against apple scab  ap. 241-246.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Innovation in Integrated and Organic Horticulture (INNOHORT) held June 8-12, 2015, Avignon, France  aScanning of the leaves of four apple cultivars at weekly intervals during the 2012 growing season made it possible to calculate their surface area. The calculation of the surface area of scanned leaves revealed that the leaf surface area is determined by the multiplication of the leaf width and leaf length, which is then multiplied by the factor 0.71. Measurement of the leaf width and the leaf length on annual shoots in the years 2013 and 2014 at weekly intervals during the growing season made it possible to calculate the leaf surface area using a non-destructive method. Monitoring of the number of leaves and measurement of the leaf area of four apple cultivars, 'Idared', 'Golden Delicious', 'Melrose' and 'Rubín', during the growing season showed that the change in the leaf area surface has a very close algorithmic relationship to the ambient temperature condition characterized by the daily sum of effective temperatures above 5°C. 3aMalus domestica 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aambient temperature 3aapples 3acultivars 3agrowing season 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3amonitoring 3anondestructive methods 3ashoots 3asurface area1 aVavra, R.1 aFalta, V.1 aBilkova, A.1 aZdarska, I.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Aug. 12, , no. 1137 p.241-246dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1137.34  aDNAL 7aarticle03273naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001900154245012400173300001600297500015300313520200500466650002502471650001702496650002302513650001102536650001502547650001302562650001802575650001502593650001402608650001702622650001702639650001502656700001902671773014502690856005502835852000902890655001202899IND60564960120221117230246.0170320e20160812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056496012DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1137.332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacob-John, J.10aPerception of fairness within organic fresh produce supply chains: the case of small and medium fresh produce retailers  ap. 233-240.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Innovation in Integrated and Organic Horticulture (INNOHORT) held June 8-12, 2015, Avignon, France  aConsumers and other stakeholders expect ethical business practices along the supply chain, making it imperative for business customers to have a 'responsibility centred' purchasing strategy. This paper analyses the influence of perception of responsibility and ethics by focussing on “fairness” within supply chain relationships. The research employs a multiple case study approach to analyse the relationship between fair and equitable business conduction and dyadic supply chain relationships from a business customer's (retailer's) perspective. The researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with an intent to determine fairness related factors that affect purchasing and vertical inter-organizational relationships. The results illustrate that within the organic fresh fruit and vegetable value chain, the vertical relationships between suppliers and business customers are heavily influenced by the perception of fairness and responsibility centric activities of the supplier organization. A major finding of fairness perception is that from a business customer's perspective, fairness perception is possible only when there is a fair behaviour to all stakeholders and thereby, the paper defines fairness from a stakeholder perspective. Moreover, by dividing fairness into three components; distributive, procedural and interactive fairness, the paper illustrates that there is a difference in perceived fairness according to the focus on each component of fairness. With greater competition from both local and international suppliers, it is imperative that suppliers create and implement strategies that foster effective supply chain relationships and this research guides managers to achieve the same. Research analysing the interrelationships between the fresh fruit and vegetable supply chain actors' fairness perception and stakeholder orientation, and propensity to repurchase within a business-to-business context is minimal and this paper contributes to this scant literature. 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aconsumers (people) 3aethics 3ainterviews 3amanagers 3aorganic foods 3apurchasing 3araw fruit 3astakeholders 3asupply chain 3avegetables1 aVerrapa, N.

Two innovative methods were tested for this purpose: a new luster sensor technology (type CH-72) and three-dimensional microscopy (type VHX 5000), as well as the combination of both innovative techniques. Yellow organically-grown 'Golden Globe' and red conventionally-grown 'Wonderful' pomegranate fruit were stored for over three weeks either at room temperature at 20°C (VPD 11.7 mbar) or in the refrigerator at 6°C (VPD 4.7 mbar), both at 50% RH. Changes in micromorphology, i.e., degree of fruit shriveling, and the roughness according to the depth of shrivel or undulations were examined. The luster levels decreased during the time of the experiment. The luster level of red pomegranate fruit dropped from 194-340 (average: 250) relative units to 195-270 (average: 220) relative units after three weeks of storage at 20°C. The luster levels of yellow fruit dropped more dramatically from 200-410 (average: 310) relative units to 175-210 (average: 190) relative units after storage at room temperature. These changes in luster level were associated with a 2.5- to 3-fold increase in undulation; the average depth of fruit surface undulation increased from 0.45 mm with fresh fruit to 1.4 mm in fruit stored at room temperature. Luster levels and 3D images of pomegranate fruit were recorded for the first time. The results may indicate that the luster sensor may be used to detect changes in surface appearance like glossiness and degree of shriveling in yellow but, to a lesser extent, in red pomegranate fruit. Further research is required before a commercial application can be considered. 3aambient temperature 3adigital images 3ahorticulture 3amarkets 3amicroscopy 3amicrostructure 3anondestructive methods 3apomegranates 3araw fruit 3arefrigerators 3aroughness 3astorage time1 aSpielmanns, J.1 aDamerow, L.1 aBlanke, M.

However, the exact comparison between these two material forms is not known. The objective of this research was to evaluate and compare the impacts of raw biomass chips with biochar produced from the same feedstock. Both raw biomass (pine chips; Pinus taeda) and a corresponding pine-chip biochar (slow pyrolysis; 2 h, 500°C) were added to a sandy-textured Ultisol at three different rates and four incremental particle-size fractions (1-2, 0.5-1, 0.2-0.5, and <0.2 mm). Results demonstrated that the immediate impact on hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) of the amended soil was influenced by application rate and particle size, with remarkable similarity between the two amendments. All additions significantly reduced both the soil bulk density and Ksat (P<0.05). These alterations in the hydraulic properties were postulated to be due to alterations in soil particle packing (i.e., tortuosity). Alterations in pore geometry, with blocking of larger macropores by the amendment, could explain this behavior, and this was supported by the similar behavior between raw feedstock and biochar of equal particle sizes. Thus, the immediate alterations in the hydraulic properties of an amended soil were primarily a function of the particle size of the material, regardless of whether or not the raw feedstock had been converted to biochar. With decreasing particle size, both additions increased water-holding capacity at saturation. This suggests that small-particle-size additions to a sandy-textured soil would reduce infiltration rates and net water gained per precipitation event due to the reduced soil moisture potential gradient and Ksat. However, the effects are a function of the amendment particle size distribution and the original soil texture. 3aPinus taeda 3aUltisols 3aapplication rate 3abiochar 3abiomass 3afeedstocks 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ainfiltration rate 3amacropores 3amaterial forms 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3apyrolysis 3asoil amendments 3asoil density 3asoil texture 3asoil water potential 3awater holding capacity1 aWeis, R.1 aFeyereisen, G.1 aWatts, D.

HMGB proteins are generally considered nuclear proteins, although mammalian HMGB1 can also be detected in the cytoplasm and outside of cells. Plant HMGB proteins studied so far were found exclusively in the cell nucleus. Using immunofluorescence and fluorescence microscopy of HMGB proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein, we have examined the subcellular localization of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) HMGB2/3 and HMGB4 proteins, revealing that, in addition to a prominent nuclear localization, they can be detected also in the cytoplasm. The nucleocytoplasmic distribution appears to depend on the cell type. By time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, it was observed that the HMGB2 and HMGB4 proteins tagged with photoactivatable green fluorescent protein can shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, while HMGB1 remains nuclear. The balance between the basic amino-terminal and the acidic carboxyl-terminal domains flanking the central HMG box DNA-binding domain critically influences the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the HMGB proteins. Moreover, protein kinase CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the acidic tail modulates the intranuclear distribution of HMGB2. Collectively, our results show that, in contrast to other Arabidopsis HMGB proteins such as HMGB1 and HMGB5, the HMGB2/3 and HMGB4 proteins occur preferentially in the cell nucleus, but to various extents also in the cytoplasm.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA-binding domains 3acell nucleus 3acytoplasm 3afluorescence microscopy 3agene expression regulation 3agreen fluorescent protein 3anuclear proteins 3aplant proteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxmetabolism 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aChromatinxmetabolism 2aCytoplasmxmetabolism 2aHMGB Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Transport 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSubcellular Fractionsxmetabolism1 aMerkle, Thomas1 aMarktl, Barbara1 aLildballe, Dorte L.1 aAntosch, Martin1 aBergmann, Thorsten1 aTönsing, Katja1 aAnselmetti, Dario1 aGrasser, Klaus D.0 tPlant physiology.g2010 Dec., v. 154, no. 4 p.1831-1841dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.110.1630553Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03398naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002100181245009100202300001800293500002400311500001500335506007600350520170900426506003702135650002302172650003902195650001702234650002202251650001802273650001202291650001102303650001102314650001102325650002702336650001102363650001302374650001002387650001102397650002502408650001802433650002402451651001402475653001402489700002302503700001902526700001902545700002402564700001802588773013702606852000902743856008002752655001202832IND4459769020221207124732.0110708e20110715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445976902DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02931-102doi7 aPMC31473702pmcid7 a216424082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPizzetti, Ilaria10aTemporal Variability of Coastal Planctomycetes Clades at Kabeltonne Station, North Sea  ap. 5009-5017.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMembers of the bacterial phylum Planctomycetes are reported in marine water samples worldwide, but quantitative information is scarce. Here we investigated the phylogenetic diversity, abundance, and distribution of Planctomycetes in surface waters off the German North Sea island Helgoland during different seasons by 16S rRNA gene analysis and catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization (CARD-FISH). Generally Planctomycetes are more abundant in samples collected in summer and autumn than in samples collected in winter and spring. Statistical analysis revealed that Planctomycetes abundance was correlated to the Centrales diatom bloom in spring 2007. The analysis of size-fractionated seawater samples and of macroaggregates showed that ~90% of the Planctomycetes reside in the >3-μm size fraction. Comparative sequence analysis of 184 almost full-length 16S rRNA genes revealed three dominant clades. The clades, named Planctomyces-related group A, uncultured Planctomycetes group B, and Pirellula-related group D, were monitored by CARD-FISH using newly developed oligonucleotide probes. All three clades showed recurrent abundance patterns during two annual sampling campaigns. Uncultured Planctomycetes group B was most abundant in autumn samples, while Planctomyces-related group A was present in high numbers only during late autumn and winter. The levels of Pirellula-related group D were more constant throughout the year, with elevated counts in summer. Our analyses suggest that the seasonal succession of the Planctomycetes is correlated with algal blooms. We hypothesize that the niche partitioning of the different clades might be caused by their algal substrates.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atemporal variation 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3aalgal blooms 3asequence analysis 3aribosomal RNA 3aislands 3aautumn 3awinter 3aniches 3aoligonucleotide probes 3aspring 3aseawater 3agenes 3asummer 3astatistical analysis 3asurface water 3aCoscinodiscophyceae 3aNorth Sea 0aCentrales1 aFuchs, Bernhard M.1 aGerdts, Gunnar1 aWichels, Antje1 aWiltshire, Karen H.1 aAmann, Rudolf0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 July 15, v. 77, no. 14 p.5009-5017dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02931-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02778naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245004000167300001600207500002400223520164400247650001301891650001501904650001801919650001801937650001301955650001201968650001301980650001801993650002202011650000902033650002502042650002102067650001302088650001102101650001202112650001602124700002502140773012702165852000902292856005502301655001202356IND4423881820221117224736.0090731e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442388182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2009.00399.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aREN, YAMEI10aAdhesion of sugar and oil solutions  ap. 427-435.  aIncludes references  aSalt was applied to surfaces coated with sugars and oils to test their adhesion. There was no difference in adhesion between 70% solutions of sucrose, glucose and fructose. Below 70%, adhesion by glucose was greater than for sucrose. Adhesion increased from propylene glycol with two hydroxyl groups to glycerol with three, but there was no change in adhesion from glycerol to sorbitol, which has six hydroxyl groups. The adhesion of glycerol and sorbitol was not different from sucrose. In corn syrups, adhesion increased with increasing dextrose equivalent. Increasing oil content increased adhesion up to 0.2 mg/cm², then plateaued. Oils produced a similar adhesion to solutions of 70% sugar. Adhesion varied with the type of oil. Most likely, the differences in adhesion were due to the presence of natural surfactants. When lecithin was added, the adhesion increased significantly. The addition of other surfactants did not significantly increase the adhesion. Sugar and oil are frequently used to adhere powders and small particulates, such as seasonings and spices, to a food surface. The desire for low calorie foods means minimizing the sugar and oil used for adhesion. Glucose was shown to have greater adhesion than sucrose, therefore less of it could be used to achieve the same adhesion. Addition of lecithin to oils increased its adhesion. Certain oils had higher adhesion than others, due to natural surfactants. Most of the fat replacers tested did not show significant adhesion. Using this information, current tack agents could be replaced with other sugars or oils to produce the same adhesion at a lower concentration. 3aadhesion 3acorn syrup 3afat replacers 3afood surfaces 3afructose 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3alipid content 3alow calorie foods 3aoils 3aphosphatidylcholines 3apropylene glycol 3asorbitol 3aspices 3asucrose 3asurfactants1 aBarringer, Sheryl A.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2009 Aug., v. 33, no. 4 p.427-435dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2009.00399.x 7aarticle03885naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002100181245012700202300001800329500002400347506007600371520172000447506003702167650001102204650001902215650001802234650001102252650002602263650000902289650001302298650001502311650001902326650001302345650001102358650002102369650001402390650003002404650001702434650001302451650001302464650002202477650001202499650001702511650004502528650001402573650001102587650002802598650002902626650003402655650003802689650003002727650007902757650002302836651001502859651001102874700002002885700002302905773013402928852000903062856008003071856004803151655001203199IND4383699520221207103147.0060917e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438369952DNAL7 a169572222pmid7 aPMC15635992pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.00917-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEiler, Alexander10aEnvironmental Influences on Vibrio Populations in Northern Temperate and Boreal Coastal Waters (Baltic and Skagerrak Seas)  ap. 6004-6011.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEven if many Vibrio spp. are endemic to coastal waters, their distribution in northern temperate and boreal waters is poorly studied. To identify environmental factors regulating Vibrio populations in a salinity gradient along the Swedish coastline, we combined Vibrio-specific quantitative competitive PCR with denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis-based genotyping. The total Vibrio abundance ranged from 4 x 10³ to 9.6 x 10⁴ cells liter⁻¹, with the highest abundances in the more saline waters of the Skagerrak Sea. Several Vibrio populations were present throughout the salinity gradient, with abundances of single populations ranging from 5 x 10² to 7 x 10⁴ cells liter⁻¹. Clear differences were observed along the salinity gradient, where three populations dominated the more saline waters of the Skagerrak Sea and two populations containing mainly representatives of V. anguillarum and V. aestuarianus genotypes were abundant in the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea. Our results suggest that this apparent niche separation within the genus Vibrio may also be influenced by alternate factors such as nutrient levels and high abundances of dinoflagellates. A V. cholerae/V. mimicus population was detected in more than 50% of the samples, with abundances exceeding 10³ cells liter⁻¹, even in the cold (annual average water temperature of around 5°C) and low-salinity (2 to 4[per thousand]) samples from the Bothnian Bay (latitude, 65°N). The unsuspected and widespread occurrence of this population in temperate and boreal coastal waters suggests that potential Vibrio pathogens may also be endemic to cold and brackish waters and hence may represent a previously overlooked health hazard.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVibrio 3abrackish water 3acoastal water 3acoasts 3aenvironmental factors 3agels 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3ahealth hazards 3alatitude 3aniches 3anutrient content 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asaline water 3asalinity 3aseawater 3awater temperature 2aAnimals 2aCold Climate 2aDinoflagellidaxisolation & purification 2aEcosystem 2aHumans 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSeawaterxanalysisxmicrobiology. 2aSodium Chloridexanalysis 2aVibrioxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aWater Microbiology 3aBaltic Sea 0aSweden1 aJohansson, Mona1 aBertilsson, Stefan0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Sept., v. 72, no. 9 p.6004-6011dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00917-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03703naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002000181245014400201300001800345500002400363506007600387520198500463506003702448650002502485650001702510650001302527650001902540650001102559650001602570650001102586650001202597650002302609650001802632650001202650650002202662650001502684650001602699650001602715650001002731650001402741700002202755700001602777700001902793700001902812700001802831700002102849700002202870700001902892773013702911852000903048856008003057655001203137IND4443633620221207125110.0101015e20101015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444363362DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00258-102doi7 aPMC29530112pmcid7 a208020762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToyama, Tadashi10aIsolation and Characterization of 4-tert-Butylphenol-Utilizing Sphingobium fuliginis Strains from Phragmites australis Rhizosphere Sediment  ap. 6733-6740.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe isolated three Sphingobium fuliginis strains from Phragmites australis rhizosphere sediment that were capable of utilizing 4-tert-butylphenol as a sole carbon and energy source. These strains are the first 4-tert-butylphenol-utilizing bacteria. The strain designated TIK-1 completely degraded 1.0 mM 4-tert-butylphenol in basal salts medium within 12 h, with concomitant cell growth. We identified 4-tert-butylcatechol and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone as internal metabolites by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. When 3-fluorocatechol was used as an inactivator of meta-cleavage enzymes, strain TIK-1 could not degrade 4-tert-butylcatechol and 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone was not detected. We concluded that metabolism of 4-tert-butylphenol by strain TIK-1 is initiated by hydroxylation to 4-tert-butylcatechol, followed by a meta-cleavage pathway. Growth experiments with 20 other alkylphenols showed that 4-isopropylphenol, 4-sec-butylphenol, and 4-tert-pentylphenol, which have alkyl side chains of three to five carbon atoms with α-quaternary or α-tertiary carbons, supported cell growth but that 4-n-alkylphenols, 4-tert-octylphenol, technical nonylphenol, 2-alkylphenols, and 3-alkylphenols did not. The rate of growth on 4-tert-butylphenol was much higher than that of growth on the other alkylphenols. Degradation experiments with various alkylphenols showed that strain TIK-1 cells grown on 4-tert-butylphenol could degrade 4-alkylphenols with variously sized and branched side chains (ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, tert-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, tert-octyl, n-nonyl, and branched nonyl) via a meta-cleavage pathway but not 2- or 3-alkylphenols. Along with the degradation of these alkylphenols, we detected methyl alkyl ketones that retained the structure of the original alkyl side chains. Strain TIK-1 may be useful in the bioremediation of environments polluted by 4-tert-butylphenol and various other 4-alkylphenols.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhragmites australis 3aSphingomonas 3abacteria 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3acell growth 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3agas chromatography 3ahydroxylation 3aketones 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3arhizosphere 3asalts 3asediments1 aMomotani, Naonori1 aOgata, Yuka1 aMiyamori, Yuji1 aInoue, Daisuke1 aSei, Kazunari1 aMori, Kazu-hiro.1 aKikuchi, Shintaro1 aIke, Michihiko0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Oct. 15, v. 76, no. 20 p.6733-6740dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00258-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01846naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245006800122500001500190520067100205650001300876650001700889650000800906650002500914650002000939650002900959650001000988650002700998650002101025650001401046651001001060653001601070653002501086700001401111700001801125773026401143852000901407939003301416946001101449655001201460IND9301789720221117225002.0930329s1986    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930178972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOoi, T.10aInformation analysis and sequence data banks of DNA and protein  a2019-12-06  aInformation stored in DNA is expressed eventually as protein molecules through transcription and translation steps of biosynthesis.

It was conducted to determine in vitro biological effects as well as to identify and quantify compound classes and effective contaminants. Research was part of investigation on hazards of contaminants bound to SPM to inundated sites and retention areas that are inundated during flood events. Material and methods SPM was sampled in 2006 and more frequently in a flood event (August, 2007) at the river Rhine barrage of Iffezheim, Germany. SPM was GC-MS analyzed for hexachlorobenzene (HCB), several polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as well as for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Flood samples were fractionated applying a recently developed automated fractionation method to receive further insight into contaminant loads in flood SPM. Impacts on biological scale were assessed using in vitro biotests for xenometabolic 7-ethoxyresorufin-o-deethylase (EROD) assay as well as for mutagenic activity (Ames fluctuation assay). EROD induction was calculated as biological equivalent concentrations (bio-TEQs) and mutagenic potentials were shown as NOECs and maximum induction factors. Results and discussion Chemical analysis gave low concentrations of PCBs (2006 and 2007) and HCB (2006). HCB concentrations increased during the flood in 2007 (maximum, 110 µg/kg SPM). Concentrations of PCBs were only initially elevated in the flood (maximum, 67 µg/kg SPM). EROD induction bio-TEQs ranged from 1,160 to 6,640 pg/g SPM in 2006 and showed maximum bio-TEQ at the peak discharge in 2007. There was no mutagenic activity with SPM of both years. Fractionation indicated highest EROD induction in PAH fractions with prioritized (EPA-) PAHs contributing to less than 1% to the fractions total bio-TEQ but also fractions containing more polar-to-polar substances were shown to contribute minor. Furthermore, more polar fractions were mutagenic active with SPM sampled after the peak of discharge (IFmax = 14.7). Conclusions Contaminants bound to flood SPM can be hazardous to inundated retention areas. Concentrations can be assumed to be increasing correlated with discharge and, thus, with more extreme flood events. Furthermore, biological effects are elevated or first place appearing with SPM from floods. Hazards have to be expected not only from persistent and non-polar substances but alike from less persistent and more polar ones that, furthermore, are more relevant evaluating hazards to drinking water resources from public well fields. 3achemical analysis 3adrinking water 3afloods 3afractionation 3ahexachlorobenzene 3aparticulates 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arivers 3awells 3aGermany 0aAmes fluctuation assay 0aDioxin-like 0aEROD assay 0aFlood 0aEffect-directed analysis 0aSuspended particulate matter1 aFleig, Michael1 aSchulze, Tobias1 aMaletz, Sibylle1 aLübcke-von Varel, Urte1 aReifferscheid, Georg1 aKühlers, Dirk1 aBraunbeck, T.q(Thomas)1 aBrack, Werner1 aHollert, Henner0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2010 Sept., v. 10, no. 6 p.1174-1185dSpringer-Verlagx1439-01087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-010-0262-y 7aarticle02741naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245018000204300001800384500002400402506007600426520140300502506003701905650001501942650002201957650002201979650001202001650001902013650001302032700001902045700002002064700002602084700002002110773013602130852000902266856008002275655001202355IND4436708620221207130537.0100507e20100515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443670862DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.00181-102doi7 aPMC28691462pmcid7 a203050232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBreton, M.q(Marc)10aSequences Essential for Transmission of Spiroplasma citri by Its Leafhopper Vector, Circulifer haematoceps, Revealed by Plasmid Curing and Replacement Based on Incompatibility  ap. 3198-3205.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpiroplasma citri GII3 contains highly related low-copy-number plasmids pSci1 to -6. Despite the strong similarities between their replication regions, these plasmids coexist in the spiroplasma cells, indicating that they are mutually compatible. The pSci1 to -6 plasmids encode the membrane proteins known as S. citri adhesion-related proteins (ScARPs) (pSci1 to -5) and the hydrophilic protein P32 (pSci6), which had been tentatively associated with insect transmission, as they were not detected in non-insect-transmissible strains. With the aim of further investigating the role of plasmid-encoded determinants in insect transmission, we have constructed S. citri mutant strains that differ in their plasmid contents by developing a plasmid curing/replacement strategy based on the incompatibility of plasmids having identical replication regions. Experimental transmission of these S. citri plasmid mutants through injection into the leafhopper vector Circulifer haematoceps revealed that pSci6, more precisely, the pSci6_06 coding sequence, encoding a protein of unknown function, was essential for transmission. In contrast, ScARPs and P32 were dispensable for both acquisition and transmission of the spiroplasmas by the leafhopper vector, even though S. citri mutants lacking pSci1 to -5 (encoding ScARPs) were acquired and transmitted at lower efficiencies than the wild-type strain GII3.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCirculifer 3aSpiroplasma citri 3amembrane proteins 3amutants 3aplasmid curing 3aplasmids1 aDuret, Sybille1 aDanet, Jean-Luc1 aDubrana, Marie-Pierre1 aRenaudin, Joël0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 May 15, v. 76, no. 10 p.3198-3205dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00181-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02105naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003100152245010300183300001800286500002400304500001500328520088800343650000901231650001701240650002701257650003001284650001201314650001301326650002201339653002701361700001901388700002201407700001901429700002401448700004701472773013601519852000901655856005501664655001201719IND4458940620221117225020.0110610e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445894062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2011.02646.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva, Daniel Santos Pinto10aMultiplex PCR for the simultaneous detection of Salmonella spp. and Salmonella Enteritidis in food  ap. 1502-1507.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMultiplex PCR assay (mPCR) for the detection of Salmonella spp. and S.

The mPCR was evaluated in Minas cheese, fresh pork sausage and chicken carcasses commercially available. Salmonella spp. was detected in nine of sixty-six chicken carcasses, five of fifty-two cheese samples, and five of fifty-two sausage samples. The serovar Enteritidis was detected in two samples of contaminated sausage. The mPCR results were confirmed by conventional culture and biochemical identification of the isolates.

Brazil remains challenged in regard to a number of social issues, notably poverty reduction in isolated areas, where access to electricity is as poor as their population. In the Amazonian region, most people have no access to electricity, or else have only a precarious supply. Due to several economic and technical reasons, many cities have old, inefficient diesel generators. In such a scenario, CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) can be an instrument both to mitigate climate change and to promote sustainable development in these remote areas, thereby contributing to the achievement of the MDGs in Brazil. However, CDM implementation in Brazil is still restricted to a few types of projects (such as sugar cane bagasse cogeneration and landfill gas use), mostly proposed by big companies and hardly ever directed to the Amazon region. The main objectives of this article are to assess the potential of CDM as a possible tool to promote electricity access to the poor rural population in the Amazonian region, and to discuss the main reasons why it has not become a reality so far. 3aUnited Nations 3abusiness enterprises 3acities 3aclimate change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3agases 3agenerators (equipment) 3alandfills 3apeople 3apoverty 3arural population 3asugarcane bagasse 3asustainable development 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aWalter, Arnaldo1 aRei, Fernando0 tClimatic change.g2007 Sept., v. 84, no. 1 p.111-129dKluwer Academic Publishersx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-007-9272-1 7aarticle01818naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245013000154300001600284500002400300520095700324650002201281650001201303650001101315650001801326651001401344773009601358852000901454856007701463655001201540IND4463206920221117224855.0120514s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446320692DNAL7 a10.1002/agr.100652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xueyan10aWho bears the burden and who receives the gain?—The case of GWRDC R&D investments in the Australian grape and wine industry  ap. 355-366.  aIncludes references  aIt is only when R&D levies are invested in the sectors in which they are raised that the distribution of the benefits among industry sectors is exactly the same as the incidence of the levies. This article examines the distributions of both costs and returns from the Australian grape and wine R&D investments and the divergence between the two distributions. The real shares of R&D costs are estimated through the incidence of the levies and compared with the nominal shares. Grape-growers, winemakers and overseas consumers are shown to receive bigger proportions of gains than their proportions of costs, while the Australian government and other domestic parties as a group bear a much higher proportion of costs than returns.

After the whole trees were shaded with the sun-light about 50-55% for 20 days, AsA levels were significantly decreased in fruit peel, flesh and leaves, while mRNA expression levels and activities of l-galactose dehydrogenase (l-GalDH, EC 1.1.1.117) and l-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (l-GalLDH, EC 1.3.2.3) as well as activities of recycling enzymes was clearly declined in the leaf and peel but not in the flesh. By shading fruits only for 20 days, AsA levels, relative mRNA levels and activities of l-GalDH and l-GalLDH as well as activities of recycling enzymes all showed obvious decrease in the peel, but not in the flesh. However, their levels in the peel were markedly increased after the full shade was removed and re-exposed these fruits on natural light for 5 days. It is concluded that light affects AsA biosynthesis and recycling in the peel and leaf, but did not in the fresh. Results also suggest that apple fruit is potential to biosynthesize AsA via the l-galactose pathway, and AsA content in the fruits may depend partly on levels of AsA or other photochemistry controlled by light in the leaves. 3aMalus domestica 3aapples 3aascorbic acid 3aenzyme activity 3afruit peels 3afruits 3agene expression 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3aplant organs 3arecycling 3ashade 3ashade trees 3asolar radiation 2aAscorbic Acidxmetabolism 2aBlotting, Northern 2aFruitxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aGalactose Dehydrogenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxradiation effects 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aLight 2aMalusxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aOxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSpectrophotometryxmethods1 aMa, Fengwang1 aShang, Peifen1 aZhang, Min1 aHou, Changming1 aLiang, Dong0 tPlanta.g2009 June, v. 230, no. 1 p.39-51dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-009-0925-3 7aarticle03952naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002900171245021000200300001800410520139200428650000801820650001801828650001501846650002101861650001701882650001601899650001401915650001501929650001601944650002101960650001801981650002401999650002702023650001502050650001002065650002202075650001602097650001402113650001602127650001602143650001202159650002702171650001302198650001302211650001002224650001202234650001802246650002502264650002102289650003302310650002502343650001102368650003502379650001402414650002002428650001302448650003302461650002702494650003302521650001602554650001402570650001602584650002302600650002702623650002402650650002002674653001502694653002702709700002902736700002002765700002102785700001802806773011702824852000902941856009202950930003303042946001103075655001203086IND4429558820221117224748.0091207e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442955882DNAL7 a199195912pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04428.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Christopher Irwin10aHost specificity and reproductive success of yucca moths (Tegeticula spp. Lepidoptera: Prodoxidae) mirror patterns of gene flow between host plant varieties of the Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia: Agavaceae)  ap. 5218-5229.  aCoevolution between flowering plants and their pollinators is thought to have generated much of the diversity of life on Earth, but the population processes that may have produced these macroevolutionary patterns remain unclear. Mathematical models of coevolution in obligate pollination mutualisms suggest that phenotype matching between plants and their pollinators can generate reproductive isolation. Here, we test this hypothesis using a natural experiment that examines the role of natural selection on phenotype matching between yuccas and yucca moths (Tegeticula spp.) in mediating reproductive isolation between two varieties of Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia var. brevifolia and Y. brevifolia var. jaegeriana). Using passive monitoring techniques, DNA barcoding, microsatellite DNA genotyping, and sibship reconstruction, we track host specificity and the fitness consequences of host choice in a zone of sympatry. We show that the two moth species differ in their degree of host specificity and that oviposition on a foreign host plant results in the production of fewer offspring. This difference in host specificity between the two moth species mirrors patterns of chloroplast introgression from west to east between host varieties, suggesting that natural selection acting on pollinator phenotypes mediates gene flow and reproductive isolation between Joshua-tree varieties. 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aTegeticula 3aYucca brevifolia 3achloroplasts 3acoevolution 3agene flow 3agenotyping 3ahost plants 3ahost specificity 3aintrogression 3amathematical models 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amonitoring 3amoths 3anatural selection 3aoviposition 3aphenotype 3apollination 3apollinators 3aprogeny 3areproductive isolation 3asiblings 3asympatry 3atrees 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aBiological Evolution 2aCluster Analysis 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aFemale 2aFlowersxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Fitness 2aGenotype 2aLarvaxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aMothsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aOviposition 2aPhenotype 2aPollination 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aYuccaxgenetics 0amutualisms 0asibship reconstruction1 aDrummond, Christopher S.1 aGodsoe, William1 aYoder, Jeremy B.1 aPellmyr, Olle0 tMolecular ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 18, no. 24 p.5218-5229dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04428.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120324b20120504c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03258naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245008300192300001800275520155400293650002101847650001401868650001101882650002101893650002301914650004201937650002301979650001002002650002002012650003802032650001802070650001102088650004202099650002802141650002602169650002902195653001402224700002102238700001802259700001402277700001602291700001802307700001602325700001502341700001802356700001702374700002102391700001602412773010702428852000902535856009202544930003302636946001102669655001202680IND4426983720221117224757.0091011e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442698372DNAL7 a198248862pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02091.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerreira, M.A.R.10aAssociation and interaction analyses of eight genes under asthma linkage peaks  ap. 1623-1628.  aLinkage studies have implicated the 2q33, 9p21, 11q13 and 20q13 regions in the regulation of allergic disease. The aim of this study was to test genetic variants in candidate genes from these regions for association with specific asthma traits. Ninety-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) located in eight genes (CD28, CTLA4, ICOS, ADAM23, ADAMTSL1, MS4A2, CDH26 and HRH3) were genotyped in >5000 individuals from Australian (n = 1162), Dutch (n = 99) and Danish (n = 303) families. Traits tested included doctor-diagnosed asthma, atopy, airway obstruction, total serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels and eosinophilia. Association was tested using both multivariate and univariate methods, with gene-wide thresholds for significance determined through simulation. Gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment analyses were also performed. There was no overall evidence for association with seven of the eight genes tested when considering all genetic variation assayed in each gene. The exception was MS4A2 on chromosome 11q13, which showed weak evidence for association with IgE (gene-wide P < 0.05, rs502581). There were no significant gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interaction effects after accounting for the number of tests performed. The individual variants genotyped in the 2q33, 9p21 and 20q13 regions do not explain a large fraction of the variation in the quantitative traits tested or have a major impact on asthma or atopy risk. Our results are consistent with a weak effect of MS4A2 polymorphisms on the variation of total IgE levels. 3ahypersensitivity 3aepistasis 3agenome 2aAsthmaxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 11xgenetics 2aEpistasis, Genetic 2aGenes 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenome, Human 2aHumans 2aHypersensitivity, Immediatexgenetics 2aImmunoglobulin Exblood 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aReceptors, IgExgenetics 0acandidate1 aZhao, Zhongzhen.1 aThomsen, S.F.1 aJames, M.1 aEvans, D.M.1 aPostmus, P.E.1 aKyvik, K.O.1 aBacker, V.1 aBoomsma, D.I.1 aMartin, N.G.1 aMontgomery, G.W.1 aDuffy, D.L.0 tAllergy.g2009 Nov., v. 64, no. 11 p.1623-1628dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02091.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091012b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03466naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245011300164300001600277520181000293650002002103650002002123650001902143650001602162650002202178650002202200650001402222650001102236650001702247650001702264650000902281650002502290650001102315650002002326650002202346650001202368650001902380650002002399650001902419650002502438650001502463650001102478650001002489650001902499650001102518653002902529653001602558700001902574700001802593700002002611773010702631852000902738856008502747930003302832946001102865655001202876IND4424613620221117224741.0090814e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442461362DNAL7 a10.1007/s11099-009-0035-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, R.V. 10aPhotosynthesis and water relations of well-watered orange plants as affected by winter and summer conditions  ap. 215-222.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate how the summer and winter conditions affect the photosynthesis and water relations of well-watered orange trees, considering the diurnal changes in leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence, and leaf water potential (Ψ) of potted-plants growing in a subtropical climate. The diurnal pattern of photosynthesis in young citrus trees was not significantly affected by the environmental changes when compared the summer and winter seasons. However, citrus plants showed higher photosynthetic performance in summer, when plants fixed 2.9 times more CO₂ during the diurnal period than in the winter season. Curiously, the winter conditions were more favorable to photosynthesis of citrus plants, when considering the air temperature (< 29 °C), leaf-to-air vapor pressure difference (< 2.4 kPa) and photon flux density (maximum values near light saturation) during the diurnal period. Therefore, low night temperature was the main environmental element changing the photosynthetic performance and water relations of well-watered plants during winter. Lower whole-plant hydraulic conductance, lower shoot hydration and lower stomatal conductance were noticed during winter when compared to the summer season. In winter, higher ratio between the apparent electron transport rate and leaf CO₂ assimilation was verified in afternoon, indicating reduction in electron use efficiency by photosynthesis. The high radiation loading in the summer season did not impair the citrus photochemistry, being photoprotective mechanisms active. Such mechanisms were related to increases in the heat dissipation of excessive light energy at the PSII level and to other metabolic processes consuming electrons, which impede the citrus photoinhibition under high light conditions. 3aCitrus sinensis 3aair temperature 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3adiurnal variation 3aelectron transfer 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3aheat 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3anight temperature 3aoranges 3aphotochemistry 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II 3astomatal conductance 3asubtropics 3asummer 3atrees 3avapor pressure 3awinter 0achlorophyll fluorescence 0aseasonality1 aMachado, E.C. 1 aSantos, M.G. 1 aOliveira, R.F. 0 tPhotosynthetica.g2009 June, v. 47, no. 2 p.215-222dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0300-36047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11099-009-0035-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20090814b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03281naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001900137245009000156300001600246500002400262520203900286650001302325650002202338650002102360650002102381650003102402650002202433650002602455650001302481653001202494653002602506700001902532700002302551773013102574852000902705856007402714930003302788945002502821946001302846655001202859IND4415274220221122221050.0090123s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aN200 0aX100 0aJ7001 aKarimi, Davood10aModeling of Straight-Line Driving with a Guidance Aid for a Tractor-Driving Simulator  ap. 403-408.  aIncludes references  aMinor steering corrections are necessary to keep a tractor moving in a straight line. If the factors that cause such steering corrections are not considered in the implementation of a driving simulator, the task of straight-line driving will be both unrealistic and too simple. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a model, for simulation of parallel swathing in a tractor-driving simulator, which accounts for both guidance system error and tractor self-deviation. Guidance system error and tractor self-deviation were both measured by an RTK GPS system. Fourier analysis was used to determine the energy spectrum in high-, medium-, and low-frequency regions. Complex sinusoids which had similar energy distributions to those obtained from field measurements were proposed for both guidance system error and tractor self-deviation. To validate the straight-line driving model, root mean square (RMS) and frequency composition of lateral deviation of the vehicle were determined for both the tractor-driving simulator and several real systems consisting of a tractor, driver, and lightbar guidance device. Six subjects participated in the simulator study. On average, the RMS of lateral deviation was 33 cm. The energy distribution was 32% in the high-frequency region, 39% in the medium-frequency region, and 29% in the low-frequency region. Field experiments with a single driver with seven distinct lightbar guidance systems yielded an average RMS of lateral deviation of 15 cm. The energy distribution was 27% in the high-frequency region, 41% in the medium-frequency region, and 32% in the low-frequency region. Field experiments with seven drivers using a single lightbar guidance device yielded an average RMS of lateral deviation of 30 cm. The energy distribution was 30% in the high-frequency region, 40% in the medium-frequency region, and 30% in the low-frequency region. Field experiments showed close agreement with simulator experiments in terms of the frequency composition of the lateral deviations. 3atractors 3asimulation models 3amodel validation 3asteering systems 3aglobal positioning systems 3aspectral analysis 3afield experimentation 3aaccuracy 0adriving 0astraight-line driving1 aMann, Danny D.1 aEhsani, R.q(Reza)0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2008, v. 24, no. 4 p.403-408dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/12  aOther US 7aarticle02946naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072000900146100001600155245016800171300001600339500002400355520129800379650001601677650002601693650001201719650001501731650003401746650002201780650004401802650002101846650001701867650001401884650001401898650002101912650002101933650002701954650002801981650002302009650001402032650001402046651001102060700001702071700002002088700001602108700001802124773009802142852000902240856008602249930003302335945002502368946001102393655001202404IND4415267920221122181838.0090123e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441526792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8331 aLunardi, M.10aOutbreak of acute bovine viral diarrhea in Brazilian beef cattle: Clinicopathological findings and molecular characterization of a wild-type BVDV strain subtype 1b  ap. 599-604.  aIncludes references  aWhen first described in 1946, bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) was characterized as an acute transmissible disease associated with severe leucopenia, high fever, depression, diarrhea, gastrointestinal erosions, and hemorrhages. Recently the severe acute form has been related only to some hypervirulent BVDV-2 strains. This article reports the detection of BVDV-1b associated with an acute and fatal outbreak of BVD in a Brazilian beef cattle herd. Depression, anorexia, watery diarrhea, sialorrhea, and weakness were observed in six steers. One of these animals was evaluated for laboratorial, clinical, and pathological alterations. Laboratory findings were non-specific; clinically, the animal was weak, with dehydration and erosive oral lesions. Pathological alterations were predominant at the tongue, esophagus, and rumen. A RT-PCR assay using primers to partially amplify the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of the BVDV genome was performed and identified BVDV in all clinical samples analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of BVDV derived from lymph node revealed that this strain was clustered within the BVDV subtype 1b. This differentiating was only possible to be performed by molecular characterization since both clinical presentation and pathologic findings were similar to BVDV-2 infection. 3abeef cattle 3abovine viral diarrhea 3astrains 3apathotypes 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3adisease outbreaks 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3adisease severity 3aacute course 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aanimal pathology 3adigestive system 3amolecular epidemiology 3apathogen identification 3amolecular genetics 3avirulence 3aphylogeny 3aBrazil1 aHeadley,S.A.1 aLisbôa, J.A.N.1 aAmude, A.M.1 aAlfieri, A.A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 Dec., v. 85, no. 3 p.599-604dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2008.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03502naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165072000900174100001600183245010900199300001600308500002400324500001500348520129200363650002701655650003001682650002201712650002501734650002301759650001101782650001701793650001301810650002001823650003801843650001901881650002001900650001601920650002401936650002301960650002901983650001202012650001102024650006502035650003502100650003702135650006802172650007302240650003502313650003602348650003702384653002602421653001602447653002502463653002202488700002302510700002102533773009802554852000902652856008602661930003302747945002502780946001102805655001202816IND4415266920221122181840.0090123e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441526692DNAL7 a182622122pmid7 a10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL833 0aL8101 aKamaraj, G.10aValidation of betapropiolactone (BPL) as an inactivant for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus  ap. 589-594.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCopyInfectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) virus causes vulvovaginitis, abortion and respiratory disease in cows and heifers. Betapropiolactone (BPL) is a disinfectant, effective against bacteria, fungi and viruses. It is also used to prepare inactivated vaccines because it destroys the nucleic acid core of viruses but does not damage the capsid. For the validation of BPL when used as an inactivant, it is more important to assure the quality of inactivating agent and the validity of the inactivation process. In the present study, the inactivation kinetics of IBR virus was determined with different concentration of BPL (1:250, 1:500, 1:1000, 1:1500, 1:2000 and 1:2500) at 4 and 37 °C. The result indicated that the BPL at 4 °C was able to inactivate the IBR virus within 4, 5 and 12 h with the concentration of 1:250, 1:500 and 1:1000, respectively. BPL at 37 °C was able to inactivate virus within 30 min with the concentration of 1:250. BPL with the concentration of 1:500 and 1:1000 were able to inactivate the virus within 120 min at 37 °C. Based on the kinetic study seven formulations were prepared and a sero conversion study of IBR inactivated vaccine was carried out. Serological response in animals to different formulations did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). 3achemical concentration 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3areaction kinetics 3ainactivated vaccines 3adisease prevention 3acattle 3ainactivation 3avalidity 3aproduct quality 3ainfectious bovine rhinotracheitis 3aseroconversion 3aimmune response 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3achemical treatment 3aantibacterial properties 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesximmunologyxprevention & controlxvirology. 2aDisinfectantsxtherapeutic use 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHerpesvirus 1, Bovinexdrug effectsximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aInfectious Bovine Rhinotracheitisximmunologyxprevention & control. 2aPropiolactonextherapeutic use 2aViral Vaccinesxtherapeutic use 2aVirus Inactivationxdrug effects 0aprocessing technology 0ainactivants 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0abetapropiolactone1 aLakshmi Narasu, M.1 aSrinivasan, V.A.0 tResearch in veterinary science.g2008 Dec., v. 85, no. 3 p.589-594dHarcourtx0034-52887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2007.12.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090316b20090508c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03141naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001700146245011800163300001400281500001500295520161100310650001801921650002601939650002001965650002401985650005502009650003402064650002202098650002802120650006502148650005102213650006002264650002102324653001902345700001902364700001602383700001402399700001702413700002002430700001302450700001902463773008702482852000902569930003302578945002502611946001102636655001202647IND4378163820221122143954.0060227e200601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437816382DNAL7 a163887782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aSicora, C.I.10aCyanobacterial psbA families in Anabaena and Synechocystis encode trace, constitutive and UVB-induced D1 isoforms  ap. 47-56.  a2019-12-05  aCyanobacteria cope with UVB induced photoinhibition of Photosystem II by regulating multiple psbA genes to boost the expression of D1 protein (in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803), or to exchange the constitutive D1:1 protein to an alternate D1:2 isoform (in Synechococcus sp. PCC7942). To define more general patterns of cyanobacterial psbA expression, we applied moderately photoinhibitory UVB to Anabaena sp. PCC7120 and tracked the expression of its five psbA genes. psbAI, encoding a D1:1 protein isoform characterized by a Gln130, represented the majority of the psbA transcript pool under control conditions. psbAI transcripts decreased upon UVB treatment but the total psbA transcript pool increased 3.5 fold within 90 min as a result of sharply increased psbAII, psbAIV and psbAIII transcripts encoding an alternate D1:2 protein isoform characterized by Glu130, similar to that of Synechococcus. Upon UVB treatment the relaxation of flash induced chlorophyll fluorescence showed a characteristic acceleration of a decay phase likely associated with the exchange from the D1:1 protein isoform encoded by psbAI to the alternate D1:2 isoform encoded by psbAIV, psbAII and psbAIII. Throughout the UVB treatment the divergent psbA0 made only a trace contribution to the total psbA transcript pool. This suggests a similarity to the divergent psbAI gene from Synechocystis, whose natural expression we demonstrate for the first time at a trace level similar to psbA0 in Anabaena. These trace-expressed psbA genes in two different cyanobacteria raise questions concerning the functions of these divergent genes. 3aCyanobacteria 3aultraviolet radiation 3aphotoinhibition 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnabaenaxenzymologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aProtein Isoformsxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aSynechocystisxenzymologyxgeneticsxradiation effects. 2aUltraviolet Rays 0aphotosynthesis1 aAppleton, S.E.1 aBrown, C.M.1 aChung, J.1 aChandler, J.1 aCockshutt, A.M.1 aVass, I.1 aCampbell, D.A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2006 Jan., v. 1757, no. 1 p.47-56x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20060331b20060529c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle02459naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001600127245010500143300001600248520163100264650001901895650002901914700001601943700001801959700002101977773009301998852000902091930003302100945002502133946001102158655001202169IND4376696420221122114831.0051213e20050930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437669642DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRanck, J.L.10aCharacterization of the core complex of Rubrivivax gelatinosus in a mutant devoid of the LH2 antenna  ap. 220-230.  aThe core complex of purple bacteria is a supramolecular assembly consisting of an array of light-harvesting LH1 antenna organized around the reaction center. It has been isolated and characterized in this work using a Rubrivivax gelatinosus mutant lacking the peripheral LH2 antenna. The purification did not modify the organization of the complex as shown by comparison with the intact membranes of the mutant. The protein components consisted exclusively of the reaction center, the associated tetraheme cyt c and the LH1 αβ subunits; no other protein which could play the role of pufX could be detected. The complex migrated as a single band in a sucrose gradient, and as a monomer in a native Blue gel electrophoresis. Comparison of its absorbance spectrum with those of the isolated RC and of the LH1 antenna as well as measurements of the bacteriochlorophyll/tetraheme cyt c ratio indicated that the mean number of LH1 subunits per RC-cyt c is near 16. The polypeptides of the LH1 antenna were shown to present several modifications. The α one was formylated at its N-terminal residue and the N-terminal methionine of β was cleaved, as already observed for other Rubrivivax gelatinosus strains. Both modifications occurred possibly by post-translational processing. Furthermore the α polypeptides were heterogeneous, some of them having lost the 15 last residues of their C-terminus. This truncation of the hydrophobic C-terminal extension is similar to that observed previously for the α polypeptide of the Rubrivivax gelatinosus LH2 antenna and is probably due to proteolysis or to instability of this extension. 3aphotosynthesis 3alight harvesting complex1 aHalgand, F.1 aLaprevote, O.1 aReiss-Husson, F.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2005 Sept. 30, v. 1709, no. 3 p.220-230x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20051230b20060102c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/12/30  aNon-US 7aarticle01943naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001500127245009400142300001600236520122100252650002001473650002601493773009201519852000901611930003301620945002501653946001101678655001201689IND4376694320221122114859.0051213e20050905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437669432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aKucera, I.10aEnergy coupling to nitrate uptake into the denitrifying cells of Paracoccus denitrificans  ap. 113-118.  aThis study deals with the effects of the agents that dissipate the individual components of the proton motive force (short-chain fatty acids, nigericin, and valinomycin) upon the methyl viologen-coupled nitrate reductase activity in intact cells. Substitution of butyrate or acetate for chloride in Tris-buffered assay media resulted in a marked inhibition at pH 7. In a Tris-chloride buffer of neutral pH, the reaction was almost fully inhibitable by nigericin. Alkalinisation increased the IC50 value for nigericin and decreased the maximal inhibition attained. Both types of inhibitions could be reversed by the permeabilisation of cells or by the addition of nitrite, and that caused by nigericin disappeared at high extracellular concentrations of potassium. These data indicate that nitrate transport step relies heavily on the pH gradient at neutral pH. Since the affinity of cells for nitrate was strongly diminished by imposing an inside-positive potassium (or lithium) diffusion potential at alkaline external pH, a potential dependent step may be of significance in the transporter cycle under these conditions. Experiments with sodium-depleted media provided no hints for Na+ as a possible H+ substitute. 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2005 Sept. 5, v. 1709, no. 2 p.113-118x0005-27287nnas  aDNAL  a20051230b20060102c00000000  aINDdLDPe2005/12/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03528naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100003200205245018600237300001500423500002400438500001500462520124500477650001501722650001701737650001101754650001701765650001401782650002601796650003301822650002601855650001601881650001401897650002101911650001901932650001201951650002501963650002901988650003702017650002302054650003702077650003302114650004902147650005702196650003702253650003002290653001902320653001302339700003202352700001802384700002102402700002602423700003002449700002002479700002102499700002302520773009502543852000902638856009002647930003302737945002502770946001102795655001202806IND4415278220221122092040.0090123e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527822DNAL7 a190006942pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2008.10.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF600 0aL600 0aL0011 aBertholdo-Vargas, Lúcia R.10aType 1 ribosome-inactivating proteins--Entomotoxic, oxidative and genotoxic action on Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hübner) and Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E.

Some two-chain (type 2) RIPs are highly toxic and may play a role in plant defense. The lower toxicity of single-chain (type 1) RIPs reflects the lack of a protein domain able to bind to, and translocate the toxin across cell membranes. We studied the effect of single-chain RIPs, lychnin, momordin, gelonin, PAP-S and saporin S-6, in larvae of Anticarsia gemmatalis and Spodoptera frugiperda. After ingesting a total dose of 20 or 40 μg of the toxins, weight gain, survival rate, lesions in DNA and oxidative status (catalase and superoxide dismutase activities and lipidic peroxidation) of RIP-treated insects were assayed. Momordin was the less toxic in the biossays. S. frugiperda had a more pronounced weight loss on the 4th day of treatment and A. gemmatalis on the 10th day. RIP-induced mortality reached 57.13% for A. gemmatalis and 29.45% for S. frugiperda. RIP-treated insects showed a 2-3-fold increase in DNA lesions as assessed by the comet assay, but there were no correlations between stress markers and DNA damage. We conclude that single-chain RIPs are entomotoxic to lepidopteran insects causing extensive DNA lesions. 3aDNA damage 3agenotoxicity 3alarvae 3ainactivation 3aribosomes 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aprotein synthesis inhibitors 3aAnticarsia gemmatalis 3aweight loss 3amortality 3aoxidative stress 3aplant proteins 2aAnimals 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aDNA Damagexdrug effects 2aLarvaxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aMothsxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aPlant Proteinsxpharmacology 2aRibosome Inactivating Proteinsxpharmacology 2aRibosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1xpharmacology 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0aentomotoxicity 0atoxicity1 aMartins, Juliana Nascimento1 aBordin, Diana1 aSalvador, Mirian1 aSchafer, Alois Eduard1 aBarros, Neiva Monteiro de1 aBarbieri, Luigi1 aStirpe, Fiorenzo1 aCarlini, Célia R.0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2009 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p. 51-58dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2008.10.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090202b20090301c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/02/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02474naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245007600148300001800224520109700242650001201339650002601351650001701377650002201394650001501416650001201431650003301443650004701476650004601523650002301569650001701592650004001609650001901649650007301668650005001741650003601791650001201827700001501839700002001854773009901874852000901973939003301982946001302015655001202028IND9205148320221122092044.0920817e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920514832DNAL7 a14971782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZimmerman, T.E.10aPolypeptides associated with Pasteurella multocida infection in rabbits  ap. 1108-1112.  aPolypeptides from whole cell preparations of Pasteurella multocida serotypes A:12 and A:3 were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose paper.

Thus, immunologic reactivity to these polypeptides may be useful for serologic detection of P multocida infection. 3arabbits 3aPasteurella multocida 3apolypeptides 3agenetic variation 3aantibodies 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aAntigens, Bacterialxanalysisximmunology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxanalysisximmunology. 2aBacterial Vaccines 2aDensitometry 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aImmunoblotting 2aPasteurella Infectionsxdiagnosisxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aPasteurella multocidaxchemistryximmunology. 2aPeptidesxanalysisximmunology. 2aRabbits1 aDeeb, B.J.1 aDiGiacomo, R.F.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1992 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.1108-1112x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02801naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119100002000128245010500148300001600253500002400269500001500293520146600308650001101774650001501785650002101800650002301821650002601844650002001870650001501890650001501905650002601920650002101946650002201967651001001989653002301999653001902022700001702041773013102058852000902189856007402198930003302272945002502305946001302330655001202343IND4415278120221122092038.0090123s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441527812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aP2101 aBordovsky, J.P.10aEffect of Subsurface Drip Irrigation System Uniformity on Cotton Production in the Texas High Plains  ap. 465-472.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPlanned reductions in subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system uniformity in the semi-arid environment of West Texas could reduce installation costs. A SDI system was installed and cotton production experiment conducted from 2001 to 2006 to evaluate irrigation system water distribution uniformities having flow variations (Q(var)) = 5%, 15%, and 27% at both moderate and near full irrigation levels. Flow variation treatments were established by installing and irrigating cotton with different diameter drip laterals in field plots in a complete block layout. Subsurface drip laterals with diameters of 17, 22, and 25 mm, pressurized at 72, 83, and 45 kPa, respectively, resulted in different irrigation uniformity treatments defined as poor (POOR), very good (VGD), and acceptable (ACC). Cotton lint yield response tended to follow changes in emitter flow rate along the length of drip laterals, but not to the extent expected. Total cotton lint yield and total yield value were not significantly affected by irrigation system designs with Q var between 5% and 27%. Average total lint yields across years were in a narrow range between 1603 and 1643 kg ha -1 yr -1 and average yield values were between 1907 and 1960 $ ha -1 yr -1 among all treatments. Over the five test years, field topography and environmental conditions common to the Texas High Plains appeared to have offset the expected cotton yield variability caused by non-uniform SDI water delivery. 3acotton 3atopography 3airrigation water 3aGossypium hirsutum 3asubsurface irrigation 3amicroirrigation 3awater flow 3acrop yield 3aenvironmental factors 3airrigation rates 3aspatial variation 3aTexas 0airrigation systems 0aflow variation1 aPorter, D.O.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2008, v. 24, no. 4 p.465-472dAmerican Society of Agricultural Engineersx0883-85427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://asae.frymulti.com/toc.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090514b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/12  aOther US 7aarticle03123naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009000146300001800236520154100254650001101795650001301806650001701819650002101836650001201857650001001869650001201879650003501891650001101926650003701937650004301974650003302017650003102050650003302081650006202114650003002176650004202206650005302248650004402301650000902345653002402354700001602378700001802394700002302412700001602435773009902451852000902550939003302559946001302592655001202605IND9205148920221122092101.0920817e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920514892DNAL7 a14971822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoussel, A.J.10aMyoelectric activity of the small intestine in enterotoxin-induced diarrhea of calves  ap. 1145-1148.  aElectrodes were surgically implanted at 15-cm intervals in the jejunum and ileum of 4 healthy neonatal calves so that myoelectric activity could be recorded on 2 consecutive days. On the first day, each calf received a control treatment, and myoelectric activity was recorded for 340 minutes. Phase I was recorded for a mean of 175.8 +/- 22.8 minutes (51.5%), phase II for 124 +/- 27.4 minutes (36.5%), and phase III for 40.3 +/- 6 minutes (11.9%). On the second day, each calf was treated with approximately 200 micrograms of heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) of Escherichia coli orally. All calves developed diarrhea after the administration of STa. Phase I was recorded for a mean of 92.5 +/- 42.3 minutes (27.2%), phase II for 227.3 +/- 52.5 minutes 66.9%), and phase III for 20.3 +/- 11.4 minutes (6.0%). Increase in phase II and decrease in phases I and III after STa administration were significant (P < 0.05). Duration of the migrating myoelectric complex was longer after STa administration (median, 64 minutes), compared with the control treatment (median, 54 minutes). Minute rhythms, recorded on the day of toxin administration, ranged from 49 to 153 minutes. There was no difference between the number of migrating action potential complexes on the control days (range, 1 to 10), compared with those on treatment days (range, 1 to 14). These findings are suggestive that enterotoxin-induced diarrhea of calves is accompanied by increased total spiking activity and minute rhythms in the distal portion of the jejunum and ileum. 3acalves 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxins 3aEscherichia coli 3ajejunum 3aileum 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Toxinsxpharmacology 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aDiarrheaxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aElectromyographyxveterinary 2aEnterotoxinsxpharmacology 2aEscherichia colixmetabolism 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aEscherichia coli Proteins 2aIleumxdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 2aIntestine, Smallxdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 2aJejunumxdrug effectsxphysiopathology. 2aMale 0aelectrical activity1 aWoode, G.N.1 aWaldron, R.C.1 aSriranganathan, N.1 aJones, M.K.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1992 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.1145-1148x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03665naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245018200142300001800324500001500342520202300357650000902380650003102389650001502420650001702435650001502452650002002467650001102487650007602498650002502574650001202599650005702611650000902668650002702677650001102704650003102715650002802746650006302774650000902837650002402846650004902870653001902919700001802938700001902956700001802975773009902993852000903092939003303101946001303134655001203147IND9205148220221122092045.0920817e199207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920514822DNAL7 a14971772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUribe, D.10aQuantitative renal scintigraphic determination of the glomerular filtration rate in cats with normal and abnormal kidney function, using 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid  ap. 1101-1107.  a2019-12-04  aThe nuclear imaging technique known as quantitative renal scintigraphy was validated as a means to assess the kidney function of cats. Renal function tests were performed in 6 healthy cats and 3 cats with clinical manifestations of kidney failure. In addition, the nephrotoxic drugs, gentamicin sulfate, or amphotericin B were used in an attempt to induce renal failure in 4 cats. Using linear regression analysis, equations were derived to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) on the basis of the renal percent uptake of 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA). One-way ANOVA and Student's t test were used to evaluate treatment effects on clearances of inulin and creatinine, percent uptake of 99-Tc-DTPA, and serum creatinine concentrations. The results show that the percent uptake of 99mTc-DTPA by the kidneys correlated well with the GFR obtained through the clearance of inulin. Thus, it was concluded that quantitative renal scintigraphy, using 99mTc-DTPA as a marker of kidney function, is an adequate technique to estimate the kidney function of healthy cats and cats with functional renal impairment. The best estimate of the GFR of cats, using the percentage dose of 99mTc-DTPA, was obtained on the 1- to 3-minute postinjection interval of the marker, using data that was background-subtracted, but not corrected for tissue absorption of gamma rays or binding of 99mTc-DTPA to plasma proteins. There was no significant difference in the mean inulin clearance, creatinine clearance, or percent uptake of 99mTc-DTPA between the 3 treatment groups of this study. Therefore, it was concluded that neither gentamicin nor amphotericin B are useful drugs in eliciting losses of feline kidney function that may be measurable through the procedures used in this study. Contrary to all other GFR studies in the cat, this study did not use any form of pharmacologic restraint. Therefore, the findings from this study are expected to reflect accurately the true GFR healthy nonanesthetized cats. 3acats 3aglomerular filtration rate 3atechnetium 3ascintigraphy 3acreatinine 3akidney diseases 3ainulin 2aAcute Kidney Injuryxphysiopathologyxradionuclide imagingxveterinary. 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxphysiopathologyxradionuclide imaging. 2aCats 2aCreatininexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGlomerular Filtration Rate 2aInulinxdiagnostic use. 2aKidneyxphysiologyxphysiopathologyxradionuclide imaging. 2aMale 2aRegression Analysis 2aTechnetium Tc 99m Pentetatexdiagnostic use. 0arenal function1 aKrawiec, D.R.1 aTwardock, A.R.1 aGelberg, H.B.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1992 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.1101-1107x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02836naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011600144300001400260500001500274520141700289650003001706650001501736650001201751650002101763650002401784650001901808650002301827650002601850650002901876650002001905650005001925650005201975650003902027651001802066651001802084653001702102653003602119700002202155700001802177700001602195773010002211852000902311939003302320946001302353655001202366IND9205147520221122060625.0920817e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920514752DNAL7 a20240432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaull, J.M.12aA survey and analysis of states' methodologies for deriving drinking water guidelines for chemical contaminants  ap. 18-35.  a2019-12-04  aData from a national survey questionnaire regarding the development of guidelines for chemical contaminants in drinking water were collected from all 50 states. Twenty-three states develop at least some of their own guidelines; the other 27 states rely on guidelines previously developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or by other states. States which derive guidelines generally employ toxicological criteria and risk assessment methodologies developed by the USEPA. Fourteen of the twenty-three states that develop their own guidelines depend on cancer potency factors derived by the USEPA to establish risk-based concentrations for carcinogens. Most of the states develop guidelines based on preventing possible excess cancer risk greater than one in one million. Seventeen of these twenty-three states rely on oral reference doses (RfDs) to derive guidelines for noncarcinogens. Examination and clarification of the states' approaches to guideline derivation reveal that although similar risk assessment techniques are generally employed, differences in assumptions, chemical classifications, and uncertainty factors may lead to variation in resultant guidance levels. Improved communication and coordination between states and the federal government may help reduce the variations and inconsistencies among the states in establishing drinking water guidelines for chemical contaminants. 3agroundwater contamination 3aguidelines 3asurveys 3astate government 3achemical substances 3adrinking water 3afederal government 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aDatabases, Bibliographic 2aRisk Management 2aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aWater Supplyxanalysisxstandards. 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0acontaminants 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aJoellenbeck, L.M.1 aCochran, R.C.1 aSidhu, K.S.0 tRegulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP.g1991 Feb., v. 13, no. 1 p.18-35x0273-23007nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01876naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009500125300001600220500001500236520073300251650001600984650002201000650001401022650001001036650001101046650000801057650003001065650002501095650002101120650001101141650001401152651001001166653001001176700001901186700001401205700002001219773007401239852000901313856008801322939003301410946001101443655001201454IND4482171120221122060729.0140617e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448217112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaba, Amit10aIsolation, identification and molecular characterization of Inclusion body hepatitis virus  ap. 415-417.  a2019-12-05  aInclusion body hepatitis caused by avian adenovirus with highly pathogenic strain lead to heavy mortality and unusual lesion like hydropericardium in commercial broilers.

Two groups of 7 sheep each were dosed orally with 3.5 mg of fluoride/kg of body weight daily for 4 months (from 5 to 9 months after birth). Sheep of the first group were slaughtered immediately after fluoride administration; those of the second group were slaughtered 4 months later at the age of 13 months. Three control groups of 7 sheep each were slaughtered at 5 months (to determine the state of the teeth at the beginning of fluoride administration), and at 9 and 13 months. During fluoride administration, plasma fluoride concentration rapidly increased to about 0.50 micrograms/ml; after fluoride administration, it stabilized at 0.20 micrograms/ml in treated sheep, whereas controls had concentration of 0.10 micrograms/ml (P < 0.01). Parts of the molars that were in the process of mineralization during fluoride administration (mainly second molars) had thinning enamel, with pits, mainly close to the apex, marked decrease in hardness throughout the layer (< 100 Vickers U, compared with 240 Vickers U), and fluoride accumulation twice as high as that in controls (1,000 to 2,500 mg(kg [dry weight]). Fluoride accumulation was higher in dentine (2,700 to 4,200 mg/kg), but hardness was less affected. On parts of the molars that were already mineralized mostly, the first molar), changes in the appearance of enamel and cementum, decreased hardness (less important than in teeth during mineralization) affecting outer enamel more than inner enamel, high fluoride concentration (4,000 to 5,500 mg(kg [dry weight]) in outer enamel extending over 200 Km were observed. Thus, in sheep, fluoride has a substantial postsecretory effect that may be explained by a slower maturation phase of enamel in this species. Because molar wear is correlated to enamel hardness (dentine at the occlusal surface has low resistance--30 Vickers U), abnormal abrasion of molar teeth that have mineralized before and during fluoride intakes can be observed. 3asheep 3afluorides 3aenamel 3asecretion 3amineralization 2aAmeloblastsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxanalysis 2aDental Enamelxchemistryxdrug effectsxsecretion. 2aDentinxchemistry 2aElectron Probe Microanalysis 2aFluoridesxanalysisxbloodxpharmacology. 2aHardness 2aMale 2aMolarxchemistryxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSheepxphysiology1 aCharles, E.1 aLoubiere, M.L.1 aKolf-Clauw, M.1 aJoubert, C.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1992 July, v. 53, no. 7 p.1241-1247x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02938naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002300155245010200178300001600280500002400296520148700320650001801807650001101825650001401836650002001850650004301870650001401913650002101927650001501948650002301963650002301986651001402009653002202023700002702045700002902072700002202101700002502123700002402148773012902172852000902301856007702310930003302387945002502420946001102445655001202456IND4415194220140725000000.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441519422DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.34832doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aQ5051 aTorres, Mariela M.10aGenetic and chemical assessment of Arbequina olive cultivar grown in Córdoba province, Argentina  ap. 523-530.  aIncludes references  aBACKGROUND: Thirty-eight accessions of olive (Olea europaea L.) originating from Córdoba province (Argentina) and preliminarily identified as belonging to the Arbequina variety were genotyped using AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) DNA markers. Also, the oil chemical composition was studied during three consecutive crop years. The objectives of the work were (a) to investigate genetic intra-cultivar diversity and (b) to evaluate the oil chemical composition and compare it with that of Arbequina oil produced in Spain.RESULTS: The 19 primer combinations employed to perform the AFLP analysis produced 98 polymorphic bands. A reduced genetic heterogeneity was obtained, confirming that (a) the selected accessions belong to the Arbequina variety and (b) the traditional vegetative propagation practice has caused low genetic erosion in this variety cultivated in Córdoba. The main features that characterise the Argentinian Arbequina oils studied are the lower content of oleic acid and higher levels of phenolics and high-molecular-weight volatile compounds compared with those found in Spanish Arbequina oils.CONCLUSION: In spite of the small proportion of intra-cultivar variability, the Arbequina variety grown in Argentina produces oils with different chemical traits from those obtained in the original Spanish growing region. These differences can be attributed mainly to the particular environmental conditions of the olive-growing areas in these countries. 3aOlea europaea 3aolives 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aolive oil 3afood composition 3aoleic acid 3aphenolic compounds 3avolatile compounds 3aArgentina 0aArbequina variety1 aPierantozzi, Pierluigi1 aCáceres, María Eugenia1 aLabombarda, Paola1 aFontanazza, Giuseppe1 aMaestri, Damián M.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2009 Feb., v. 89, no. 3 p.523-530dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.34833Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03331naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100001900198245018600217300001400403500001500417520107300432592002801505650001201533650001901545650001701564650001601581650002301597650001001620650001501630650001101645650002901656650001401685650001701699650001501716650001801731650001501749650001201764650002001776650001401796650001901810650001801829650004301847650003301890650002401923650002101947650004001968650002402008650002502032650001802057650001902075650002502094650004202119650004102161650004702202653002502249653001602274773013302290852000902423856008502432930003302517945002502550946001102575990002302586655001202609IND4380547020221122051357.0060601e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438054702DNAL7 a167116552pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

We studied the effects of an 8-week open-label supplementation with vitamins C (500 mg), B<sub>6</sub> (25 mg), B<sub>12</sub> (1 mg), and folate (5 mg) on C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and estradiol levels in 20 obese (body mass index ≥ 30) postmenopausal women. Outcomes were assessed in a blinded fashion. Folate and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> levels rose significantly, suggesting that the supplement was well absorbed and that participants adhered to the protocol. Weight, blood pressure, and serum lipids remained stable. C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and leptin levels remained unchanged. Estradiol levels rose from a median of 22.0 pg/mL (IQR = 15.9–25.8) at baseline to a median of 27.8 pg/mL (IQR = 23.1–33.9) at follow-up (p = 0.003). Increments in serum estradiol caused by vitamin supplementation in postmenopausal women have not been previously described and probably merit further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3ahuman diseases 3ablood lipids 3avitamin B12 3aC-reactive protein 3awomen 3abiomarkers 3aleptin 3amultivitamin supplements 3amenopause 3ainflammation 3apyridoxine 3ainterleukin-6 3afolic acid 3aobesity 3ahuman nutrition 3aestradiol 3ablood pressure 3aascorbic acid 2aAscorbic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aC-Reactive Proteinxanalysis 2aDietary Supplements 2aEstradiolxblood 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aInflammationxblood 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aLeptinxblood 2aObesityxblood 2aPostmenopausexblood 2aVitamin B 12xadministration & dosage 2aVitamin B 6xadministration & dosage 2aVitamin B Complexxadministration & dosage 0apostmenopausal women 0abody weight0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 76, no. 1 p.34-38dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.343Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02733naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100003300146245009100179300001600270500002400286500001500310520127900325650001401604650001801618650002701636650001601663650001401679650001201693650001601705650002601721650002101747650002101768650002001789653001101809653002101820653001901841700002501860700002301885700002101908700002601929773012901955852000902084856007702093930003302170945002502203946001102228655001202239IND4415194420140725000000.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441519442DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.34902doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5041 aRendón Villalobos, Rodolfo.10aProximal composition and in vitro starch digestibility in flaxseed-added corn tortilla  ap. 537-541.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBACKGROUND: The effect of addition of flaxseed flour (10:90, 15:85 and 20:80, w/w) on the chemical composition and starch digestibility of corn tortilla was investigated. Tortillas were baked and frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried, ground and analyzed for fat, protein, ash, total starch (TS), available starch (AS) and resistant starch (RS) contents as well as for starch hydrolysis rate and predicted glycemic index (pGI). Tortillas made from commercial nixtamalized corn flour were used as control sample.RESULTS: Flaxseed flour addition increased the fat and protein content of tortilla, whereas TS and AS decreased. TS was 15.25% lower in the 20% flaxseed-containing tortilla as compared to the control sample. The AS content was 12.65% lower in the composite tortilla. RS content in the samples ranged between 1.92% for the control sample and 5.08% for the tortilla containing 20% flaxseed. The reduced enzymatic starch hydrolysis rate and pGI recorded for the flaxseed-added tortilla, indicated slow digestion features.CONCLUSIONS: Flaxseed-added tortilla might be used to increase the consumption of α-linolenic acid in the daily diet and modulate starch digestibility of corn tortilla. This kind of product may be used by people with special diet reqirements. 3acorn meal 3alipid content 3ain vitro digestibility 3acorn starch 3atortillas 3alinseed 3aash content 3aproximate composition 3afood composition 3aresistant starch 3aprotein content 0astarch 0aavailable starch 0aflaxseed flour1 aAgama-Acevedo, Edith1 aOsorio-Diaz, Perla1 aTovar, Juscelino1 aBello-Pérez, Luis A.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2009 Feb., v. 89, no. 3 p.537-541dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.34903Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/02/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03174naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003300131040001800164100001800182245018000200300001800380506007600398520160000474506003702074650002102111650001302132650002702145650001302172650001702185650002102202650001102223650001802234650001902252653002502271653001302296700001802309700001802327700001802345700001502363700002002378773014302398852000902541856008302550930003302633945001302666946001302679655001202692IND2047957020221207122356.0950926e19950829dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204795702DNAL7 a116075762pmid7 aPMC411632pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.18.83932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeybold, S.J.13aDe novo biosynthesis of the aggregation pheromone components ipsenol and ipsdienol by the pine bark beetles Ips paraconfusus Lanier and Ips pini (Say) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae)  ap. 8393-8397.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe California five-spined ips, Ips paraconfusus Lanier, produces the myrcene-derived acyclic monoterpene alcohols ipsenol (2-methyl-6-methylene-7-octen-4-ol) and ipsdienol (2-methyl-6-methylene-2,7-octadien-4-ol) as components of its aggregation pheromone. The pine engraver beetle, Ips pini (Say), produces only ipsdienol. Previous studies have shown that myrcene, a monoterpene in the pines colonized by these beetles, is a direct precursor to these pheromone components. In vivo radiolabeling studies reported here showed that male I. paraconfusus incorporated [1-14C]acetate into ipsenol, ipsdienol, and amitinol (trans-2-methyl-6-methylene-3,7-octadien-2-ol), while male I. pini incorporated [1-14C]acetate into ipsdienol and amitinol. Females of these species produced neither labeled nor unlabeled pheromone components. The purified radiolabeled monoterpene alcohols from males were identified by comparison of their HPLC and GC retention times with those of unlabeled standards. HPLC-purified fractions containing the individual radiolabeled components were analyzed by GC-MS and were shown to include only the pure alcohols. To further confirm that ipsdienol and ipsenol were radiolabeled, diastereomeric ester derivatives of the isolated alcohols were synthesized and analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS. After derivatization of the radiolabeled alcohols, the HPLC analysis demonstrated expected shifts in retention times with conservation of naturally occurring stereochemistry. The results provide direct evidence for de novo biosynthesis of ipsenol, ipsdienol, and amitinol by bark beetles.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aIps paraconfusus 3aIps pini 3aaggregation pheromones 3aalcohols 3abiosynthesis 3aisotope labeling 3acarbon 3aradionuclides 3amonoterpenoids 0amonoterpene alcohols 0aamitinol1 aQuilici, D.R.1 aTillman, J.A.1 aVanderwel, D.1 aWood, D.L.1 aBlomquist, G.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 29, v. 92, no. 18 p.8393-8397x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.18.83933Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03123naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164100001200181245007200193300001400265500001500279520121500294592002801509650001801537650001901555650002701574650002101601650003201622650000901654650002601663650002101689650002401710650002401734650002401758650002301782650002301805650002101828650002501849650002001874650002101894650002401915650002201939650002401961650002801985650003502013651001002048651001002058653002502068653003202093700001402125700002702139773013302166852000902299856008502308930003302393945002502426946001102451990002302462655001202485IND4380546720221122042119.0060601e20060101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438054672DNAL7 a167116522pmid7 a10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The predominant content of lipid is triacylglycerol, ranging from 91.1% in Cannabis sativa to 98.4% in macadamia. There were two polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in all nuts analyzed; 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3. The content of 18:3n-3 ranging from 0.2% in almond to 15.2% in Cannabis sativa, 18:2n-6 ranged from 2.5% in macadamia to 61.6% in pine nut. The proportion of total PUFA in analyzed eight nut species ranging from 2.8% in macadamia to 71.7% in walnut (p < 0.001). Monounsaturated fatty acid composition ranged from 18.0% in Cannabis sativa to 82.6% in macadamia (p < 0.001). The proportion of saturated fatty acid ranged from 7.4% in filbert to 14.7% of total fatty acids in macadamia (p < 0.001). No C20 fatty acids were detected in any of the samples in the present study. The lipids content and fatty acid compositions in analyzed samples were varied between nut species. Cannabis sativa and walnut contained relatively high 18:3n-3, consumption of several these nuts each day can contribute to n-3 PUFA intake, especially for the vegetarian population.  aPublisher supplied data 3alipid content 3alinolenic acid 3afatty acid composition 3atriacylglycerols 3amonounsaturated fatty acids 3anuts 3asaturated fatty acids 3afood composition 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aomega-6 fatty acids 2aCannabisxchemistry 2aCorylusxchemistry 2aJuglansxchemistry 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMacadamiaxchemistry 2aNutsxchemistry 2aPinusxchemistry 2aPistaciaxchemistry 2aPrunusxchemistry 2aTaxaceaexchemistry 2aTriglyceridesxanalysis 2aalpha-Linolenic Acidxanalysis 3aChina 0aChina 0aalpha-linolenic acid 0apolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aYao, Ting1 aSiriamornpun, Sirithon0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 76, no. 1 p.18-21dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.183Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03084naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001700181245009100198300001800289500001500307506007600322520082600398506003701224650001201261650002401273650001301297650002501310650002301335650001001358650001201368650002301380650001601403650002401419650001201443650002301455650002301478650002101501650003001522650003001552650002501582650001101607650002001618650002301638650000901661650002801670650001301698650002401711650003901735650001801774650001701792650002301809653001901832653001801851653001901869653002801888653002501916653001901941653001501960700002001975700001601995700002102011773014302032852000902175856008302184930003302267945001302300946001302313655001202326IND2047654220221207122439.0950908e19950815dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204765422DNAL7 a76445362pmid7 aPMC412842pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.17.80502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrov, D.A.10aDiverse transposable elements are mobilized in hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis  ap. 8050-8054.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe a system of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis in which at least four unrelated transposable elements are all mobilized following a dysgenic cross. The data are largely consistent with the superposition of at least three different systems of hybrid dysgenesis, each repressing a different transposable element, which break down following the hybrid cross, possibly because they share a common pathway in the host. The data are also consistent with a mechanism in which mobilization of a single element triggers that of others, perhaps through chromosome breakage. The mobilization of multiple, unrelated elements in hybrid dysgenesis is reminiscent of McClintock's evidence [McClintock, B. (1955) Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 8, 58-74] for simultaneous mobilization of different transposable elements in maize.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahybrids 3aopen reading frames 3acrossing 3aamino acid sequences 3achromosome mapping 3aexons 3aintrons 3aDrosophila virilis 3atransposons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNAxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aDrosophilaxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenomic Library 2aGonadal Dysgenesis 2aMale 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid 2aRetroelements 2aX Chromosome 2aZea maysxgenetics 0agenbank/u26938 0atransposition 0agenetic change 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u26847 0adysgenesis1 aSchutzman, J.L.1 aHartl, D.L.1 aLozovskaya, E.R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 15, v. 92, no. 17 p.8050-8054x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.17.80503Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04063naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100002100181245017200202300001800374500001500392506007600407520112800483506003701611650002601648650001701674650002201691650002201713650002501735650002901760650001801789650002501807650001601832650002501848650002801873650002401901650001201925650002301937650001401960650002901974650006302003650002702066650002402093650004002117650002502157650005802182650002802240650003902268650003002307650002002337650003202357650006602389650003902455650004802494650003502542650007002577650003402647650003802681650001702719653002302736653002302759653001802782653001902800653000802819653002802827653001902855700001602874700001902890700001802909773014302927852000903070856008303079930003303162945001303195946001303208655001203221IND2047653220221207134839.0950908e19950815dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204765322DNAL7 a76445222pmid7 aPMC412672pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.17.79662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSutherland, J.D.10aDrosophila hormone receptor 38: a second partner for Drosophila USP suggests an unexpected role for nuclear receptors of the nerve growth factor-induced protein B type  ap. 7966-7970.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn Drosophila the response to the hormone ecdysone is mediated in part by Ultraspiracle (USP) and ecdysone receptor (EcR), which are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Heterodimers of these proteins bind to ecdysone response elements (EcREs) and ecdysone to modulate transcription. Herein we describe Drosophila hormone receptor 38 (DHR38) and Bombyx hormone receptor 38 (BHR38), two insect homologues of rat nerve growth factor induced protein B (NGFI-B). Although members of the NGFI-B family are thought to function exclusively as monomers, we show that DHR38 and BHR38 in fact interact strongly with USP and that this interaction is evolutionarily conserved. DHR38 can compete in vitro against EcR for dimerization with USP and consequently disrupt EcR-USP binding to an EcRE. Moreover, transfection experiments in Schneider cells show that DHR38 can affect ecdysone-dependent transcription. This suggests that DHR38 plays a role in the ecdysone response and that more generally NGFI-B type receptors may be able to function as heterodimers with retinoid X receptor type receptors in regulating transcription.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3aecdysteroids 3acomplementary DNA 3ahormone receptors 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aBombyx mori 3anucleotide sequences 3aDrosophila melanogaster 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBombyxxmetabolism 2aCell Line 2aCell Nucleusxmetabolism 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDrosophilaxmetabolism 2aDrosophila Proteins 2aDrosophila melanogasterxmetabolism 2aEcdysonexmetabolism 2aInsect Hormonesxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNerve Growth Factorsxpharmacology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtein Kinases 2aErbB Receptorsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear 2aReceptors, Invertebrate Peptidexmetabolism 2aReceptors, Steroidxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTransfection 0aecdysone receptors 0agenetic regulation 0aultraspiracle 0agenbank/x89246 0aDNA 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x892471 aKozlova, T.1 aTzertzinis, G.1 aKafatos, F.C.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 15, v. 92, no. 17 p.7966-7970x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.17.79663Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03603naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002000110024003300130040001800163100001800181245014000199300001800339500001500357506007600372520101600448506003701464650001201501650001601513650002201529650002301551650002201574650002201596650001601618650002201634650002201656650002501678650001101703650002001714650003001734650001201764650001801776650002301794650001601817650002301833650003301856650003301889650001301922650001001935650002801945650003401973650004802007650003302055650001802088650003002106650003802136650002402174650002702198650001202225650002402237653001602261653001502277653002802292653001902320653002602339653002102365653002802386700001702414700001502431700001402446700001902460773014302479852000902622856008302631930003302714945001302747946001302760655001202773IND2047653920221207134854.0950908e19950815dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204765392DNAL7 a76445352pmid7 aPMC412822pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.17.80412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJongsma, M.A.10aAdaptation of Spodoptera exigua larvae to plant proteinase inhibitors by induction of gut proteinase activity insensitive to inhibition  ap. 8041-8045.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTobacco plants were transformed with a cDNA clone of chymotrypsin/trypsin-specific potato proteinase inhibitor II (PI2) under the control of a constitutive promoter. Although considerable levels of transgene expression could be demonstrated, the growth of Spodoptera exigua larvae fed with detached leaves of PI2-expressing plants was not affected. Analysis of the composition of tryptic gut activity demonstrated that only 18% of the proteinase activity of insects reared on these transgenic plants was sensitive to inhibition by PI2, whereas 78% was sensitive in insects reared on control plants. Larvae had compensated for this loss of tryptic activity by a 2.5-fold induction of new activity that was insensitive to inhibition by PI2. PI2-insensitive proteolytic activity was also induced in response to endogenous proteinase inhibitors of tobacco; therefore, induction of such proteinase activity may represent the mechanism by which insects that feed on plants overcome plant proteinase inhibitor defense.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atrypsin 3afood plants 3acomplementary DNA 3atrypsin inhibitors 3aSpodoptera exigua 3atransgenic plants 3aproteolysis 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aNicotiana tabacum 3anucleotide sequences 3alarvae 3aenzyme activity 2aAdaptation, Physiological 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Complementary 2aDigestive Systemxenzymology 2aEndopeptidasesxbiosynthesis 2aKinetics 2aLarva 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Physiological Phenomena 2aPlant Proteinsxbiosynthesisxpharmacology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aProtease Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSpodopteraxphysiology 2aTobacco 2aTrypsinxmetabolism 0aproteinases 0aadaptation 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/l37519 0aproteinase inhibitors 0adigestive system 0achymotrypsin inhibitors1 aBakker, P.L.1 aPeters, J.1 aBosch, D.1 aStiekema, W.J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g1995 Aug. 15, v. 92, no. 17 p.8041-8045x0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.92.17.80413Available from publisher's Web site  a19951002b19951006c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02072naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111024003300131040001800164100001400182245007300196300001800269500001500287506007600302520069700378506003701075650002601112650002201138650004901160650001801209650001001227653001901237653001801256700001401274700002501288700001701313700001401330773014301344852000901487856008301496930003301579945001301612946001301625655001201638IND2047652920221207134844.0950908e19950815dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204765292DNAL7 a116075722pmid7 aPMC412312pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.92.17.77892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, S.10aLight-generated nuclear quantum beats: a signature of photosynthesis  ap. 7789-7793.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLight-induced radical pairs in deuterated and deuterated plus 15N-substituted Synechococcus lividus cyanobacteria have been studied by transient EPR following pulsed laser excitation.

Fasting plasma vitamin A and E status of 857 Lebanese adults residing in Dar Al-Fatwa, Beirut were assessed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mean retinol and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were 59.8 ± 29 µg/dL and 1.0 ± 0.5 mg/dL, respectively in which only 0.2% were retinol-deficient, while 0.7% were alpha-tocopherol-deficient. Vitamin A and E correlated positively with plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides. Vitamin E, but not vitamin A, correlated positively with blood pressure and glucose. A good status of vitamins A and E was found among the studied Lebanese sample and the elevation in vitamin A and E levels was associated with unfavorable lipid profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahuman nutrition 3anutritional status 3avitamin A 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aadults 3avitamin deficiencies 3ablood lipids 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3atriacylglycerols 3ablood pressure 3ablood glucose 3abiomarkers 3arisk factors 3ahuman diseases 3acardiovascular diseases 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Mass Index 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aFasting 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Status 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aUrban Population 2aVitamin Axblood 2aVitamin A Deficiencyxepidemiology 2aVitamin Exblood 2aVitamin E Deficiencyxepidemiology 2aalpha-Tocopherolxblood 3aLebanon 0aLebanonxepidemiology.1 aAl-Ghali, Rola M.1 aAl-Ghali, Rola M.1 aHwalla, Nahla0 tInternational journal for vitamin and nutrition research.g2006 Jan. 1, v. 76, no. 1 p.3-8dVerlag Hans Huberx0300-98317nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1024/0300-9831.76.1.33Available from publisher's Web site  a20060726b20060804c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/12  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03704naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144100001400153245013300167300001400300500002400314500001500338520200800353650001602361650002102377650001502398650001902413650002902432650001502461650001002476650001802486650001702504650001402521650001502535650002002550650001802570650002202588650002402610650001902634650001102653650001602664650003502680650002202715651001002737653003002747700001402777700001402791700001602805700001702821773011102838852000902949856007502958930003303033945002503066946001103091655001203102IND4415749820221122005131.0090130e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441574982DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.8852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aX6201 aLi, X.-Y.10aImpact of land use and land cover change on environmental degradation in lake Qinghai watershed, northeast Qinghai-Tibet Plateau  ap. 69-83.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLake Qinghai, the largest saline lake in China, covers 4234 km² (2007) with a catchment area of 29 660 km² on the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The ecosystem of the lake is extremely vulnerable and sensitive to global climate change and human interference. However, little information is available on land use/cover change (LUCC) in Lake Qinghai watershed. Using a geographical information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), this study analysed land use and land cover change pattern in Lake Qinghai watershed between 1977 and 2004 and discussed major environmental issues in this area. LUCC analysis indicated that grassland (63 per cent) and water body (18 per cent) dominated in the watershed and the magnitude of the land use and land cover change was generally low; the percentage of the change of various land types relative to the total area was less than 1 per cent. From 1977 to 2004, cropland, sandy land, bare rock, salinized land, swampland and built-up areas increased by 0·43, 0·35, 0·24, 0·06, 0·03 and 0·03 per cent of the total area, respectively; in contrast, water body, grassland and woodland decreased by 0·99, 0·22 and 0·05 per cent, respectively. Moreover, the area of LUCC tended to expand from places around the lake to the upper reaches of the watershed during the last three decades. The LUCC transition pattern was: woodland converted to grassland, grassland converted to cropland and water body converted to sandy land. Lake level decline and grassland degradation are major ecological and environmental problems in Lake Qinghai watershed. The level and area of the lake decreased at the rate of 6·7 cm a⁻¹ and 6·4 km² a⁻¹, respectively, between 1959 and 2007, resulting in sandy land expansion and water quality deterioration. Lake level decline and area shrinkage was mainly attributed to climate change, but grassland degradation was mainly resulted from anthropogenic activities (increasing population, overgrazing and policy). 3asandy soils 3avegetation cover 3awatersheds 3aremote sensing 3aanthropogenic activities 3agrasslands 3alakes 3athematic maps 3asaline water 3awoodlands 3aecosystems 3aland use change 3awater quality 3aagricultural land 3asurface water level 3aclimate change 3aswamps 3aovergrazing 3ageographic information systems 3asoil salinization 3aChina 0aenvironmental degradation1 aMa, Y.-J.1 aXu, H.-Y.1 aWang, J.-H.1 aZhang, D.-S.0 tLand degradation & development.g2009 Jan., v. 20, no. 1 p.69-83dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1085-32787nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.8853Available from publisher's Web site  a20110710b20110805c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/02/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02088naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145100002300154245008400177300001600261500002400277520094300301650001601244650001101260650001601271650001701287650002501304650001501329650001301344653002301357653001201380700002201392773012501414852000901539856008501548930003301633945002501666946001101691655001201702IND4415713720221122005053.0090130e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441571372DNAL7 a10.1007/s10295-008-0492-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX3001 aFrengova, Ginka I.10aCarotenoids from Rhodotorula and Phaffia: yeasts of biotechnological importance  ap. 163-180.  aIncludes references  aCarotenoids represent a group of valuable molecules for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food and feed industries, not only because they can act as vitamin A precursors, but also for their coloring, antioxidant and possible tumor-inhibiting activity. Animals cannot synthesize carotenoids, and these pigments must therefore be added to the feeds of farmed species. The synthesis of different natural commercially important carotenoids (β-carotene, torulene, torularhodin and astaxanthin) by several yeast species belonging to the genera Rhodotorula and Phaffia has led to consider these microorganisms as a potential pigment sources. In this review, we discuss the biosynthesis, factors affecting carotenogenesis in Rhodotorula and Phaffia strains, strategies for improving the production properties of the strains and directions for potential utility of carotenoid-synthesizing yeast as a alternative source of natural carotenoid pigments. 3aRhodotorula 3ayeasts 3acarotenoids 3abiosynthesis 3abiochemical pathways 3ametal ions 3asolvents 0aliterature reviews 0aPhaffia1 aBeshkova, Dora M.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g2009 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.163-180dSpringer-Verlagx1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-008-0492-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20090503b20090608c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/05/03  aNon-US 7aarticle04104naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163072000900172100002300181245017300204300001400377500002400391520235900415650002802774650001502802650002202817650002802839650001902867650002802886650002502914650002002939650002102959650001602980650002002996650002703016650002203043650001603065650002103081650001403102650002903116650001103145650002103156650001603177650002603193651001103219700001203230700001703242773009203259852000903351856008503360930003303445945002503478946001103503655001203514IND4415600420221121233414.0090130e20090315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441560042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2008.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF822 0aF600 0aB200 0aX1001 aTimmermans, B.G.H.14aThe development, validation and application of a crop growth model to assess the potential of Solanum sisymbriifolium as a trap crop for potato cyst nematodes in Europe  ap. 22-31.  aIncludes references  aSolanum sisymbriifolium (Lam.), a plant that was introduced as a trap crop for potato cyst nematodes, shows strong temperature limitation of its growth. Previous research indicated that the crop needs to accumulate at least 700gm⁻² dry matter to achieve sufficient nematode control. In that context, three functionally different geographical zones can be distinguished: (i) a zone with insufficient growth, independent of sowing time, (ii) a zone with potentially sufficient growth if the crop is allowed to grow for the whole growing season, and (iii) a zone with sufficient growth early or late in the growing season, opening the option to combine cultivation of the trap crop with another crop in the same year. The aim of the current research was to delimit these zones for western and central Europe, by developing a model enabling simulation of the potential growth of S. sisymbriifolium in 64 locations between Scandinavia and Spain and between the UK and Hungary. A LINTUL type crop growth model for potential growth was adapted to S. sisymbriifolium. Adaptations regarded particularly the relative growth rate of the leaf area, the specific leaf area, and the radiation use efficiency, that were made temperature dependent using experimental data. Furthermore, the leaf death rates were modelled as limited by light availability in the canopy. The model was calibrated with field data from an experiment in 2002, and validated on field experiments in 2001, 2003 and 2004, resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 118.1gm⁻² crop dry matter and a mean deviation (MD) of -15.9gm⁻² for the validation data. Simulations were done for the 64 sites, using weather data from 1996 to 1999, and the studied area was divided in the three zones (i, ii and iii) as described above. In all regions the crop could reach the required minimum size, although barely so in Scandinavia and the north of the United Kingdom. Zone (ii) included the south of the United Kingdom and Sweden, The Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and the north of France. Zone (iii) included the rest of France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Hungary; here temperature and radiation suffice for the crop to reach its required minimum size in only part of the growing season, leaving space for an other (main) crop in the same season, at least in the absence of water limitations. 3aSolanum sisymbriifolium 3atrap crops 3aGlobodera pallida 3aGlobodera rostochiensis 3acyst nematodes 3adry matter accumulation 3aagroecological zones 3aair temperature 3anematode control 3asowing date 3acrop management 3ageographical variation 3asimulation models 3acrop models 3aplant adaptation 3aleaf area 3aradiation use efficiency 3acanopy 3amodel validation 3acalibration 3afield experimentation 3aEurope1 aVos, J.1 aStomph, T.J.0 tField crops research.g2009 Mar. 15, v. 111, no. 1-2 p.22-31dElsevierx0378-42907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2008.10.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/24  aNon-US 7aarticle02647naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147100001500156245008400171300001600255500002400271500001500295520140800310650001501718650001501733650001301748650001801761650002701779650002201806651001001828653001701838653003001855700001701885700001701902700001601919700001601935773009701951852000902048856008702057930003302144945002502177946001102202655001202213IND4415598720140725000000.0090130e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441559872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2008.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aGómez, S.10aIdentification of the hydraulic conductivity using a global optimization method  ap. 504-510.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA method to determine the soil hydraulic conductivity via an internal drainage experiment is presented. Identifying the parameters of the hydraulic conductivity is achieved by solving an inverse global optimization problem that uses the water contents measured at different depths and times as matching flow variables. The optimization procedure is combined with a recently developed analytical model for the water content propagation, which essentially assumes that the flow is gravity-driven. A crucial (from the identification point of view) parameter of such a model is the initial position [formula removed] of the draining front, determining the interface between the wetted and dried zone. By using an evolutionary algorithm specifically developed for this problem, it is shown that if information upon [formula removed] is not a priori available, the identification of the hydraulic conductivity is not possible. However, assuming that [formula removed] is known (i.e. measured), and by dividing the model variables by [formula removed], the optimization is able to fully identify the soil hydraulic conductivity. Finally, in order to show the robustness of the proposed approach, it is shown that the method leads to very good estimates of the hydraulic conductivity even if data are noise-affected, provided that the optimization procedure is coupled to the (Tikhonov) regularization approach. 3aestimation 3asoil depth 3adrainage 3awetting front 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydrologic models 3aItaly 0aoptimization 0asoil hydraulic properties1 aSeverino, G.1 aRandazzo, L.1 aToraldo, G.1 aOtero, J.M.0 tAgricultural water management.g2009 Mar., v. 96, no. 3 p.504-510dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.09.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20090211b20090301c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/02/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02764naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165100002500174245009700199300001600296500002400312500001500336520139100351650001101742650001601753650002201769650002901791650001801820650001701838650002601855650001701881650001601898650001601914651001401930653002101944700001601965700002101981700001802002773009702020852000902117856008702126930003302213945002502246946001102271655001202282IND4415598620221121233453.0090130e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441559862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2008.09.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ200 0aP200 0aP2101 aK̲h̲ān, Shahbāz.10aWater markets and soil salinity nexus: Can minimum irrigation intensities address the issue?  ap. 493-503.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAgricultural water markets can facilitate adjustments to water scarcity and competition and enhance economic efficiency, but markets cannot automatically balance efficiency, equity and environmental sustainability goals. The consequences of water trading on soil salinity in irrigation areas are not yet fully understood, but recognized as an issue that needs to be analysed. This paper explores the nexus between water trading and groundwater-induced soil salinity in a selected irrigated area in the Murray-Darling Basin. Results show that minimum irrigation intensities must be met to flush salts out of the root zone especially in shallow water table/high salinity impact areas. Such minimum irrigation intensities are helpful but not necessarily in deep water table/low salinity impact areas. Should water markets lead to permanent water transfers out of mature irrigation areas, minimum irrigation intensity needs might not be met in high salinity impact areas, causing substantial negative impacts on resource quality and agricultural productivity. Water trading that adds to salinity cannot be economically viable in the long run. The tradeoffs between water trading and environmental and equity goals need to be determined. This work contributes to the wider debate on Australian water policy aimed at achieving water security through water trading in the Murray-Darling Basin. 3abasins 3arhizosphere 3aeconomic analysis 3aenvironmental management 3asoil salinity 3asaline water 3airrigation management 3awater policy 3agroundwater 3awater table 3aAustralia 0awater management1 aRana, Tariq1 aHanjra, Munir A.1 aZirilli, John0 tAgricultural water management.g2009 Mar., v. 96, no. 3 p.493-503dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2008.09.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20090211b20090301c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/02/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03675naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001600184245007800200300001600278500002400294500001500318520188600333650002002219650002602239650001702265650002102282650001502303650002602318650001702344650001802361650001302379650001702392650001802409650003002427650002002457650002302477650002602500650001902526650001302545650002702558650001902585650002202604651001002626653002602636700002302662700001402685700001202699700001902711700001602730700001702746773009602763852000902859856008802868930003302956945002502989946001103014655001203025IND4415602220140725000000.0090130e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441560222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ500 0aJ700 0aJ2001 aBastida, F.10aRole of amendments on N cycling in Mediterranean abandoned semiarid soils  ap. 195-205.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSoils found in semiarid areas of the Mediterranean Basin are particularly prone to degradation due to adverse climatic conditions with annual rainfall <300mm and high temperatures being responsible for the scant vegetal growth and the consequent lack of organic matter. A three-year field experiment was conducted to test the potential of two organic amendments (sludge and compost) to improve soil quality and plant growth in a semiarid degraded Mediterranean ecosystem. Since little is known about N dynamics in such assisted ecosystems, we investigated the effects of this practice on key processes of the global N cycle. Besides soil chemical and biological parameters and vegetation cover, we measured absolute and specific potential nitrification and denitrification rates and quantified the size of the ammonia oxidising and denitrifying bacterial populations via quantitative PCR (amoA and nirS genes). At the end of the experiment soil fertility, microbial activity and plant growth had improved in treated plots. Amendments increased the amount of ammonia oxidisers and denitrifiers in soil, but the relative proportion of these groups varied in relation to the total microbial community, being higher in the case of ammonia oxidisers but not in the case of denitrifiers. As a consequence, significantly higher potential nitrification and denitrification rates were measured on a global basis in amended soils. Yet specific activities (potential rate/gene copy numbers) were lower for ammonia oxidisers in amended soils and for denitrifiers in sludge treated soils than those observed in control plots. Organic amendments influenced resource availability, the size and the activity patterns of microbial populations involved in long-term N dynamics. Therefore N cycling processes may play a key role to assist sustainable restoration practices in semiarid degraded areas. 3asoil amendments 3afield experimentation 3asoil ecology 3aland restoration 3aecosystems 3adenitrifying bacteria 3aplant growth 3asoil bacteria 3acomposts 3asoil quality 3anitrification 3apolymerase chain reaction 3adenitrification 3amicrobial activity 3aMediterranean climate 3asoil nutrients 3anitrogen 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asemiarid soils 3aNitrosomonadaceae 3aSpain 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aPérez-de-Mora, A.1 aBabic, K.1 aHai, B.1 aHernández, T.1 aGarcía, C.1 aSchloter, M.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2009 Feb., v. 41, no. 2 p.195-205dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2008.10.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090217b20090301c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/02/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02635naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245015300155300001400308500002400322520140300346650001901749650002801768650001501796650001501811650002301826650001401849650001001863650002801873650001101901650001601912650002901928650002801957650001201985650001401997700002402011700002002035773008602055852000902141856007502150655001202225IND4464084220221121200711.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408422DNAL7 a10.1071/FP021232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAble, Amanda J.10aProduction of reactive oxygen species during non-specific elicitation, non-host resistance and field resistance expression in cultured tobacco cells  ap. 91-99.  aIncludes references  aWe examined production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induction of cell death in tissue-cultured tobacco cells undergoing different disease resistance responses. A superoxide-dependent hypersensitive response occurs during both the race-specific resistance response of tobacco cells challenged with incompatible zoospores of Phytophthora nicotianae and during non-specific elicitation of tobacco cells challenged with Phytophthora glucan elicitors extracted from the fungal cell wall. Inhibition studies are consistent with dependence upon endogenous Ca2+ levels, and with involvement of NAD(P)H oxidase and peroxidases in production of ROS during both specific and non-specific elicitation. The patterns of resistance expression during non-host resistance or field resistance responses appear to be similar to race-specific resistance expression with regard to the timing and order of events. However, the intensity of the response is very much reduced. In contrast, during non-specific elicitation, these temporal patterns are significantly altered. The differences in timing, intensity and extent of responses during different modes of disease resistance expression indicate that stimulation of cultured plant cells with non-specific soluble fractions in order to model in planta events during plant / Oomycete and, by implication, plant / fungal interactions, has significant limitations. 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aPhytophthora nicotianae 3acell death 3acell walls 3adisease resistance 3aelicitors 3afungi 3ahypersensitive response 3amodels 3aperoxidases 3aplant cultural practices 3areactive oxygen species 3atobacco 3azoospores1 aSutherland, Mark W.1 aGuest, David I.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2003, v. 30, no. 1 p.91-99dCSIRO Pubx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP021233Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02636naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245019800157300001600355500002400371520129200395650002301687650001901710650001701729650001201746650001101758650001101769650003601780650001101816650001101827650001901838650002001857650001901877650002801896650002201924700002001946700002201966700002001988700002202008773008802030852000902118856007502127655001202202IND4464084320221121200753.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408432DNAL7 a10.1071/FP021442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKornyeyev, Dmytro10aElevated chloroplastic glutathione reductase activities decrease chilling-induced photoinhibition by increasing rates of photochemistry, but not thermal energy dissipation, in transgenic cotton  ap. 101-110.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of the overproduction of glutathione reductase (GR+) in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. Coker 312) chloroplasts on the response of photosynthetic parameters to chilling in the light was examined. After 180 min at 10°C and 500 μmol photons m–2 s–1 in the chamber of an oxygen electrode, leaf discs of GR+ plants exhibited lower levels of sustained PSII photoinhibition than leaf discs of wild-type plants. No genotypic differences in thermal energy dissipation, leaf pigment composition, or the dynamics of xanthophyll cycle de-epoxidation were observed. The rate of induction and steady-state levels of photochemistry were greater for GR+ in comparison to wild-type plants. Enhanced photochemistry in GR+ plants could not be attributed to higher rates of CO2 assimilation at 10°C. Although GR overproduction afforded some increased protection against PSI photoinactivation, suggesting improved scavenging of reactive oxygen species, higher PSI activities could not completely explain the greater rates of photochemistry. Pools of glutathione and ascorbate were significantly more reduced in GR+ plants. Increased demand for reducing power to maintain these constituents in the reduced state may contribute to the higher rates of photochemistry observed in GR+ plants. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3acarbon dioxide 3achloroplasts 3acooling 3acotton 3aenergy 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aleaves 3aoxygen 3aphotochemistry 3aphotoinhibition 3aphotosystem II 3areactive oxygen species 3atransgenic plants1 aLogan, Barry A.1 aPayton, Paxton R.1 aAllen, Randy D.1 aHoladay, A.

Benn. ex D. Don) de Laub.], which has an indeterminate growth habit. In a 2-year experiment, P. ferruginea seedlings were supplied with nutrient solutions consisting of two different concentrations of nitrogen (5 and 0.5 mM) and phosphorus (1.33 and 0.133 mM) in the first year, and two concentrations (5 and 0.5 mM) of a 15N-labelled nitrogen solution in the second year. Growth and nitrogen content of new foliage were shown to be largely dependent on seedling nitrogen status at the end of the first year, and only weakly dependent on nutrient supply in the second. An average of 70% of total nitrogen in new foliage was remobilised from storage in the first 63 d after flushing began. The remainder of new-foliage nitrogen was derived by root uptake from the nutrient supply in the second year. There was some response of nitrogen uptake to high nitrogen supply in the second year where seedlings had been nitrogen deficient at the end of the first year. However, it was concluded that the indeterminate growth habit of P. ferruginea did not distinguish its pattern of nitrogen storage and remobilisation from that of determinate conifers. 3aconifers 3aindeterminate growth 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3aseedlings1 aMillard, Peter1 aRogers, Graeme N.D.1 aWhitehead, David0 tFunctional plant biology.g2003, v. 30, no. 1 p.49-55dCSIRO Pubx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP021543Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03427naa a2200805 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100002400196245013800220300001800358500002400376500001500400520089200415650001701307650001501324650001501339650001101354650001201365650001901377650002801396650004201424650001501466650002901481650001201510650002301522650001301545650002901558650002001587650002801607650001201635650001701647650001501664650003501679650003701714650002401751650001701775650002801792650001701820650002301837650006101860650003701921650010201958650001702060650002302077653001102100653002002111653001702131653002602148653002902174653003302203653002102236700002002257700002202277700002002299700002202319773009802341852000902439856009002448930003302538945002502571946001302596655001202609IND4415603820221121164910.0090130e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441560382DNAL7 a191289602pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.11.0472doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aP120 0aX3501 aMatsushika, Akinori10aBioethanol production performance of five recombinant strains of laboratory and industrial xylose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 2392-2398.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this study, five recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were compared for their xylose-fermenting ability. The most efficient xylose-to-ethanol fermentation was found by using the industrial strain MA-R4, in which the genes for xylose reductase and xylitol dehydrogenase from Pichia stipitis along with an endogenous xylulokinase gene were expressed by chromosomal integration of the flocculent yeast strain IR-2. The MA-R4 strain rapidly converted xylose to ethanol with a low xylitol yield. Furthermore, the MA-R4 strain had the highest ethanol production when fermenting not only a mixture of glucose and xylose, but also mixed sugars in the detoxified hydrolysate of wood chips. These results collectively suggest that MA-R4 may be a suitable recombinant strain for further study into large-scale ethanol production from mixed sugars present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. 3afermentation 3atransgenes 3aEucalyptus 3axylose 3aglucose 3alignocellulose 3aindustrial microbiology 3agenetically engineered microorganisms 3awood chips 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3axylitol 3aethanol production 3abiofuels 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3aenzyme activity 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3aethanol 3ahydrolysates 2aAerobiosis 2aAldehyde Reductasexmetabolism 2aD-Xylulose Reductasexmetabolism 2aEthanolxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aLaboratories 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aPhosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)xmetabolism 2aRecombination, Geneticxgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTime Factors 2aXylosexmetabolism 0asugars 0aPichia stipitis 0axylulokinase 0axylitol dehydrogenase 0arenewable energy sources 0alignocellulosic hydrolysates 0axylose reductase1 aInoue, Hiroyuki1 aMurakami, Katsuji1 aTakimura, Osamu1 aSawayama, Shigeki0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Apr., v. 100, no. 8 p.2392-2398dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.11.0473Available from publisher's Web site  a20090202b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle02729naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245011400155300001800269500002400287520157000311650002301881650001401904650001401918650003101932650001601963650001101979650000901990650001901999650001702018650001302035650001002048650001502058650002102073651001102094700001802105700002102123773009102144852000902235856007502244655001202319IND4464086020221121164948.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408602DNAL7 a10.1071/FP031052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuilioni, Lydie10aHigh temperature and water deficit may reduce seed number in field pea purely by decreasing plant growth rate  ap. 1151-1164.  aIncludes references  aSeed number, the most variable yield component of legumes is strongly affected by heat stress (HS) and water deficit (WD). The objective of this paper is to investigate whether HS and WD reduced seed number in field pea through their negative effects on biomass production rather than by specific effects on the developing reproductive organs. Several field and glasshouse experiments were carried out in southern France, in which HS and / or WD of various intensities, durations and positions in the plant lifecycle were imposed on several pea cultivars. WD and HS reduced seed number, in an intensity-dependent manner. They also changed the distribution of seeds along the stem. Plants subjected to WD and mild HS had more seeds on the basal phytomers than did control plants, making it possible to exclude direct effects of stress on seed development. In contrast, severe HS resulted in the immediate abortion of reproductive organs. WD and HS also decreased net photosynthesis (P(n)), but only during the period of constraint. Quantitative relationships between P(n) and soil water status and between P(n) and leaf temperature were established. Nevertheless, in all cases there was a single linear relationship between final seed number and plant growth rate during the critical period for seed set (from the beginning of flowering to the beginning of seed fill for the last seed-bearing phytomer). This reflects the reproductive plasticity of pea, which adjusts the number of reproductive sinks in an apparent balance with assimilate availability in the plant. 3abiomass production 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aheat stress 3aleaves 3apeas 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3aseed set 3aseeds 3asoil water 3ayield components 3aFrance1 aWery, Jacques1 aLecoeur, Jeremie0 tFunctional plant biology.g2003, v. 30, no. 11 p.1151-1164dCSIRO Pubx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP031053Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02213naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001500168245008300183300001800266500002400284520102300308650001401331650001301345650002501358650002001383650001301403650001301416650001801429653003101447700002201478700001901500700001601519773009801535852000901633856009001642930003301732945002501765946001301790655001201803IND4415604720140725000000.0090130e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441560472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2008.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP120 0aW0001 aBodík, I.10aBiodiesel waste as source of organic carbon for municipal WWTP denitrification  ap. 2452-2456.  aIncludes references  aThis paper presents the results of experiments to test biodiesel waste (glycerine - g-phase) as an organic carbon source for the removal of nitrate in a WWTP denitrification process. Investigation of g-phase was first centered on g-phase utilization as an external source for denitrification under laboratory conditions and consequently, after positive results from the laboratory investigation, g-phase was applied in the denitrification process in the WWTP Vrútky (35,000 PE). This WWTP had insufficient nitrogen removal via denitrification. Denitrification was insufficient due to an influent with a low BOD₅/N ratio (1.7:1) entering into the activated sludge tank. Laboratory experiments and calculations showed that, to reach Ntotal concentration under 10 mgl⁻¹ in effluent, a biodiesel waste dose of 500kgCOD d⁻¹ was necessary. Glycerol phase (g-phase) dosing into the denitrification tank increased denitrification efficiency by [formula removed] per 100l of g-phase dose into the denitrification tank. 3abiodiesel 3aglycerol 3awastewater treatment 3adenitrification 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrification 0awastewater treatment plant1 aBlšťáková, A.1 aSedláček, S.1 aHutňan, M.0 tBioresource technology.g2009 Apr., v. 100, no. 8 p.2452-2456dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2008.11.0503Available from publisher's Web site  a20090202b20090301c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/02/02  aOther US 7aarticle02411naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245011700156300001600273500002400289500001500313520126800328650002301596650002401619650001201643650002301655650001101678650001901689650001501708650001301723650001701736650001601753650001501769653001101784700002401795700002201819773008801841852000901929856007501938655001202013IND4464086820221121164851.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408682DNAL7 a10.1071/FP020852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrull, Evelyn S.10aImportance of mechanisms and processes of the stabilisation of soil organic matter for modelling carbon turnover  ap. 207-222.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThis paper reviews current knowledge of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics with respect to physical protection, soil moisture and temperature, and recalcitrant carbon fractions (such as charcoal) in predominantly agricultural soils. These factors are discussed within the framework of current soil organic matter models. The importance of soil structure in the stabilisation of organic residues through physical protection has been documented previously in various studies. In addition, changes in soil structure associated with tillage can significantly affect soil organic matter decomposition rates. The concept of physical protection has been incorporated into several soil carbon models as a function of soil texture. While soil texture can affect the soil's capacity for aggregation and adsorption, factors such as soil moisture and temperature may further enhance or reduce the extent of physical protection. While adsorption and aggregation can slow decomposition processes, it is unlikely that these processes are solely responsible for the high mean residence times measured in biologically active surface soils. Accordingly, chemical recalcitrance appears to be the only mechanism by which soil organic carbon can be protected for long periods of time. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3atillage 3asoil stabilization 3amodels 3asoil structure 3asoil water 3acharcoal 3asoil texture 3atemperature 3aadsorption 0acarbon1 aBaldock, Jeffrey A.1 aSkjemstad, Jan O.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2003, v. 30, no. 2 p.207-222dCSIRO Pubx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP020853Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02522naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245013500158300001800293500002400311520153900335650002201874650002101896650001201917650001001929650001801939700002301957700002501980700002802005773009102033852000902124856007502133655001202208IND4464086120221121164853.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408612DNAL7 a10.1071/FP030872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarnett, Trevor P.10aKinetics of ammonium and nitrate uptake by eucalypt roots and associated proton fluxes measured using ion selective microelecrodes  ap. 1165-1176.  aIncludes references  aIon-selective microelectrodes were used non-invasively to measure the concentration dependence of NH4+ and NO3– fluxes around the roots of intact solution-cultured Eucalyptus nitens (Deane & Maiden) Maiden. In addition, NH4+ and H+ fluxes were measured simultaneously at a range of NH4+ concentrations, and NO3– and H+ fluxes were measured simultaneously at a range of NO3– concentrations. Nitrogen concentrations ranged from 10–250 μM, i.e. in the range corresponding to the high affinity transport system (HATS). Both NH4+ and NO3– fluxes exhibited saturating Michaelis–Menten-style kinetics. The Km was 16 μM for NH4+ and 18 μM for NO3–. Values of V(max) were 53 nmol m–2 s–1 for NH4+ and 37 nmol m–2 s–1 for NO3–. Proton fluxes were highly correlated with NH4+ and NO3– fluxes, but the relationships were different. Proton efflux increased with increasing NH4+ concentration and mirrored the changing NH4+ fluxes. The ratio between NH4+ and H+ fluxes was 1 : –1.6. Proton influx was evident with initial exposure to NO3–, with the flux stoichiometry for NO3– : H+ being 1 : 1.4. Subsequent increases in NO3– concentration caused a gradual increase in H+ efflux such that the flux stoichiometry for NO3– : H+ became 1 : –0.8. The presence of 100 μM NH4+ greatly reduced NO3– fluxes and caused a large and constant H+ efflux. These results are evidence that E. nitens has a preference for NH4+ as a source of N, and that the fluxes of NH4+ and NO3– are quantitatively linked to H+ flux. 3aEucalyptus nitens 3anitrogen content 3aprotons 3aroots 3astoichiometry1 aShabala, Sergey N.1 aSmethurst, Philip J.1 aNewman, I.

The lipophilized products were identified using ESI-MS. Free radical scavenging activity was determined using the DPPH radical method. The polarity of the solvents proved important in determining the radical scavenging activity of the substrates. Ferulic acid showed much higher radical scavenging activity than cinnamic acid, which has limited activity. The esterification of cinnamic acid and ferulic acid with triolein resulted in significant increase and decrease in the radical scavenging activity, respectively. These opposite effects were due to the effect of addition of electron-donating alkyl groups on the predominant mechanism of reaction (hydrogen atom transfer or electron transfer) of a species with DPPH. The effect of esterification of cinnamic acid was confirmed using ethyl cinnamate which greatly enhances the radical scavenging activity. Although, compared to the lipophilized cinnamic acid product, the activity was lower. The radical scavenging activity of the main component isolated from lipophilized cinnamic acid product using solid phase extraction, monocinnamoyl dioleoyl glycerol, was as good as the unseparated mixture of lipophilized product. Based on the ratio of a substrate to DPPH concentration, lipophilized ferulic acid was a much more efficient radical scavenger than lipophilized cinnamic acid. 3atransesterification 3acinnamic acid 3afree radical scavengers 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3ahuman health 3atriolein 3astructure-activity relationships 3ahuman nutrition 3aantioxidant activity 3aferulic acid 2aAntioxidants 2aCatalysis 2aCinnamatesxchemistry 2aCoumaric Acidsxchemistry 2aEnzymes, Immobilizedxmetabolism 2aEsterification 2aFree Radical Scavengersxpharmacology 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aTrioleinxchemistryxmetabolism. 0aphenolic acids 0alipophilization1 aBirch, Edward John0 tLipids.g2009 Feb., v. 44, no. 2 p.145-152dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-008-3242-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090324b20090508c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/03/24  aOther US 7aarticle03221naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245016900158300001800327500002400345520163100369650004302000650002802043650001502071650001302086650002502099650002602124650001302150650002102163650001002184650002202194650001402216650001102230650002002241650001202261650001502273650001402288650001202302650001202314650001602326650001302342700002102355700002202376700001902398700002102417700002002438700002202458700002402480773009102504852000902595856007502604655001202679IND4464085620221121130719.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408562DNAL7 a10.1071/FP031212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantangelo, Enrico14aThe Cf-2 / Rcr3(esc) gene interaction in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) induces autonecrosis and triggers biochemical markers of oxidative burst at cellular level  ap. 1117-1125.  aIncludes references  aA tomato plant (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) with necrotic leaf spots mimicking disease lesions was singled out in progeny under selection in Moscow (breeding material of Ignatova Svetlana). The progeny from spontaneous selfing of such a plant (V20368), in the presence of increasing temperature and high light intensity, exhibited spontaneous necrotic lesions on the leaves, with acropetal progression (autonecrosis). A similar phenotype, described in 1948 by Langford, appeared to be associated with the Cf-2 resistance gene, introgressed from L. pimpinellifolium. Recently, Kruger et al. (2002) demonstrated that the Cf-2 effect depends on a second gene (Rcr3pim) encoding a cysteine protease, and that autonecrosis is activated by the contemporary presence of Cf-2 and the L. esculentum allele Rcr3(esc). In this work we characterised the V20368 mutant and verified that autonecrosis is caused by the presence of an interaction between Cf-2 and Rcr3(esc). When the environmental conditions are favourable, this interaction triggers an oxidative burst, as evidenced by a strong increase in H2O2 production and activities of catalase (EC 1.11.1.6), peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7) and ATPase (EC 3.6.1.3). In addition, by grafting the necrotic mutant on the cv. Riogrande and vice versa, we proved that the necrotic phenotype is not associated with the movement of a signal molecule, since the autonecrosis was not transmitted across the grafting point. Finally, the interaction between Cf-2 and Rcr3(esc) appeared to lower the threshold of stress perception, as evidenced by an increased sensitivity to the insecticide Fenthion. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3acysteine proteinases 3aenvironmental factors 3afenthion 3agene interaction 3agenes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaf spot 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amutants 3aperoxidase 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3aselfing 3atemperature 3atomatoes1 aFonzo, Valentina1 aAstolfi, Stefania1 aZuchi, Sabrina1 aCaccia, Riccardo1 aMosconi, Pietro1 aMazzucato, Andrea1 aSoressi, Gian Piero0 tFunctional plant biology.g2003, v. 30, no. 11 p.1117-1125dCSIRO Pubx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP031213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01746naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100001900135245013800154300001800292500002400310520086700334650002001201650001101221650002401232650001001256700002701266773009101293852000901384856007501393655001201468IND4464085020221121130640.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408502DNAL7 a10.1071/FP031472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBritto, Dev T.10aTrans-stimulation of 13NH4+ efflux provides evidence for the cytosolic origin of tracer in the compartmental analysis of barley roots  ap. 1233-1238.  aIncludes references  aThe analysis of tracer efflux kinetics is fundamental to membrane transport studies, but requires the rigorous identification of subcellular tracer sources. We present a solution to this problem through the analysis of sharp increases in 13NH4+ efflux from roots of radiolabelled barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings, in response to a 100-fold increase in external [NH4+]. By comparing these trans-stimulation data with a mathematical model incorporating changes in subcellular NH4+ fluxes and pool sizes, we show that the cytosol of root cells is the origin of the tracer efflux. Our analysis provides new insight into the rapidly occurring events underlying compensatory flux regulation during transitions from one nutritional steady state to another, and confirms the validity of compartmental analysis by tracer efflux (CATE) in this important model system. 3aHordeum vulgare 3abarley 3amathematical models 3aroots1 aKronzucker, Herbert J.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2003, v. 30, no. 12 p.1233-1238dCSIRO Pubx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP031473Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02820naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002800135245013300163300001800296500002400314520152800338650002101866650002301887650001901910650002501929650001601954650001401970650002001984650003102004650001002035650002102045650001402066650001602080650002202096650001302118650002202131650002202153700001602175700002002191773009102211852000902302856007502311655001202386IND4464085520221121130621.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408552DNAL7 a10.1071/FP030662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayasankar, Subramanian10aConstitutive expression of Vitis vinifera thaumatin-like protein after in vitro selection and its role in anthracnose resistance  ap. 1105-1115.  aIncludes references  aAnthracnose-resistant grapevine (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Chardonnay) plants were regenerated from embryogenic cultures that had been subjected to in vitro selection with culture filtrate of Elsinoe ampelina (de Bary) Shear. Three secreted proteins differentially expressed by in vitro-selected embryogenic cultures and regenerated plants were identified. An 8-kDa protein was identified as a lipid-transfer protein (LTP) by N-terminal amino acid sequence comparison. Two other differentially expressed proteins, with estimated molecular weights of 21.6 and 22 kDa, immuno-reacted with antiserum raised against a thaumatin-like protein (TLP) protein from pinto bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the 21.6-kDa protein showed a high degree of homology to V. vinifera thaumatin-like protein 2 (VVTL-2 = grapevine osmotin; Acc no. CAA71883), and that of the 22-kDa protein was homologous to V. vinifera thaumatin-like protein 1 (VVTL-1; AAB61590). Interestingly, both VVTL-1 and VVTL-2 are pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, belonging to the PR-5 group. Protein produced from the cloned grapevine VVTL-1 gene significantly inhibited E. ampelina spore germination and hyphal growth in vitro. Plants regenerated from in vitro-selected cultures similarly inhibited fungal growth in vivo. Enhanced expression of antifungal VVTL-1 in anthracnose resistant grapevine strongly suggests that it plays an important role, either alone or in conjunction with other PR proteins, by suppressing pathogen growth. 3aElsinoe ampelina 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aVitis vinifera 3aamino acid sequences 3aanthracnose 3aantiserum 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amicrobial growth 3apathogens 3apinto beans 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3asequence analysis 3aspore germination1 aLi, Zhijian1 aGray, Dennis J.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2003, v. 30, no. 11 p.1105-1115dCSIRO Pubx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP030663Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02970naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002300135245012500158300001800283500002400301520170100325650001602026650001702042650001702059650001102076650001602087650001002103650001102113650001702124650001502141650001102156650002002167650002202187650001902209650001102228650001102239650001602250650001502266651001302281700002202294700002102316773009102337852000902428856007502437655001202512IND4464084820221121130646.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408482DNAL7 a10.1071/FP031452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilliams, Erica L.10aStrategies of light energy utilisation, dissipation and attenuation in six co-occurring alpine heath species in Tasmania  ap. 1205-1218.  aIncludes references  aAlpine environments are characterised by low temperatures and high light intensities. This combination leads to high light stress owing to the imbalance between light energy harvesting and its use in photochemistry. In extreme cases, high light stress can lead to the level of photo-oxidative damage exceeding the rate of repair to the photosynthetic apparatus. Plant species may vary in the mechanisms they use to prevent photodamage, but most comparisons are of geographically and ecologically distinct species. Differences in leaf colouration suggested that photoprotective strategies might differ among Tasmanian evergreen alpine shrub species. We compared chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf pigment composition in six co-occurring alpine shrub species on the summit of Mt Wellington, southern Tasmania, Australia, during spring and autumn. We found marked differences among species in light energy utilisation, attenuation and dissipation. Ozothamnus ledifolius maintained a large capacity for photosynthetic light utilisation and thus, had a low requirement for light dissipation. All five of the other species relied on xanthophyll-cycle-dependent thermal energy dissipation. In addition Epacris serpyllifolia, Richea sprengelioides and Leptospermum rupestre had foliar anthocyanins that would attenuate photosynthetically active light in the leaf. During spring, all species retained de-epoxidised xanthophylls through the night and the pre-dawn concentration of antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin was significantly correlated with reductions in pre-dawn Fv / Fm. We propose that these species use three photoprotective strategies to cope with the combination of high light and low temperature. 3aCassipourea 3aLeptospermum 3aanthocyanins 3aautumn 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aenergy 3afluorescence 3aharvesting 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3alight requirement 3aphotosynthesis 3ashrubs 3aspring 3atemperature 3azeaxanthin 3aTasmania1 aHovenden, Mark J.1 aClose, Dugald C.0 tFunctional plant biology.g2003, v. 30, no. 12 p.1205-1218dCSIRO Pubx1445-44087nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP031453Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03418naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002600135245010700161300001600268500002400284520215500308650001102463650002502474650001702499650001102516650002702527650001302554650002602567650002102593650001402614650001502628650001902643650002502662650000902687650001102696650002702707700002302734700002302757700003202780773008802812852000902900856007502909655001202984IND4464086920221121104039.0120913s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446408692DNAL7 a10.1071/FP021522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirschbaum, Miko U.F.10aOn the importance of including soil nutrient feedback effects for predicting ecosystem carbon exchange  ap. 223-237.  aIncludes references  aTo grow, plants need both carbon, which is fixed in photosynthesis, and inorganic nutrients, which are generally obtained from the soil. Much interest currently exists in trying to understand the uptake and storage of carbon by terrestrial ecosystems. This paper investigates to what extent carbon gain and storage are modified by soil nutrient availability. This issue is investigated in relation to both short-term carbon fluxes on the time scale of interannual variability and long-term ecosystem carbon stocks on time scales of several thousand years. We conclude from simulations with an ecosystem model (CenW) that interannual variations in carbon gain can be significantly affected by feedback effects through the nutrient cycle. This feedback effect operates principally through an imbalance between carbon and nutrient dynamics. In years that allow high carbon gain, nutrient supply typically does not match the increased carbon supply so that foliar nutrient concentrations are reduced. This lowers productivity below that which could be expected if foliar nutrient concentration remained the same. The importance of these feedback effects is shown to be greatest at intermediate levels of water availability and nutrient supply, and is relatively more important for net ecosystem carbon exchange than for net primary production. We conclude that the long-term build-up of carbon stocks in ecosystems is often controlled by the rate at which nutrients can be gained. This conclusion is based on data from published studies showing that the slow build-up of carbon matches the gain in nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur, and on our simulations of system carbon stocks in response to fertiliser addition. The paper concludes with a discussion of the importance and feasibility of including these processes into models at different scales, including the broad continental scale. For modelling net ecosystem exchange for Australia, it is regarded as feasible and desirable to use models that are constrained by these system-internal feedback effects. Such models have already been used for large-scale simulations in Australia and other countries. 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3acarbon sinks 3amodels 3anet ecosystem exchange 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphotosynthesis 3aprimary productivity 3asoil 3asulfur 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aSimioni, Guillaume1 aMedlyn, Belinda E.1 aMcMurtrie, R.

Yeast, moulds, and bacteria were detected from all orange juice samples but no Salmonella. The concentrations of mould and bacteria were very low and remained at 0-4 and 0-6 cfu/ml, respectively, when these juices were stored up to 6 months, then gradually rose to 5-8 and 10-15 cfu/ml, respectively after being stored for 10 months at 4°C. At 12 months, mould and bacteria concentrations reached 8-16 and 14-18 cfu/ml, respectively. Brand B juice had better hygienic quality with the lowest amount of microorganisms and no detection of yeasts. In Brand C juice, microbial populations increased quickly and yeasts were detected. All brand juices are permitted to sell and are regarded as safe for consumption within 10 months when stored on shelves. But after this time, juice quality may be problematic because the mould counts in three brand juices were more than 10 cfu/ml which exceeded the hygienic standard for fruit and vegetable juice of China (GB 19297-2003). 3aSalmonella 3abacteria 3ajuice quality 3amarkets 3amicrobial growth 3aorange juice 3apopulation dynamics 3ashelf life 3avegetable juices 3ayeasts 3aChina1 aYang, X.H.1 aGuo, D.Q.1 aHu, Q.1 aZhou, Z.Q.1 aJiao, B.N.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 June, , no. 934 p.559-565dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.934.743Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03389naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002400167245012800191300001600319500002400335500001500359520180200374650004502176650001802221650001602239650002002255650003002275650001402305650002102319650001502340650001302355650002602368650002502394650001302419650003202432650001102464650001802475653001402493653001302507653002802520700001902548700002302567773010202590852000902692856008902701930003302790945002502823946001102848655001202859IND4415595420221121055340.0090130e20090217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441559542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2008.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF200 0aF7001 aJena, Satya Narayan10aMolecular phylogeny in Indian Citrus L.

The study was based on 50 accessions of Citrus genotypes, collected from wild, semi-wild and domesticated stocks. Of the 13 restriction enzymes (RE) used for restriction digestion of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons, four (Hinf I, Msp I, Alu I, Hae III) generated 47 restriction fragments, of which 24 (51%) were polymorphic. PCR-RFLP data showed a genetic distance ranging from 0 to 0.79 among 50 accessions of Citrus, and a cluster analysis, based on Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method, placed all the accessions in eight major clusters. Analysis of trnL-trnF sequences from 23 representative accessions of Citrus showed a pair-wise sequence divergence rate in the range of 0-0.064. NJ, minimum evolution (ME) and maximum parsimony (MP) analyses of trnL-trnF sequences produced phylogenetic trees, which placed all the 23 accessions in five clusters. PCR-RFLP analysis resulted in a well resolved phylogenetic tree with branches supported by moderate to high bootstrap values, while the trnL-trnF sequence-based trees showed only moderate to low bootstrap support for the internal tree branches, indicating uncertain origin of some Citrus genotypes. This study shows that the trnL-trnF spacer sequence data can detect genetic variation in Indian Citrus genotypes, but the utility of the data in inferring phylogeny at intra and inter-specific levels is limited probably by factors such as hybridization, bud mutations, apomixis and polyploidy. However, PCR-RFLP and trnL-trnF data supported the recognition of C. maxima, C. medica, and C. reticulata as the basal species of edible Citrus. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3acitrus fruits 3awild plants 3achloroplast DNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aphylogeny 3agenetic distance 3apolyploidy 3aapomixis 3amolecular systematics 3anucleotide sequences 3agenotype 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aCitrus 3adomestication 0aevolution 0amutation 0amolecular sequence data1 aKumar, Susheel1 aNair, Narayanan K.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2009 Feb. 17, v. 119, no. 4 p.403-416dElsevier Sciencex0304-42387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2008.08.0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/02/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03082naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001700151245007600168300001600244500026700260500002400527520153900551650001602090650000902106650001802115650001702133650001102150650001702161650000902178650000902187650002102196650002802217650001402245650001102259650001402270650001702284650002002301700001702321700001502338700001702353700001402370773014002384852000902524856009102533655001202624IND4464101520221121055229.0120917s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446410152DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.934.692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForney, C.F.10aInfluence of packaging on loss of aroma and quality of diced red onions  ap. 523-530.  aPaper presented at the International Symposium on Postharvest Technology in the Global Market, organized on the occasion of the 28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People, volume 1, held August 22-27, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal.  aIncludes references  aFresh-cut onions (Allium cepa L.) have a short self life and are subject to loss of acceptable flavour, excessive microbial growth, and discoloration. Proper packaging can reduce quality loss. Therefore, this study evaluated a package made of the biodegradable polymer polylactide (PLA) for its effectiveness to maintain the aroma and quality of diced red onions. Whole red onions were peeled, sanitized, diced, and placed into ridged PLA containers or polyethylene (PE) bags. The PLA containers were sealed with intact or vented (one 0.07 mm hole) PLA lids and PE bags were sealed with a heat sealer. Onion packages were stored at 4.5°C and assessed after 0, 7, 12, 14, 18, and 21 days for volatile content, package atmosphere composition, respiratory gas exchange rate, electrolyte leakage, pH, microbial quality, and sensory quality. After 7 days, the total headspace volatile content of onions stored in sealed PLA containers decreased by only 15% compared to 98 and 85% in the vented PLA and sealed PE packages, respectively. The retention of volatiles was associated with a greater fresh onion odour. However, after 14 days of storage, off odours developed in association with anaerobic atmospheres and/or microbial growth. During the 21 days of storage, onion respiratory gas exchange rates increased 5- to 6-fold and electrolyte leakage doubled. Aerobic and anaerobic microbial plate counts exceeded 106 CFU/g after 12 days. Marketable quality of diced red onions was maintained for 12 days in the sealed PLA and PE packages. 3aAllium cepa 3abags 3adiscoloration 3aelectrolytes 3aflavor 3agas exchange 3aheat 3alids 3amicrobial growth 3amicrobiological quality 3aoff odors 3aonions 3apackaging 3apolyethylene 3apolylactic acid1 aJordan, M.A.1 aFan, Lihua1 aDoucette, C.1 aGrant, R.0 tActa horticulturae.g2012 June, , no. 934 p.523-530dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2012.934.693Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04314naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128072001700146072001700163072001700180072001700197072001700214100002100231245010500252300001600357500002400373500001500397520244000412650001002852650002502862650001602887650002202903650002302925650002002948650002202968650001602990650001403006650001403020650001503034650002703049650002803076650001603104650002003120650002203140650001503162651001903177653004003196653001103236700001703247700001903264700002003283700002103303700001903324773012003343852000903463856008603472856004903558930003303607945002503640946001103665655001203676IND4415596520221121034456.0090130e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441559652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agsy.2008.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A method is presented and applied for optimising the sustainability of agricultural production systems in terms of both economics and the environment. Components of the agricultural production chain are analysed using environmental life-cycle assessment (LCA) and a financial value attributed to the resources consumed and burden imposed on the environment by agriculture, as well as to the products. The sum of the outputs is weighed against the inputs and the system considered sustainable if the value of the outputs exceeds those of the inputs. If this ratio is plotted against the sum of inputs for all levels of input, a diminishing returns curve should result and the optimum level of sustainability is located at the maximum of the curve. Data were taken from standard economic almanacs and from published LCA reports on the extent of consumption and environmental burdens resulting from farming in the UK. Land-use is valued using the concept of ecosystem services. Our analysis suggests that agricultural systems are sustainable at rates of production close to current levels practiced in the UK. Extensification of farming, which is thought to favour non-food ecosystem services, requires more land to produce the same amount of food. The loss of ecosystem services hitherto provided by natural land brought into production is greater than that which can be provided by land now under extensive farming. This loss of ecosystem service is large in comparison to the benefit of a reduction in emission of nutrients and pesticides. However, food production is essential, so the coupling of subsidies that represent a relatively large component of the economic output in EU farming, with measures to reduce pollution are well-aimed. Measures to ensure that as little extra land is brought into production as possible or that marginal land is allowed to revert to nature would seem to be equally well-aimed, even if this required more intensive use of productive areas. We conclude that current arable farming in the EU is sustainable with either realistic prices for products or some degree of subsidy and that productivity per unit area of land and greenhouse gas emission (subsuming primary energy consumption) are the most important pressures on the sustainability of farming. 3afoods 3aenvironmental impact 3afarm inputs 3aeconomic analysis 3aecosystem services 3afarm management 3aextensive farming 3afield crops 3anutrients 3alivestock 3acrop yield 3aagricultural subsidies 3asustainable agriculture 3aagriculture 3acrop management 3aintensive farming 3apesticides 3aUnited Kingdom 0aenvironmental life-cycle assessment 0ayields1 aDailey, A.G.1 aWilliams, A.G.1 aEvert, F.K. van1 aGoulding, K.W.T.1 aWhitmore, A.P.0 tAgricultural systems.g2009 Feb., v. 99, no. 2-3 p.117-125dElsevier Science Ltd.wJournal:jnl7186x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2008.11.0013Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2008.11.001  a20090821b20091002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/07/30  aNon-US 7aarticle03271naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245010600170300001600276500002400292520215300316650001802469650002002487650001202507650000902519650001802528650001202546650001802558650001202576650001302588650002502601650001402626650002302640650001002663650001602673773013002689852000902819856005702828655001202885IND4456302020221121023529.0110408e199408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445630202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01811.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStamp, N.E.10aSimultaneous effects of potassium, rutin and temperature on performance of Manduca sexta caterpillars  ap. 135-143.  aIncludes references  aThe simultaneous effects on an insect herbivore (third instar tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta (L.): Sphingidae) of temperature (daytime temperatures of 20 °C, 25 °C and 30 °C), a mineral that may play a role in plant defense (potassium) and a common allelochemical (rutin) were examined in a factorial experiment. To manipulate potassium levels, a modified diet with limited plant material was used as the base and KCl and rutin added. Temperature affected efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD), time to head-capsule slippage, stadium duration, relative consumption rate (RCR) and relative growth rate (RGR) but not food consumed, biomass gained and approximate digestibility (AD). Potassium concentration influenced all of the variables except AD, time to head-capsule slippage (HCS), duration of the stadium and percent of stadium time to HCS. Rutin impacted negatively on all of the variables except food consumed. Compared to larvae on the non-rutin diets, fewer larvae fed rutin survived through molt initiation to ecdysis and fewer successfully completed ecdysis. Temperature and rutin had interactive effects for AD, ECD, RCR, RGR, time to HCS, and percent of stadium required to reach HCS. Rutin and potassium had interactive effects for biomass gained, RCR, ECI, time to HCS, duration of stadium, and percent of stadium required to reach HCS. Comparison of larval responses on an average potassium concentration (3.1%) versus high concentration (6.1%) showed that at the low daytime temperature increasing potassium concentration depressed biomass gained, but at the warmer temperatures potassium concentration had little effect unless rutin was present. In addition, potassium concentration had little impact on ECI unless rutin was present. These results indicate that significant interactive effects occur among temperature, potassium and rutin, and thus suggest that such interactive effects on larval performance may be common under field conditions, which are characterized by varying temperature and different concentrations of minerals and allelochemicals in hostplants. 3aManduca sexta 3aallelochemicals 3abiomass 3adiet 3adigestibility 3aecdysis 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3aminerals 3aphytophagous insects 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3arutin 3atemperature0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1994 Aug., v. 72, no. 2 p.135-143dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw26078x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1994.tb01811.x 7aarticle03167naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245010400204300001800308500002400326506007600350520167700426506003702103650001802140650001402158650001302172650002602185650002502211650001102236650002202247650004402269650001502313650003802328650001802366650001302384700002402397700001902421700002302440700002102463773013602484852000902620856008002629655001202709IND4401642120221207131215.0080217e20080215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440164212DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02047-072doi7 aPMC22585742pmcid7 a181563192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohamed, Naglaa M.10aChanges in Bacterial Communities of the Marine Sponge Mycale laxissima on Transfer into Aquaculture  ap. 1209-1222.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe changes in bacterial communities associated with the marine sponge Mycale laxissima on transfer to aquaculture were studied using culture-based and molecular techniques. M. laxissima was maintained alive in flowthrough and closed recirculating aquaculture systems for 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The bacterial communities associated with wild and aquacultured sponges, as well as the surrounding water, were assessed using 16S rRNA gene clone library analysis and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Bacterial richness and diversity were measured using DOTUR computer software, and clone libraries were compared using S-LIBSHUFF. DGGE analysis revealed that the diversity of the bacterial community of M. laxissima increased when sponges were maintained in aquaculture and that bacterial communities associated with wild and aquacultured M. laxissima were markedly different than those of the corresponding surrounding water. Clone libraries of bacterial 16S rRNA from sponges confirmed that the bacterial communities changed during aquaculture. These communities were significantly different than those of seawater and aquarium water. The diversity of bacterial communities associated with M. laxissima increased significantly in aquaculture. Our work shows that it is important to monitor changes in bacterial communities when examining the feasibility of growing sponges in aquaculture systems because these communities may change. This could have implications for the health of sponges or for the production of bioactive compounds by sponges in cases where these compounds are produced by symbiotic bacteria rather than by the sponges themselves.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA libraries 3aaquariums 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abioactive properties 3aclones 3acomputer software 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3amonitoring 3arecirculating aquaculture systems 3aribosomal RNA 3aseawater1 aEnticknap, Julie J.1 aLohr, Jayme E.1 aMcIntosh, Scott M.1 aHill, Russell T.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Feb. 15, v. 74, no. 4 p.1209-1222dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02047-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01938naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245008400177300001400261500002400275520098000299650002401279650001101303650001601314650001501330650001201345650001401357650001101371650001201382650001301394773013901407852000901546856005701555655001201612IND4456183020221120222443.0110408e198501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445618302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1985.tb03456.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCochran, Donald G.10aMortality and reproductive effects of avermectin B₁ fed to German cockroaches  ap. 83-88.  aIncludes references  aNewly emerged adult female German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (L.) (Dictyoptera: Blattellidae) fed avermectin B₁ at concentrations of 6.5 ppm and higher in the food exhibited high mortality at 10 days. Survivors of these dosages failed to reproduce. Lower dosages produced some mortality and inhibited mating and reproduction. Those individuals that did reproduce had normal-sized oothecae and the percent hatch was normal. The higher concentrations produced a marked inhibition of feeding which appeared to be related to toxicity rather than to unpalatability or repellency. When nymphs were fed avermectin B₁ for short periods, higher dosages were required to produce mortality. Young nymphs were the most susceptible. Feeding inhibition also occurred in these short-term studies, but the survivors reproduced normally as did the progeny from the females fed avermectin continuously. The possible use of avermectin B₁ in baits for cockroach control is discussed. 3aBlattella germanica 3aadults 3aavermectins 3aegg masses 3afemales 3amortality 3anymphs 3aprogeny 3atoxicity0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1985 Jan., v. 37, no. 1 p.83-88dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1985.tb03456.x 7aarticle02930naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002500154245008700179300001600266500002400282520153400306650002301840650002001863650002101883650003701904650001101941650001601952650001701968650001201985650001601997650001002013650001102023650001602034650001202050650001402062650001402076650002002090650001102110650001402121650002902135650001002164650001602174651001102190700002102201773014802222852000902370856005702379655001202436IND4456242920221120212221.0110408e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445624292DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1989.tb01195.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanizzi, Antônio R.10aPerformance of nymphal and adult Nezara viridula on selected alternate host plants  ap. 215-223.  aIncludes references  aLaboratory studies with the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), feeding on seeds or fruits of some alternate host plants, demonstrated differences in nymphal survival and development time, and body weight at adult emergence. Lowest mortalities (25%) were observed for nymphs on fruits of dakota mustard [Brassica kaber (DC.)] and Siberian motherwort (Leonurus sibiricus L.). On fruits of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) nymph mortality was ca. 60%, and on mature seeds of L. sibiricus ca. 75%. Total development time from second instar to adult ranged from ca. 26 days on B. kaber to ca. 42 days on R. communis. Fresh body weight at adult emergence was greatest for nymphs on L. sibiricus and lowest on R. communis. Adult survival after 30 days and mean longevity was greater on L. sibiricus than on the remaining foods, being drastically reduced on R. communis. In general, reproductive performance on all foods was similar, except R. communis, on which no female reproduced. Female weight gain of N. viridula was generally greater on L. sibiricus. On R. communis, adults lost weight during their first week and showed the lowest weight gain at the end of day 29. Field observations coupled with these laboratory studies suggest that in the Warta area (northern Paraná state, Brazil, 23° 11′ S), L. sibiricus and B. kaber are important alternate food plants in the seasonal phenology of N. viridula. R. communis, however, is of poor nutritional quality, serving primarily as a refuge. 3aLeonurus sibiricus 3aNezara viridula 3aRicinus communis 3aSinapis arvensis subsp. arvensis 3aadults 3abody weight 3acastor beans 3afemales 3afood plants 3afoods 3afruits 3ahost plants 3ainstars 3alongevity 3amortality 3anutritive value 3anymphs 3aphenology 3areproductive performance 3aseeds 3aweight gain 3aBrazil1 aMeneguim, Ana M.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g1989 Mar., v. 50, no. 3 p.215-223dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw36094wJournal:jnl46140x0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1989.tb01195.x 7aarticle02708naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001800149245005900167300001600226500002400242500001500266520172700281650001802008650001002026650002202036650001302058650001502071650001602086650001302102650001402115653001802129700001602147700002802163773009402191852000902285856005202294655001202346IND4415898420221120212424.0090206e20090225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441589842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.11.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSayfu Kabada.14aThe δ ¹⁸O and δ ²H enrichment of Ethiopian lakes  ap. 173-182.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aUp-to-date overview of ¹⁸O and deuterium isotope composition of Ethiopian (low latitude) lakes is presented and the suitability of the isotope balance method in water balance estimations of these lakes is assessed. To determine the water budgets of the lakes and to investigate the factors that influence isotopic enrichment in these lakes we used a method whereby the calculated (theoretical) local evaporation line (CLEL) is compared with the evaporation line derived from fitting of the measured isotopic compositions of the lakes in the region. The CLEL is specific to a given region and is determined from representative relative humidity, the isotopic composition of the ambient moisture and the isotopic composition of inflow waters. The comparison between CLEL and the measured isotopic composition of the lakes, and the departures of the isotopic compositions of these lakes from the calculated values, were interpreted in terms of the lakes water budget and their catchment characteristics. This comparison revealed how far the existing empirical parameters in the isotope balance method predict evaporative enrichment in lakes under low latitude setting. Significant discrepancies were noted when CLEL was compared with the measured isotope enrichments of lakes. In this regard the low latitude lakes show similar enrichment behavior to that of other lakes in high latitude settings. Satisfactory agreement between the calculated and the measured local evaporation lines was obtained through adjusting the theta value which accounts for humidity build-up over the evaporating lake. All the investigated lakes are evaporation-dominated systems, with evaporative water losses exceeding 50% of total water loss. 3awater quality 3alakes 3arelative humidity 3aisotopes 3awatersheds 3aevaporation 3alatitude 3adeuterium 0awater balance1 aTravi, Yves1 aRóżański, Kazimierz.0 tJournal of hydrology.g2009 Feb. 25, v. 365, no. 3-4 p.173-182dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.11.027 7aarticle02855naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245006900126300001800195500001500213520176600228650002301994650001302017650002202030650001202052650002702064650002002091650001502111650002102126650001502147651000902162653001802171653002202189653001502211700001902226700001802245700001602263773008602279852000902365930003302374945001302407946001302420655001202433IND2290422020221120212405.0010412e200012  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229042202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeutong, F.10aComparison of bioclimatic indices for prediction of maize yields  ap. 1612-1617.  a2019-12-04  aYield prediction across a target production zone with varying strategies of agronomic practices has been a challenging problem to plant breeders when testing new genotypes for release. This study focused on comparing the importance of a new bioclimatic index called biological windows and six other traditional environmental indices as predictor variables of maize yields across sites (farmers' fields) and years, using a simple linear regression model. The yield data were collected for six hybrids evaluated in strip tests at 57 to 186 sites throughout Iowa during 1987-1994. The biological windows index was based on the Newhall Simulation Model and estimated the number of days the soil was moist and above 5 degrees C. The environmental indices were July precipitation, temperature, the product of July precipitation and temperature, and the equivalent values for August. Because the actual values for the indices were not recorded at each site, all the indices were estimated for each site as the weighted averages of the data from 112 Iowa weather stations. Across years and within the Iowa sites, the mean percentiles of R-square distributions showed that biological windows had less predictive value for maize yields than the more traditional indicators such as August precipitation and temperature. For all indices, across years and within sites had much greater mean R-squares than across sites and within years, which had very low predictive values. For predicting yield across years within sites, there appeared to be an advantage in using August precipitation or the product of August precipitation and temperature over the five other indices. The R-square values for these two indices were at least 0.60 in 80% of the test sites for five hybrids. 3atemporal variation 3aZea mays 3asimulation models 3ahybrids 3ageographical variation 3aair temperature 3acrop yield 3aclimatic factors 3aprediction 3aIowa 0aprecipitation 0ayield forecasting 0abioclimate1 aEskridge, K.M.1 aWaltman, W.J.1 aSmith, O.S.0 tCrop science.g2000 , v. 40, no. 6 p.1612-1617wJournal:jnl44570x1435-06537nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02858naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008700126300001800213500001500231520164700246650001801893650001301911650002001924650001201944650001001956650001401966650001301980650002301993650001002016650002302026650001702049650002602066650002702092650001902119651001002138653001402148653001502162700001702177700001702194700001502211700001402226773006802240852000902308930003302317945001302350946001302363655001202376IND2290415720221120212229.0010412e200012  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229041572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRevilla, P.10aInheritance of cold tolerance at emergence and during early season growth in maize  ap. 1579-1585.  a2019-12-04  aAdaptation of maize (Zea mays L.) to early planting dates requires the improvement of cold tolerance, which implies high percentage emergence and vigorous seedling growth under cold temperatures. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the combining ability of elite European maize inbreds for cold tolerance and to study the inheritance of cold tolerance. Five maize inbreds, differing in sensitivity to cold temperatures, were crossed by means of a diallel design. Hybrid seed was obtained at two production environments. Hybrids were planted on trays filled with sterilized peat in a cold chamber at four minimum temperatures, and these hybrids were also grown in field trials at two locations in northwestern Spain. The most cold-tolerant inbreds, according to previous unpublished inbred evaluations in the cold chamber, F7 and EA2087, produced the most cold-tolerant hybrids. Inbred F7 performed slightly better in hybrid combinations than EA2087 for emergence-related traits in the cold chamber, and EA2087 was superior in hybrid combinations to F7 for seedling growth. The inbred F7 may contribute cold tolerance at emergence, whereas EA2087 contributed cold tolerance for both emergence and seedling growth. In the field, inbreds F7 and H104W were the best parent for cold-tolerant hybrids. Percentage emergence was not related to the other traits. Generally, the genetic regulation of cold-tolerance traits conformed to an additive-dominance model, and it should be possible to combine both high percent emergence and vigorous seedling growth. A promising source of new cold-tolerant inbreds is the cross between EA2087 and F7. 3aplanting date 3aZea mays 3aseedling growth 3ahybrids 3avigor 3aseedlings 3acrossing 3aseasonal variation 3agenes 3aseedling emergence 3ainbred lines 3afield experimentation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3acold tolerance 3aSpain 0adominance 0aadaptation1 aMalvar, R.A.1 aCartea, M.E.1 aButron, A.1 aOrdas, A.0 tCrop science.g2000 , v. 40, no. 6 p.1579-1585x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02717naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245012500198300002000323506007600343520141600419506003701835650001801872650001101890650001001901650001901911650000901930650001201939650002901951700002601980700002602006700001802032773017602050852000902226856008302235946001302318655001202331IND4443601420221207132858.0101015e20101012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444360142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10124961072doi7 aPMC29551212pmcid7 a208614472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Feng10aDendritic spine instability and insensitivity to modulation by sensory experience in a mouse model of fragile X syndrome  ap. 17768-17773.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation and is caused by transcriptional inactivation of the X-linked fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FXS is associated with increased density and abnormal morphology of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic sites of the majority of excitatory synapses. To better understand how lack of the FMR1 gene function affects spine development and plasticity, we examined spine formation and elimination of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the whisker barrel cortex of Fmr1 KO mice with a transcranial two-photon imaging technique. We found that the rates of spine formation and elimination over days to weeks were significantly higher in both young and adult KO mice compared with littermate controls. The heightened spine turnover in KO mice was due to the existence of a larger pool of "short-lived" new spines in KO mice than in controls. Furthermore, we found that the formation of new spines and the elimination of existing ones were less sensitive to modulation by sensory experience in KO mice. These results indicate that the loss of Fmr1 gene function leads to ongoing overproduction of transient spines in the primary somatosensory cortex. The insensitivity of spine formation and elimination to sensory alterations in Fmr1 KO mice suggest that the developing synaptic circuits may not be properly tuned by sensory stimuli in FXS.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3acortex 3agenes 3aimage analysis 3amice 3aneurons 3atranscription (genetics)1 aAldridge, Georgina M.1 aGreenough, William T.1 aGan, Wen-Biao0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 12, v. 107, no. 41 p.17768-17773dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10124961073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02938naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008900204300002000293506007600313520145700389506003701846650001701883650001201900650001901912650001801931650001901949650001001968650001301978650001501991650001402006650002002020650001402040650001502054650002202069650001602091650001502107651001102122700002302133700002002156773017502176852000902351856008302360946001302443655001202456IND4445117720221207132807.0101113e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444511772DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10068231072doi7 aPMC29841462pmcid7 a209749782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarrison, Susan10aEcological contingency in the effects of climatic warming on forest herb communities  ap. 19362-19367.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDownscaling from the predictions of general climate models is critical to current strategies for mitigating species loss caused by climate change. A key impediment to this downscaling is that we lack a fully developed understanding of how variation in physical, biological, or land-use characteristics mediates the effects of climate change on ecological communities within regions. We analyzed change in understory herb communities over a 60-y period (1949/1951-2007/2009) in a complex montane landscape (the Siskiyou Mountains, Oregon) where mean temperatures have increased 2 °C since 1948, similar to projections for other terrestrial communities. Our 185 sites included primary and secondary-growth lower montane forests (500-1.200 m above sea level) and primary upper montane to subalpine forests (1,500-2,100 m above sea level). In lower montane forests, regardless of land-use history, we found multiple herb-community changes consistent with an effectively drier climate, including lower mean specific leaf area, lower relative cover by species of northern biogeographic affinity, and greater compositional resemblance to communities in southerly topographic positions. At higher elevations we found qualitatively different and more modest changes, including increases in herbs of northern biogeographic affinity and in forest canopy cover. Our results provide community-level validation of predicted nonlinearities in climate change effects.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abiogeography 3aclimate 3aclimate models 3aforest canopy 3aglobal warming 3aherbs 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aleaf area 3amontane forests 3amountains 3aprediction 3asubalpine forests 3atemperature 3aunderstory 3aOregon1 aDamschen, Ellen I.1 aGrace, James B.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 9, v. 107, no. 45 p.19362-19367dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10068231073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02868naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245011200207300002000319506007600339520144700415506003701862650004001899650002901939650002101968650002101989650002002010650001302030650000902043650001602052650002302068650001402091650002902105650001102134700002102145773017502166852000902341856008302350946001302433655001202446IND4445118120221207132854.0101113e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444511812DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10064361072doi7 aPMC29841602pmcid7 a209749722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHickman, Meleah A.10aTranscriptional silencing functions of the yeast protein Orc1/Sir3 subfunctionalized after gene duplication  ap. 19384-19389.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe origin recognition complex (ORC) defines origins of replication and also interacts with heterochromatin proteins in a variety of species, but how ORC functions in heterochromatin assembly remains unclear. The largest subunit of ORC, Orc1, is particularly interesting because it contains a nucleosome-binding BAH domain and because it gave rise to Sir3, a key silencing protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, through gene duplication. We examined whether Orc1 possessed a Sir3-like silencing function before duplication and found that Orc1 from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis, which diverged from S. cerevisiae before the duplication, acts in conjunction with the deacetylase Sir2 and the histone-binding protein Sir4 to generate heterochromatin at telomeres and a mating-type locus. Moreover, the ability of KlOrc1 to spread across a silenced locus depends on its nucleosome-binding BAH domain and the deacetylase Sir2. Interestingly, KlOrc1 appears to act independently of the entire ORC, as other subunits of the complex, Orc4 and Orc5, are not strongly associated with silenced domains. These findings demonstrate that Orc1 functioned in silencing before duplication and suggest that Orc1 and Sir2, both of which are broadly conserved among eukaryotes, may have an ancient history of cooperating to generate chromatin structures, with Sir2 deacetylating histones and Orc1 binding to these deacetylated nucleosomes through its BAH domain.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aKluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene duplication 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3aloci 3anucleosomes 3areplication origin 3atelomeres 3atranscription (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aRusche, Laura N.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 9, v. 107, no. 45 p.19384-19389dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10064361073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02136naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002300154245014800177300001600325500002400341520116200365650002001527650001901547650001701566650001401583650001501597650001001612650001101622700002401633773009901657852000901756856005701765655001201822IND4444124720221123025646.0101022s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444412472DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.1993.tb00148.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeters, Michael C.14aTHE Fine structure and scale formation of chrysolepidomonas dendrolepidota gen. et. sp. nov.(chrysolepidomonadaceae fam. nov., chrysophyceae)¹  ap. 469-475.  aIncludes references  aChrysolepidomonas gen. nov. is described for single‐celled monads with two flagella, a single chloroplast, and distinctive canistrate and dendritic scales. The type species, Chrysolepidomonas dendrolepidota sp. nov., is described for the first time. The canistrate scales bear eight “bumps” on the top surface, and the dendriticscales have a tapered base with a quatrifid tip. These organic scales are formed in the Golgi apparatus and storred in a scale reservoir. The scale reservoir is bounded on two sides by the R₁ and R₂ in microtubular roots of the basal apparatus. The cyst (=stomatocyst, statospore) forms endogenously by means of a silica deposition vesicle. The outer cyst surface is smooth, and the pore region is unornamented. Two other organisms bearing canistrate and dendritic scales, previously assigned to the genus Sphaleromants, are transferred to the genus Chrysolepidomonas. They are C.angalica sp. nov. and C. marine(Pienaar) comb. nov. The distinguishing features of Chrysolepidomonas and Sphaleromantis are discussed.

This long-juvenile and long-lived woody plant can be more difficult to cultivate than other crop plants. Dried-shrink disease is a dangerous pathogen that destroys sea buckthorn and halts commercial production. We estimated variability of ISSR molecular markers in 52 accessions of 16 sea buckthorn varieties and lines to seek markers associated with dried-shrink resistance and help identify potential breeding varieties and lines. Fifteen ISSR primers generated 346 bands, with an average of 23 bands per primer. Genetic similarities (Jaccard coefficient) between pairs of accessions ranged from 0.216 to 0.781. At a Jaccard coefficient of 0.39, the dendrogram generated with 342 polymorphic bands clustered 51 accessions of H. rhamnoides into five groups and one H. salicifolia isolate. Four ISSR markers (887₁₉₀, 835₇₀₀, 809₂₉₀, and 811₂₈₀) were significantly correlated with resistance to dried-shrink disease (P < 0.001). These markers provide a potential method for breeding programs that select lineages resistant to dried-shrink disease, especially when no other genetic information such as linkage maps and Quantitative Trait Loci are available. 3aHippophae rhamnoides 3abreeding 3achromosome mapping 3acrops 3agenetic markers 3apathogens 3aquantitative trait loci 3ashrubs 3awoody plants1 aLi, He1 aMopper, Susan0 tMolecular breeding.g2009 Oct., v. 24, no. 3 p.255-268dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl53942x1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-009-9288-5 7aarticle02728naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245007200206300002000278506007600298520145900374506003701833650001501870650001201885650001001897650000801907650001401915650001401929650001201943650001901955650001001974651001801984700001902002700001702021773017502038852000902213856008302222946001302305655001202318IND4445114920221207131642.0101113e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444511492DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10025981072doi7 aPMC29841722pmcid7 a209749472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, Robert S.10aEvolutionary history of partible paternity in lowland South America  ap. 19195-19200.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPartible paternity, the conception belief that more than one man can contribute to the formation of a fetus, is common in lowland South America and characterized by nonexclusive mating relationships and various institutionalized forms of recognition and investment by multiple cofathers. Previous work has emphasized the fitness benefits for women where partible paternity beliefs facilitate paternal investment from multiple men and may reduce the risk of infanticide. In this comparative study of 128 lowland South American societies, the prevalence of partible paternity beliefs may be as much as two times as common as biologically correct beliefs in singular paternity. Partible paternity beliefs are nearly ubiquitous in four large language families--Carib, Pano, Tupi, and Macro-Je. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that partible paternity evolved deep in Amazonian prehistory at the root of a tentative Je-Carib-Tupi clade. Partible paternity often occurs with uxorilocal postmarital residence (males transfer), although there are exceptions. Partible paternity may have benefits for both sexes, especially in societies where essentially all offspring are said to have multiple fathers. Despite a decrease in paternity certainty, at least some men probably benefit (or mitigate costs) by increasing their number of extramarital partners, using sexual access to their wives to formalize male alliances, and/or sharing paternity with close kin.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aconception 3afathers 3amales 3amen 3apaternity 3aphylogeny 3aprogeny 3arisk reduction 3awomen 3aSouth America1 aFlinn, Mark V.1 aHill, Kim R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 9, v. 107, no. 45 p.19195-19200dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10025981073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02654naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245004800206300002000254506007600274520131700350506003701667650001901704650002701723650002401750650001301774650002201787650002901809650001401838650000901852650001201861650001301873650002101886650001601907700002901923773017501952852000902127856008302136946001302219655001202232IND4445114120221207132412.0101113e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444511412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10091811072doi7 aPMC29841932pmcid7 a209749252pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayashi, Tomoyuki10aElectron tunneling in respiratory complex I  ap. 19157-19162.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) plays a central role in the respiratory electron transport chain by coupling the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone to the creation of the proton gradient across the membrane necessary for ATP synthesis. Here the atomistic details of electronic wiring of all Fe/S clusters in complex I are revealed by using the tunneling current theory and computer simulations; both density functional theory and semiempirical electronic structure methods were used to examine antiferromagnetically coupled spin states and corresponding tunneling wave functions. Distinct electron tunneling pathways between neighboring Fe/S clusters are identified; the pathways primarily consist of two cysteine ligands and one additional key residue. Internal water between protein subunits is identified as an essential mediator enhancing the overall electron transfer rate by almost three orders of magnitude to achieve a physiologically significant value. The identified key residues are further characterized by sensitivity of electron transfer rates to their mutations, examined in simulations, and their conservation among complex I homologues. The unusual electronic structure properties of Fe₄S₄ clusters in complex I explain their remarkable efficiency of electron transfer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aadenosine triphosphate 3acomputer simulation 3acysteine 3aelectron transfer 3aelectron transport chain 3aelectrons 3airon 3aligands 3amutation 3aprotein subunits 3aubiquinones1 aStuchebrukhov, Alexei A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 9, v. 107, no. 45 p.19157-19162dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10091811073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03356naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245007500169300001600244500002400260520214500284650001702429650001702446650002102463650001202484650001902496650001102515650001202526650002102538650001302559650001502572650003202587650001302619650001502632700001802647700001702665700001402682700001502696700002002711773012702731852000902858856005502867655001202922IND4460329720221123014453.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446032972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4549.2010.00483.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYANG, SHAOYU10aEffect of methyl jasmonate on pericarp browning of postharvest lychees  ap. 417-422.  aIncludes references  aThe application of methyl jasmonate (MJ) for the control of pericarp browning of harvested lychees in relation to the levels of anthocyanins and (-)-epicatechin was investigated. Lychees were dipped for 3 min in 0.6 µg/L MJ + 0.05% Sportak, 1 µg/L MJ + 0.05% Sportak, 5 µg/L MJ + 0.05% Sportak, 25 µg/L MJ + 0.05% Sportak or 0.05% Sportak (control). In this study, contents of anthocyanins (-)-epicatechin and lipofuscin-like substance, and browning index of harvested lychees during storage were determined. The activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase were also measured. The treatment with MJ significantly maintained the contents of anthocyanins and (-)-epicatechin, delayed the accumulation of lipofuscin-like substance and extended the shelf life of lychees. Furthermore, MJ treatment increased PAL activity, which can account for the maintenance of anthocyanin or (-)-epicatechin content. After these treatments, 1 µg/L MJ was effective in inhibiting pericarp browning and in maintaining the contents of anthocyanins and (-)-epicatechin of lychees. Thus, it is suggested that maintenance of anthocyanin or (-)-epicatechin contents could be an important factor for controlling pericarp browning of lychees during storage. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Lychees are highly perishable after harvest because of rapid skin browning as a result of anthocyanin degradation and (-)-epicatechin oxidation by polyphenol oxidase or peroxidase in the presence of peroxides, and the subsequent accumulation of lipofuscin-like substance, a final product of the autooxidation of lipid hydroperoxides, malondialdehydes and proteins of cells. This study exhibited that treatment with 1 µg/L methyl jasmonate (MJ) inhibited significantly the degradation of anthocyanins and the oxidation of (-)-epicatechin, and delayed significantly the accumulation of lipofuscin-like substance and pericarp browning of lychees. Therefore, application of MJ could be an important strategy to extend storage life and maintain the quality of harvested lychees based on the maintenance of anthocyanin or (-)-epicatechin content. 3aanthocyanins 3aautoxidation 3acatechol oxidase 3adipping 3ahydroperoxides 3alipids 3alitchis 3amethyl jasmonate 3apericarp 3aperoxidase 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aproteins 3ashelf life1 aChen, Yulong.1 aFENG, LINYAN1 aYang, En.1 aSU, XINGUO1 aJiang, Yueming.0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2011 Aug., v. 35, no. 4 p.417-422dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4549.2010.00483.x 7aarticle03029naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245015200202300002000354506007600374520123300450506003701683650001201720650002101732650002301753650002201776650002101798650002701819650002801846650001801874650001101892650001501903650002201918650002001940650001501960650001701975650002701992700001902019700001502038700001802053700002202071700002402093700002002117700002402137700001802161700001602179773017502195852000902370856008302379946001302462655001202475IND4445115720221207132407.0101113e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444511572DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10095991072doi7 aPMC29841912pmcid7 a209749262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaito, Kazuki10aOmnipotent role of archaeal elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α) in translational elongation and termination, and quality control of protein synthesis  ap. 19242-19247.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe molecular mechanisms of translation termination and mRNA surveillance in archaea remain unclear. In eukaryotes, eRF3 and HBS1, which are homologous to the tRNA carrier GTPase EF1α, respectively bind eRF1 and Pelota to decipher stop codons or to facilitate mRNA surveillance. However, genome-wide searches of archaea have failed to detect any orthologs to both GTPases. Here, we report the crystal structure of aRF1 from an archaeon, Aeropyrum pernix, and present strong evidence that the authentic archaeal EF1α acts as a carrier GTPase for aRF1 and for aPelota. The binding interface residues between aRF1 and aEF1α predicted from aRF1·aEF1α·GTP ternary structure model were confirmed by in vivo functional assays. The aRF1/eRF1 structural domain with GGQ motif, which corresponds to the CCA arm of tRNA, contacts with all three structural domains of aEF1α showing striking tRNA mimicry of aRF1/eRF1 and its GTPase-mediated catalysis for stop codon decoding. The multiple binding capacity of archaeal EF1α explains the absence of GTPase orthologs for eRF3 and HBS1 in archaea species and suggests that universal molecular mechanisms underlie translational elongation and termination, and mRNA surveillance pathways.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3abinding capacity 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3aeukaryotic cells 3aguanosine triphosphate 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3amessenger RNA 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprotein synthesis 3aquality control 3astop codon 3atransfer RNA 3atranslation (genetics)1 aKobayashi, Kan1 aWada, Miki1 aKikuno, Izumi1 aTakusagawa, Akira1 aMochizuki, Masahiro1 aUchiumi, Toshio1 aIshitani, Ryuichiro1 aNureki, Osamu1 aIto, Koichi0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 9, v. 107, no. 45 p.19242-19247dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10095991073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03488naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245014100210300002000351506007600371520181900447506003702266650000802303650001102311650001402322650001302336650001502349650001402364650002302378650002102401650001202422650003102434650001602465650003302481650001602514650000902530650001402539650002702553650001902580700002202599700002002621700002602641700002302667773017502690852000902865856008302874946001302957655001202970IND4445116220221207131638.0101113e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444511622DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10132261072doi7 aPMC29841692pmcid7 a209749212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinuthayanon, Wipawee10aUterine epithelial estrogen receptor α is dispensable for proliferation but essential for complete biological and biochemical responses  ap. 19272-19277.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFemale fertility requires estrogen to specifically stimulate estrogen receptor α (ERα)-dependent growth of the uterine epithelium in adult mice, while immature females show proliferation in both stroma and epithelium. To address the relative roles of ERα in mediating estrogen action in uterine epithelium versus stroma, a uterine epithelial-specific ERα knockout (UtEpiαERKO) mouse line was generated by crossing Esr mice with Wnt7a-Cre mice. Expression of Wnt7a directed Cre activity generated selective deletion of ERα in uterine epithelium, and female UtEpiαERKO are infertile. Herein, we demonstrate that 17β-estradiol (E₂)-induced uterine epithelial proliferation was independent of uterine epithelial ERα because DNA synthesis and up-regulation of mitogenic mediators were sustained in UtEpiαERKO uteri after E₂ treatment. IGF-1 treatment resulted in ligand-independent ER activation in both wild-type (WT) and UtEpiαERKO and mimicked the E₂ stimulatory effect on DNA synthesis in uterine epithelium. Uterine epithelial ERα was necessary to induce lactoferrin, an E₂-regulated secretory protein selectively synthesized in the uterine epithelium. However, loss of uterine epithelial ERα did not alter the E₂-dependent progesterone receptor (PR) down-regulation in epithelium. Strikingly, the uterine epithelium of UtEpiαERKO had robust evidence of apoptosis after 3 d of E₂ treatment. Therefore, we surmise that estrogen induced uterine hyperplasia involves a dispensable role for uterine epithelial ERα in the proliferative response, but ERα is required subsequent to proliferation to prevent uterine epithelial apoptosis assuring the full uterine epithelial response, illustrating the differential cellular roles for ERα in uterine tissue and its contribution during pregnancy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3acrossing 3aepithelium 3aestradiol 3aestrogen receptors 3afemale fertility 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3ahyperplasia 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3alactoferrin 3amice 3apregnancy 3aprogesterone receptors 3auterine tissue1 aHewitt, Sylvia C.1 aOrvis, Grant D.1 aBehringer, Richard R.1 aKorach, Kenneth S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 9, v. 107, no. 45 p.19272-19277dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10132261073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02462naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245013000204300002000334506007600354520104800430506003701478650001701515650002201532650000701554650001901561650001301580650003001593650001501623700001801638700002101656700001901677700002401696700001901720700002101739773017501760852000901935856008301944946001302027655001202040IND4445116020221207132421.0101113e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444511602DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10091241072doi7 aPMC29842042pmcid7 a209749202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlte, Ferdinand10aFerredoxin:NADPH oxidoreductase is recruited to thylakoids by binding to a polyproline type II helix in a pH-dependent manner  ap. 19260-19265.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFerredoxin:NADPH oxidoreductase (FNR) is a key enzyme of photosynthetic electron transport required for generation of reduction equivalents. Recently, two proteins were found to be involved in membrane-anchoring of FNR by specific interaction via a conserved Ser/Pro-rich motif: Tic62 and Trol. Our crystallographic study reveals that the FNR-binding motif, which forms a polyproline type II helix, induces self-assembly of two FNR monomers into a back-to-back dimer. Because binding occurs opposite to the FNR active sites, its activity is not affected by the interaction. Surface plasmon resonance analyses disclose a high affinity of FNR to the binding motif, which is strongly increased under acidic conditions. The pH of the chloroplast stroma changes dependent on the light conditions from neutral to slightly acidic in complete darkness or to alkaline at saturating light conditions. Recruiting of FNR to the thylakoids could therefore represent a regulatory mechanism to adapt FNR availability/activity to photosynthetic electron flow.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactive sites 3aelectron transfer 3apH 3aphotosynthesis 3aproteins 3asurface plasmon resonance 3athylakoids1 aStengel, Anna1 aBenz, J.

To elucidate the mechanism of the antihypertensive and anti-inflammatory activities of this herb, the ethanol fraction from A. saponaria Haw. was evaluated for antioxidative activity using xanthine-xanthine oxidase (XO) assay, 2,2-Diphenyl-lpicrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) assay, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) production in RAW 264.7 cell, and antinociceptive activity using a tail-flick assay and hind paw pressure assay in cisplatin-treated hyperalgesic rats. The ethanol fraction displayed potent antioxidative activities in XO assay. In addition, ethanol fractions showed potent scavenging effects in DPPH assay. We next examined whether ethanol fractions showed anti-inflammatory activities. Ethanol fractions significantly suppressed NO production from LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells. As expected, ethanol fractions dose-dependently inhibited the messenger RNA expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS). Moreover, ethanol fractions potently suppressed the expression of cycloxygenase (COX)-2 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which are stimulated by LPS in RAW264.7 cells.

Coupled climate-carbon cycle models are sensitive to this negative feedback on atmospheric CO₂, but model projections are uncertain because of the expectation that feedbacks through the nitrogen (N) cycle will reduce this so-called CO₂ fertilization effect. We assessed whether N limitation caused a reduced stimulation of net primary productivity (NPP) by elevated atmospheric CO₂ concentration over 11 y in a free-air CO₂ enrichment (FACE) experiment in a deciduous Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) forest stand in Tennessee. During the first 6 y of the experiment, NPP was significantly enhanced in forest plots exposed to 550 ppm CO₂ compared with NPP in plots in current ambient CO₂, and this was a consistent and sustained response. However, the enhancement of NPP under elevated CO₂ declined from 24% in 2001-2003 to 9% in 2008. Global analyses that assume a sustained CO₂ fertilization effect are no longer supported by this FACE experiment. N budget analysis supports the premise that N availability was limiting to tree growth and declining over time --an expected consequence of stand development, which was exacerbated by elevated CO₂. Leaf- and stand-level observations provide mechanistic evidence that declining N availability constrained the tree response to elevated CO₂; these observations are consistent with stand-level model projections. This FACE experiment provides strong rationale and process understanding for incorporating N limitation and N feedback effects in ecosystem and global models used in climate change assessments.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aforest stands 3aforests 3afree air carbon dioxide enrichment 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen cycle 3aprimary productivity 3atree growth 3atrees 3aTennessee1 aWarren, Jeffrey M.1 aIversen, Colleen M.1 aMedlyn, Belinda E.1 aMcMurtrie, R.

The model offers insight into the probable social impacts of the government-sanctioned supply control scheme in place in the French Comté cheese market, suggesting it falls short of constituting a Pareto-improvement compared with a laissez-faire situation. More generally, our theoretical model provides guidance to identify instances where encouraging industry coordination may be socially desirable. We formally introduce the concept of ‘seller-equivalent degree of overall market power' of the separated industry, a market characteristic comprised of measurable or inferable parameters, the value of which is shown to determine the potential for Pareto improvements through industry integration. 3acheeses 3ahorizontal integration 3aindustry 3amarket power 3amarkets 3amodels 3asocial impact 3avertical integration 3aFrance0 tJournal of agricultural economics.g2011 Sept., v. 62, no. 3 p.585-603dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-857X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00301.x 7aarticle02629naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245012300201300002000324506007600344520103900420506003701459650001301496650001801509650002001527650001101547650001601558650002401574650001001598650001101608650001701619650002201636650000901658650001201667650001401679650001801693700001401711700001901725700001401744700001701758700002201775700001501797700001901812773017501831852000902006856008302015946001302098655001202111IND4444613720221207120912.0101105e20101102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444461372DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10130321072doi7 aPMC29739032pmcid7 a209563012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xingshun10aNeuronal Abelson helper integration site-1 (Ahi1) deficiency in mice alters TrkB signaling with a depressive phenotype  ap. 19126-19131.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies suggest that the human Abelson helper integration site-1 (AHI1) gene on chromosome 6 is associated with susceptibility to schizophrenia and autism, two common neuropsychological disorders with depression symptoms. Mouse Ahi1 protein is abundant in the hypothalamus and amygdala, which are important brain regions for controlling emotion. However, the neuronal function of Ahi1 remains unclear. With the Cre-loxP system, we created a mouse model that selectively reduces Ahi1 expression in neuronal cells. Mice with neuronal Ahi1 deficiency show reduced TrkB level in the brain and depressive phenotypes, which can be alleviated by antidepressant drugs or by overexpression of TrkB in the amygdala. Ahi1 deficiency promotes the degradation of endocytic TrkB and reduces TrkB signaling in neuronal cells. Our findings suggest that impaired endocytic sorting and increased degradation of TrkB can induce depression and that this impaired pathway may serve as a previously uncharacterized therapeutic target for depression.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamygdala 3aanimal models 3aantidepressants 3aautism 3achromosomes 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3ahumans 3ahypothalamus 3amental depression 3amice 3aneurons 3aphenotype 3aschizophrenia1 aYang, Hao1 aLin, Yongfeng.1 aLi, Xiang1 aCape, Austin1 aRessler, Kerry J.1 aLi, Shihua1 aLi, Xiao-Jiang0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 2, v. 107, no. 44 p.19126-19131dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10130321073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03241naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245010600202300002000308506007600328520153300404506003701937650002201974650003201996650001002028650001402038650000902052650001202061650001302073650001902086650001402105650002202119650001202141700002302153700001702176700001802193700001802211700002302229700001702252700001702269700002202286700002102308700001602329700001902345700002402364700001902388773017502407852000902582856008302591946001302674655001202687IND4445114020221207120906.0101113e20101109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444511402DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10135921072doi7 aPMC29842002pmcid7 a209749072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Ching-Yao10aHigh-throughput identification of compounds targeting influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity  ap. 19151-19156.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAs influenza viruses have developed resistance towards current drugs, new inhibitors that prevent viral replication through different inhibitory mechanisms are useful. In this study, we developed a screening procedure to search for new antiinfluenza inhibitors from 1,200,000 compounds and identified previously reported as well as new antiinfluenza compounds. Several antiinfluenza compounds were inhibitory to the influenza RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), including nucleozin and its analogs. The most potent nucleozin analog, 3061 (FA-2), inhibited the replication of the influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus in MDCK cells at submicromolar concentrations and protected the lethal H1N1 infection of mice. Influenza variants resistant to 3061 (FA-2) were isolated and shown to have the mutation on nucleoprotein (NP) that is distinct from the recently reported resistant mutation of Y289H [Kao R, et al. (2010) Nat Biotechnol 28:600]. Recombinant influenza carrying the Y52H NP is also resistant to 3061 (FA-2), and NP aggregation induced by 3061 (FA-2) was identified as the most likely cause for inhibition. In addition, we identified another antiinfluenza RdRP inhibitor 367 which targets PB1 protein but not NP. A mutant resistant to 367 has H456P mutation at the PB1 protein and both the recombinant influenza and the RdRP expressing the PB1 H456P mutation have elevated resistance to 367. Our high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign thus resulted in the identification of antiinfluenza compounds targeting RdRP activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRNA-directed RNA polymerase 3adrugs 3ainfluenza 3amice 3amutants 3amutation 3anucleoproteins 3ascreening 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aCheng, Ting-Jen R.1 aLin, Meng-I.1 aWang, Shi-Yun1 aHuang, Wenyi.1 aLin-Chu, Shao-Ying1 aChen, Yu-Hou1 aWu, Chung-Yi1 aLai, Michael M.C.1 aCheng, Wei-Chieh1 aWu, Ying-Ta1 aTsai, Ming-Daw1 aCheng, Yih-Shyun E.1 aWong, Chi-Huey0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 9, v. 107, no. 45 p.19151-19156dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10135921073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03607naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001800158245015000176300001600326500001500342520163000357650002101987650000902008650001102017650001802028650001702046650001902063650002002082650002602102650001402128650001002142650002002152650001602172650002102188650001802209650002502227650002202252650002802274650002802302650001202330650002502342650002402367650003702391650002202428650002302450650003002473653001302503653001602516653001202532653002602544653002402570653001102594700001602605700001802621700001802639700001502657700001702672773007302689852000902762856007902771930003302850945001302883946001302896655001202909IND2290451220221122234757.0010412e200103  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229045122DNAL7 a112615652pmid7 a10.1093/ps/80.3.3382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRavindran, V.10aMicrobial phytase improves performance, apparent metabolizable energy, and ileal amino acid digestibility of broilers fed a lysine-deficient diet  ap. 338-344.  a2019-12-04  aAn experiment was conducted to examine the effects of adding microbial phytase (Natuphos) on the performance in broilers fed a phosphorus-adequate, lysine-deficient diet. A wheat-soybean meal-sorghum-based diet, containing 1.00% lysine and 0.45% nonphytate phosphorus, was supplemented with L-lysine monochloride to provide 1.06, 1.12, or 1.18% lysine or with 125, 250, 375, 500, 750, or 1,000 phytase units (FTU)/kg diet. Each diet was fed to six pens of 10 chicks each from Day 7 to 28 posthatching. Addition of lysine to the lysine-deficient diet linearly increased (P < 0.001) weight gain and gain per feed of broilers. The response in weight gain to added phytase reached a plateau at 500 FTU/kg diet (quadratic effect, P < 0.001). Phytase had no effect on gain per feed to 250 FTU/kg diet and then increased (quadratic effect, P < 0.05) with further additions. Assuming that the observed responses in weight gain and gain per feed to added phytase were due to the release of lysine alone and by solving linear or nonlinear response equations of lysine and phytase levels, the lysine equivalency value was calculated to be 500 FTU phytase/kg diet = 0.074% lysine. Addition of increasing levels of supplemental phytase to the lysine-deficient diet improved (P < 0.001) the digestibilities of nitrogen and all amino acids. Phytase also increased the AME, and the response reached a plateau at 750 FTU/kg diet (quadratic effect, P < 0.001). These results showed that amino acid and energy responses are responsible for the performance improvements observed when phytase was added to a wheat-soybean meal-sorghum-based diet. 3abroiler chickens 3adiet 3alysine 3adose response 3asoybean meal 3afeed additives 3afeed conversion 3anutrient deficiencies 3aequations 3awheat 3aliveweight gain 3afeed intake 3afeed formulation 3adigestibility 3ametabolizable energy 3aSorghum (Poaceae) 2a6-Phytasexpharmacology 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aChickensxphysiology 2aDietary Supplements 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aIleumxmetabolism 2aLysinexdeficiency 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 0abone ash 0aamino acids 0aphytase 0aequivalence equations 0aenzyme preparations 0adigits1 aSelle, P.H.1 aRavindran, G.1 aMorel, P.C.H.1 aKies, A.K.1 aBryden, W.L.0 tPoultry science.g2001 Mar., v. 80, no. 3 p.338-344x0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ps/80.3.3383Available from publisher's Web site  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02630naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245010400207300002000311506007600331520114200407506003701549650001901586650001801605650003601623650001301659650001001672650002101682650000901703650001801712650002001730700002301750700002101773700002301794700001501817700002601832700001901858700001501877773017501892852000902067856008302076946001302159655001202172IND4444611920221207120930.0101105e20101102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444461192DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10137611072doi7 aPMC29738722pmcid7 a209378572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeufeld-Cohen, Adi12aA triple urocortin knockout mouse model reveals an essential role for urocortins in stress recovery  ap. 19020-19025.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aResponding to stressful events requires numerous adaptive actions involving integrated changes in the central nervous and neuroendocrine systems. Numerous studies have implicated dysregulation of stress-response mechanisms in the etiology of stress-induced psychopathophysiologies. The urocortin neuropeptides are members of the corticotropin-releasing factor family and are associated with the central stress response. In the current study, a triple-knockout (tKO) mouse model lacking all three urocortin genes was generated. Intriguingly, these urocortin tKO mice exhibit increased anxiety-like behaviors 24 h following stress exposure but not under unstressed conditions or immediately following exposure to acute stress. The inability of these mutants to recover properly from the exposure to an acute stress was associated with robust alterations in the expression profile of amygdalar genes and with dysregulated serotonergic function in stress-related neurocircuits. These findings position the urocortins as essential factors in the stress-recovery process and suggest the tKO mouse line as a useful stress-sensitive mouse model.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute exposure 3aanimal models 3acorticotropin-releasing hormone 3aetiology 3agenes 3aknockout mutants 3amice 3aneuropeptides 3astress response1 aTsoory, Michael M.1 aEvans, Andrew K.1 aGetselter, Dmitriy1 aGil, Shosh1 aLowry, Christopher A.1 aVale, Wylie W.1 aChen, Alon0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 2, v. 107, no. 44 p.19020-19025dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10137611073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02479naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245010100200300002000301506007600321520119700397506003701594650001601631650000901647650001201656650002001668650003301688650001301721700001901734700001901753700001701772700002401789773017501813852000901988856008301997946001302080655001202093IND4444612220221207120907.0101105e20101102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444461222DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10134941072doi7 aPMC29738542pmcid7 a209562892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Lifang10aGRIP1 and 2 regulate activity-dependent AMPA receptor recycling via exocyst complex interactions  ap. 19038-19043.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPSD-95/SAP90/DLG/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-mediated protein-protein interactions play important roles in regulating AMPA receptor trafficking and neuronal plasticity. GRIP1 and GRIP2 are homologous multi-PDZ domain-containing proteins that bind to the C-termini of AMPA-R GluA2 and GluA3 subunits. Previous attempts to determine the cellular roles of GRIP1 and GRIP2 in neurons have been complicated by nonspecific reagents, and by the embryonic lethality of conventional GRIP1 KO mice. To circumvent these issues we developed a conditional targeted deletion strategy to knock out GRIP1 in postnatal neurons derived from GRIP2 KO mice. Loss of GRIP1 and 2 did not affect normal AMPA-R steady-state trafficking and endocytosis, but strikingly impaired activity-dependent AMPA-R recycling. This previously uncharacterized role for GRIP1 appears to be mediated by novel interactions with the cellular trafficking machinery via the exocyst protein complex. Indeed, disruption of GRIP1-exocyst binding caused a strikingly similar deficit in AMPA-R recycling. Together these findings reveal a previously unidentified role for AMPA-R-GRIP1-exocyst protein complexes in activity-dependent AMPA-R trafficking.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aendocytosis 3amice 3aneurons 3aneuroplasticity 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteins1 aTakamiya, Kogo1 aThomas, Gareth1 aLin, Da-Ting1 aHuganir, Richard L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 2, v. 107, no. 44 p.19038-19043dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10134941073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02234naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245015800175300001600333500002400349520123000373650001901603650001401622650001101636650002301647650001401670650001301684650001901697650001601716773012401732852000901856856005501865655001201920IND4446178220221122185401.0101208e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444617822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00429.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaylon, Juliana C.10aEffects of Salinity and Temperature on Survival and Development of Larvae and Juveniles of the Mud Crab, Scylla serrata (Crustacea: Decapoda: Portunidae)  ap. 858-873.  aIncludes references  aAn investigation was conducted to determine salinity and temperature effects on the survival and development of larvae and juveniles of the mud crab, Scylla serrata. Zoea, megalopae, and juveniles were reared at various salinity and temperature combinations: 15, 25, 35, and 45 ppt for zoea; 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 ppt for megalopae; and 0, 5, 15, 25, 35, and 45 ppt for juveniles, at 20, 26, and 32 C. Salinity and temperature affected the survival of the zoea larvae, and there was an interaction between salinity and temperature. Salinity and temperature also affected the survival of megalopa and juveniles, but there was no interaction between salinity and temperature. There was high survival and metamorphosis on zoea reared at 25-35 ppt at 26 and 32 C. Megalopae developed to juveniles at 15-45 ppt at 20, 26, and 32 C. Juveniles survived and developed at 5-45 ppt at 20, 26, and 32 C. Salinity and temperature also affected the development and molt duration. Development was rapid at 25 and 35 ppt, at 32 C, but delayed at 15 and 45 ppt, at 20 and 26 C. Zoea benefited gradual transfer to 15 and 45 ppt but megalopa and juveniles did not. As the larvae grew, there was tolerance to wider salinity and low temperature. 3aScylla serrata 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amortality 3asalinity 3asalt tolerance 3atemperature0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2010 Dec., v. 41, no. 6 p.858-873dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0893-88497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2010.00429.x 7aarticle03465naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003800152245014500190300001600335500002400351520201500375650001502390650000802405650002202413650002102435650001202456650002202468650003702490650002202527650001602549650002802565650001802593650002102611653002502632653002802657653002302685653002802708653005302736700002102789700002902810773011602839852000902955856005502964655001203019IND4425530320221122153417.0090905e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442553032DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2009.01542.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantha Lakshmi Prasad, Madamsetty10aAnalysis of Cultural and Genetic Diversity in Alternaria helianthi and Determination of Pathogenic Variability Using Wild Helianthus Species  ap. 609-617.  aIncludes references  aThe study aims at assessment of morphological, molecular and pathogenic variability of Alternaria helianthi, incitant of leaf blight of sunflower. Morphological characteristics determined for 26 isolates of A. helianthi from India revealed variations in shape of culture, pigmentation, conidial measurements, number of septa and colony growth. The conidia of isolate Ah-7 were long, while conidia of isolate Ah-15 were short. Based on cultural characters, isolates were classified into four groups. Genetic variability of the isolates was assessed by random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Good polymorphism was observed and cluster analysis indicated presence of six genetically distinct groups among the isolates. The isolates Ah-1, Ah-7 and Ah-14 were genetically distinct. Resistant sources are not available in cultivated sunflower, while wild Helianthus species possess resistance to multiple stresses. We evaluated reaction of wild Helianthus species to isolates of A. helianthi. Among wild Helianthus species, H. tuberosus followed by H. occidentalis showed moderately to highly resistant reaction to all the isolates and recorded less disease incidence. The species H. argophyllus followed by H. laevigatus showed more disease incidence. The cultivated sunflower recorded susceptible reaction to most of the isolates and recorded high disease incidence. The isolates differed significantly for pathogenic reaction and were grouped into three pathogenicity groups; low, medium and high. Six isolates induced <20% disease incidence and were included in the low pathogenicity group. Majority of isolates were in the medium pathogenicity group. Six isolates i.e. Ah-9, Ah-10, Ah-18, Ah-20, Ah-24 and Ah-26 induced more than 50% disease incidence and were considered high pathogenicity group. Our results demonstrate the existence of considerable variation in resistance of Helianthus species to A. helianthi and also in morphological and genetic characters of A. helianthi isolates prevalent in India. 3aAlternaria 3aDNA 3aHelianthus annuus 3acluster analysis 3aconidia 3adisease incidence 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3aleaf blight 3amulticultural diversity 3apathogenicity 3astress tolerance 0aAlternaria helianthi 0adetached leaf technique 0aHelianthus species 0amorphological variation 0arandom amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis1 aSujatha, Mulpuri1 aChander Rao, Sankaraneni0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2009 Oct., v. 157, no. 10 p.609-617dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2009.01542.x 7aarticle02478naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245005000202300002000252506007600272520102800348506003701376650002201413650001801435650001201453650001201465650001901477650002101496650002301517650001601540650002301556650002601579700002101605700001701626700001601643700001501659700001901674700001701693700001701710773017601727852000901903856008301912946001301995655001202008IND4444273520221207134323.0101029e20101026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444427352DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10101241072doi7 aPMC29729742pmcid7 a209378662pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Guohui10aIon sensing in the RCK1 domain of BK channels  ap. 18700-18705.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBK-type K⁺ channels are activated by voltage and intracellular Ca²⁺, which is important in modulating muscle contraction, neural transmission, and circadian pacemaker output. Previous studies suggest that the cytosolic domain of BK channels contains two different Ca²⁺ binding sites, but the molecular composition of one of the sites is not completely known. Here we report, by systematic mutagenesis studies, the identification of E535 as part of this Ca²⁺ binding site. This site is specific for binding to Ca²⁺ but not Cd²⁺. Experimental results and molecular modeling based on the X-ray crystallographic structures of the BK channel cytosolic domain suggest that the binding of Ca²⁺ by the side chains of E535 and the previously identified D367 changes the conformation around the binding site and turns the side chain of M513 into a hydrophobic core, providing a basis to understand how Ca²⁺ binding at this site opens the activation gate of the channel that is remotely located in the membrane.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray diffraction 3abinding sites 3acadmium 3acalcium 3ahydrophobicity 3amolecular models 3amuscle contraction 3amutagenesis 3apotassium channels 3asynaptic transmission1 aHuang, Sheng-You1 aYang, Junqiu1 aShi, Jingyi1 aYang, Xiao1 aMoller, Alyssa1 aZou, Xiaoqin1 aCui, Jianmin0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 26, v. 107, no. 43 p.18700-18705dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10101241073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02994naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245015900195300001800354500002400372520127500396650002001671650002201691650002401713650001901737650001901756650002201775650002401797650002201821650001301843650002401856650001201880650003301892650003201925650002001957650003601977650002402013650004902037650002202086650003402108650003102142650002402173650004902197700002702246700002502273773011402298852000902412856005502421655001202476IND4412733920221122153510.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441273392DNAL7 a187617002pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01880.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKÖNIGSHOFER, HELGA10aEarly events in signalling high-temperature stress in tobacco BY2 cells involve alterations in membrane fluidity and enhanced hydrogen peroxide production  ap. 1771-1780.  aIncludes references  aAlterations in membrane fluidity are among the early events in plants that detect changes in ambient temperature. However, signal transduction downstream of the membrane-associated processes is still not well understood. We have focused here on the role of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in high-temperature signalling in relation to changes in membrane fluidity in cells of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cv. Bright Yellow 2 (BY2). As final indicators of the heat-signalling cascade, we have monitored the synthesis of small heat-shock proteins (sHSPs). Elevation of temperature between 32 and 38 °C resulted in a fast, transient stimulation of H₂O₂ production in the tobacco cells. A similar H₂O₂ burst could be induced at lower temperatures (28-32 °C) by membrane fluidization using benzyl alcohol (BA). Diphenylene iodonium (DPI), a NADPH oxidase inhibitor, prevented both the heat- and BA-triggered H₂O₂ rise. The synthesis of sHSPs (14.5 and 16 kDa) was shifted to lower temperatures by BA application and was suppressed by DPI treatment in the same way. The results indicate that H₂O₂ is an early component of the heat-signalling pathway, which responds rapidly to changes in membrane fluidity and is required for the activation of sHSP synthesis. 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aambient temperature 3abenzyl alcohol 3acell membranes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrogen production 3amembrane fluidity 3aproteins 3asignal transduction 3atobacco 2aBenzyl Alcoholxpharmacology 2aCell Membranexdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxmetabolism 2aHeat-Shock Response 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aMembrane Fluidity 2aOnium Compoundsxpharmacology 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aTobaccoxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aTROMBALLA, HANS-WALTER1 aLÖPPERT, HANS-GEORG0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2008 Dec., v. 31, no. 12 p.1771-1780dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01880.x 7aarticle02448naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245007300207300002000280506007600300520100700376506003701383650002201420650001601442650001301458650002301471650001001494650000901504650002301513650001601536650001701552650001001569650001201579650001501591650001301606650002201619650001201641700002301653700002101676773017601697852000901873856008301882946001301965655001201978IND4444270720221207134336.0101029e20101026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444427072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10084751072doi7 aPMC29729962pmcid7 a209213982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeehan, Timothy D.10aBird communities in future bioenergy landscapes of the Upper Midwest  ap. 18533-18538.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMandates for biofuel and renewable electricity are creating incentives for biomass production in agricultural landscapes of the Upper Midwest. Different bioenergy crops are expected to vary in their effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Here, we use data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to forecast the impact of potential bioenergy crops on avian species richness and the number of bird species of conservation concern in Midwestern landscapes. Our analysis suggests that expanded production of annual bioenergy crops (e.g., corn and soybeans) on marginal land will lead to declines in avian richness between 7% and 65% across 20% of the region, and will make managing at-risk species more challenging. In contrast, replacement of annual with diverse perennial bioenergy crops (e.g., mixed grasses and forbs) is expected to bring increases in avian richness between 12% and 207% across 20% of the region, and possibly aid the recovery of several species of conservation concern.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3aagriculture 3abiofuels 3abiomass production 3abirds 3acorn 3aecosystem services 3aelectricity 3aenergy crops 3aforbs 3agrasses 3alandscapes 3asoybeans 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys1 aHurlbert, Allen H.1 aGratton, Claudio0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 26, v. 107, no. 43 p.18533-18538dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10084751073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02605naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245012500205300002000330506007600350520134800426506003701774650001101811650001701822650001101839650002401850650001501874650001801889700002501907700003001932773017601962852000902138856008302147946001302230655001202243IND4444270620221207134332.0101029e20101026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444427062DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10070771072doi7 aPMC29729752pmcid7 a209378672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaro, Andrés U.10aEcological convergence in a rocky intertidal shore metacommunity despite high spatial variability in recruitment regimes  ap. 18528-18532.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn open ecological systems, community structure can be determined by physically modulated processes such as the arrival of individuals from a regional pool and by local biological interactions. There is debate centering on whether niche differentiation and local interactions among species are necessary to explain macroscopic community patterns or whether the patterns can be generated by the neutral interplay of dispersal and stochastic demography among ecologically identical species. Here we evaluate how much of the observed spatial variation within a rocky intertidal metacommunity along 800 km of coastline can be explained by drift in the structure of recruits across 15 local sites. Our results show that large spatial changes in recruitment do not explain the observed spatial variation in adult local structure and that, in comparison with the large drift in structure of recruits, local adult communities converged to a common, although not unique, structure across the region. Although there is no unique adult community structure in the entire region, the observed variation represents only a small subset of the possible structures that would be expected from passive recruitment drift. Thus, in this diverse system our results do not support the idea that rocky intertidal metacommunities are structured by neutral mechanisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abiodiversity 3acoasts 3acommunity structure 3ademography 3alittoral zone1 aNavarrete, Sergio A.1 aCastilla Z., Juan Carlos.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 26, v. 107, no. 43 p.18528-18532dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10070771073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02663naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245011100209300002000320506007600340520122200416506003701638650001401675650001401689650001901703650002501722650002101747650001601768650001101784650001901795650001501814650001501829700002001844700001801864700001901882700001901901700001601920773017601936852000902112856008302121946001302204655001202217IND4444270320221207134334.0101029e20101026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444427032DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10061241072doi7 aPMC29729672pmcid7 a209378562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScherz-Shouval, Ruth10ap53-dependent regulation of autophagy protein LC3 supports cancer cell survival under prolonged starvation  ap. 18511-18516.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe p53 tumor suppressor is mutated in a high percentage of human tumors. However, many other tumors retain wild-type (wt) p53 expression, raising the intriguing possibility that they actually benefit from it. Recent studies imply a role for p53 in regulation of autophagy, a catabolic pathway by which eukaryotic cells degrade and recycle macromolecules and organelles, particularly under conditions of nutrient deprivation. Here, we show that, in many cell types, p53 confers increased survival in the face of chronic starvation. We implicate regulation of autophagy in this effect. In HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells exposed to prolonged nutrient deprivation, the endogenous wt p53 posttranscriptionally down-regulates LC3, a pivotal component of the autophagic machinery. This enables reduced, yet sustainable autophagic flux. Loss of p53 impairs autophagic flux and causes excessive LC3 accumulation upon starvation, culminating in apoptosis. Thus, p53 increases cell fitness by maintaining better autophagic homeostasis, adjusting the rate of autophagy to changing circumstances. We propose that some cancer cells retain wt p53 to benefit from the resultant increased fitness under limited nutrient supply.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell viability 3acolorectal neoplasms 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aorganelles 3astarvation1 aWeidberg, Hilla1 aGonen, Chagay1 aWilder, Sylvia1 aElazar, Zvulun1 aOren, Moshe0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 26, v. 107, no. 43 p.18511-18516dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10061241073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03467naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245008900205300002000294506007600314520164600390506003702036650001102073650001802084650001302102650001902115650002402134650001002158650001502168650001402183650001902197650001002216650002402226650002802250650001202278650001802290650001302308650001702321650001402338700001902352700002002371700002002391700002302411700001702434700001502451700002802466700002702494700002002521700001902541700002402560773017602584852000902760856008302769946001302852655001202865IND4444271320221207134334.0101029e20101026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444427132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10069801072doi7 aPMC29729982pmcid7 a209213962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaust, Thomas W.10aNeurotoxic lupus autoantibodies alter brain function through two distinct mechanisms  ap. 18569-18574.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDamaging interactions between antibodies and brain antigenic targets may be responsible for an expanding range of neurological disorders. In the case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), patients generate autoantibodies (AAbs) that frequently bind dsDNA. Although some symptoms of SLE may arise from direct reactivity to dsDNA, much of the AAb-mediated damage originates from cross-reactivity with other antigens. We have studied lupus AAbs that bind dsDNA and cross-react with the NR2A and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). In adult mouse models, when the blood-brain barrier is compromised, these NMDAR-reactive AAbs access the brain and elicit neuronal death with ensuing cognitive dysfunction and emotional disturbance. The cellular mechanisms that underlie these deleterious effects remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that, at low concentration, the NMDAR-reactive AAbs are positive modulators of receptor function that increase the size of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials, whereas at high concentration, the AAbs promote excitotoxicity through enhanced mitochondrial permeability transition. Other synaptic receptors are completely unaffected by the AAbs. NMDAR activation is required for producing both the synaptic and the mitochondrial effects. Our study thus reveals the mechanisms by which NMDAR-reactive AAbs trigger graded cellular alterations, which are likely to be responsible for the transient and permanent neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in patients with SLE. Our study also provides a model in which local AAb concentration determines the exact nature of the cellular response.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3aanimal models 3aantigens 3aautoantibodies 3ablood-brain barrier 3abrain 3acell death 3acognition 3across reaction 3adeath 3alupus erythematosus 3anervous system diseases 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3apatients 3apermeability 3areceptors1 aChang, Eric H.1 aKowal, Czeslawa1 aBerlin, RoseAnn1 aGazaryan, Irina G.1 aBertini, Eva1 aZhang, Jie1 aSanchez-Guerrero, Jorge1 aFragoso-Loyo, Hilda E.1 aVolpe, Bruce T.1 aDiamond, Betty1 aHuerta, Patricio T.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 26, v. 107, no. 43 p.18569-18574dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10069801073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02966naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245013900201300002000340506007600360520124300436506003701679650003101716650002401747650001201771650001901783650001101802650002001813650001701833650000901850650001701859650002601876700001801902700002101920700002301941700002001964700002201984700001802006700002202024700001902046700002602065700001902091700001902110700002602129773017602155852000902331856008302340946001302423655001202436IND4444271420221207134333.0101029e20101026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444427142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10004001072doi7 aPMC29729522pmcid7 a209378782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Je-Min10aCell-permeable Foxp3 protein alleviates autoimmune disease associated with inflammatory bowel disease and allergic airway inflammation  ap. 18575-18580.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFoxp3 is a key transcription factor for differentiation and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells that is critical for maintaining immunological self-tolerance. Therefore, increasing Treg function by Foxp3 transduction to regulate an inflammatory immune response is an important goal for the treatment of autoimmune and allergic diseases. Here we have generated a cell-permeable Foxp3 protein by fusion with the unique human HHph-1-PTD (protein transduction domain), examined its regulatory function in T cells, and characterized its therapeutic effect in autoimmune and allergic disease models. HHph-1-Foxp3 was rapidly and effectively transduced into cells within 30 min and conferred suppressor function to CD4⁺CD25⁻ T cells as well as directly inhibiting T-cell activation and proliferation. Systemic delivery of HHph-1 Foxp3 remarkably inhibited the autoimmune symptoms of scurfy mice and the development of colitis induced by scurfy or wild-type CD4 T cells. Moreover, intranasal delivery of HHph-1-Foxp3 strongly suppressed ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation. These results demonstrate the clinical potential of the cell-permeable recombinant HHph-1-Foxp3 protein in autoimmune and hypersensitive allergic diseases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aautoimmune diseases 3acolitis 3adisease models 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3amice 3atherapeutics 3atranscription factors1 aShin, Jae-Hun1 aSohn, Myung-Hyun1 aHarding, Martha J.1 aPark, Jong-Hyun1 aTobiasova, Zuzana1 aKim, Da-Young1 aMaher, Stephen E.1 aChae, Wook-Jin1 aPak, Sŏng-ho,d1942-1 aLee, Chun-Geun1 aLee, Sang-Kyou1 aBothwell, Alfred L.M.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 26, v. 107, no. 43 p.18575-18580dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10004001073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03068naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245011500189300001600304500002400320500001500344520177000359650001502129650001502144650001102159650001102170650002402181650001202205650001402217650001502231650001502246650001002261650001402271650001502285650001102300651001202311653001402323700002502337700002502362700001802387700002002405773010902425852000902534856005502543655001202598IND4458900420221122115217.0110610e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445890042DNAL7 a214182072pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01814.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Lee E.10aFood web complexity and allometric scaling relationships in stream mesocosms: implications for experimentation  ap. 884-895.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a1. Mesocosms are used extensively by ecologists to gain a mechanistic understanding of ecosystems based on the often untested assumption that these systems can replicate the key attributes of natural assemblages. 2. Previous investigations of stream mesocosm utility have explored community composition, but here for the first time, we extend the approach to consider the replicability and realism of food webs in four outdoor channels (4 m²). 3. The four food webs were similarly complex, consisting of diverse assemblages (61-71 taxa) with dense feeding interactions (directed connectance 0·09-0·11). Mesocosm food web structural attributes were within the range reported for 82 well-characterized food webs from natural streams and rivers. When compared with 112 additional food webs from standing freshwater, marine, estuarine and terrestrial environments, stream food webs (including mesocosms) had similar characteristic path lengths, but typically lower mean food chain length and exponents for the species-link relationship. 4. Body size (M) abundance (N) allometric scaling coefficients for trivariate taxonomic mesocosm food webs (−0·53 to −0·49) and individual size distributions (−0·60 to −0·58) were consistent and similar to those from natural systems, suggesting that patterns of energy flux between mesocosm consumers and resources were realistic approximations. 5. These results suggest that stream mesocosms of this scale can support replicate food webs with a degree of biocomplexity that is comparable to ‘natural' streams. The findings highlight the potential value of mesocosms as model systems for performing experimental manipulations to test ecological theories, at spatiotemporal scales of relevance to natural ecosystems. 3aecologists 3afreshwater 3arivers 3aenergy 3acommunity structure 3astreams 3abody size 3aecosystems 3afood chain 2aBiota 2aEcosystem 2aFood Chain 2aRivers 0aEngland 0afood webs1 aEdwards, Francois K.1 aMilner, Alexander M.1 aWoodward, Guy1 aLedger, Mark E.0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2011 July, v. 80, no. 4 p.884-895dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0021-87907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01814.x 7aarticle03450naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245014400202300002000346506007600366520165500442506003702097650001902134650001902153650001402172650001602186650002002202650001902222650001102241650002102252650001502273650002202288650001502310650001302325650001502338650002102353700002202374700002102396700003102417700002002448700002002468700002502488700002202513700002102535700003502556700002502591773017502616852000902791856008302800946001302883655001202896IND4444609420221207135409.0101105e20101102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444460942DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10126671072doi7 aPMC29739192pmcid7 a209526552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Xiaolong10aMüllerian inhibiting substance preferentially inhibits stem/progenitors in human ovarian cancer cell lines compared with chemotherapeutics  ap. 18874-18879.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCancer stem cells are proposed to be tumor-initiating cells capable of tumorigenesis, recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance, and, like somatic stem cells, are thought to be capable of unlimited self-renewal and, when stimulated, proliferation and differentiation. Here we select cells by expression of a panel of markers to enrich for a population with stem cell-like characteristics. A panel of eight was initially selected from 95 human cell surface antigens as each was shared among human ovarian primary cancers, ovarian cancer cell lines, and normal fimbria. A total of 150 combinations of markers were reduced to a panel of three--CD44, CD24, and Epcam--which selected, in three ovarian cancer cell lines, those cells which best formed colonies. Cells expressing CD44, CD24, and Epcam exhibited stem cell characteristics of shorter tumor-free intervals in vivo after limiting dilution, and enhanced migration in invasion assays in vitro. Also, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel increased this enriched population which, conversely, was significantly inhibited by Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) or the MIS mimetic SP600125. These findings demonstrate that flow cytometry can be used to detect a population which shows differential drug sensitivity, and imply that treatment of patients can be individualized to target both stem/progenitor cell enriched and nonenriched subpopulations. The findings also suggest that this population, amenable to isolation by flow cytometry, can be used to screen for novel treatment paradigms, including biologic agents such as MIS, which will improve outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal ovaries 3acarcinogenesis 3acisplatin 3adoxorubicin 3adrug resistance 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3ametastasis 3aovarian neoplasms 3apaclitaxel 3apatients 3astem cells 3asurface antigens1 aDombkowski, David1 aMeirelles, Katia1 aPieretti-Vanmarcke, Rafael1 aSzotek, Paul P.1 aChang, Henry L.1 aPreffer, Frederic I.1 aMueller, Peter R.1 aTeixeira, José.1 aMacLaughlin, D.

Gene duplication allows biological functions to become separated, leading to increased complexity through subfunctionalization. Recently, the relative contributions to morphological evolution of changes to the regulatory and/or coding regions of duplicated genes have been the subject of debate. Duplication generated multiple copies of the MADS-box transcription factor genes that play essential roles in specifying organ identity in the flower, making this evolutionary novelty a good model to investigate the nature of the changes necessary to drive subfunctionalization. Here, we show that naturally occurring variation at a single amino acid in a MADS-box transcription factor switches its ability to specify male and female reproductive organs by altering its repertoire of protein-protein interactions. However, these different developmental fates are only manifest because of an underlying variation in the expression pattern of interacting proteins. This shows that the morphological outcomes of changes to protein sequence and gene expression must be interpreted in the context of the wider regulatory network. It also suggests an explanation for the surprisingly widespread duplications of some of the floral transcription factors.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3aevolution 3amales 3amodels 3aflowers 3agene duplication 3aamino acids 3agene expression 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aprotein-protein interactions 3afemales 0aproteins1 aBergonzi, Sara1 aDavies, Brendan0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 2, v. 107, no. 44 p.18898-18902dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10090501073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03147naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008600204300002000290506007600310520171500386506003702101650001802138650001002156650001102166650001302177650001302190650000902203650002402212650001802236650001502254650001702269650001702286700002502303700001802328700001802346700002102364700002402385773017502409852000902584856008302593946001302676655001202689IND4444610520221207135301.0101105e20101102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444461052DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10132301072doi7 aPMC29738522pmcid7 a209563292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerwold, Thomas10aT-cell receptor-driven lymphomagenesis in mice derived from a reprogrammed T cell  ap. 18939-18943.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe conversion of mature somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, both by nuclear transfer and transduction with specific "reprogramming" genes, represents a major advance in regenerative medicine. Pluripotent stem cell lines can now be generated from an individual's own cells, facilitating the generation of immunologically acceptable stem cell-based therapeutics. Many cell types can undergo nuclear reprogramming, leading to the question of whether the identity of the reprogrammed cell of origin has a biological consequence. Peripheral blood, containing a mixture of T, B, NK, and myeloid cell types, represents one potential source of reprogrammable cells. In this study, we describe the unique case of mice derived from a reprogrammed T cell. These mice have prerearranged T-cell receptor (TCR) genes in all cells. Surprisingly, [almost equal to]50% of mice with prerearranged TCR genes develop spontaneous T cell lymphomas, which originate in the thymus. The lymphomas arise from developing T cells, and contain activated Notch1, similar to most human and mouse T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphomas. Furthermore, lymphomagenesis requires the expression of both prerearranged TCRα and TCRβ genes, indicating a critical role for TCR signaling. Furthermore, inhibitors of multiple branches of TCR signaling suppress lymphoma growth, implicating TCR signaling as an essential component in lymphoma proliferation. The lymphomagenesis in mice derived from a reprogrammed T cell demonstrates the deleterious consequences of misregulation of the TCR rearrangement and signaling pathways and illustrates one case of cellular reprogramming where the identity of the cell of origin has profound consequences.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3agenes 3ahumans 3alymphoma 3amedicine 3amice 3asignal transduction 3asomatic cells 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3athymus gland1 aHochedlinger, Konrad1 aSwindle, John1 aHedgpeth, Joe1 aJaenisch, Rudolf1 aWeissman, Irving L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Nov. 2, v. 107, no. 44 p.18939-18943dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10132301073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02094naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001500136245013100151300001600282500002400298520088900322650001101211650001601222650002201238650002001260650001001280650003901290650001301329650002401342650003701366650002601403650001601429650002001445650001101465700001301476700001901489700001501508700001301523773008801536852000901624856003901633655001201672IND4432546320221122115323.0100205e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443254632DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.17362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Feng10aCloning and characterization of a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD⁺) gene from the halotolerant yeast Pichia farinosa  ap. 115-121.  aIncludes references  aIn this study, a novel glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD⁺) (EC1.1.1.8) gene (PfGPD) was cloned from halotolerant yeast Pichia farinosa, using degenerate reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) methods. The full-length cDNA of the PfGPD gene is 1403 bp, which has an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 370 amino acids. PfGPD is conserved with other glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes and presents a single copy in the P. farinosa genome. Transcriptional analysis revealed that PfGPD gene expression level was high after 2 h induction in a hyperosmotic environment containing 2 M NaCl and returned to normal within 6 h. These results suggest that the PfGPD gene is induced by salt stress. Yeast complementation experiment indicated that PfGPD complements gpd1 mutation in S. cerevisiae.

Here, we compared somatic growth rates and clutch sizes of Daphnia magna reared on a diet of low food quality (Synechococcus elongatus) and of high food quality (Cryptomonas sp.) and investigated if and to what extent the absence of sterols or PUFAs in the cyanobacterium S. elongatus accounts for the observed differences in food quality. The supplementation of S. elongatus with cell-free lipid extracts (fatty acids, sterols, total lipids) obtained from the flagellate Cryptomonas sp. suggested that the superior food quality of Cryptomonas sp. is predominantly, but not completely, a combined effect of its sterol and PUFA composition. Our laboratory study suggests that somatic growth of D. magna feeding on S. elongatus is primarily constrained by the absence of sterols, whereas egg production is primarily limited by the absence of long chain PUFAs. 3aCryptomonas 3aDaphnia magna 3aSynechococcus elongatus 3aclutch size 3adiet 3afoods 3afreshwater 3aherbivores 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arearing 3asterols1 avon Elert, Eric0 tAquatic ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 43, no. 4 p.943-950dSpringer Netherlandsx1386-25887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10452-009-9239-6 7aarticle02284naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002300158245011400181300001800295500002400313520131600337650001501653650001401668650001101682650001701693650002001710650001301730700002201743773011701765852000901882856007901891655001201970IND4413399420221122115215.0081205e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441339942DNAL7 a216281562pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.08002772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDriouich, Azeddine10aIntercourse between cell wall and cytoplasm exemplified by arabinogalactan proteins and cortical microtubules  ap. 1491-1497.  aIncludes references  aHow does a plant cell sense and respond to the status of its cell wall? Intercourse between cell wall and cytoplasm has long been supposed to involve arabinogalactan proteins, in part because many of them are anchored to the plasma membrane. Disrupting arabinogalactan proteins has recently been shown to disrupt the array of cortical microtubules present just inside the plasma membrane, implying that microtubules and arabinogalactan proteins interact. In this article, we assess possibilities for how this interaction might be mediated. First, we consider microdomains in the plasma membrane (lipid rafts), which have been alleged to link internal and external regions of the plasma membrane; however, the characteristics and even the existence of these domains remains controversial. Next, we point out that disrupting the synthesis of cellulose also can disrupt microtubules and consider whether arabinogalactan proteins are part of a network linking microtubules and nascent microfibrils. Finally, we outline several signaling cascades that could transmit information from arabinogalactan proteins to microtubules through channels of cellular communication. These diverse possibilities highlight the work that remains to be done before we can understand how plant cells communicate across their membranes. 3acell walls 3acellulose 3alipids 3amicrotubules 3aplasma membrane 3aproteins1 aBaskin, Tobias I.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2008 Dec., v. 95, no. 12 p.1491-1497dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.08002773Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02609naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245011700205300002000322506007600342520121500418506003701633650001601670650002601686650001001712650001201722650002101734650001501755650001701770650001401787650002201801650000901823700002301832700002401855700002801879773017501907852000902082856008302091946001302174655001202187IND4444608820221207135313.0101105e20101102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444460882DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10073871072doi7 aPMC29738982pmcid7 a209563312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcMahon, Michael10aKeap1 perceives stress via three sensors for the endogenous signaling molecules nitric oxide, zinc, and alkenals  ap. 18838-18843.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecognition and repair of cellular damage is crucial if organisms are to survive harmful environmental conditions. In mammals, the Keap1 protein orchestrates this response, but how it perceives adverse circumstances is not fully understood. Herein, we implicate NO, Zn²⁺, and alkenals, endogenously occurring chemicals whose concentrations increase during stress, in this process. By combining molecular modeling with phylogenetic, chemical, and functional analyses, we show that Keap1 directly recognizes NO, Zn²⁺, and alkenals through three distinct sensors. The C288 alkenal sensor is of ancient origin, having evolved in a common ancestor of bilaterans. The Zn²⁺ sensor minimally comprises H225, C226, and C613. The most recent sensor, the NO sensor, emerged coincident with an expansion of the NOS gene family in vertebrates. It comprises a cluster of basic amino acids (H129, K131, R135, K150, and H154) that facilitate S-nitrosation of C151. Taken together, our data suggest that Keap1 is a specialized sensor that quantifies stress by monitoring the intracellular concentrations of NO, Zn²⁺, and alkenals, which collectively serve as second messengers that may signify danger and/or damage.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamino acids 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3amammals 3amolecular models 3amonitoring 3anitric oxide 3aphylogeny 3asecond messengers 3azinc1 aLamont, Douglas J.1 aBeattie, Kenneth A.1 aHayes, J.

  1 aGao, J.10aEffects of Yeast Culture in Broiler Diets on Performance and Immunomodulatory Functions  ap. 1377-1384.  a2019-12-04  aA study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplemental yeast culture (Diamond V XP Yeast Culture; YC) in broiler diets on performance, digestibility, mucosal development, and immunomodulatory functions. One-day-old Arbor Acres chicks (n = 960) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments based on corn and soybean meal and containing 0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 g/kg of YC in the diet for 42 d. Each treatment consisted of 12 replicates of 20 broilers each. Nutrient digestibility was determined on d 15 and 35 by total fecal collection. On d 21 and 42, 12 birds per treatment were sacrificed to evaluate gut morphology and secretory IgA. Broilers were vaccinated with Newcastle disease vaccine by eye drop on d 7 and 28 and antibody titer was determined on d 14, 21, 35, and 42. Dietary supplemental YC at 2.5 g/kg improved average daily gain and feed conversion during grower and overall periods (P <= 0.05). Yeast culture supplementation increased digestibility of Ca (linear and quadratic, P = 0.01) and P (linear, P = 0.01) on d 35, but did not affect (P > 0.05) protein retention and energy digestibility. Villus height to crypt depth ratios in the duodenum and jejunum (d 42) and ileum (d 21) were increased (P <= 0.05) in broilers fed 2.5 g/kg of YC. Yeast culture increased antibody titers to Newcastle disease virus (linear, P <= 0.05), serum lysozyme activity (linear and cubic, P <= 0.05), and IgM (linear, P <= 0.05) and secretary IgA concentrations in the duodenum (linear, P = 0.01). Results of this study indicate that dietary supplemental YC at 2.5 g/kg improved growth performance. Dietary YC affected immune functions, digestibility of Ca and P, and intestinal mucosal morphology of broilers. Growth performance was optimized at 2.5 g/kg of YC in the present study. Immune function could be modified with dietary YC supplementation. 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3avaccination 3aphosphorus 3abroiler chickens 3aantibodies 3anutrient uptake 3afeces 3aliveweight gain 3avilli 3afeed supplements 3adigestible energy 3abroiler feeding 3afeed conversion 3acalcium 3ayeasts 3aintestinal absorption 3aimmune system 3aintestinal crypts 3adosage 3adietary minerals 0aintestinal mucosa 0aNewcastle disease virus 0aintestines 0aprotein retention1 aZhang, H.J.1 aYu, S.H.1 aWu, S.G.1 aYoon, I.1 aQuigley, J.1 aGao, Y.P.1 aQi, G.H.0 tPoultry science.g2008 July, v. 87, no. 7 p.1377-1384dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2007-004183Available from publisher's Web site  a20080917b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle04114naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001300228245016700241300001800408520184500426650002102271650001602292650002002308650002302328650002102351650001902372650002102391650002602412650001402438650002502452650002002477650001802497650002302515650001602538650001602554650002002570650001402590650002202604650001802626650002102644650002502665650002002690650001202710650002902722650002302751650004802774650004102822650002502863650002002888650001502908650000902923650001302932650004502945650001602990700001503006700001403021700001503035700001503050700001403065773010403079852000903183856008103192930003303273945002503306946001303331655001203344IND4407256420221122085844.0080627e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440725642DNAL7 a185776072pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2008-000232doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWang, L.10aEffects of Forsythia suspensa Extract on Growth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility, and Antioxidant Activities in Broiler Chickens Under High Ambient Temperature  ap. 1287-1294.  aA 42-d trial was conducted with 252 broiler chickens (d 1 of age, 38.8 ± 1.3 g of BW) to determine the effects of Forsythia suspensa extract on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and antioxidant activities under high ambient temperature (32 ± 1°C). The feeding program consisted of a starter diet from d 1 to 21 of age and a finisher diet from d 22 to 42 of age. Dietary treatments included a negative control group (NC) fed a cornsoybean meal based diet without vitamin C or Forsythia suspensa extract, a positive control group fed a diet with 200 mg of vitamin C/kg, and a test group (FS) fed with 100 mg of Forsythia suspensa extract/kg. There were 14 cages per treatment and 6 birds per cage during the study. Birds had free access to diets and water during the entire period. Body weight and feed intake were measured at d 21 and 42. Blood and tissue samples were collected at d 21 and 42 for assay of antioxidant indices. Growth performance did not differ among treatment groups during the starter period. In the finisher phase, birds in FS had greater (P < 0.05) average daily gain, feed conversion, and apparent digestibility of energy, CP, calcium, and phosphorus than birds in NC. Furthermore, birds in FS had greater (P < 0.05) total antioxidant capacity and superoxide dismutase activity and lower (P < 0.05) malondialdehyde activity in the serum than birds in NC. The FS birds had greater (P < 0.05) muscle superoxide dismutase activity and lower (P < 0.05) malondialdehyde than NC birds. During the entire period, hepatic superoxide dismutase activity of FS birds was greater (P < 0.05) than that of NC birds. Dietary supplementation with Forsythia suspensa extract can enhance nutrient digestibility and growth performance possibly by reducing oxidative stress of broiler chickens under high ambient temperatures. 3abroiler chickens 3aheat stress 3aair temperature 3aForsythia suspensa 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3afeed supplements 3anutrient availability 3adigestion 3aantioxidant activity 3abroiler feeding 3aascorbic acid 3aad libitum feeding 3abody weight 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 3afinishing 3adigestible energy 3acrude protein 3adietary minerals 3asuperoxide dismutase 3amalondialdehyde 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aBiphenyl Compounds 2aChickensxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aDigestionxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aForsythiaxchemistry 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrazines 2aMale 2aPicrates 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aTemperature1 aPiao, X.L.1 aKim, S.W.1 aPiao, X.S.1 aShen, Y.B.1 aLee, H.S.0 tPoultry science.g2008 July, v. 87, no. 7 p.1287-1294dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2008-000233Available from publisher's Web site  a20080918b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle03077naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245008000208300002000288506007600308520170600384506003702090650002102127650002502148650001702173650001102190650001402201650002502215650001102240650001302251650002702264650000902291700002802300700002602328700002002354773017602374852000902550856008302559946001302642655001202655IND4444269320221207131814.0101029e20101026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444426932DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10057291072doi7 aPMC29729332pmcid7 a209379062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFindlay, Heather E.10aUnfolding free energy of a two-domain transmembrane sugar transport protein  ap. 18451-18456.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding how an amino acid sequence folds into a functional, three-dimensional structure has proved to be a formidable challenge in biological research, especially for transmembrane proteins with multiple alpha helical domains. Mechanistic folding studies on helical membrane proteins have been limited to unusually stable, single domain proteins such as bacteriorhodopsin. Here, we extend such work to flexible, multidomain proteins and one of the most widespread membrane transporter families, the major facilitator superfamily, thus showing that more complex membrane proteins can be successfully refolded to recover native substrate binding. We determine the unfolding free energy of the two-domain, Escherichia coli galactose transporter, GalP; a bacterial homologue of human glucose transporters. GalP is reversibly unfolded by urea. Urea causes loss of substrate binding and a significant reduction in alpha helical content. Full recovery of helical structure and substrate binding occurs in dodecylmaltoside micelles, and the unfolding free energy can be determined. A linear dependence of this free energy on urea concentration allows the free energy of unfolding in the absence of urea to be determined as +2.5 kcal·mol⁻¹. Urea has often been found to be a poor denaturant for transmembrane helical structures. We attribute the denaturation of GalP helices by urea to the dynamic nature of the transporter structure allowing denaturant access via the substrate binding pocket, as well as to helical structure that extends beyond the membrane. This study gives insight into the final, critical folding step involving recovery of ligand binding for a multidomain membrane transporter.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aamino acid sequences 3adenaturation 3aenergy 3agalactose 3aglucose transporters 3ahumans 3amicelles 3atransmembrane proteins 3aurea1 aRutherford, Nicholas G.1 aHenderson, Peter J.F.1 aBooth, Paula J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2010 Oct. 26, v. 107, no. 43 p.18451-18456dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10057291073Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03347naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001600194245011700210300001800327500001500345520152900360650002201889650002201911650002201933650002001955650001801975650002201993650002002015650001002035650002302045650001002068650002102078650001202099650001202111650002002123650004302143650002002186650003802206650003002244650003802274650004002312650004402352653001102396700001602407700001702423700001902440700002102459773010402480852000902584856008102593930003302674945002502707946001302732655001202745IND4407256920221122085817.0080627e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440725692DNAL7 a185776122pmid7 a10.3382/ps.2008-000512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Spots were analyzed with Phoretix software and compared between the 2 breeds. Proteins differentially expressed were arrayed on a map, plotting molecular weight against isoelectric point. Eight discrete zones were identified, 5 that included only proteins unique to susceptible cells and 3 that included proteins unique to resistant cells. Of the 88 differentially expressed proteins from susceptible cells, 41 were located in unique zones, whereas 29 of 82 differentially expressed proteins from resistant cells were in unique zones. Selected proteins from susceptibility, and resistance zones were annotated by peptide mass fragments, molecular weights, isoelectric points, and correspondence with genes differentially expressed between cells from the 2 breeds. Some of the annotated proteins (such as smooth muscle myosin phosphatase, myosin heavy chain, fatty acid-binding protein, ribophorin, heat shock protein, and tumor necrosis factor α-inducing factor) corresponded to the current hypotheses to explain atherogenesis. In addition, the unique electrophoretic migration zones of proteins associated with susceptibility or resistance should prove useful as a diagnostic tool in clinical settings where species or phenotypes, or both, susceptible or resistant to atherosclerosis can be identified. 3abreed differences 3adisease diagnosis 3aprotein synthesis 3aatherosclerosis 3asmooth muscle 3aisoelectric point 3agene expression 3agenes 3adisease resistance 3aaorta 3amolecular weight 3apigeons 2aAnimals 2aAortaxcytology 2aAtherosclerosisxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aCells, Cultured 2aColumbidaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aLipoproteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPoultry Diseasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0abreeds1 aSmith, E.C.1 aGilman, M.L.1 aAnderson, J.L.1 aTaylor, R.L.

  1 aDavis, K.A.10aFear Responses of Offspring from Divergent Quail Stress Response Line Hens Treated with Corticosterone During Egg Formation  ap. 1303-1313.  aIncreased fearfulness has been associated with adrenocortical activation. Maternal corticosterone (B) treatment increases egg B, and elevated B in ovo enhances chick avoidance of humans. Quail selected for exaggerated (high stress, HS) rather than reduced (low stress, LS) plasma B response to stress are more fearful, and more B is found in HS hen eggs. Thus, we used tonic immobility (TI) and hole-in-the-wall box (HWB) emergence tests to assess fear in chicks hatched from eggs of LS and HS hens implanted with B or no B (CON). The number of inductions required to attain TI, latency to first alert head movement, and duration of TI were determined in one study and the latency until first vocalization (LATVOC), numbers of vocalizations (VOCS), proportions of chicks vocalizing, and the latencies to head (HE) and full-body (FE) emergence from a HWB were assessed in another. The LS chicks required less inductions (P < 0.0005) and had shorter latency to first alert head movement (P < 0.02) than HS chicks, although the duration of TI was unaffected by any of the treatments. During the acclimation period of the HWB tests, more (proportions of chicks vocalizing; P < 0.0001) HS chicks alarm-called sooner (LATVOC; P < 0.0001) and more often (VOCS; P < 0.0001) than did LS chicks, and, although maternal implant treatment did not affect LATVOC, progeny of B-implanted hens showed a tendency toward less (P < 0.07) VOCS than the CON. Chicks hatched from eggs of B-implant mothers also took longer to achieve HE (P < 0.06) and FE (P < 0.05) from the HWB than did their CON counterparts. Stress line, implantation treatment, and their interaction did not alter HE or FE responses. The data suggest that quail stress line genome may or may not be affecting certain fear and alarm responses in chicks via the same mechanism(s) that underlies how elevating maternal B increases egg levels of B that in turn alters the fear behavior of progeny. 3aquails 3aanimal stress 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3acorticosterone 3amaternal effect 3afearfulness 3aoogenesis 3achicks 3aacclimation 3adrug implants 3agenome 2aAcclimatization 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCorticosteronexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCoturnixxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFearxphysiology 2aFemale 2aOviposition 2aOvum 2aProstheses and Implants 2aSelection, Genetic 2aStress, Physiological 2aVocalization, Animal 0ain ovo exposure 0atonic immobility1 aSchmidt, J.B.1 aDoescher, R.M.1 aSatterlee, D.G.0 tPoultry science.g2008 July, v. 87, no. 7 p.1303-1313dPoultry Science Associationx0032-57917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/ps.2008-000833Available from publisher's Web site  a20080917b20081011c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/09/11  aOther US 7aarticle01687naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013400126300001600260500002400276500002300300520068400323650001901007650001301026650000901039650002401048650001001072650001401082650001301096650001401109700001701123700001701140773009201157852000901249856009101258655001201349IND4468901120221122060640.0130624s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446890112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForcada, F.10aRegulation of LH secretion during seasonal anestrus by dopaminergic pathways in Rasa Aragonesa ewes treated or not with melatonin  ap. 311-313.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aThe involvement of the dopaminergic system in the steroid-dependent inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion during anestrus in ovariectomized, estradiol-implanted adult Rasa Aragonesa ewes was investigated in both ewes treated with melatonin on 8 March (n = 10) and in control (n = 8) ewes. Melatonin implants did not significantly increase LH secretion. However, treatment with pimozide induced a significant increase (P < 0.05) in LH pulse frequency in both groups during early anestrus. We conclude that, in the absence of males, the dopaminergic system is clearly involved in the inhibition of LH secretion during anestrus in both melatonin-treated and control ewes. 3aRasa Aragonesa 3aanestrus 3aewes 3aluteinizing hormone 3amales 3amelatonin 3apimozide 3asecretion1 aAbecia, J.A.1 aZúñiga, O.0 tCanadian journal of animal science.g2003 June, v. 83, no. 2 p.311-313x0008-39847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjas.html3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01346naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007100126300001600197500002400213500002300237520039900260650001500659650002700674650001600701650001000717650000900727700002300736700001200759700001200771700001300783700002000796773009200816852000900908856009100917655001201008IND4468901420221122051711.0130624s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446890142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkine, E.K.10aInfluence of canola oil on the fatty acid profile in goats’ milk  ap. 323-325.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aFour Alpine does were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design to determine the effects of feeding canola oil at four levels: 0, 2, 4 and 6% on milk fatty acid profile.

The effects of grinder screen opening size [25.4 to 127.0 mm (1.0 to 5.0 in.)] and feedstock type on ground particle size, bulk density of ground biomass, throughput, specific energy consumption, and cost of grinding were studied. The bulk density of ground biomass ranged from 69 to 207 kg/m 3 with the moisture content of particles ranging from 14% to 39% (w.b.). The throughput of the grinder ranged from 6 to 45 t/h. The specific energy consumption ranged from 93 to 661 MJ/t. The estimated cost of grinding ranged from $4.39 to $31.23/t. Increasing the grinder screen opening size increased the ground particle size and throughput, but decreased the bulk density of ground biomass, specific energy consumption, and cost of grinding. High moisture bales (>= 25% w.b.) decreased the performance of the grinder. The results from this study would be useful for developing a biomass supply logistics system involving mobile grinding. 3abiomass 3abulk density 3acorn stover 3agrasses 3agrinding 3aparticle size 3aspecific energy 3awater content1 aSchmidt, David R.1 aMorey, R.

This station is an ideal site for monitoring long-range transport of atmospheric pollutants from mainland China and Southeast Asia to South China Sea. Annual average GEM concentration was 1.58 ± 0.71 ng m⁻³ during the monitoring period, which was close to background values in the Northern Hemisphere. GEM concentrations showed a clear seasonal variation with relatively higher levels in autumn (1.86 ± 0.55 ng m⁻³) and winter (1.80 ± 0.62 ng m⁻³) and lower levels in spring (1.16 ± 0.45 ng m⁻³) and summer (1.43 ± 0.46 ng m⁻³). Long-range atmospheric transport dominated by monsoons was a dominant factor influencing the seasonal variations of GEM. The GEM diel trends were related to the wind speed and long-range atmospheric mercury transport. We observed 30 pollution episodes throughout the monitoring period. The analysis of wind direction and backward trajectory suggested that elevated GEM concentrations at the monitoring site were primarily related to the outflows of atmospheric Hg from mainland China and the Indochina peninsula. The △GEM/△CO values also suggested that GEM was significantly affected by the long-range transport from the anthropogenic sources and biomass burning in Asia and Indochina peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aautumn 3abiomass 3aburning 3amercury 3amonitoring 3amonsoon season 3apollutants 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awind speed 3awinter 3aChina 3aIndochina 3aSouth China Sea 3aSouth East Asia1 aChen, Laiguo1 aXie, Donghai1 aSun, Jiaren1 aHe, Qiusheng1 aCai, Limei1 aGao, Zhiqiang1 aZhang, Yiqiang0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Nov., v. 23, no. 21 p.21631-21640dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7432-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012100157300001600278500002000294520139500314592002801709650001901737650003001756650001701786650001901803650001501822650002101837650001701858650002101875651001101896651001401907700001901921700001401940700001801954700001801972700002201990700001902012700001702031700001802048773013402066856007402200852000902274655001202283IND60783139420221118234446.0220715e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078313942DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.125682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShultz, Aaron10aCase study: Applying the resist–accept–direct framework to an Ojibwe Tribe's relationship with the natural world  ap. 392-408.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOjibwe Tribes' approach to the natural world is guided by the original treaties between beings (species and spirits) and the Ojibwe people who reside in lands now known as the United States and Canada. Relationships with these beings, such as ogaa (walleye Sander vitreus), are best characterised as taking care of a relative/gift for the next seven generations of Ojibwe. Initial denial of treaty rights by the state government has strongly influenced tribes' relationship with their relatives for over 100 years. Ogaa stocks and natural reproduction have declined in the Minocqua Chain of Lakes (Wisconsin, USA) over the last 20 years. Region‐wide declines in ogaa have been attributed to many stressors such as overharvest by state‐licensed anglers, invasive species and climate change. Here, we retroactively applied the resist–accept–direct (RAD) framework to the process used to create an interjurisdictional rehabilitation plan for the Minocqua Chain of Lakes. Specifically, we cover the following: progress to date on the rehabilitation plan; subsistence, cultural and spiritual challenges associated with resisting ecosystem change; unforeseen obstacles to rehabilitation; re‐evaluation of the relationship with ogaa; unknowns; and contingency plans from a tribal perspective. Lastly, we discuss how the RAD framework could become more useful to tribes in the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander vitreus 3aadministrative management 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3ainvasive species 3areproduction 3astate government 3aCanada 3aWisconsin1 aLuehring, Mark1 aRay, Adam1 aRose, Joe Dan1 aCroll, Robert1 aGilbert, Jonathan1 aPrice, Michael1 aGraveen, Joe1 aChapman, Lyle0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 4 p.392-408dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867078x0969-997X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.125683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001400137245011000151300001600261500002000277520134900297592002801646650001401674650002201688650001901710650001401729650001501743650002001758650001801778650002401796650000901820650001601829700001601845700001901861700001601880700001301896700001701909700001701926773012301943856007102066852000902137655001202146IND60588538520221117233241.0180118e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058853852DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.47302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Can10aEarly flowering and rapid grain filling determine early maturity and escape from harvesting in weedy rice  ap. 465-476.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Early maturity is an important trait that is essential to the survival of weedy rice. To explore the mechanism of early maturity in weedy rice, the reproductive development of a large sample of weedy rice accessions and cultivars was compared in a common garden study. A selected sample of both weedy and cultivated rice was sown at different dates in two years to study in more detail their flowering and grain‐filling patterns. RESULTS: The weedy rice from three major cropping regions matured 7‐8 days earlier than their associated cultivars. Representative weedy rice accessions planted on conventional sowing dates flowered 3‐26 days earlier than cultivars; delayed sowing caused divergence in the flowering regimes in weedy rice. However, regardless of the sowing date, weedy rice filled its grain 7‐21 days faster than cultivars in both study years. Vegetative and reproductive traits of weedy and cultivated rice have different patterns of variation with delayed planting. CONCLUSION: Early maturity is an essential factor determining the persistence of weedy rice by contributing to the escape of its seed from being harvested with the rice crop. Both early flowering and shorter grain‐filling stages determine early maturity, and flowering is more plastic than grain filling. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3acultivars 3aearly development 3afilling period 3aflowering 3aharvesting 3apest management 3aplanting date 3areproductive traits 3arice 3asowing date1 aXu, Wenrong1 aSong, Xiaoling1 aDai, Weimin1 aDai, Lei1 aZhang, Zheng1 aQiang, Sheng0 tPest management science.g2018 Feb., v. 74, no. 2 p.465-476dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.47303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013700195300001600332500001400348500002000362520146400382592002801846596008701874596007401961596007002035596010502105650002702210650001002237650001102247650001002258650001902268650001302287650000902300650001102309650001902320650001802339650002002357700001702377700001802394700001402412700001702426700001702443700001502460773012002475856007302595852000902668655001202677IND60723029620221119035334.0210110e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072302962DNAL7 a10.1111/are.149152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jichen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3782-905310aTranscriptome analysis reveals the effects of sand substrate removal and body colour change of kuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus  ap. 577-588.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aKuruma shrimp, Marsupenaeus japonicus, is an important economic species widely cultured in the world. Kuruma shrimp usually are cultured in the ponds with sand substrates, which could cause multiple pollutions to the environment. In this study, we investigated a new kuruma shrimp culture pattern by removing the sand substrates at the pond bottom and replacing with plastic membranes. The result showed that kuruma shrimp survived in the pond without sand substrates. The body colour of adult kuruma shrimp in the experimental group was dark blue, obviously different from the brown body colour in shrimps cultured under normal conditions. A comprehensive study of gene profiling by transcriptome analysis provided a new perspective to understand the impact of removing sand substrates on kuruma shrimp. A total of 60,780 genes were obtained in the transcriptome sequencing. 1,005 DEGs were identified in gills with 427 genes were up‐regulated and 578 genes were down‐regulated. Meanwhile, only 115 DEGs were identified in hepatopancreas with 41 genes were up‐regulated and 74 genes were down‐regulated. Multiple essential genes were inhibited, such as actin. The expression levels of crustacyanin subunit A and C were significantly higher in the shrimp cultured without sand substrates than that shrimp cultured in normal conditions. The body colour change may be a self‐protection strategy for kuruma shrimp to deal with environmental challenges.  aPublisher supplied data  a2319412525cThe Project of 2019 Annual Guangdong Provincial Special Financial Fund  a2020B0202010009cthe Guangdong Province Key Field R&D Program Project  aAD19008017cthe Fangchenggang Science and Technology Plan Project  a013S19006‐007cthe Fund of Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory(Zhanjiang) 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3aactin 3aadults 3acolor 3ahepatopancreas 3aresearch 3asand 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aLiu, Xueting1 aLiao, Xuzheng1 aHe, Zihao1 aChen, Xieyan1 aSun, Chengbo1 aNi, Zuotao0 tAquaculture research.g2021 Feb., v. 52, no. 2 p.577-588dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.149153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02504naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013700175300001300312520090700325592002801232650001101260650001901271650002301290650002001313650001901333650000901352650000901361650002201370650001701392650002301409650001701432650001901449650001001468650000901478650001701487650001401504650001301518650001701531650001501548653001901563653001701582653001701599653002301616653000901639653001701648700002101665700002201686700002401708700001901732773009201751856008601843852000901929655001201938IND60635703120221123033339.0210114e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063570312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.08.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChikwanha, Obert C.10aGrape pomace (Vitis vinifera L. cv.

Dry matter intake increased quadratically with a critical value (i.e., optimum inclusion level) of 11.3% GP (P ≤ 0.05). Diet exhibited similar quadratic responses for average daily gain, live, hot and cold carcass weights with optimum inclusion levels at 9.6, 9.7, 12, 2 and 12.1, respectively (P ≤ 0.05). Overall, meat quality traits were not negatively affected by GP inclusion (P > .05). Gross profit was influenced by diet, with an optimum inclusion level at 12.2% (quadratic; P ≤ 0.05). Overall, inclusion of 12.2% GP in lamb finishing diets at the expense of oat bran and wheat bran middlings improved lamb productivity, without compromising meat quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aVitis vinifera 3aaverage daily gain 3acarcass quality 3acarcass weight 3acold 3adiet 3adry matter intake 3agrape pomace 3agrowth performance 3alamb feeding 3alamb finishing 3alambs 3ameat 3ameat quality 3amiddlings 3aoat bran 3asolar drying 3awheat bran 0aCarcass traits 0aGrape pomace 0aGross profit 0aGrowth performance 0aLamb 0aMeat quality1 aMuchenje, Voster1 aNolte, Joubert E.1 aDugan, Michael E.R.1 aMapiye, Cletos0 tMeat science.g2019 Jan., v. 147 p.6-12dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.08.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245010700156520133000263592002801593650001801621650001201639650001101651650002501662650002501687650002101712650001601733650002201749650001701771650001101788650002601799651001001825700001601835700002001851700001401871700001701885773011901902856007202021852000902093655001202102IND60648710220221120172930.0190701e20170723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064871022DNAL7 a10.3390/f80702632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jiameng10aSpatiotemporal Distribution and Driving Factors of Forest Biomass Carbon Storage in China: 1977–2013  aIncreasing forest vegetation is important for carbon dynamics and to maintain the ecological and environmental balance in China. However, there is little understanding of how socioeconomic factors affect forest biomass carbon storage (FBCS). Here, we used continuous functions for biomass expansion factors and China’s seven completed forest inventories to estimate the changes in FBCS for 31 provinces in mainland China between 1977 and 2013. We developed a model that decomposes the contribution of the different socioeconomic factors driving FBCS. We found China’s FBCS increased from 4972 TgC (1 Tg = 1012g) in 1977–1981 to 7435 TgC in 2009–2013, with a mean growth of 77 TgC/a, and the average forest carbon density increased from 36.0 to 38.9Mg/ha (1 Mg = 106g), mainly due to the arbor forest contribution. Among the seven regions in China, the southwestern region currently accounts for the highest proportion (37.3%) of national FBCS, followed by northeastern (19.7%), northern (12.5%) and eastern region (10.8%). The main socio-economic factors affecting FBCS were forest land dependence, industrial structure and economic development level. Optimizing forest type and age structure, improving forest productivity, and strengthening forest management are feasible options to further increase China’s FBCS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aage structure 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3aeconomic development 3aforest inventory 3aforest land 3aforest management 3aforest types 3amodels 3asocioeconomic factors 3aChina1 aJi, Xiaoxia1 aDeane, David C.1 aWu, Linyu1 aChen, Shulin0 tForests.g2017 July 23, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80702633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006400139245014500203300001600348500002000364520120700384592002801591596003901619596002501658596004001683596004701723650002301770650003001793650001201823650001401835650001301849650001801862650001301880650001701893651001101910651001501921651001401936700001901950700005901969700002002028700002002048700006102068700002302129700002102152700002302173700001602196773013402212856007402346852000902420655001202429IND60783139520221118234547.0220715e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078313952DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.125672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Sarah Lindley1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6905-242910aReview of adaptations of U.S. Commercial Fisheries in response to the COVID‐19 pandemic using the Resist‐Accept‐Direct (RAD) framework  ap. 439-455.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe COVID‐19 pandemic transformed social and economic systems globally, including fisheries systems. Decreases in seafood demand, supply chain disruptions, and public safety regulations required numerous adaptations to maintain the livelihoods and social resilience of fishing communities. Surveys, interviews, and focus groups were undertaken to assess impacts from and adaptive responses to the pandemic in commercial fisheries in five U.S. regions: the Northeast, California, Alaska, the U.S. Caribbean, and the Pacific Islands. Fishery adaptation strategies were categorized using the Resist–Accept–Direct (RAD) framework, a novel application to understand social transformation in a social‐ecological system in response to a disturbance. A number of innovations emerged, or were facilitated, that could improve the fisheries' resilience to future disruptions. Fishers with diversified options and strategic flexibility generally fared better, i.e., had fewer disruptions to their livelihoods. Using the RAD framework to identify adaptation strategies from fishery system actors highlights opportunities for improving resilience of fisheries social‐ecological systems to future stressors.  aPublisher supplied data  a2019002753cClimate Program Office  cCalifornia Sea Grant  cCalifornia Ocean Protection Council  cCalifornia Department of Fish and Wildlife 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aadministrative management 3aecology 3afisheries 3apandemic 3apublic safety 3aseafoods 3asupply chain 3aAlaska 3aCalifornia 3aCaribbean1 aCook, Samantha1 aGolden, Abigail1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9849-62911 aIwane, Mia Aiko1 aKleiber, Danika1 aLeong, Kirsten M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5798-59771 aMastitski, Anthony1 aRichmond, Laurie1 aSzymkowiak, Maria,1 aWise, Sarah0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 4 p.439-455dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867078x0969-997X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.125673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01885naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245010900208300002000317520053500337592002800872653001500900653001500915653001700930653001200947700002500959700001900984700002001003700002501023700002401048700002401072700001801096700002901114700002501143700002501168773019401193856007901387852000901466655001201475IND60518024320221120210751.0160406e20151222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051802432DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.15092491122doi7 aPMC46973812pmcid7 a266445832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTinkum, Kelsey L.10aFasting protects mice from lethal DNA damage by promoting small intestinal epithelial stem cell survival  ap.

The aminotransferase encoded by BAT2 and alcohol acetyltransferases encoded by ATF1, ATF2, and Lg-ATF1 are involved in the production of branched-chain alcohols and synthesis of acetate esters, respectively. In this study, the effects of ATF1, ATF2, and Lg-ATF1 overexpressions with BAT2 deletion were explored in Chinese Baijiu yeast. The differences among these effects were also investigated. Results showed that the productions of acetate esters by mutant overexpressing ATF1 with BAT2 deletion and that overexpressing ATF2 with BAT2 deletion were 1353.45 and 73.40 mg/L, respectively, which were 43.16- and 2.34-fold higher than that by the original strain. Compared with mutant overexpressing ATF2 with BAT2 deletion, mutant overexpressing ATF1 with BAT2 deletion exhibited 48.17% decreased higher alcohol productivity. The production of higher alcohols in mutant overexpressing ATF2 with BAT2 deletion was similar to that in the BAT2 deletion mutant. Furthermore, no significant difference was observed between the BAT2 deletion mutant and the mutant overexpressing Lg-ATF1 with BAT2 deletion in terms of acetate ester and higher alcohol production. The mutants that have varying capacities for acetate ester and higher alcohol production can be potentially developed and applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetate esters 3aacetyltransferases 3aalcohols 3aflavor 3afood research 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amutants 3ayeasts1 aCui, Dan-Yao1 aWang, Jian-Hui1 aLiu, Xiao-Er1 aXu, Jia1 aZhou, Zheng1 aZhang, Cui-Ying1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4926-42021 aChen, Ye-Fu1 aXiao, Dong-Guang0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 Mar., v. 244, no. 3 p.555-564dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-017-2977-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04046naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005600147245019100203520252800394592002802922650002702950650002802977650001703005650002403022650001803046650001603064650000703080650002003087650001103107650001903118650002803137650001403165650001403179650001903193653003203212653001903244653002103263653001903284653000903303700001703312700001703329700001803346773012203364856008103486852000903567655001203576IND60729972920221120095604.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072997292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTenderis, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5661-378410aControlling growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas fluorescens in thermally processed ground beef by sodium lactate, encapsulated or unencapsulated polyphosphates incorporation  aThis work was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of using sodium lactate (SL), encapsulated (e) and unencapsulated (u) polyphosphates (PP; sodium tripolyphosphate, STP; sodium acid pyrophosphate, SPP), and various combinations of these additives on growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas fluorescens in cooked ground beef during 30 d refrigerated storage. The study consisted of two independent work packages as L. monocytogenes and P. fluorescens in the same experimental settings. During storage, analysis of oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), water activity (aw), pH, and counts of L. monocytogenes and P. fluorescens were carried out. Results indicated that there was no difference among the groups in terms of L. monocytogenes or P. fluorescens counts on processing day. Although only PP incorporated groups had higher (P < 0.05) P. fluorescens counts compared to those groups formulated with only SL at the end of storage, there were no differences among these groups regarding L. monocytogenes load. The lowest L. monocytogenes and P. fluorescens counts were determined in the samples containing a combination of SL with uSPP or eSPP or ueSPP at the end of storage (P < 0.05). A combinations of SL with uSTP or eSTP or ueSTP did not create further reduction in L. monocytogenes load then reduction level obtained by SL which had lower (P < 0.05) load compared to MO. The same combination groups had lower (P < 0.05) P. fluorescens counts then those of MO and SL groups. The lower (P < 0.05) ORP values were determined in all PP added groups during storage compared to control, MO and SL groups. ORP in all treatments generally increased (P < 0.05) with storage. There was no significant changes in pH during storage. A slight decrease (P < 0.05) in aw was determined during storage in P. fluorescens experiments, whereas aw levels was stable in case of L. monocytogenes. In general, the use of ePP did not create any significant changes on pH, aw, ORP values and counts of L. monocytogenes and P. fluorescens compared to that of uPP.This study showed that encapsulation is not a factor affecting antimicrobial efficiency of PP and using PP-SL combinations have synergistic effect on reducing the viability of L. monocytogenes and P. fluorescens and their subsequent growth ability in cooked ground beef. Therefore, cross-contamination of L. monocytogenes or P. fluorescens cells on RTE meat products may be controlled more effectively with combinations of SL with ePP or uPP or uePP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3acold storage 3across contamination 3aencapsulation 3aground beef 3apH 3aredox potential 3asodium 3asodium lactate 3asodium tripolyphosphate 3asynergism 3aviability 3awater activity 0aEncapsulated polyphosphates 0aSodium lactate 0aL. monocytogenes 0aP. fluorescens 0aBeef1 aKılıç, B.1 aYalçın, H.1 aŞimşek, A.,0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111169-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02654naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245015700164300002000321520135100341592002801692650001801720650001101738650001901749650002501768650001801793650002901811650003001840650001701870650002901887650001101916650002901927650002701956650002501983700002102008773014902029856008102178852000902259655001202268IND60569599920221122060420.0170608e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056959992DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-7413-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMert, Mehmet10aDo foreign direct investment and renewable energy consumption affect the CO2 emissions? New evidence from a panel ARDL approach to Kyoto Annex countries  ap. 21669-21681.  aThis study examines the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) and the potential of renewable energy consumption on carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions in 21 Kyoto countries using an unbalanced panel data. For this purpose, Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis was tested using panel cointegration analysis. Panel causality tests show that there are significant long-run causalities from the variables to carbon emissions, renewable energy consumption, fossil fuel energy consumption and inflow foreign direct investments. The results of our model support the pollution haloes hypothesis which states that FDI brings in clean technology and improves the environmental standards. However, an inverted U-shaped relationship (EKC) was not supported by the estimated model for the 21 Kyoto countries. This means that economic growth cannot ensure environmental protection itself or environmental goals cannot await economic growth. Another important finding is that renewable energy consumption decreases carbon emissions. Based on the empirical results, some important policy implications emerge. Kyoto countries should stimulate the FDI inflows and usage of renewable energy consumption to mitigate the air pollution and meet the emission targets. This paper provides new insights into environment and energy policies through FDI inclusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aeconomic development 3aenergy policy 3aenvironmental protection 3aforeign direct investment 3afossil fuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3asustainable technology 3atime series analysis1 aBölük, Gülden0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 Nov., v. 23, no. 21 p.21669-21681dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7413-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02621naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003200137245019300169300001600362500002000378520128500398592002801683650001901711650002501730650001201755650001101767650001301778650001601791650002701807650001701834650002301851650001201874650003001886650001001916650001001926651001001936700002601946700002401972773012301996856007102119852000902190655001202199IND60588538720221117233212.0180118e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058853872DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.47082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRubio‐Meléndez, María E10aTemporal and spatial distribution of insecticide‐resistance mutations in the green peach aphid Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on primary and secondary host plants in central Chile  ap. 340-347.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: The aphid Myzus persicae develops insensitivity to almost all classes of insecticides through target site mutations. The aim of this study was to assess the temporal and spatial distribution of resistant aphids that grow on peach trees and weeds, and establish the role of the secondary hosts as a reservoir of resistant genotypes. RESULTS: The frequency of genotypes (RR, RS, and SS) was affected by the host plant, mainly for knock‐down resistance (kdr) and modified acetylcholinesterase (MACE) mutations (P < 0.05). A higher frequency of RS and RR was observed in aphids found on peach trees than on weeds. The frequency of the R allele was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than expected in autumn and on weeds for the kdr and MACE mutations, while the frequency of the S allele was high in all seasons for all insecticide‐resistance mutations (P < 0.01). The most abundant multilocus genotype was characterized as being RS for the kdr mutation and SS for both super‐kdr and MACE. CONCLUSION: This study provides farm‐scale evidence that weeds are not an important reservoir of the R allele, but they are for the S allele. Hence, the presence of heterozygous genotypes on peach trees is most likely attributable to weeds. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aMyzus persicae 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aalleles 3aautumn 3agenotype 3ahost plants 3ainsecticide resistance 3ainsecticides 3aintermediate hosts 3apeaches 3asite-directed mutagenesis 3atrees 3aweeds 3aChile1 aSepúlveda, Daniela A1 aRamírez, Claudio C0 tPest management science.g2018 Feb., v. 74, no. 2 p.340-347dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.47083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01980naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009800159520082900257592002801086650002101114650001701135650001901152650001301171650001201184650001001196650001001206650001801216650001401234650001801248650001001266651001101276700002201287700002201309700002401331700002301355773012201378856007301500852000901573655001201582IND60674480920221118024733.0191025e20190928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067448092DNAL7 a10.3390/f101008472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzmidla, Hanna 10aImpact of Common Mistletoe (<i>Viscum album</i> L.) on Scots Pine Forests—A Call for Action  aCommon mistletoe is increasingly mentioned as contributing not only to the decline of deciduous trees at roadside and in city parks, but to conifers in stands. The presence of Viscum in fir stands has been known for many years, but since 2015 has also been the cause of damage to pine. In 2019, mistletoe was observed on 77.5 thousand hectares of Scots pine stands in southern and central Poland. Drought resulting from global climate change is implicated as an important factor conducive to weakening trees and making them more susceptible to the spread of mistletoe and other pests. This paper presents an overview of the latest information on the development of this semi-parasitic plant in Poland, its impact on tree breeding traits and raw material losses, as well as current options for its prevention and eradication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aViscum album 3aclimate change 3aconifers 3adrought 3aparks 3apests 3araw materials 3aroadsides 3atree breeding 3atrees 3aPoland1 aTkaczyk, Miłosz 1 aPlewa, Radosław 1 aTarwacki, Grzegorz 1 aSierota, Zbigniew 0 tForests.g2019 Sept. 28, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f101008473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007000167300001400237520192400251592002802175650006702203650002002270650001802290650001002308650001302318650005002331650001402381650001602395650002402411650001902435650001002454651001202464700001302476700001502489773009402504856008102598852000902679655001202688IND60087614720221122092952.0141102e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008761472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2012.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeraverbeke, S.13aAn alternative spectral index for rapid fire severity assessments  ap. 72-80.  aRapid fire severity assessments are essential for timely post-fire rehabilitation responses. The Landsat differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) has become the standard spectral index for assessing fire severity. The dNBR is generally calculated using the first available cloud-free post-fire image and a pre-fire image. This bi-temporal image differencing can be problematic due to image-to-image differences in illumination and phenology for example. We have developed an alternative index based on single date short-wave infrared (SWIR) and mid infrared (MIR) reflectance. In contrast with the (d)NBR, the SWIR–MIR index (SMI) is robust against scattering caused by smoke plumes over active fires allowing fire severity assessments to be generated when the area is still obscured by smoke. The SMI was generated using MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data acquired over the recent 2011 Wallow fire in Arizona, USA. Simulation experiments showed that the SMI is more sensitive to char fractional cover than the NBR. We performed a regression analysis in which 92 Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) field plots of severity were randomly assigned to two equal halves, a training and a validation dataset, during ten separate trials. The SMI performed better to estimate GeoCBI values than the NBR (SMI R²=0.69±0.06 and NBR R²=0.60±0.06). The dNBR demonstrated slightly better performance than the SMI (dNBR R²=0.71±0.05), however this difference was not significant at the 95% confidence level. Although no spaceborne sensors with pixel sizes smaller than 100m currently offer the possibility of a SWIR–MIR band combination, the airborne results illustrate the potential of this band combination for the remote sensing of post-fire effects. Such data will become available with the advent of the next generation satellite sensors, such as the planned spaceborne Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer 3adata collection 3afire severity 3afires 3alighting 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aphenology 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3asmoke 3aArizona1 aHook, S.1 aHulley, G.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2012 Aug., v. 123 p.72-80dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2012.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014200167520141400309592002801723650001601751650001101767650002201778650000901800650000901809650001301818650001901831650001801850650001401868650000701882650001301889650001801902650002501920650001801945653003101963653001601994653001902010653002002029653002202049700001702071700001702088700001702105700001702122700001802139700001402157700001302171700001502184700001802199700001402217700001402231700001702245773011202262856008602374852000902460655001202469IND60681565920221122065548.0210121e20200510xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068156592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wenbo12aA novel process for the biological detoxification of non-metal residue from waste copper clad laminate treatment: From lab to pilot scale  aA new process of biological detoxification and comprehensive utilization of non-metal residue from waste copper clad laminates treatment was proposed. The process mainly includes microbial cultivation, bioleaching, metal recovery, and wastewater treatment. The leaching rate of metal by bioleaching in acidic environment with pH1.0–2.0 was close to 100% and was 8.7% higher than that by dilute sulfuric acid leaching, and about 11.4% higher than that by circulating tailings leaching. Through a series of continuous batch operation, it was found that Eh (Oxidation/Reduction Potential), pH, c (Cu²⁺), c (TFe, total iron) of solutions in each section fluctuated within the expected range. Although the concentration of accumulated iron ions in the solution exceeds 20 g/L, the concentration of planktonic microorganisms was still above 6 × 10⁷ cells/mL, and the activated microbial solution still had a good leaching effect on metals in the waste. The residue directly obtained through a filter press had a water content of less than 30%, while that dried residue has a copper content of less than 524 mg/kg. In addition, the grade of sponge copper prepared in the replacement section could reach 86.63%, and the direct yield of copper can reach more than 90%. Furthermore, an economic analysis mainly based on material balance had further confirmed the feasibility of the green treatment process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioleaching 3acopper 3aeconomic analysis 3aions 3airon 3aleaching 3amicroorganisms 3amine tailings 3aoxidation 3apH 3aplankton 3asulfuric acid 3awastewater treatment 3awater content 0aWaste copper clad laminate 0aBioleaching 0aDetoxification 0aCopper recovery 0aLeaching toxicity1 aChen, Yanzhi1 aCheng, Haina1 aLiu, Xiaowen1 aTian, Zhuang1 aZhang, Lijuan1 aKang, Xin1 aGe, Yang1 aPeng, Jing1 aSun, Jianxing1 aWen, Yong1 aWang, Wei1 aZhou, Hongbo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 10, v. 255 p.120116-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010300170300001600273520158000289592002801869650001201897650002601909650001401935650001401949650001901963650001201982650000901994650001102003650001302014650000902027650002002036650001002056650001402066650001402080651001102094700002802105773008402133856008102217852000902298655001202307IND60439612720221120162226.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043961272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-015-9758-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNæss, Marius Warg10aMarket Economy vs. Risk Management: How Do Nomadic Pastoralists Respond to Increasing Meat Prices?  ap. 425-438.  aA growing body of evidence shows that for nomadic pastoralists herd accumulation is an efficient strategy for buffering environmental variation and maximizes long-term survival. Pastoralists may thus view livestock as investments, or ‘banks on the hoof,’ that work as insurance against unpredictable environmental conditions. This perspective differs from strict market logic where producers are expected to follow the ‘law of supply,’ i.e., that when the price of a product rises suppliers should be willing to offer more of the product for sale. In terms of insurance, increased meat prices may make it possible for pastoralists to slaughter fewer animals for the same financial gain as when prices are low and subsequently convert unslaughtered animals to herd capital. This study investigates to what degree Saami reindeer herders follow a market driven or risk management logic by investigating how slaughter strategies are influenced by increasing meat prices. While slaughter strategies vary regionally in Norway, our results indicate that reindeer herders follow neither risk nor market considerations alone, but rather a combination, and support the general hypothesis that slaughter strategies entail balancing the benefits of increasing herd size against economic gain through meat sales. This has important management implications since current management schemes aiming to reduce the number of reindeer by stimulating slaughter rates through economic subsidies is based on the assumption that herders are meat producers motivated by monetary gains alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapital 3aenvironmental factors 3aherd size 3ainsurance 3amarket economy 3amarkets 3ameat 3aprices 3areindeer 3arisk 3arisk management 3asales 3aslaughter 3asubsidies 3aNorway1 aBårdsen, Bård-Jørgen0 tHuman ecology.g2015 June, v. 43, no. 3 p.425-438dSpringer USx0300-78397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-015-9758-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02553naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003600138245013300174520128000307592002801587650002101615650001801636650003001654650002001684650001701704650001201721650002001733650002201753650001501775650002701790650001701817650002201834650001901856650001301875651001101888700002201899700002201921773011901943856007202062852000902134655001202143IND60648710520221120183931.0190701e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064871052DNAL7 a10.3390/f80702272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojnicka-Półtorak, Aleksandra10aGenetic Diversity among Age Classes of a <em>Pinus sylvestris</em> (L.) Population from the Białowieża Primeval Forest, Poland  aThe Białowieża Primeval Forest (BPF) is Europe’s last primeval forest and an irreplaceable area for biodiversity conservation due to its size, protection status, and substantially undisturbed nature. There is no other forest in Europe with such a large surface representing highly-advanced natural succession. This article reports on the first analysis of the genetic variability and demographic structure of a self-renewed Pinus sylvestris population located in BPF, using both chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA markers. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) for chloroplast simple sequence repeats (cpSSRs) revealed a significant genetic differentiation among age classes that accounted for about 2% of the total variance, comparable to those reported among different populations of Scots pine. None of the 117 detected chloroplast haplotypes were common to all age classes. Haplotype diversity ranged from 0.370 to 0.415 for cpSSRs and from 0.320 to 0.455 for mitochondrial markers. The genetic variation of the studied age classes—represented by mitochondrial markers—strongly depicts the maternal genetic structure, indicating limited seed dispersal. Temporal genetic substructuring is maintained within a self-renewed population of Scots pine from the BPF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aage structure 3abiodiversity conservation 3achloroplast DNA 3achloroplasts 3aforests 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3aseed dispersal 3avariance 3aPoland1 aCeliński, Konrad1 aChudzińska, Ewa,0 tForests.g2017 June 28, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f80702273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245016600150300001800316520100300334650004401337650002201381650002801403650001701431650001301448650002101461650001301482650002101495650000901516650003301525650003701558650001901595700001501614700001601629700001401645700001301659700001701672773016201689856004001851852000901891655001201900IND4535050820221121064645.0160119e20140730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453505082DNAL7 a10.1021/jf50146922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jia10aOptimization and Characterization of Curcumin Loaded in Octenylsuccinate Oat Î²-Glucan Micelles with an Emphasis on Degree of Substitution and Molecular Weight  ap. 7532-7540.  aThe dependence of the curcumin loading capacity (CLC) of octenylsuccinate oat Î²-glucan (OSG) micelles on the structural parameters (degree of substitution, DS; molecular weight, Mw) of OSG was unknown and explored in this study. Meanwhile, the curcumin-loaded OSG micelle (COM) was first characterized. The results from response surface methodology revealed that the linear effects of Mw and stirrer input power, as well as the quadratic effect of DS, were significant (p < 0.05). The maximum CLC value of the OSG micelle was obtained as 4.21 Î¼g/mg. Dynamic light scattering showed that the average size and Î¶ potential of the COM were 308 nm and â10.8 mV, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy evidenced that the COM was elliptical in shape. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimeltry, and X-ray diffraction revealed that curcumin was loaded in OSG micelles in an amorphous form by interacting with OSG molecules. 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aatomic force microscopy 3abeta-glucans 3acurcumin 3alight scattering 3amicelles 3amolecular weight 3aoats 3aresponse surface methodology 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azeta potential1 aChen, Fang1 aTian, Weina1 aMa, Yaqin1 aLi, Jing1 aZhao, Guohua0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 July 30, v. 62, no. 30 p.7532-7540dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf5014692  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012100160520121700281592002801498650002101526650002001547650001401567650001001581651001201591700002001603700002201623700002201645700002001667700002401687700002401711700001901735700002301754773012201777856007301899852000901972655001201981IND60674481020221118024716.0191025e20190929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067448102DNAL7 a10.3390/f101008482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaarinen, Ninni 10aAssessing the Effects of Sample Size on Parametrizing a Taper Curve Equation and the Resultant Stem-Volume Estimates  aLarge and comprehensive datasets, traditionally based on destructive stem analysis or other labor-intensive approaches, are commonly considered as a necessity in developing stem-volume equations. The aim here was to investigate how a decreasing number of sample trees affects parametrizing an existing taper curve equation and resultant stem-volume estimates. Furthermore, the potential of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) in producing taper curves was examined. A TLS-based taper curve was derived for 246 Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris L.) from southern Finland to parametrize an existing taper curve equation. To assess sensitivity of the parametrization regarding sample size, the number of Scots pines included in the parametrization varied between full census and 1 Scots pine at a time. Root mean square error of stem-volume estimates remained &le;20.9% and the mean absolute difference was relatively constant (&le;9.0%) between stem-volume estimates when the sample size included &ge;46 Scots pines. Thus, it can be concluded that, with a rather small sample size, a taper curve equation can be re-parametrized for local conditions using point clouds from TLS to produce consistent stem-volume estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3adata collection 3aequations 3atrees 3aFinland1 aKankare, Ville 1 aPyörälä, Jiri 1 aYrttimaa, Tuomas 1 aLiang, Xinlian 1 aWulder, Michael A.,1 aHolopainen, Markus 1 aHyyppä, Juha 1 aVastaranta, Mikko 0 tForests.g2019 Sept. 29, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f101008483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245016500195300001600360500002000376520090600396592002801302650003001330650001701360650001501377650000901392650001401401650002301415773013401438856007401572852000901646655001201655IND60783139820221118234539.0220715e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078313982DNAL7 a10.1111/fme.125432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPsuty, Iwona1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3120-450310aAre we ready to implement resist–accept–direct framework thinking? A case study of fish stocks and small‐scale fisheries in the Puck Bay (Southern Baltic)  ap. 423-438.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Puck Bay socioecological system is covered by many management plans, most of which are embedded in a paradigm of resistance to ecosystem change. However, it is highly probable that this system has already passed the tipping point, in terms of both the availability of fish stocks and small‐scale fishery function in coastal communities. The current scheme excludes the listing of alternative management options, as it rejects those that have not been agreed upon. Societal feasibility has been a barrier to many of these rejected solutions. Another problem is the low level of coordination between the plans and the varying ability to implement them, which depends on the funding source. Recognising that the ecosystem is in transition and may not be controllable, managers can apply the resist–accept–direct (RAD) framework to make more informed decisions and better prepare for the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acase studies 3aecosystems 3afish 3afisheries 3asocial environment0 tFisheries management and ecology.g2022 Aug., v. 29, no. 4 p.423-438dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867078x0969-997X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fme.125433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03520naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245015000166300001800316520200200334592002802336650002002364650002202384650001602406650002802422650001502450650002202465650001702487650002302504650001902527650001302546653002402559653002802583653002302611653002102634653001702655700002202672700002102694700002202715700002502737700002002762700002302782700001902805773012702824856007802951852000903029655001203038IND60528882120221120080702.0160717e20160406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052888212DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b003452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuzuki, Mitsuharu10aPhotoprecursor Approach Enables Preparation of Well-Performing Bulk-Heterojunction Layers Comprising a Highly Aggregating Molecular Semiconductor  ap. 8644-8651.  aActive-layer morphology critically affects the performance of organic photovoltaic cells, and thus its optimization is a key toward the achievement of high-efficiency devices. However, the optimization of active-layer morphology is sometimes challenging because of the intrinsic properties of materials such as strong self-aggregating nature or low miscibility. This study postulates that the “photoprecursor approach” can serve as an effective means to prepare well-performing bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layers containing highly aggregating molecular semiconductors. In the photoprecursor approach, a photoreactive precursor compound is solution-deposited and then converted in situ to a semiconducting material. This study employs 2,6-di(2-thienyl)anthracene (DTA) and [6,6]-phenyl-C₇₁-butyric acid methyl ester as p- and n-type materials, respectively, in which DTA is generated by the photoprecursor approach from the corresponding α-diketone-type derivative DTADK. When only chloroform is used as a cast solvent, the photovoltaic performance of the resulting BHJ films is severely limited because of unfavorable film morphology. The addition of a high-boiling-point cosolvent, o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), to the cast solution leads to significant improvement such that the resulting active layers afford up to approximately 5 times higher power conversion efficiencies. The film structure is investigated by two-dimensional grazing-incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and fluorescence microspectroscopy to demonstrate that the use of o-DCB leads to improvement in film crystallinity and increase in charge-carrier generation efficiency. The change in film structure is assumed to originate from dynamic molecular motion enabled by the existence of solvent during the in situ photoreaction. The unique features of the photoprecursor approach will be beneficial in extending the material and processing scopes for the development of organic thin-film devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDCB (herbicide) 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanthracenes 3aatomic force microscopy 3achloroform 3acrystal structure 3afluorescence 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asemiconductors 3asolvents 0aorganic solar cells 0aphotoprecursor approach 0amorphology control 0asolution process 0aα-diketones1 aYamaguchi, Yūji,1 aTakahashi, Kohei1 aTakahira, Katsuya1 aKoganezawa, Tomoyuki1 aMasuo, Sadahiro1 aNakayama, Ken-ichi1 aYamada, Hiroko0 tACS applied materials .g2016 Apr. 06, v. 8, no. 13 p.8644-8651dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.6b003453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01737naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245006600172300001400238520089800252592002801150650001901178650001101197650000901208700002001217700002201237773011001259856008101369852000901450655001201459IND60121201520221123041201.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012120152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-013-9717-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrijalva, Therese C.10aDiscounting the Distant Future: An Experimental Investigation  ap. 39-63.  aWe use a laboratory experiment to elicit discount rates over a 20-year time horizon using government savings bonds as a payment vehicle. When using a constant (exponential) discount rate function, we find an implied average discount rate of 4.9 %, which is much lower than has been found in previous experimental studies that used time horizons of days or months. However, we also find strong support for non-constant, declining discount rates for longer time horizons, with an extrapolated implied annual discount rate approaching 0.5 % in 100 years. There is heterogeneity in discount rates and risk preferences in that people with more optimistic beliefs about technological progress have higher discount rates. These findings contribute to the debate over the appropriate discount rate to use in comparing the long-term benefits of climate change mitigation to the more immediate costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3apeople 3arisk1 aLusk, Jayson L.1 aShaw, W.

It was shown that the NH···π binding is especially effective when the NH-donor is a positively charged group, for example, Me₂NH⁺, and the π-donor is an electron-rich aromatic substituent, in particular, the 1-pyrrolyl or the 4-hydroxyphenyl group. Using protonated tetrafluoroborate salts, a strong counterion effect was demonstrated by means of theoretical calculations. Through several mechanisms, including short CH···F contacts, bifurcation, and long-range dispersion, the counterion promotes considerable structural changes and weakens the NH···π interactions from 12–15 kcal mol–¹ in “naked” cations to 5–9 kcal mol–¹ in the salts. To this end, 8-(2,5-dimethylpyrrol-1-yl)-N,N-dimethylnaphthalene-1-ammonium tetrafluoroborate, with the record linearity and shortness (2.07 Å) of the NH···π-centroid bond, was recognized as the most appropriate model with the strongest NH···π interaction ever described.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3adispersions 3ajournals 3amodels 3anaphthalene 3anaphthalenes 3aorganic chemistry 3aprotein secondary structure 3aprotein tertiary structure 3areceptors 3asalting 3asalts1 aDyablo, Olga V.1 aPogosova, Olga G.1 aOzeryanskii, Valery A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3797-38051 aFilarowski, Aleksander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1013-49451 aVasilikhina, Kseniya M.1 aDzhangiryan, Narek A.0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2020 Sept. 10, v. 85, no. 19 p.12468-12481dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19181x1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.0c016973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02433naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245013200175520116400307592002801471650001501499650001501514650001501529650002001544650000901564650002501573650001601598650001701614650001901631653001501650653002501665653001501690653001801705653002701723700001801750700005501768773012201823856008101945852000902026655001202035IND60729973120221120211108.0211030e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072997312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamani, Mohammad Hassan10aFunctional modification of protein extracted from black gram by-product: Effect of ultrasonication and micronization techniques  aThe black gram mill by-product is a valuable protein-rich source that is generally discarded. Therefore, this study was conducted to extract the protein from this underutilized source and further improve its functionality by using ultrasound and micronization techniques. Protein micronized at 110 °C had maximum water absorption (from 2.79 to 4.83 g/g) and emulsifying activity (from 9.94 to 38.32 m²/g). Ultrasonicated proteins for 10 min and 30 min exhibited the highest oil absorption (3.18–3.66 g/g) and foaming capacity (53.7–91.25%), respectively. When compared to ultrasonication, micronization particularly at 150 °C, was very effective in improving zeta potential (−18.7 to −24.95 mV). Thermal properties suggested structural changes, particularly in ultrasonicated proteins. FT-IR spectra showed no marked alteration in the secondary structure, while the electrophoretic pattern showed slight reduction in the intensity of the major band in modified proteins. The findings indicated that these techniques substantially enhanced the functionality of by-product protein, thus might increase its utilization in various food systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3ablack gram 3abyproducts 3aelectrophoresis 3aoils 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3awater uptake 3azeta potential 0aBlack gram 0aProtein modification 0aUltrasound 0aMicronization 0aBy-product utilization1 aSemwal, Jyoti1 aMeera, M.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4801-27320 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2021 June, v. 144 p.111193-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2021.1111933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245017400165300001800339520128700357592002801644650002201672650002001694650002001714650001201734650001101746650001401757650001401771650002801785653000901813653003301822653002201855653000901877653001301886653000801899700005901907700006501966700006102031773014402092856008602236852000902322655001202331IND60777920020221118062439.0220523e20220513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077792002DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c004322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Bing10aReaction Selectivity in Electro-oxidation of Lignin Dimer Model Compounds and Synthetic Lignin with Different Mediators for the Laccase Mediator System (PZH, NHPI, ABTS)  ap. 6633-6641.  aElectro-oxidation of lignin dimer model compounds bearing β–O–4, β–5, and β–β linkages and synthetic lignin (guaiacyl-type dehydrogenation polymer [G-DHP]) in the presence of different mediators previously used in the laccase mediator system (LMS), that is, promazine hydrochloride (PZH), N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI), and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS), was investigated. The characteristics of the electro-oxidations of the lignin dimer model compounds were reflected in the electro-oxidation of G-DHP. The three mediators effectively mediated the electro-oxidation of G-DHP, although they showed different reaction selectivities toward the three major lignin linkages of G-DHP. Specifically, PZH preferentially mediated the oxidation of β–O–4 and β–β linkages over β–5 linkages, NHPI preferred β–O–4 linkages over β–5 and β–β linkages, and ABTS preferred β–O–4 and β–β linkages over β–5 linkages under the present conditions. NHPI and ABTS tended to mediate Cα–Cβ cleavage in contrast to PZH, and the three mediators all mediated the conversion of coniferyl alcohol end-units. Consequently, PZH, NHPI, and ABTS were found to be promising mediators for the electrolytic mediator system of lignin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconiferyl alcohol 3adehydrogenation 3agreen chemistry 3alaccase 3alignin 3aoxidation 3apromazine 3aselectivity (chemistry) 0aABTS 0aElectrolytic mediator system 0aElectro-oxidation 0aNHPI 0aMediator 0aPZH1 aTobimatsu, Yuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7578-73921 aKamitakahara, Hiroshi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0130-19191 aTakano, Toshiyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8244-223X0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2022 May 13, v. 10, no. 20 p.6633-6641dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c004323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02233naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011200155300002000267520108500287592002801372650001401400650002101414650002201435650001201457650001701469650001601486700001501502700001801517700002001535700001401555700001601569700001701585700001901602700001901621773012401640856007401764852000901838655001201847IND60642209320221122053218.0190506e20171116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064220932DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra10422g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Keke10aEfficient interface and bulk passivation of PbS quantum dot infrared photodetectors by PbI₂ incorporation  ap. 52947-52954.  aLead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) exhibit outstanding optoelectronic properties owing to their low temperature solution-processability and bandgap tunability. PbS QD heterojunction detectors suffer from an incomplete interface and bulk passivation. Herein, a simple passivation method based on PbI₂ was developed, which can effectively suppress the heterojunction interface and PbS QD surface defects by interface and ligand passivation. Utilizing the present strategies, PbS QD photodetectors can decrease the dark current and simultaneously increase the photocurrent. Such photodiode detectors also showed a fast response on the order of microseconds which is much faster than that of photoconductive CQD detectors (millisecond order). Also, an ultra-high specific detectivity of 10¹³ Jones was obtained. Meanwhile, the energy conversion efficiency of PbI₂ based devices reached 8%, a twofold value compared to the control one. The convenient and efficient passivation method is expected to hold great potential for high performance QD optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetectors 3aelectric current 3aenergy conversion 3aligands 3aquantum dots 3atemperature1 aCao, Yulin1 aYang, Xiaokun1 aKhan, Jahangeer1 aDeng, Hui1 aZhang, Jian1 aFarooq, Umar1 aYuan, Shengjie1 aSong, Haisheng0 tRSC advances.g2017 Nov. 16, v. 7, no. 83 p.52947-52954dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra10422g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012900164300001600293520088600309592002801195650001001223650001301233650001701246650001301263650001401276650002701290650002901317650001801346650000901364650000901373650001401382650001901396650001601415650001901431700002001450773014001470856008201610852000901692655001201701IND60590026020221122225858.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059002602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-017-2966-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAslan, Duygu14aThe influence of ultrasound on the stability of dairy-based, emulsifier-free emulsions: rheological and morphological aspect  ap. 409-421.  aThis study has been designed to examine incorporation of 7, 10 and 15% olive oil in milk-based media by using ultrasound (US) at 24 kHz, for 3 min in order to form new dairy-based, emulsifier-free emulsions.

The morphology of the emulsions was examined under the fluorescence microscope to evaluate the changes caused by US. The peroxide value and fatty acid composition were determined. After the treatment, application of the US increased the stability of emulsions. A decrease in the creaming index and droplet size and an increase in the zeta potential were observed. All the emulsions exhibited a weak gel structure.

To study the sources and atmospheric influence of HONO, continuous observations of HONO and relevant air pollutants were performed from June to July 2019 at an urban site in Beijing. A comparative study on the ambient levels, diurnal variation, the sources in daytime and nighttime, and the formation mechanisms were investigated for a haze pollution period (Period I) and an ozone pollution period (Period II). The average hourly HONO concentrations during Period I, Period II, and the whole observation period, were 0.58 ± 0.23, 0.54 ± 0.19 and 0.44 ± 0.24 ppb, respectively. The emission from vehicle exhaust was an important source of nocturnal HONO formation. During the nighttime, compared with the homogeneous reaction of NO with OH, the heterogeneous conversion from NO₂ was the dominant pathway for HONO formation. The heterogeneous conversion frequency was 0.0075 h⁻¹ during Period I, higher than that during Period II (0.0028 h⁻¹), suggesting a higher conversion potential to HONO formation during the haze episode. Based on the analysis of HONO budget, it was found that the daytime unknown source Pᵤₙₖₙₒwₙ during Period II was higher than that during Period I. Correlation analysis implied that the photo-enhanced NO₂ conversion on the aerosol surface might be a potential source for daytime HONO. Without HONO constraint, the Observation-Based Model (OBM) would largely underestimate the averaged daytime atmospheric oxidative capacity (24%), OH production rate (57%), and net O₃ production rate (20%). The study results further demonstrated the necessity for clarifying the formation mechanism of HONO to improve the understanding of the influence of HONO to atmospheric chemical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acomparative study 3adiurnal variation 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3anitrous acid 3aozone 3aphotochemistry 3aresearch 3asummer 3aChina 0aNitrous acid (HONO) 0aHaze pollution period 0aOzone pollution period 0aHeterogeneous conversion 0aUnknown daytime source 0aObservation-Based Model1 aWang, Xuezhong1 aWu, Zhenhai1 aLi, Ling1 aWang, Chuhan1 aLi, Hong1 aZhang, Xin1 aZhang, Yingnan1 aLi, Junling1 aGao, Rui1 aXue, Likun1 aMellouki, Abdelwahid1 aRen, Yangang1 aZhang, Qingzhu0 tAtmospheric research.g2021 Oct. 01, v. 260 p.105689-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1056893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245009000189300001400279520163300293592002801926650001001954650001401964650001301978650001001991650000902001650002202010650002602032650001802058650002702076650004202103650001102145650001102156650000902167650002902176650003202205650004002237650001802277650001602295700002002311700003202331773008402363856008602447990002302533852000902556655001202565IND60091792720221118052756.0141103e20110926xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009179272DNAL7 a218716122pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.07.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahn, Melanie10aAge-related differences in performance and stimulus processing in dual task situation  ap. 66-76.  aCompetition for limited processing resources is most critical in dual-tasks which incorporate cognitive and motor demands. Performance is usually diminished with increasing age in such tasks. This decline is relevant for activities in real life like driving. In the present study we aim to examine if there are age-related differences in stimulus processing in a dual-task and if these differences have an impact on performance of a driving-like tracking task. Young and older participants performed a dual-task consisting of a tracking task and a visual attention task. Alongside, the EEG was recorded for calculating the P300 (P3) of the event-related potential as a reflection of controlled stimulus processing. In the visual attention task older vs. young participants showed more misses and false alarms. For young participants the P3 shows an expected pattern of higher amplitudes for relevant compared to irrelevant stimuli. This was not found for the older participants. A general age-related decline in tracking performance was relatively more pronounced if a secondary motor response was required in the visual attention task and also after irrelevant stimuli. The results suggest that older compared to young participants had greater difficulties to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant stimuli in a dual-task situation as they probably apply comparable attentional resources to all stimuli. This may also explain the higher error rates. These results have important implications for the understanding of age-related stimulus processing in dual and multi task situations in real life as for instance driving.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acognition 3aresearch 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAttentionxphysiology 2aBrain Mapping 2aElectroencephalography 2aEvoked Potentials, Visualxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNeuropsychological Tests 2aPhotic Stimulationxmethods 2aPsychomotor Performancexphysiology 2aReaction Time 2aYoung Adult1 aWild-Wall, Nele1 aFalkenstein, M.q(Michael),0 tBrain research.g2011 Sept. 26, v. 1414 p.66-76dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.07.0513Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245007800164520150100242592002801743650001901771650002901790650001601819650001501835650002601850650002201876650002001898650001501918651001101933700002401944700002401968700002201992700002202014700002802036773012202064856007302186852000902259655001202268IND60674481220221118024536.0191025e20190929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067448122DNAL7 a10.3390/f101008492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaroszewicz, Bogdan 10aBiałowieża Forest—A Relic of the High Naturalness of European Forests  aIn Europe only some small isolated patches of forests with a high degree of naturalness still exist. These are forests, whose structure, composition and function has been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial anthropogenic influence over the long period. In this respect, Białowieża Forest is a unique location in Europe, with continuous forest cover for close to 12,000 years. The palynological, archaeological and historical data document only a weak anthropogenic fingerprint compared to other European lowland forests in Holocene history. Due to long-lasting protection, a large portion of the forest is still composed of stands originating from the pre-silvicultural period. Moreover, the stands of Białowieża Forest converted by silvicultural activities during the 20th century have the potential to recover owing to patches of stands with high naturalness, scattered throughout the forest. As conflict over management of the forest has recurred regularly for close to century, there is a need to summarize our knowledge on the forest history and natural assets, to help making scientifically informed decisions over its future. Expansion of a non-intervention approach to the Polish part of the forest is suggested to increase the stability of the entire ecosystem and enhance the chances for its successful adaptation to changing environmental conditions.

Following a central composite design, five pressure levels (range 150–450 MPa) and frozen storage time (range 0–5 months) were tested. Colour parameters (L *, a * and b *), expressible water and texture parameters were evaluated on raw and cooked muscles. Results showed that a low-pressure level (150 MPa) allowed adequate expressible water for raw muscle up to 2.5 months of frozen storage time. Values of 150 or 169.27 MPa did not cause significant changes on L * values of raw muscle. Overall, HPP led to changes on texture parameters of fresh muscle before and after cooking. However, 300 MPa and 5 months of frozen storage showed adhesiveness values for raw muscle alike that of non-treated fresh muscle. Moreover, 150–300 MPa for 5 months of frozen storage resulted in cohesiveness and chewiness values for cooked muscle like cooked fresh hake, showing that the HPP improves the quality of frozen hake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerluccius merluccius 3aadhesion 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acolor 3acooking 3afood research 3afreezing 3afrozen storage 3ahake 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amechanical properties 3amuscles 3astorage time 3atexture1 aGuerra-Rodríguez, Esther1 aSaraiva, JorgeA.1 aAubourg, SantiagoP.1 aVázquez Murillo, Manuel,1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0392-17240 tEuropean food research & technology.g2018 Mar., v. 244, no. 3 p.423-431dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl58946x1438-23777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-017-2969-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245008600169520173000255592002801985650002102013650001802034650002202052650001302074650001302087650001902100650001902119650001802138650001202156650001902168650001502187650001602202650001602218650001802234650002602252650001202278653002002290653003002310653002402340653001502364653001602379653002802395700001502423773010602438856008702544852000902631655001202640IND60671734520221118001616.0200210e20200120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067173452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Chaoyou10aFabrication of multifunctional closed-surface SiO2-TiO2 antireflective thin films  aMultifunctional thin films with superhydrophilicity, broadband antireflective performance, humidity resistance and outstanding mechanical robustness are essential as for their wide applications. However, so far, it remains a big challenge to take into consideration all these properties simultaneously due to the structural contradiction. Herein, we develop an effective dip-coating process to prepare hybrid thin films with mechanical robustness, high transmittance, super-durable moisture resistance, excellent photocatalytic activity and durable superhydrophilicity. Three different nanoparticles were deposited sequentially to construct the above thin film and the maximum transmittance of this particular thin film reached ∼96.0%. The film surface showed an excellent superhydrophilicity (water contact angle ≈3.0°), and antifogging property. The superhydrophilic thin film could keep its property for more than 20 days. The transformation from hydrophilicity to superhydrophilicity of the thin film could be readily realized by UV irradiation. Moreover, its self-cleaning property could be retained after reduplicative storage and UV illumination cycles. Sponge washing test, water drop impact, pencil hardness test and tape peeling test revealed that the thin film possessed outstanding mechanical robustness. Methylene blue photodegradation was chose to weigh the photocatalytic activity of the hybrid thin film. In addition, the thin film shows excellent humidity-resistance at high temperature, and the excellent performance is due to its closed-surface structure. The closed-surface multifunctional thin films pave way toward use in solar cells, high-rise architecture windows under severe climate conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatic factors 3acontact angle 3afilms (materials) 3ahardness 3ahumidity 3ahydrophilicity 3amethylene blue 3ananoparticles 3apeeling 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3asolar cells 3atemperature 3atransmittance 3aultraviolet radiation 3awashing 0aMultifunctional 0aAntireflective thin films 0aSuperhydrophilicity 0aDurability 0aAntifogging 0aPhotocatalytic activity1 aZhang, Lin0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Jan. 20, v. 585 p.124045-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245008700168300001600255520132600271592002801597650002701625650003401652650001201686650001401698650001701712650001101729650001201740650002201752650001901774650000901793650001601802650001201818650003101830650002201861650001301883650001601896650001901912773011901931856008202050961001302132852000902145655001202154IND60616931420221118145300.0181021e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061693142DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517503073002112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGamble, Gary R.10aEffects of Elevated Temperatures on the Chemical Properties of Cotton Fiber Pectin  ap. 157-160.  aPolygalacturonic acid, calcium polygalacturonate, and samples of two cotton varieties are subjected to elevated temperatures for varying increments of time. The galacturonic acid residues of the heat-treated samples are quantified by digestion with pectinase along with EDTA, and the resultant solutions are analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography. Results indicate that galacturonic acid content decreases exponentially as a function of heating time, and that the rate constant for the degradation is temperature- dependent. The energy of activation for degrading polygalacturonic acid is substantially lower than that for calcium polygalacturonate, and that for the cotton samples is essen tially identical with that for calcium polygalacturonate. This phenomenon, along with supporting data, indicates that cotton fiber pectin is primarily non-esterified polygalactu ronic acid with a large percentage of galacturonic acid residues crosslinked by calcium ions. The energy of activation for degrading cotton fiber pectin is substantially lower than that for cellulose, suggesting that heating cotton at normal ginning temperatures may degrade the pectin component. This change in pectin composition may in turn affect fiber spinning performance due to changes in the surface properties of the fibers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aanion exchange chromatography 3acalcium 3acellulose 3acrosslinking 3aenergy 3afabrics 3agalacturonic acid 3aheat treatment 3aions 3alint cotton 3apectins 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolygalacturonase 3aspinning 3atemperature 3atextile fibers0 tTextile research journal.g2003 Feb., v. 73, no. 2 p.157-160dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517503073002113Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010500170520120000275592002801475650002301503650002201526650003701548650001501585650001801600650001301618650001901631650001801650650001901668650001801687650001501705650001901720650001501739650002201754650003301776650001101809650003701820650002601857650001501883653001901898653003501917653003101952700001401983700001601997700001302013700001502026700001502041773010602056856008702162852000902249655001202258IND60671734620221118001535.0200103e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067173462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2019.1240112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xuesheng10aGreen preparation of Ag-ZnO-rGO nanoparticles for efficient adsorption and photodegradation activity  aTo improve the photocatalytic performance of ZnO nanoparticles, based on the collective effect as electron sink of Ag and perfect two-dimensional (2-D) feature of graphene, Ag-ZnO-rGO nanoparticles were prepared by polyvinyl alcohol assisted freeze-drying and subsequent hydrothermal reduction method. Through photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange solution under UV irradiation, all as-prepared samples were assessed and compared with those of published works. The surface morphology, microstructure and optical property of materials were systematically studied by XRD, XPS, SEM, TEM and DRS, respectively. XPS and Raman spectra results confirmed that GO has successfully been reduced to rGO; SEM and TEM characterizations manifested that Ag-ZnO NPs were uniformly distributed in rGO with two-dimensional sheets structure; DRS characterization and Kubelka-Munk formula calculation illustrated that Ag-ZnO-rGO exhibited the smallest band gap and the best optical absorption performance.

Here we study the role of SFKs catalytic activity in triple-negative/basal-like and metastatic human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells employing three well-established inhibitors: Dasatinib, PP2 and SU6656. These compounds inhibited migration and invasion. Concomitantly, they reduced Fak, paxillin, p130CAS, caveolin-1 phosphorylation and altered cytoskeletal structures. They also inhibited cell proliferation, but in different manners. Dasatinib and PP2 increased p27ᴷⁱᵖ¹ expression and reduced c-Myc levels, restraining G1–S transition. In contrast, SU6656 did not modify p27ᴷⁱᵖ¹ expression, slightly altered c-Myc levels and generated polyploid multinucleated cells, indicating inhibition of cytokinesis. These later effects were also observed in SYF fibroblasts, suggesting a SFKs-independent action. ZM447439, an Aurora B kinase inhibitor, produced similar cell cycle and morphological alterations in MDA-MB-231 cells, indicating that SU6656 blocked Aurora B kinase. This was confirmed by inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation, the canonical Aurora B kinase substrate. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression profiles showed that SU6656 defined a set of genes that differed from Dasatinib and PP2. Additionally, Gene Set Enrichment Analyses revealed that SU6656 significantly reduces the Src pathway. Together, these results show the importance of SFKs catalytic activity for MDA-MB-231 proliferation, migration and invasiveness. They also illustrate that SU6656 acts as dual SFKs and Aurora B kinase inhibitor, suggesting its possible use as a therapeutic agent in breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acatalytic activity 3acell proliferation 3acluster analysis 3acytokinesis 3acytoskeleton 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistones 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphorylation 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3apolyploidy1 aCalcabrini, Annarica1 aGómez-Domínguez, Daniel1 aMorte, Beatriz1 aMartín-Forero, Esther1 aGómez-López, Gonzalo1 aMolinari, Agnese1 aWagner, Kay-Uwe1 aMartín-Pérez, Jorge0 tCellular signalling.g2012 June, v. 24, no. 6 p.1276-1286dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2012.02.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02960naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009500169520187100264592002802135650001502163650001002178650001302188650002202201650001102223650001802234650001602252650001802268651001002286653001802296653002002314653001402334653001602348653001502364773011202379856008602491852000902577655001202586IND60681566520221122041006.0220906e20200501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068156652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeng, Xiaojun10aInfluence of water body area on water quality in the southern Jiangsu Plain, eastern China  aWater quality management remains a challenge due to the complex interactions between multiple influencing factors. Although the influences of land use/cover types on water quality have received extensive attention, few researchers have attempted to elucidate the correlation between water body characteristics and water quality, and the interactions between water bodies and other land use/cover types on water quality have been relatively less studied. In this study, the southern Jiangsu Plain, eastern China, was taken as a study area, and the influence of water body area on water quality was investigated. The results revealed that all land use/cover types exhibited correlations with water quality, but their correlative directions and significance levels exhibited larger differences. The influences of different water body types on water quality were discrepant, and these influences all had spatial non-stationarity. The interactions between urban and dry lands and water bodies on water quality were bidirectionally weakened, and there was an inverted U-shaped relationship between water body area and water quality. The water body area could predict whether the water quality reached the standard of Class Ⅲ, and the appropriate cut-off values of the water body, rivers, and lakes were 10.65%, 9.33%, and 2.38%, respectively. These results suggested that water body area had a positive influence on water quality, and the loss of water bodies caused by the expansion of urban and dry lands created a double whammy on water quality; finally, water body area could effectively predict whether water quality reached a certain standard. Thus, maintaining a reasonable water body area contributes to managing water quality, and the proportion of water bodies can be a useful index for water quality management in downstream regions with dense river networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3alakes 3aland use 3apollution control 3arivers 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3awater quality 3aChina 0aWater quality 0aWater body area 0aInfluence 0aInteraction 0aPrediction0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2020 May 01, v. 254 p.120136-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1201363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01501naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245005800173300001600231520064100247592002800888650002400916650002600940650002200966650002100988650001201009773011201021856008101133852000901214655001201223IND60121201920221123041047.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012120192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-013-9721-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopez-Mayan, Cristina10aMicroeconometric Analysis of Residential Water Demand  ap. 137-166.  aThis paper develops a structural model for obtaining price elasticities and evaluating consumer’s response to changes in nonlinear tariffs when only panel data on household consumption are available. The model and the empirical strategy address problems implied by nonlinear tariffs, existence of a fixed cost, and use of limited data, giving rise to a random effects model with a nonlinear individual effect. Results show that the estimated model does well at fitting data and demand is inelastic, although elasticity varies by initial consumption block. Then, I estimate welfare consequences of implementing several demand policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3ademand elasticities 3ahousehold consumption 3aissues and policy 3anonlinear models 3atariffs0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2014 Sept., v. 59, no. 1 p.137-166dSpringer-Verlagx0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-013-9721-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01514naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011400166300001600280520051400296592002800810650001200838650001100850650002400861650001500885650002400900650001900924650000900943650001000952700001600962773011900978856008201097852000901179655001201188IND60616931520221118145248.0181021e200302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061693152DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517503073002122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, K.P.S.10aEvaluating and Comparing the Physical Properties of Spliced Yarns by Regression and Neural Network Techniques  ap. 161-164.  aDifferent spliced yam properties (strength, bending, abrasion, and appearance) are merged into a single score, also known as the total score, which is then used to analyze the overall performance of the yarns.

Data on weight, height, skinfolds, and circumferences were collected from 534 individuals in the year 2000. The data were used to describe mean differences in human nutrition between ages, sexes, and within and among three Group Ranches. Nutritional data and diet recall data were compared with past studies of Maasai nutrition from 1930 to 2000. Results indicate that nutritional status is poor and has remained so despite numerous changes to the social-ecological system including livelihood diversification, sedentarization, human population growth and decreased access to vegetation heterogeneity. Imbirikani Group Ranch had better access to infrastructure and markets and some measures of nutritional status were better than for individuals in other group ranches. However, nutritional status remains poor despite transitioning to greater market integration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiet recall 3ahuman nutrition 3ahuman population 3ainfrastructure 3alivelihood 3amarkets 3anutritional status 3apopulation growth 3aranching 3avegetation 3aKenya1 aBeeton, Tyler A.1 aBoone, Randall B.1 aBurnSilver, Shauna B.0 tHuman ecology.g2015 June, v. 43, no. 3 p.411-424dSpringer USx0300-78397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-015-9749-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245011800208300001800326506007600344520124900420592002801669506003701697650001401734650001801748650001001766650002001776650001301796650001101809650002301820650000901843650001201852650001401864650001301878650001401891650001201905653003001917653001901947700002501966700001801991700002402009700002502033700002402058700002702082700002302109700002002132700002402152700002402176700002002200700002002220700002002240773017202260856007902432852000902511655001202520IND60173659720221207084008.0150603e20130507xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017365972DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13038001102doi7 aPMC36514452pmcid7 a236205152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnutson, Sarah K.10aDurable tumor regression in genetically altered malignant rhabdoid tumors by inhibition of methyltransferase EZH2  ap. 7922-7927.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInactivation of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable complex component SMARCB1 is extremely prevalent in pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) or atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors. This alteration is hypothesized to confer oncogenic dependency on EZH2 in these cancers. We report the discovery of a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 enzymatic activity, (N-((4,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)methyl)-5-(ethyl(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)amino)-4-methyl-4′-(morpholinomethyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-carboxamide). The compound induces apoptosis and differentiation specifically in SMARCB1 -deleted MRT cells. Treatment of xenograft-bearing mice with (N-((4,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)methyl)-5-(ethyl(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)amino)-4-methyl-4′-(morpholinomethyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-carboxamide) leads to dose-dependent regression of MRTs with correlative diminution of intratumoral trimethylation levels of lysine 27 on histone H3, and prevention of tumor regrowth after dosing cessation. These data demonstrate the dependency of SMARCB1 mutant MRTs on EZH2 enzymatic activity and portend the utility of EZH2-targeted drugs for the treatment of these genetically defined cancers.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3adose response 3adrugs 3aenzyme activity 3ahistones 3alysine 3amethyltransferases 3amice 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3aregrowth 3aremission 3asucrose 0aepigenetic cancer therapy 0aEZH2 inhibitor1 aWarholic, Natalie M.1 aWigle, Tim J.1 aKlaus, Christine R.1 aAllain, Christina J.1 aRaimondi, Alejandra1 aPorter Scott, Margaret1 aChesworth, Richard1 aMoyer, Mikel P.1 aCopeland, Robert A.1 aRichon, Victoria M.1 aPollock, Roy M.1 aKuntz, Kevin W.1 aKeilhack, Heike0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 May 7, v. 110, no. 19 p.7922-7927dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13038001103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245005500165300001600220520070300236592002800939650002600967650003700993650002501030650002401055650001101079650001801090650002401108650002201132700001301154700001601167773012001183856008101303852000901384655001201393IND60614172620221119231611.0181002e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061417262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-018-2495-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Ai-ping10aChemical Constituents of Leaves of Taxus chinensis  ap. 841-845.  aA new compound, (E)-1-O-(p-coumaroyl)-3-methoxy-myo-inositol (1), and 13 known compounds, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (3), palmitic acid (4), protocatechuic acid (5), sciadopitysin (6), ginkgetin (7), sequoiaflavonoid (8), taxacin (9), 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10), 5-deacetyltaxachitriene B (11), makisterone C (12), 7-β-xylosyl-10-decetyltaxol (13), and taxiphyllin (14), were isolated from the leaves of Taxus chinensis (Pilg.)

Empirical data demonstrates Simpson’s paradox  ap. 79.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: According to WHO childhood severe acute malnutrition (SAM) is diagnosed when the weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ) is <−3Z of the WHO₂₀₀₆ standards, the mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) is < 115 mm, there is nutritional oedema or any combination of these parameters. Recently there has been a move to eliminate WHZ as a diagnostic criterion on the assertion that children meeting the WHZ criterion are healthy, that MUAC is universally a superior prognostic indicator of mortality and that adding WHZ to the assessment does not improve the prediction; these assertions have lead to a controversy concerning the role of WHZ in the diagnosis of SAM. METHODS: We examined the mortality experience of 76,887 6–60 month old severely malnourished children admitted for treatment to in-patient, out-patient or supplementary feeding facilities in 18 African countries, of whom 3588 died. They were divided into 7 different diagnostic categories for analysis of mortality rates by comparison of case fatality rates, relative risk of death and meta-analysis of the difference between children admitted using MUAC and WHZ criteria. RESULTS: The mortality rate was higher in those children fulfilling the WHO₂₀₀₆ WHZ criterion than the MUAC criterion. This was the case for younger as well as older children and in all regions except for marasmic children in East Africa. Those fulfilling both criteria had a higher mortality. Nutritional oedema increased the risk of death. Having oedema and a low WHZ dramatically increased the mortality rate whereas addition of the MUAC criterion to either oedema-alone or oedema plus a low WHZ did not further increase the mortality rate. The data were subject to extreme confounding giving Simpson’s paradox, which reversed the apparent mortality rates when children fulfilling both WHZ and MUAC criteria were included in the estimation of the risk of death of those fulfilling either the WHZ or MUAC criteria alone. CONCLUSIONS: Children with a low WHZ, but a MUAC above the SAM cut-off point are at high risk of death. Simpson’s paradox due to confounding from oedema and mathematical coupling may make previous statistical analyses which failed to distinguish the diagnostic groups an unreliable guide to policy. WHZ needs to be retained as an independent criterion for diagnosis of SAM and methods found to identify those children with a low WHZ, but not a low MUAC, in the community.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWorld Health Organization 3achildhood 3achildren 3adeath 3aedema 3aissues and policy 3amalnutrition 3ameta-analysis 3amortality 3aprediction 3arelative risk 3astatistical analysis 3aEastern Africa1 aGolden, Michael H.0 tNutrition journal.g2018 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.79-79dBioMed CentralwJournal:2170x1475-28917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12937-018-0384-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015500169300001600324500001900340520100100359592002801360650001101388650001201399650001801411650001401429650001701443650001101460650001001471650001001481650001301491653003301504653002301537653002601560653001101586700002201597700002701619700001801646700001901664773014701683856008101830852000901911655001201920IND60689325520221122101610.0200421e20090101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068932552DNAL7 a10.1080/096374808027102162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEssed, Natasja H.10aNo effect on intake and liking of soup enhanced with mono-sodium glutamate and celery powder among elderly people with olfactory and/or gustatory loss  ap. 143-154.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMono-sodium glutamate (MSG) and/or flavors may improve palatability and intake in elderly people. Whether this improvement is related to a decline in chemosensory sensitivity is unclear. We examined the effect of flavor-enhanced tomato soup (1,200 mg/l MSG (0.12% MSG) + 3 g/l celery powder) versus non-enhanced soup on intake and liking in 120 older adults (72±6 years). Olfactory and gustatory performance was measured. For the whole group, no difference in intake (198 g vs. 203 g) (P =0.97), liking (6.6 vs. 6.7) (P =0.99) and strength (7.2 vs. 7.2) (P =0.76) between the soups was found. Intake (P =0.52), liking (P =0.90) and strength (P =1.00) between the soups were not different within the low olfactory/low gustatory group. Intake and liking of the flavor-enhanced soup was not increased within elderly with low chemosensory sensitivity. Enhancing flavors to increase intake and liking may not be a uniform approach due to the heterogeneity in chemosensory losses among elderly people.  aPublisher supplied data 3acelery 3aelderly 3aglutamic acid 3anutrition 3apalatability 3apeople 3asoups 3ataste 3atomatoes 0aOlfactory and gustatory loss 0aflavor enhancement 0amono-sodium glutamate 0aintake1 aKleikers, Suzanne1 aStaveren, Wija A. van,1 aKok, Frans J.1 ade Graaf, Cees0 tInternational journal of food sciences and nutrition.g2009 Jan. 1, v. 60, no. sup5 p.143-154dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2066x1465-34787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/096374808027102163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02896naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245016900163300001200332520124700344592002801591650001101619650002901630650001301659650001701672650001201689650001501701650002001716650001201736650002501748650000901773650001601782650002201798650000901820650001401829650002601843650001401869650000701883650001401890650001101904650002101915650001301936650002101949650001801970651001001988700001601998700001702014700001402031700001502045700001802060700001402078773013502092856008202227852000902309655001202318IND60646802320221119035254.0191104e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680232DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-019-8366-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jiutan10aDetermining the factors controlling the chemical composition of groundwater using multivariate statistics and geochemical methods in the Xiqu coal mine, North China  ap. 364.  aStudying the hydrogeochemical processes that control groundwater quality in different aquifers helps to identify the sources of inrush water into coal mines. In this paper, 65 mine water samples were collected from Xiqu coal mine during 2016 and 2017 to determine the hydrogeochemical processes and controlling factors of mine water using hydrochemical methods and multivariate statistical analysis. The mine water is acidic to alkaline in nature. The dominant anions in the mine water are SO₄²⁻ and HCO₃⁻, and cations were dominated by Ca²⁺ Na⁺, and Mg²⁺. The dominant hydrochemical facies of groundwater were SO₄–Na·Ca and SO₄–Ca·Mg water types. Based on multivariate statistical analysis, four principal components and two clusters were obtained. Concentrations of SO₄²⁻ showed significant positive correlations with Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺, and strong negative correlations with HCO₃⁻ and pH. The mine water chemistry was dominated by the oxidation of iron-bearing sulfide minerals, cation exchange and the dissolution of silicate, carbonate and sulfate minerals. In addition, human activities such as agriculture are also likely to have influences groundwater chemistry at the mine site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquifers 3abicarbonates 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3acation exchange 3acations 3achemical composition 3acoal 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeochemistry 3airon 3amagnesium 3amultivariate analysis 3aoxidation 3apH 3asilicates 3asodium 3asulfate minerals 3asulfates 3asulfide minerals 3awater quality 3aChina1 aHao, Yaojun1 aGao, Zongjun1 aWang, Min1 aLiu, Manxi1 aWang, Zhenyan1 aWang, Shu0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2019 June, v. 78, no. 12 p.364-364dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-019-8366-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03514naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245012000179300001600299520173700315592002802052650002502080650002402105650002302129650004102152650002302193650001002216650002102226650001802247650001902265650000702284650001702291650001502308650001302323650001802336650002102354653003502375653002302410653002602433653002502459653001602484653001802500700006102518700002002579700002302599700002102622700002002643700002002663700006102683773011902744856008802863852000902951655001202960IND60623292220221118165614.0190325e20190315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062329222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.2792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlomberg, Danielle L.10aNanoparticle stability in lake water shaped by natural organic matter properties and presence of particulate matter  ap. 338-346.  aPredicting nanoparticle (NP) fate in the environment continues to remain a challenge, especially for natural surface water systems, where NPs can hetero-aggregate with natural organic and mineral suspended matter. Here we present the interactions and aggregation behavior of TiO2 NPs with natural organic matter (NOM) in a natural lake water. NP fate in a synthetic water of the same pH and ionic composition was also tested in the presence and absence of NOM analogs to gain insight into the different stabilizing effects of each NOM type. Several complementary analytical techniques were utilized to assess lake NOM composition, including pyrolysis−gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, gel permeation chromatography, the polarity rapid-assessment method, and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. In the natural lake water, the TiO2 NPs preferentially interacted with mostly anionic NOM of high and medium molecular weight (~1200–1450 and 400–520 Da). Specifically, strong interactions with proteins and polyhydroxy aromatics were observed. NP fate and stability were determined in both raw lake water containing mineral particulate matter and total NOM (NOMtot) and filtered lake water containing only NOM <0.8 μm (NOM<0.8), with different aggregation profiles observed over time. Additionally, three times the number of TiO2 NPs remained in suspension when only NOM<0.8 was present compared to the unfiltered water containing mineral particulate matter and NOMtot. These results demonstrate the contrasting NP fates in the aquatic environment according to the presence of NOMtot vs. NOM<0.8 and further suggest that the use of pure NOM analogs may not accurately represent NP interactions and fate in the natural system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggregation behavior 3aaquatic environment 3aaromatic compounds 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agel chromatography 3alakes 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aparticulates 3aprediction 3aproteins 3asurface water 3atitanium dioxide 0aNanotechnology risk assessment 0aEnvironmental fate 0aNanomaterial exposure 0aColloidal dispersion 0aAggregation 0aSedimentation1 aOllivier, Patrick1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4829-25381 aMiche, Hélène1 aAngeletti, Bernard1 aBruchet, Auguste1 aPhilibert, Marc1 aBrant, Jonathan1 aLabille, Jérôme1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4033-537X0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 15, v. 656 p.338-346dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.2793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245008100177300001800258520101700276592002801293650001501321650001501336650001501351650002001366650002401386650003301410650001601443700002101459700002401480773009701504856009001601990002301691852000901714655001201723IND60095811520221119202811.0141104e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009581152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoussement, Axel10aKernel density weighted principal component analysis of combustion processes  ap. 2844-2855.  aPrincipal component analysis (PCA) has been successfully applied to the analysis of combustion data-sets. However using PCA on a raw direct numerical simulation or an experimental data-set is not straightforward. Indeed, those data-sets usually show non-homogenous data density, hot and cold zones being generally over represented. This can introduce bias in the PCA reconstruction, especially when strong non-linear relationships characterize the data sample. To tackle this problem, a combination of the kernel density method and PCA is introduced here. This new PCA algorithm, called Temperature BAsed KErnel Density weighted PCA (T-BAKED PCA) allows to enhance the PCA accuracy especially in the flame front zone, which is the principal zone of interest. The performance of this new approach is benchmarked against classical PCA. Moreover, a new method called Hybrid T-BAKED PCA or HT-BAKED PCA, combining both classical and T-BAKED PCA, is proposed to provide an optimal representation of all flame regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acold zones 3acombustion 3adata collection 3amathematical models 3aprincipal component analysis 3atemperature1 aGicquel, Olivier1 aParente, Alessandro0 tCombustion and Flame.g2012 Sept., v. 159, no. 9 p.2844-2855dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.04.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003200140245014700172300001600319520123000335592002801565650001801593650002101611650001001632650001201642650001001654650001101664650001101675650001201686650001201698651001101710653002101721653001401742653001701756653001101773653001201784653002801796700002901824700002701853700003901880700002901919700003301948773012801981856007402109852000902183655001202192IND60676846220221121031901.0191122e20191105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067684622DNAL7 a10.1111/jvec.123542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantos Andrade, Pâmela dos10aParity and gonotrophic discordance of females of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae) in the city of São Paulo, SP, Brazil  ap. 233-240.  aThe objective of this study was to assess the parity, presence of blood in the stomach, and the gonotrophic discordance of females of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus captured in two areas of the city of São Paulo. The captures were undertaken monthly, by aspiration, in the period from January, 2015 to August, 2017. All the females of the two species had their midguts and ovaries dissected to determine the presence of blood and the parity/stage of maturation. With regard to parity, 27% and 34% of the females of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively, were parous or were in advanced stages of the development of their ovaries (33% and 27%, respectively). The larger part of the females of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus contained blood in their stomachs (77% and 60%, respectively), beyond which 36% and 27% of the females of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, respectively, were in gonotrophic discordance. Our results indicate favorable conditions in the study areas because of the presence of parous females. Moreover, this frequent and multiple contact of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus females with vertebrate hosts, such as humans, increases the possibility of transmitting the viruses they may be carrying.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aAedes albopictus 3ablood 3afemales 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amidgut 3astomach 3aviruses 3aBrazil 0aMosquito vectors 0aarbovirus 0atransmission 0aparity 0aovaries 0agonotrophic discordance1 aUrbinatti, Paulo Roberto1 aRocha Coelho, Ronan da1 ade Sá Almeida, Rosa Maria Marques1 aRibeiro, Sabrina Santana1 ade Lima-Camara, Tamara Nunes0 tJournal of vector ecology.g2019 Nov. 5, v. 44, no. 2 p.233-240dSociety for Vector EcologywJournal:19531x1081-17107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvec.123543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010600167520153500273592002801808650001501836650001201851650001101863650001201874650001601886650001301902650001501915650002101930650002201951650001701973650002201990650001302012650001302025650001602038650002502054650001102079650001802090650003802108650001702146650002902163651001802192653001502210653002002225653002202245653002002267700001602287700001702303700002102320773009602341856008502437852000902522655001202531IND60749995420221121154043.0220307e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074999542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2021.1008912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Yung Mi10aComplete genome sequence of Rhodoferax sp.

Whole-genome sequencing of the strain Rhodoferax sp. PAMC 29310 was achieved using PacBio RS II and Illumina platform. The resulting complete genome comprised of 4,593,249 base pairs (G + C content of 58.0%) with a single chromosome, 4546 protein-coding genes, 57 tRNAs and 6 rRNA operons. A complete set of genes encoding the enzymes of glycolysis and citric acid cycle were identified. No genes encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and nitrogenase reductase (nif) were present indicating that strain PAMC 29310 is not capable of fixing of carbon and nitrogen. PAMC 29310 genome contains genes for dissimilatory and assimilatory nitrate reduction. Gene encoding choline dehydrogenase enzyme which functions at the first step in the synthesis of betaine, one of the most effective osmoprotectants, was detected. In particular, among the genomes of the genus Rhodoferax strains, gene encoding nitrite reductase (nirK), which reduces nitrite to nitric oxide and tetA gene encoding tetracycline resistance protein involved in the resistance to tetracycline were identified only in the genome of Rhodoferax sp. PAMC 29310. As the first genome from the strain which was isolated from marine sediment in the genus Rhodoferax, investigation of physiological characteristics based on the complete genome sequences will help understand the adaptation of Rhodoferax sp.

Here, we demonstrate the direct patterning of thiolate SAMs on oxide-free GaAs surface by dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) and microcontact printing (μCP), facilitated by a process of surface etching and passivation of the GaAs. A quantitative analysis on the molecular diffusion on GaAs was conducted by examining the writing of nanoscale dot and line patterns by DPN, which agrees well with surface diffusion models. The functionality of the patterned thiol molecules was demonstrated by directed self-assembly of gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto a template of 4-aminothiophenol (ATP) SAM on GaAs. The highly selective assembly of the Au NPs was made evident with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The ability to precisely control the assembly of Au NPs on oxide-free semiconductor surfaces using molecular templates may lead to an efficient bottom-up method for the fabrication of nanoplasmonic structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic force microscopy 3amodels 3ananogold 3aquantitative analysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asemiconductors 3athiols 0adirected self-assembly 0ahybrid nanostructures 0aoxide-free GaAs 0agold nanoparticles 0adip-pen nanolithography 0amicrocontact printing 0amolecular diffusion1 aKeiper, Timothy1 aWang, Xiaolei1 aYang, Guang1 aHallinan, Daniel1 aZhao, Jianhua1 aXiong, Peng0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 9, no. 49 p.43363-43369dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b141133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03011naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008300170300001600253520166400269592002801933650002001961650001701981650002001998650001902018650001302037650001002050650001602060650001702076650001502093650001502108650001302123650002102136650000902157650001002166650002502176653001702201653001502218653001502233653001502248653002002263653002002283700001902303773011202322856008602434852000902520655001202529IND60581904120221116170202.0180905e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058190412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.08.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMan, Farahdina10aHPLC–MS/MS method for bioavailability study of bruceines D & E in rat plasma  ap. 183-188.  aBruceines D and E are quassinoids from seeds of Brucea javanica (L.) Merr. exhibiting hypoglycemia effect. The crude drug is used as a traditional medicine by diabetes patients. The aim of this study is to understand the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of both the bruceines D & E. A rapid and sensitive HPLC–MS/MS method was developed and validated for the quantification of both quassinoids, bruceines D & E in rat plasma. Both the bruceines D & E were separated with the Zorbax SBC-18 column with gradient elution and mobile phase system of acetonitrile and deionized water with 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.5mL/min. Analytes were detected in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with electrospray positive ionization. The quassinoids, namely bruceines D & E were detected with transitions of m/z 411.2→393.2 and m/z 395.2→377.2, respectively. Another quassinoid, eurycomanone was used as the internal standard with transition of m/z 409.2→391.2. The method was validated and conformed to the regulatory requirements. The validated method was applied to pharmacokinetic and bioavailability studies in rats. The pharmacokinetic study indicated both bruceine D and E were rapidly absorbed into the circulation system and reached its peak concentration at 0.54±0.34h and 0.66±0.30h, respectively. Bruceine E was eliminated slower than Bruceine D with t1/2 value almost increased two-fold compared to Bruceine D. In conclusion, a rapid, selective and sensitive HPLC–MS/MS method was developed for the simultaneous determination of both the bruceines D and E in rat plasma. Both bruceines D and E displayed poor oral bioavailability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrucea javanica 3aacetonitrile 3abioavailability 3achromatography 3adiabetes 3adrugs 3aformic acid 3ahypoglycemia 3aionization 3amonitoring 3apatients 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3aseeds 3atraditional medicine 0aHPLC–MS/MS 0aQuassinoid 0aBruceine D 0aBruceine E 0aBioavailability 0aPharmacokinetic1 aChoo, Chee-Yan0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 1063 p.183-188dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.08.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013100159300002000290520104200310592002801352650003701380650001101417650002801428650002201456650001301478650002801491650002101519650001701540650001301557650001201570650002201582700001501604700001401619700001701633700001301650700001701663700001301680700001701693700001801710773012301728856007401851852000901925655001201934IND60641652120221120121217.0190505e20170517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064165212DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra03926c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Guanghua10aImproving the cyclability performance of lithium-ion batteries by introducing lithium difluorophosphate (LiPO₂F₂) additive  ap. 26052-26059.  aThe cyclability of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is often affected by the components of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer which is generated from electrochemical decomposition of electrolyte. Here, lithium difluorophosphate (LiPO₂F₂) is studied in this work. When 1.6 wt% LiPO₂F₂ additive is incorporated into the reference electrolyte, the capacity retention of graphite/Li half-cell is increased from 82.53% to 98.04% and the capacity retention of LiCoO₂/Li half-cell is increased from 89.60% to 97.53% after 160 cycles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicates that the SEI layer containing LiPO₂F₂ can decrease the surface impedance of cells in the last stage cycle. In situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), DFT calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results show that LiPO₂F₂ is deposited on the surface of both LiCoO₂ and graphite electrodes, which effectively protects the graphite anode and suppresses the degradation of the cathode during the long-term cycling of LIBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3aatomic force microscopy 3acarbon electrodes 3acathodes 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3agraphene 3alithium 3alithium batteries1 aShi, Junli1 aShen, Cai1 aWang, Shuwei1 aXia, Lan1 aHu, Huasheng1 aLuo, Hao1 aXia, Yonggao1 aLiu, Zhaoping0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 17, v. 7, no. 42 p.26052-26059dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra03926c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245013700172300001800309520188700327592002802214650002102242650001502263650001102278650002302289650001502312650002302327650002502350650001502375650003202390650006602422650001302488650001602501650001802517650001702535650001402552650001202566700002002578700001902598700002802617700002002645700002202665700001902687700002002706700002202726700001802748773011702766856005502883852000902938655001202947IND4510069420221118220154.0150730e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451006942DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03041.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIriko, Hideyuki10aChemical structures and immunolocalization of glycosphingolipids isolated from Diphyllobothrium hottai adult worms and plerocercoids  ap. 3549-3559.  aGlycosphingolipids (GSLs) were purified from adults and plerocercoids of the tapeworm Diphyllobothrium hottai, and their chemical structures were determined. Total lipid fractions prepared from chloroform/methanol extracts of whole tissues were fractionated successively on ionâexchange chromatography, silicic acid column chromatography, and preparative TLC. The purified GSLs were characterized by methylation analysis, TLCâimmunostaining, liquid secondary ion MS, MALDIâTOF MS, and 1HâNMR. Ten GSLs were isolated from adult worms and four from plerocercoids, comprising monoâ, diâ, triâ, tetraâ, and pentasaccharides. The GSL GalÎ²1â4(FucÎ±1â3)GlcÎ²1â3GalÎ²1âCer was found in adult worms but not in plerocercoids, whereas GalÎ²1â4 (FucÎ±1â3)GlcÎ²1â3(GalÎ²1â6)GalÎ²1âCer was found in both adult worms and plerocercoids. We previously found a similar series of GSLs in plerocercoids of the cestode Spirometra erinaceieuropaei, and termed them âspirometosidesâ[Kawakami, Y. etÂ al. (1996) Eur J. Biochem. 239, 905â911]. The core structure of spirometosides, GalÎ²1â4GlcÎ²1â3 GalÎ²1âCer, may have taxonomic significance, being characteristic of pseudophyllidean tapeworms. In the present study, GSL compositions were significantly different between adults and plerocercoids, and growthâdependent changes in composition were documented. We found a novel dihexosylceramide, GlcÎ²1â3GalÎ²1âCer, which is a possible precursor for spirometosides. Immunohistochemical examination showed that spirometoside GSLs are highly enriched in the inner surface of bothria, the major point of contact between the adult worm and the host's intestine. Our findings indicate that spirometosides are involved in hostâparasite interaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiphyllobothrium 3aSpirometra 3aadults 3achemical structure 3achloroform 3aglycosphingolipids 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aintestines 3aion exchange chromatography 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amethylation 3aplerocercoids 3asilicic acid 3atapeworms 3atissues1 aNakamura, Kazuo1 aKojima, Hisako1 aIidaâTanaka, Naoko1 aKasama, Takeshi1 aKawakami, Yasushi1 aIshizuka, Ineo1 aUchida, Akihiko1 aMurata, Yoshihiko1 aTamai, Yoichi0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2002 July, v. 269, no. 14 p.3549-3559dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03041.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520083200280592002801112650001701140650001601157650000901173650001001182650001601192650001101208650002501219650003001244650001801274650000901292650002201301650001001323651001001333651001601343651001301359700001801372700001901390700001501409700001501424773010601439856008101545852000901626655001201635IND50071260020221121014502.0150211e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007126002DNAL7 a10.1007/s13314-013-0117-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValarmathi, P.10aFirst report of Rice orange leaf disease phytoplasma (16 SrI) in rice (Oryza sativa) in India  ap. 141-143.  aRice (Oryza sativa L.,) is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide.

The reducing substances such as carbon matter and pyrite could cause relatively high chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the raw kaolin, resulting in low quality kaolin products. In this study, narrow range classification and calcination were investigated to evaluate decreasing COD on coal-series kaolin from the Hubei Province. The kaolin and roasting products were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and thermogravimetry–differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) analyses. The results showed that the COD value in kaolin ore (19,252 µg/g) was largely concentrated in the size fraction of – 150 to + 60 μm. The optimum conditions for reducing COD were identified to be – 74 to + 60 μm at a roasting temperature of 450 °C, and the COD value decreased from 27517 to 585 µg g⁻¹. Moreover, the COD value and Eₐ showed linear correlation (R² = 0.932) among different particle sizes, and G(α) = [Formula: see text] could be regarded as the most possible mechanism function for the thermal decomposition of coal-series kaolin.  aPublisher supplied data  a[2013]104−22.cAcademician workstation of Yichang Huilong Science and Technology Co., Ltd.

Among the various techniques used to reduce the computational cost of representing chemistry, the three approaches in widest use are: (1) mechanism reduction, (2) dimension reduction, and (3) tabulation. In addition to these approaches, in large scale parallel LES/PDF computations, we need strategies to distribute the chemistry workload among the participating cores to reduce the overall wall clock time of the computations. Here we present computationally-efficient strategies for implementing chemistry in parallel LES/PDF computations using in situ adaptive tabulation (ISAT) and x2f_mpi – a Fortran library for parallel vector-valued function evaluation (used with ISAT in this context). To test the strategies, we perform LES/PDF computations of the Sandia Flame D with chemistry represented using (a) a 16-species augmented reduced mechanism; and (b) a 38-species C₁–C₄ skeletal mechanism. We present three parallel strategies for redistributing the chemistry workload, namely (a) PLP, purely local processing; (b) URAN, the uniform random distribution of chemistry computations among all cores following an early stage of PLP; and (c) P-URAN, a Partitioned URAN strategy that redistributes the workload only among partitions or subsets of the cores. We show that among these three strategies, the P-URAN strategy (i) yields the lowest wall clock time, which is within a factor of 1.5 and 1.7 of estimates for the lowest theoretically achievable wall clock time for the 16-species and 38-species mechanisms, respectively; and (ii) for reaction, achieves a relative weak scaling efficiency of about 85% when scaling from 2304 to 9216 cores and a relative strong scaling efficiency of over 60% when scaling from 1152 to 6144 cores.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3asimulation models 3aturbulent flow1 aLantz, Steven R.1 aWang, Haifeng1 aPope, Stephen B.0 tCombustion and Flame.g2012 Oct., v. 159, no. 10 p.3096-3109dElsevier Inc.x0010-21807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2012.04.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245010200161300002000263520155500283592002801838650001801866650002201884650001801906650001301924650001901937650001201956650001101968700002101979700002402000700002402024700003002048700001702078700002402095700002402119700002002143773010102163856007502264852000902339655001202348IND60576614320221117230601.0170806e20120731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057661432DNAL7 a10.1021/la302036d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHansson, Petra
M.10aEffect of Surface Depressions on Wetting and Interactions between Hydrophobic Pore Array Surfaces  ap. 11121-11130.  aThe surface structure is known to significantly affect the long-range capillary forces between hydrophobic surfaces in aqueous solutions. It is, however, not clear how small depressions in the surface will affect the interaction. To clarify this, we have used the AFM colloidal probe technique to measure interactions between hydrophobic microstructured pore array surfaces and a hydrophobic colloidal probe. The pore array surfaces were designed to display two different pore spacings, 1.4 and 4.0 μm, each with four different pore depths ranging from 0.2 to 12.0 μm. Water contact angles measured on the pore array surfaces are lower than expected from the Cassie–Baxter and Wenzel models and not affected by the pore depth. This suggests that the position of the three-phase contact line, and not the interactions underneath the droplet, determines the contact angle. Confocal Raman microscopy was used to investigate whether water penetrates into the pores. This is of importance for capillary forces where both the movement of the three-phase contact line and the situation at the solid/liquid interface influence the stability of bridging cavities. By analyzing the shape of the force curves, we distinguish whether the cavity between the probe and the surfaces was formed on a flat part of the surface or in close proximity to a pore. The pore depth and pore spacing were both found to statistically influence the distance at which cavities form as surfaces approach each other and the distance at which cavities rupture during retraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman imaging 3aaqueous solutions 3acontact angle 3adroplets 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3amodels1 aHormozan, Yashar1 aBrandner, Birgit D.1 aLinnros, J.q(Jan),1 aClaesson, P.M.q(Per M.),1 aSwerin, Agne1 aSchoelkopf, Joachim1 aGane, Patrick A.

Seven species belonging to the order Cyclopoida, family Cyclopidae, were collected in the field in Germany and tested for the first time in laboratory bioassays for their potential to serve as biological control agents of the invasive Asian bush mosquito Aedes japonicus (Theobald), a vector of various pathogens causing disease. Females of Diacyclops bicuspidatus (Claus) did not attack 1ˢᵗ instar larvae of Ae. japonicus, but Macrocyclops distinctus (Richard), Cyclops divergens Lindberg, and C. heberti Einsle predated a mean of 14, 18, or 19 1ˢᵗ instar larvae, respectively. Acanthocyclops einslei Mirabdullayev and Defaye killed 30 larvae, and high predation rates with a mean of 39 or 46 larvae, respectively, were obtained by Megacyclops viridis (Jurine) and M. gigas (Claus). In regression analyses, predation rates by M. viridis correlated with body size, with specimens of 1.8 mm length being more effective than smaller or bigger ones. Based on the presented data, the two Megacyclops species seem to be promising candidates for use in field studies on the biological control of Ae. japonicus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacrocyclops 3aOchlerotatus japonicus 3abioassays 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3abody size 3afemales 3aindigenous species 3ainsect control 3ainsect larvae 3ainstars 3ainvasive species 3apathogens 3apredation 3apredators 3aregression analysis 3aGermany 0aCyclopidae 0aAedes japonicus 0amosquitoes 0acopepods1 aKampen, Helge1 aSchaub, Günter A.1 aWerner, Doreen0 tJournal of vector ecology.g2019 Nov. 5, v. 44, no. 2 p.241-247dSociety for Vector EcologywJournal:19531x1081-17107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvec.123553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012300163300002000286520129400306592002801600650002201628650001301650650002201663650001601685650001301701650001201714650002201726650002201748650001801770653002401788653002101812653003101833653001501864653002201879700001701901700001801918700001401936700002001950700001801970700001101988773012601999856008002125852000902205655001202214IND60586580820221121061853.0171214e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058658082DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b141172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xiao-Kai10aAnthracite-Derived Dual-Phase Carbon-Coated Li3V2(PO4)3 as High-Performance Cathode Material for Lithium Ion Batteries  ap. 42788-42796.  aIn this study, low cost anthracite-derived dual-phase carbon-coated Li₃V₂(PO₄)₃ composites have been successfully prepared via a traditional solid-phase method. XRD results show that the as-prepared samples have high crystallinity and anthracite introduction has no influence on the LVP crystal structure. The LVP/C particles are uniformly covered with a dual-phase carbon layer composed of amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon. The effect of the amount of anthracite on the battery performance of LVP as a cathode material has also been studied. The LVP/C composite obtained with 10 wt % anthracite (LVP/C-10) delivers the highest initial charge/discharge capacities of 186.1/168.2 mAh g–¹ at 1 C and still retains the highest discharge capacity of 134.0 mAh g–¹ even after 100 cycles. LVP/C-10 also displays an outstanding average capacity of 140.8 mAh g–¹ at 5 C. The superior rate capability and cycling stability of LVP/C-10 is ascribed to the reduced particle size, decreased charge-transfer resistance, and improved lithium ion diffusion coefficient. Our results demonstrate that using anthracite as a carbon source opens up a new strategy for larger-scale synthesis of LVP and other electrode materials with poor electronic conductivity for lithium ion batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acathodes 3acrystal structure 3adiffusivity 3agraphene 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3amaterials science 3aparticle size 0alithium ion battery 0acathode material 0alithium vanadium phosphate 0aanthracite 0adual-phase carbon1 aZhang, Lu-Lu1 aYang, Xue-Lin1 aFang, Hui1 aZhou, Ying-Xian1 aWang, Ji-Qing1 aMa, Di0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 9, no. 49 p.42788-42796dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b141173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002100155245013600176300001600312520173800328592002802066650002402094650001702118650001202135650001202147650003102159650001002190650001002200650001802210650002602228650001502254650001202269650001002281650001002291650001802301650001202319650004302331650002102374650001202395650001102407650001202418650001002430650001902440653002202459653001502481653002202496653001802518653001802536700001802554773011302572856009002685852000902775655001202784IND60576087020221123030444.0190405e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057608702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVazirzadeh, Arya10aDifferential expression of subunits of 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase during gametogenesis in rainbow trout (Oncorhychus mykiss)  ap. 139-148.  aThe patterns of expression of two subunits of 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20β-HSD), key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis and activation of steroid hormones, were examined in rainbow trout by using a combination of quantitative real-time PCR and in-situ hybridization. The expression of targeted genes was examined in mRNA extracted from different tissues at different gonadal stages in male and female trout. Both subunits of 20β-HSD were found to be widely distributed in tissues. The highest expression of 20β-HSD A was found in intestine followed by skin, stomach, liver and gills, whereas, the highest expression of 20β-HSD B was observed in stomach followed by head kidney, ovary − at late vitellogenesis stage- and trunk kidney. In ovarian tissue 20β-HSD A was highly expressed in mature oocytes, and the highest expression of 20β-HSD B was in ovary at late vitellogenesis stage. There were no differences in the level of expression of either subunit among groups of rainbow trout at different stages of maturational competence. In male fish, 20β-HSD A was highly expressed in testis stage I in contrast to 20β-HSD B which was highly expressed in testis stage VIII. In situ- hybridization results showed that the 20β-HSD gene was highly expressed in gastrointestinal organs, while only slightly expressed in the gonadal tissue of fish at stage 62day-post-fertilization (dpf). Overall, the results confirm the ubiquitous presence of 20β-HSD among tissues in rainbow trout with relatively minor fluctuations in expression associated with reproductive cycles which collectively suggests a wider metabolic role of these enzymes than just an association with the synthesis of control hormones for reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abiosynthesis 3aenzymes 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agills 3ahybridization 3ain situ hybridization 3aintestines 3akidneys 3aliver 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asteroid hormones 3astomach 3atestes 3atissues 3atrout 3avitellogenesis 0a20β-HSD subunits 0aExpression 0aDifferent tissues 0aGametogenesis 0aRainbow trout1 aGuiguen, Yann0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2017 Sept., v. 184 p.139-148dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.07.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245014200165300001600307520118400323592002801507650001801535650001601553650001201569650001501581650001901596650000901615650001601624650001501640650001701655651001801672653001401690653002001704653001801724653001601742653001201758653001901770700001501789700002001804700001701824700001501841700001401856773012801870856007401998852000902072655001202081IND60676846420221121032010.0191122e20191105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067684642DNAL7 a10.1111/jvec.123562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuindo-Coulibaly, N.10aExpansion of Aedes africanus (Diptera: Culicidae), a sylvatic vector of arboviruses, into an urban environment of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire  ap. 248-255.  aIn 2008, an outbreak of yellow fever occurred in Abidjan. The entomological investigations confirm that Abidjan is at risk of yellow fever with a suspicion of the National Park of Banco (NPB) forest as a likely area of re-emergence. This study aims to assess the dispersion of sylvatic vectors of arboviruses from the NPB forest to the surrounding areas (Andokoi and Sagbé). The sampling was done in the rainy season using the WHO layer-traps technique. Among the six species of Aedes sampled, Aedes aegypti and Aedes africanus were the potential vectors of arboviruses. Both species were collected in Sagbé but only Ae. aegypti in Andokoi. Only Ae. aegypti were present 400 and 800 m from NPB forest, but at 200 m, it showed respective proportions of 75.5% and 87.5% in Sagbé and Andokoi. In the NPB forest, however, Ae. africanus has been the predominant species. The study showed the presence of Ae. aegypti in Andokoi and Sagbé. However, Ae. africanus was found in the NPB forest and in the 200 m radius in Sagbé. The establishment of an entomological surveillance program in all areas would therefore be essential for the prevention of arboviruses outbreaks in Abidjan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAedes aegypti 3aarboviruses 3aforests 3amonitoring 3anational parks 3arisk 3aurban areas 3awet season 3ayellow fever 3aCote d'Ivoire 0aExpansion 0aAedes africanus 0aParc National 0aarboviroses 0aAbidjan 0aCôte d'Ivoire1 aAdja, A.M.1 aCoulibaly, J.T.1 aKpan, M.D.S.1 aAdou, K.A.1 aZoh, D.D.0 tJournal of vector ecology.g2019 Nov. 5, v. 44, no. 2 p.248-255dSociety for Vector EcologywJournal:19531x1081-17107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvec.123563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245012500207300001600332520122300348592002801571650002201599650002001621650001301641650001201654650001501666650000901681650001901690650001101709650001701720650003201737650002001769650001901789650001701808650001401825650001601839650002101855650001001876650001101886653001701897653001301914653000901927653001201936653001301948700001701961700001401978700001801992700005502010773009002065856008502155852000902240655001202249IND60616134120221117234846.0190130e20181215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061613412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, M.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4992-901910aKinetic study for the co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass and plastics using the distributed activation energy model  ap. 731-742.  aThe characteristics of bio-oil produced from biomass pyrolysis can be improved by co-feeding waste materials. In this work, co-pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass with six different waste plastics (waste tyre (WT), polylactic acid (PLA), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) and high density polyethylene (HDPE)) were conducted in a thermogravimetric analyser to study thermal decomposition of the mixtures. The distributed activation energy model (DAEM) was applied to pure feedstocks at 5 and 10 °C/min heating rates to fit the kinetic parameters. The model was used to simulate the co-pyrolysis of biomass/plastic mixtures assuming additive effect of components at different weight proportions and heating rates. Profiles of the fraction of mass remaining for mixtures at 100 °C/min were reproduced with a remarkable agreement. Discrepancies between the experimental and calculated profiles were considered as a measure of the extent of interactions occurring in the co-pyrolysis. Projections of the behaviour of mixtures under flash pyrolysis conditions were performed to study important aspects of the process, such as radical interactions and optimum working temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aadditive effect 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3afeedstocks 3aheat 3alignocellulose 3amodels 3apolyethylene 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolylactic acid 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3atires 3awastes 0aCo-pyrolysis 0aKinetics 0aDAEM 0aBiomass 0aPlastics1 aLópez, J.M.1 aVeses, A.1 aCallén, M.S.1 aGarcía, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4255-59980 tEnergy.g2018 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.731-742dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03685naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006600188245009700254300001100351506007600362520199400438592002802432596005402460596004502514596004502559506003702604650000902641650001602650650001402666650001402680650001002694650001002704650002002714650001402734650001702748700002102765700001702786700001902803700002702822700002102849700002102870700002702891700002002918700002602938773011202964856008203076852000903158655001203167IND60646802620221207072602.0210217e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064680262DNAL7 a312107752pmid7 aPMC65633742pmcid7 a10.1186/s12983-019-0315-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangowski, Julian K.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8791-306110aComparative and functional analysis of the digital mucus glands and secretions of tree frogs  ap. 19.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Mucus and mucus glands are important features of the amphibian cutis. In tree frogs, the mucus glands and their secretions are crucial components of the adhesive digital pads of these animals. Despite a variety of hypothesised functions of these components in tree frog attachment, the functional morphology of the digital mucus glands and the chemistry of the digital mucus are barely known. Here, we use an interdisciplinary comparative approach to analyse these components, and discuss their roles in tree frog attachment. RESULTS: Using synchrotron micro-computer-tomography, we discovered in the arboreal frog Hyla cinerea that the ventral digital mucus glands differ in their morphology from regular anuran mucus glands and form a subdermal gland cluster. We show the presence of this gland cluster also in several other—not exclusively arboreal—anuran families. Using cryo-histochemistry as well as infrared and sum frequency generation spectroscopy on the mucus of two arboreal (H. cinerea and Osteopilus septentrionalis) and of two terrestrial, non-climbing frog species (Pyxicephalus adspersus and Ceratophrys cranwelli), we find neutral and acidic polysaccharides, and indications for proteinaceous and lipid-like mucus components. The mucus chemistry varies only little between dorsal and ventral digital mucus in H. cinerea, ventral digital and abdominal mucus in H. cinerea and O. septentrionalis, and between the ventral abdominal mucus of all four studied species. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a digital mucus gland cluster in various anuran families, as well as the absence of differences in the mucus chemistry between arboreal and non-arboreal frog species indicate an adaptation towards generic functional requirements as well as to attachment-related requirements. Overall, this study contributes to the understanding of the role of glands and their secretions in tree frog attachment and in bioadhesion in general, as well as the evolution of anurans.  aPublisher supplied data  a13353cStichting voor de Technische Wetenschappen  aDMR 1610483cNational Science Foundation  aIOS 1656645cNational Science Foundation0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHyla 3abioadhesion 3achemistry 3aevolution 3afrogs 3amucus 3apolysaccharides 3asecretion 3aspectroscopy1 aSingla, Saranshu1 aNyarko, Alex1 aSchipper, Henk1 avan den Berg, Frank T.1 aKaur, Sukhmanjot1 aAstley, Henry C.1 aGussekloo, Sander W.S.1 aDhinojwala, Ali1 avan Leeuwen, Johan L.0 tFrontiers in zoology.g2019 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.19-19dBioMed CentralwJournal:J000001775x1742-99947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12983-019-0315-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245008200205300002000287506007600307520133300383592002801716506003701744650002501781650002201806650001401828650001501842650001301857650001901870650001701889650002301906650001401929650000901943650001801952650003001970650001102000650002002011650000902031650001402040650001202054653002102066653002502087653002902112700002202141700002702163700001702190773017602207856007902383852000902462655001202471IND60172227620221207111119.0150602e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017222762DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.09124581092doi7 aPMC34270922pmcid7 a228697312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Jin Hyang10aStrategies to alleviate original antigenic sin responses to influenza viruses  ap. 13751-13756.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOriginal antigenic sin is a phenomenon wherein sequential exposure to closely related influenza virus variants reduces antibody (Ab) response to novel antigenic determinants in the second strain and, consequently, impairs the development of immune memory. This could pose a risk to the development of immune memory in persons previously infected with or vaccinated against influenza. Here, we explored strategies to overcome original antigenic sin responses in mice sequentially exposed to two closely related hemagglutinin 1 neuraminidase 1 (H1N1) influenza strains A/PR/8/34 and A/FM/1/47. We found that dendritic cell–activating adjuvants [ Bordetella pertussis toxin (PT) or CpG ODN or a squalene-based oil-in-water nanoemulsion (NE)], upon administration during the second viral exposure, completely protected mice from a lethal challenge and enhanced neutralizing-Ab titers against the second virus. Interestingly, PT and NE adjuvants when administered during the first immunization even prevented original antigenic sin in subsequent immunization without any adjuvants. As an alternative to using adjuvants, we also found that repeated immunization with the second viral strain relieved the effects of original antigenic sin. Taken together, our studies provide at least three ways of overcoming original antigenic sin.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBordetella pertussis 3aInfluenza A virus 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3aepitopes 3ahemagglutinins 3aimmunization 3aimmunologic memory 3ainfluenza 3amice 3ananoemulsions 3aoligodeoxyribonucleotides 3apeople 3apertussis toxin 3arisk 3asialidase 3aviruses 0across-reactivity 0aantigen presentation 0amemory T-cell activation1 aDavis, William G.1 aSambhara, Suryaprakash1 aJacob, Joshy0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 Aug. 21, v. 109, no. 34 p.13751-13756dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.09124581093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02025naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008300169300001800252520066100270592002800931650001300959650003000972650000901002650002301011650001101034650003201045650001901077650001401096650004401110651001201154700001601166700001201182700002001194700001501214700001901229700001401248700002301262700002201285700002101307773015601328856008601484852000901570655001201579IND60549463420221119220814.0160908e20151224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054946342DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b008242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWin, Nwet Nwet10aPicrajavanicins A–G, Quassinoids from Picrasma javanica Collected in Myanmar  ap. 3024-3030.  aSeven new tetracyclic quassinoids, picrajavanicins A–G (1–7), along with three known analogues, were isolated from a CHCl₃-soluble extract of the bark of Picrasma javanica collected in Myanmar.

The present study aimed to investigate the testis function and the duration of spermatogenesis in the southeastern four-eyed opossum, Philander frenatus. Testes of six adult males were routinely processed for histological and stereological analyses. In order to determine the duration of spermatogenesis, intratesticular injections of tritiated thymidine were performed 1h, 13days and 21days before the sacrifice. Based on the development of the acrosomic system, ten stages of the seminiferous epithelium cycle were characterized. The mean body and testis weights for the P. frenatus were respectively 326±20g and 0.4±0.05g, providing a gonadosomatic index of 0.3±0.02%. The most advanced germ cell types labeled at 1h, 13days and 21days after thymidine injections were, respectively, preleptotene spermatocytes at stage IV, pachytene spermatocytes at stage IV and diplotene spermatocytes at stage IX. Based on the stages frequencies and the most advanced labeled germ cells, each spermatogenic cycle and the entire spermatogenic process lasted respectively 13.5±0.5 and 60.9±2.4days. When compared to the vast majority of eutherian mammals already investigated, these data indicate that the Philander frenatus presents a relatively long duration of spermatogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeotropics 3aPhilander 3aadults 3agonadosomatic index 3ahistology 3amale genitalia 3amales 3aopossums 3apachytene stage 3aseminiferous epithelium 3aspermatocytes 3aspermatogenesis 3athymidine 3atritium 0aSpermatogenesis 0aTestis 0aPhilander frenatus 0aMarsupial 0aReproduction1 aCordeiro, D.A.1 aNogueira, J.C.1 aTalamoni, S.A.1 aFrança, L.R.1 aCosta, G.M.J.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2017 Sept., v. 184 p.102-109dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2017.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013200163300001200295520118300307592002801490650001301518650001101531650001201542650001201554650001101566650001501577650001401592650001201606650001701618650002301635650001101658650001101669650001101680651001001691651002001701773013301721856008101854852000901935655001201944IND60481589320221121135739.0160329e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048158932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-016-5111-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yuhong10aSize distribution characteristics of carbonaceous aerosol in Xishuangbanna, southwest China: a sign for biomass burning in Asia  ap. 148.  aIn 2012, size-segregated aerosol samples were collected in Xishuangbanna, a forest station in southwest China. The concentrations of organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC for short) were quantified with thermal/optical carbon analyzer in the filter samples. OC and EC exhibited similar seasonal patterns, with the highest concentrations in spring, possibly due to the influence of biomass burning in south and southeast Asia. The mass size distributions of OC and EC were bimodal in all the sampling seasons, each with a dominant peak in the fine mode of 0.4–0.7 μm and a coarse peak in the size range of 2.1–4.7 μm. In fine mode, OC and EC showed smaller geometric mean diameters (GMDs) during winter. OC and EC were prone to be more concentrated in fine particles in spring and winter than in summer and autumn. Furthermore, EC was more abundant in fine particles than OC. Good correlations (R ² = 0.75–0.82) between OC and EC indicated that they had common dominant sources of combustion such as biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion emissions. The daily average OC/EC ratios ranged from 2.1 to 9.1, more elevated OC/EC ratios being found in the winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aautumn 3abiomass 3aburning 3acarbon 3acombustion 3aemissions 3aforests 3afossil fuels 3aseasonal variation 3aspring 3asummer 3awinter 3aChina 3aSouth East Asia0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2016 Mar., v. 188, no. 3 p.148-148dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-016-5111-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03130naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015900169300001400328520148700342592002801829650002401857650002501881650002501906650002701931650001501958650001501973650001701988650001902005650001702024650001902041650002102060650001102081650003202092650002402124650002102148650001302169653003202182653003002214653001402244653000902258653001902267700002102286700001302307700001802320700001602338700001302354700001702367773010902384856008602493852000902579655001202588IND60581904420221116170253.0180905e20171001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058190442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.08.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ling-Li10aDescribing the holistic toxicokinetics of hepatotoxic Chinese herbal medicines by a novel integrated strategy: Dioscorea bulbifera rhizome as a case study  ap. 40-48.  aIt is vital to monitor the holistic toxicokinetics of toxic Chinese herbal medicines (CHMs) for safety. Although an integrated strategy based on the area under the curve (AUC) has been proposed to characterize the pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic properties of CHMs, improvement is still needed. This study attempted to use 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) as weighting coefficient to investigate holistic toxicokinetics of the major diosbulbins i.e. diosbulbin A (DA), diosbulbin B (DB), and diosbulbin C (DC) after oral administration of Dioscorea bulbifera rhizome (DBR) extract. Firstly, the cytotoxicities of the three diosbulbins on human hepatic L02 cells were evaluated and the IC50 values were calculated. Then, integrated toxicokinetics of multiple diosbulbins based on AUC and IC50 were determined. Finally, correlations between integrated plasma concentrations and hepatic injury biomarkers including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bile acid (TBA) were analyzed. As a result, integrated plasma concentrations were correlated well with TBA and the correlation between TBA and IC50-weighting integrated plasma concentrations was better than that of AUC-weighting integrated plasma concentrations. In conclusion, the newly developed IC50-weighting method is expected to generate more reasonable integrated toxicokinetic parameters, which will help to guide the safe usage of DBR in clinical settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea bulbifera 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aaspartate transaminase 3abile acids 3abiomarkers 3acase studies 3achromatography 3acytotoxicity 3ahepatotoxicity 3aherbal medicines 3ahumans 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aoral administration 3apharmacokinetics 3arhizomes 0aDioscorea bulbifera rhizome 0aIntegrated toxicokinetics 0aLC-QqQ-MS 0aIC50 0aHepatotoxicity1 aZhao, Dong-Sheng1 aShi, Wei1 aLi, Zhuo-Qing1 aWu, Zi-Tian1 aLi, Ping1 aLi, Hui Jun,0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Oct. 01, v. 1064 p.40-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.08.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245006700177300001600244520176900260592002802029650001902057650002002076650002402096650001702120650001902137650002002156650002502176650001302201650001302214650002302227650001502250650001302265650001102278650001602289651001402305651002302319700002002342700001702362700001602379700001902395700001802414700002702432700001602459700002002475700002302495773013402518856008102652852000902733655001202742IND60481589420221121135757.0160207e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048158942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-014-9590-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes, Mariana M. P. B.10aAdaptive management of marine mega-fauna in a changing climate  ap. 209-224.  aManagement of marine mega-fauna in a changing climate is constrained by a series of uncertainties, often related to climate change projections, ecological responses, and the effectiveness of strategies in alleviating climate change impacts. Uncertainties can be reduced over time through adaptive management. Adaptive management is a framework for resource conservation that promotes iterative learning-based decision making. To successfully implement the adaptive management cycle, different steps (planning, designing, learning and adjusting) need to be systematically implemented to inform earlier steps in an iterative way. Despite the critical role that adaptive management is likely to play in addressing the impacts of climate change on marine mega-fauna few managers have successfully implemented an adaptive management approach. We discuss the approaches necessary to implement each step of an adaptive management cycle to manage marine mega-fauna in a changing climate, highlighting the steps that require further attention to fully implement the process. Examples of sharks and rays (Selachimorpha and Batoidea) on the Great Barrier Reef and little penguins, Eudyptula minor, in south-eastern Australia are used as case studies. We found that successful implementation of the full adaptive management cycle to marine mega-fauna needs managers and researchers to: (1) obtain a better understanding of the capacity of species to adapt to climate change to inform the planning step; (2) identify strategies to directly address impacts in the marine environment to inform the designing step; and (3) develop systematic evaluation and monitoring programs to inform the learning step. Further, legislation needs to flexible to allow for management to respond.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChondrichthyes 3aEudyptula minor 3aadaptive management 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3alaws and regulations 3alearning 3amanagers 3amarine environment 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3asharks 3auncertainty 3aAustralia 3aGreat Barrier Reef1 aChambers, Lynda1 aChin, Andrew1 aDann, Peter1 aDobbs, Kirstin1 aMarsh, Helene1 aPoloczanska, Elvira S.1 aMaison, Kim1 aTurner, Malcolm1 aPressey, Robert L.0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2016 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.209-224dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-014-9590-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245007100214300001600285520172400301592002802025650001902053650001802072650001602090650002002106650002402126650002902150650001802179650001902197650001202216650002202228650001502250650002102265650001502286650001002301650001702311650001402328650002102342650002402363650001902387651001102406653001402417653001802431653001002449653002902459653001202488653002202500700005702522700001902579700001602598700001802614773011902632856008802751852000902839655001202848IND60623292620221118165350.0210219e20190310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062329262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.2842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Ching-chun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1898-533010aPrenatal exposure to PM2.5 and Congenital Heart Diseases in Taiwan  ap. 880-886.  aGestational exposure to ambient air pollution has been associated with Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs). However, only a few studies, with inconsistent results, have investigated the effects of PM₂.₅ exposure during early pregnancy. This study aims to evaluate the association between prenatal exposure to PM₂.₅ and CHDs occurrence. We selected 782 births reported to have CHDs between 2007 and 2014 from the Taiwanese Birth Registry and randomly selected 4692 controls without any birth defects using a population-based case-control design. Data of exposure to ambient air pollutants, mainly PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, CO, SO₂, NO₂, and O₃ during weeks 3–8 of pregnancy were retrieved from air quality monitoring stations and interpolated to every township using ordinary kriging. We applied unconditional logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders to evaluate the associations. The results revealed a positive correlation between increased PM₂.₅ exposure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.03–1.42, per interquartile range change = 13.4 μg/m³) during early pregnancy and overall CHDs occurrence. Furthermore, we found that atrial septal defect (aOR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.01–2.02), endocardial cushion defect (aOR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.01–5.58), and pulmonary artery and valve stenosis (aOR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.06–2.78) were significantly associated with PM₂.₅ exposures. No similar effects were observed for the other air pollutants. This study has demonstrated some positive associations between increased PM₂.₅ exposure during the critical period of cardiac embryogenesis and certain CHDs occurrence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acarbon monoxide 3aconfidence interval 3acongenital abnormalities 3aembryogenesis 3aheart diseases 3akriging 3amaternal exposure 3amonitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3aodds ratio 3aozone 3aparticulates 3apregnancy 3apulmonary artery 3aregression analysis 3asulfur dioxide 3aTaiwan 0aPregnancy 0aAir pollution 0aPM2.5 0aCongenital Heart Disease 0aKriging 0aPrenatal exposure1 aChen, Bing-yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1010-59921 aPan, Shih-chun1 aHo, Yi-lwun1 aGuo, Yue Leon0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 10, v. 655 p.880-886dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.2843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245014700162300002000309520116300329592002801492650002801520650001701548650001901565650001001584650001901594650002601613650001501639650001301654650001301667650000901680650002301689650001801712653001001730653001901740653002001759653001301779653002801792653001601820700001201836700001501848700001701863700001701880700001401897700001601911700001801927700001601945700001801961700001701979773012601996856008002122852000902202655001202211IND60586581020221121230310.0171214e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058658102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b142672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Tengfei10aElectrospun Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate)/Graphene Oxide Scaffold: Enhanced Properties and Promoted in Vivo Bone Repair in Rats  ap. 42589-42600.  aBone tissue engineering emerges as an advantageous technique to achieve tissue regeneration. Its scaffolds must present excellent biomechanical properties, where bare polymers poorly perform. Development of new biomaterials with high osteogenic capacity is urgently pursued. In this study, an electrospun poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate)/graphene oxide (P34HB/GO) nanofibrous scaffold is successfully fabricated and characterized. The effects of GO amount on scaffold morphology, biomechanical properties, and cellular behaviors are investigated. GO reduces the fiber diameter and enhances porosity, hydrophilicity, mechanical properties, cellular performance, and osteogenic differentiation of scaffolds. P34HB/GO triumphs over P34HB in in vivo bone regeneration in critical-sized calvarial defect of rats. We believe that this study is the first to evaluate the capability of in vivo bone repair of electrospun P34HB/GO scaffold. With facile fabrication process, favorable porous structures, enhanced biomechanical properties, and fast osteogenic capability, P34HB/GO scaffold holds practical potentials for bone tissue engineering application.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomechanics 3abone formation 3abones 3ahydrophilicity 3amechanical properties 3ananofibers 3apolymers 3aporosity 3arats 3atissue engineering 3atissue repair 0ap34hb 0agraphene oxide 0aelectrospinning 0ascaffold 0abone tissue engineering 0acell homing1 aLi, Guo1 aLin, Shiyu1 aTian, Taoran1 aMa, Quanquan1 aZhang, Qi1 aShi, Sirong1 aXue, Changyue1 aMa, Wenjuan1 aCai, Xiaoxiao1 aLin, Yunfeng0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 9, no. 49 p.42589-42600dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b142673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245016900167300001800336520148800354592002801842650002601870650003101896650001601927650001301943650001201956650001801968650001701986650001702003650002202020650001802042650001702060650001602077650002102093650000902114650001902123650001402142650003202156700002202188700001602210700002102226700002102247700002102268700002202289700002102311773015602332856008602488852000902574655001202583IND60549463620221119220726.0160908e20151224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054946362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jnatprod.5b008332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMon, Htwe H.10aSerrulatane Diterpenoid from Eremophila neglecta Exhibits Bacterial Biofilm Dispersion and Inhibits Release of Pro-inflammatory Cytokines from Activated Macrophages  ap. 3031-3040.  aThe purpose of this study was to assess the biofilm-removing efficacy and inflammatory activity of a serrulatane diterpenoid, 8-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (1), isolated from the Australian medicinal plant Eremophila neglecta. Biofilm breakup activity of compound 1 on established Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms was compared to the antiseptic chlorhexidine and antibiotic levofloxacin. In a time-course study, 1 was deposited onto polypropylene mesh to mimic a wound dressing and tested for biofilm removal. The ex-vivo cytotoxicity and effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release were studied in mouse primary bone-marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) cells. Compound 1 was effective in dispersing 12 h pre-established biofilms with a 7 log₁₀ reduction of viable bacterial cell counts, but was less active against 24 h biofilms (approximately 2 log₁₀ reduction). Compound-loaded mesh showed dosage-dependent biofilm-removing capability. In addition, compound 1 displayed a significant inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion from BMDM cells, but interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) secretion was not significant. The compound was not cytotoxic to BMDM cells at concentrations effective in removing biofilm and lowering cytokine release. These findings highlight the potential of this serrulatane diterpenoid to be further developed for applications in wound management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aantiseptics 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3achlorhexidine 3acytotoxicity 3aditerpenoids 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alevofloxacin 3amacrophages 3amedicinal plants 3amice 3apolypropylenes 3asecretion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aChristo, Susan N.1 aNdi, Chi P.1 aJasieniak, Marek1 aRickard, Heather1 aHayball, John D.1 aGriesser, Hans J.1 aSemple, Susan J.0 tJournal of natural products.g2015 Dec. 24, v. 78, no. 12 p.3031-3040dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of Pharmacognosyx1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jnatprod.5b008333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008700171300001800258520171900276592002801995650002302023650001102046650001102057650001502068650001502083650001502098650002602113650001502139650002702154650002102181651001102202653003202213653002302245653003702268653002402305653003202329653002402361700002202385700001802407773012102425856008802546852000902634655001202643IND60623292720221118165613.0210219e20190310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062329272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.2862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBukvareva, E.10aNational assessment of ecosystem services in Russia: Methodology and main problems  ap. 1181-1196.  aThe Project TEEB-Russia is the first attempt at a nation-wide assessment of ecosystem services (ES) in Russia. The result of the pilot phase of the project (2013–2015) was the “Prototype National Report on Ecosystem Services of Russia, Volume 1, Terrestrial Ecosystems Services”. A methodology for ES assessment was developed with allowance for the current status of the national public statistics. The units of ES assessment were the constituent entities of the Russian Federation. ES volumes supplied by ecosystems and consumed by humans were assessed. A number of productive (provisioning) and environment-forming (regulating) ES were evaluated in terms of quantitative scientific indicators; others were scored in terms of natural and socioeconomic factors that determine the supply and use of ES. The degree to which ES are consumed by humans was assessed by the ratio of supplied ES volumes to consumed ES volumes. The constituents of the Russian Federation were compared with respect to the balance of natural factors determining ES supply and socioeconomic factors determining ES use.Analyses of available data show that a national ES assessment can be started on the basis of the current national system of data collection. The creation of a full national system for assessment and monitoring of ES requires, in the short term, solving the problem of extremely unequal areas of administrative regions, ensuring availability and regular updating of data relevant for ES assessment that are already being collected by federal agencies as well as of the satellite maps of terrestrial ecosystems of Russia, and elaborating models linking ES volume to land cover types for the entire territory of Russia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystem services 3ahumans 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aprototypes 3asatellites 3asocioeconomic factors 3astatistics 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3avegetation types 3aRussia 0aConsumed ecosystem services 0aEvaluation methods 0aIndicators of ecosystem services 0aNational assessment 0aSupplied ecosystem services 0aUnits of assessment1 aZamolodchikov, D.1 aGrunewald, K.0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 10, v. 655 p.1181-1196dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.2863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245018200163300002000345520168200365592002802047650003702075650001402112650002202126650001502148650003702163650002202200650001402222650001602236653001902252653002802271653003502299653004302334653004202377653001602419653003002435700001902465700002102484700002202505700001902527700002002546700002002566700002402586700002202610773012602632856008002758852000902838655001202847IND60586581120221120163039.0171214e20171213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058658112DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b143692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatveyev, Yury10aEffect of Polarization Reversal in Ferroelectric TiN/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/TiN Devices on Electronic Conditions at Interfaces Studied in Operando by Hard X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy  ap. 43370-43376.  aBecause of their compatibility with modern Si-based technology, HfO₂-based ferroelectric films have recently attracted attention as strong candidates for applications in memory devices, in particular, ferroelectric field-effect transistors or ferroelectric tunnel junctions. A key property defining the functionality of these devices is the polarization dependent change of the electronic band alignment at the metal/ferroelectric interface. Here, we report on the effect of polarization reversal in functional ferroelectric TiN/Hf₀.₅Zr₀.₅O₂/TiN capacitors on the potential distribution across the stack and the electronic band line-up at the interfaces studied in operando by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. By tracking changes in the position of Hf₀.₅Zr₀.₅O₂ core-level lines with respect to those of the TiN electrode in both short- and open-circuit configurations following in situ polarization reversal, we derive the conduction band offset to be 0.7 (1.0) eV at the top and 1.7 (1.0) eV at the bottom interfaces for polarization, pointing up (down), respectively. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy profiling of the sample cross-section in combination with the laboratory X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal the presence of a TiOₓ/TiON layer at both interfaces. The observed asymmetry in the band line-up changes in the TiN/Hf₀.₅Zr₀.₅O₂/TiN memory stack is explained by different origin of these oxidized layers and effective pinning of polarization at the top interface. The described methodology and first experimental results are useful for the optimization of HfO₂-based ferroelectric memory devices under development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aasymmetry 3acomputer hardware 3aelectrodes 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3amaterials science 3aoxidation 3atransistors 0ahafnium oxides 0aferroelectric switching 0aferroelectric tunnel junctions 0aferroelectric field-effect transistors 0ahard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 0ain operando 0aelectronic band alignment1 aNegrov, Dmitry1 aChernikova, Anna1 aLebedinskii, Yury1 aKirtaev, Roman1 aZarubin, Sergei1 aSuvorova, Elena1 aGloskovskii, Andrei1 aZenkevich, Andrei0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Dec. 13, v. 9, no. 49 p.43370-43376dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b143693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245011200169300001600281520137300297536027601670592002801946650002701974650002302001650001502024650001102039650001002050650001902060650002302079650001002102650003502112650002102147650001202168650001302180653003002193653002202223653003002245653002102275653001302296700002202309700001902331700002202350700002702372700002102399700002002420700002202440700002202462773013202484856008002616852000902696655001202705IND60616351420221119071556.0181016e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061635142DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387145455062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlanchard, Myra T.10aAssessment of a fluorescent antibody test for the detection of antibodies against epizootic bovine abortion  ap. 622-630.  aThe current study was directed at developing and validating an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) capable of detecting antibodies specific for the agent of epizootic bovine abortion (aoEBA). Sensitivity and specificity was determined by comparing antibody titers from 114 fetuses infected with aoEBA with 68 fetuses diagnosed with alternate infectious etiologies. Data established specificity at 100% and sensitivity at 94.7% when cutoff criteria for a positive test were assigned at a titer of ≥1,000. Potential cross-reactivity was noted in samples from 3 fetuses with antibody titers of 10 or100; all were infected with Gram-positive organisms. The remaining 65 fetuses infected with microbes other than aoEBA, and an additional 12 negative reference sera, did not have detectable titers. The IFAT-based serology assay is rapid, reproducible, and unaffected by fluid color or opacity. Total fetal immunoglobulin (Ig)G was also evaluated as an aid for diagnosing EBA. Significantly higher concentrations of IgG were identified in fetuses infected with aoEBA as compared to those with alternate infectious etiologies. The presence of IgG is a sensitive indicator of EBA and increases the specificity of FAT-based serologic diagnosis when titers are 10 or 100. Taken together, serology and IgG analyses suggest that the incidence of EBA may be underestimated.  aFunding This study was supported in part by funds provided by the Center for Food Animal Health, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis; USDA Formula Funds, USDA Western Regional Research Project W-112 and the California Cattlemen’s Association.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aabortion (animals) 3aantibodies 3acattle 3acolor 3across reaction 3aepizootic diseases 3afetus 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aopacity 3aserology 0aEpizootic bovine abortion 0afoothill abortion 0afluorescent antibody test 0aimmunoglobulin G 0aserology1 aAnderson, Mark L.1 aHoar, Bruce R.1 aPires, Alda F.

The ring is constantly subjected to thermal and mechanical wear counteracting the growth of the ring. If the ring hardens or if the growth of the ring is too rapid, the kiln needs to be shut down and the ring removed, reducing the operational time and profitability of the process. In the present study, ring deposits from a limestone fed long rotary kiln producing quicklime was sampled and characterized in detail by SEM-EDS, dynamic rate TG, and XRD analyses. This work identifies three hardening mechanisms active in the kiln, an increased densification of the ring deposits near the refractory surface, the formation of calcite and spurrite through carbonation of the ring deposits, and the intrusion of molten fuel ash and product into the refractory, resulting in a strong attachment of the deposit to the refractory surface. The work also concludes that a significant part of the ring deposit has its origin in the fuel ash, contributing to deposit mass and increasing the ring growth rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalcite 3acalcium oxide 3acarbonation 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afuels 3akilns 3alimestone 3aprofitability 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry1 aCarlborg, Markus1 aBroström, Markus1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1095-91540 tEnergy & fuels.g2019 Sept. 23, v. 33, no. 11 p.11731-11740dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.9b008653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02465naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245009400164300001600258520136000274592002801634650001101662650001101673650002901684650001601713650000901729650001801738653001701756653003601773653002901809653001901838653001701857700001301874700001301887773009701900856008501997852000902082655001202091IND60648448620221120121844.0191114e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064844862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuanyuan,10aMultivariable robust blade pitch control design to reject periodic loads on wind turbines  ap. 329-341.  aThe demand on sustainable operations of large-scale wind turbines necessitates the concurrent advancement of power regulation and load mitigation through blade pitch control. Traditional collective pitch control (CPC) mechanisms can only deal with symmetric disturbances. The advent of individual pitch control (IPC) provides new opportunities to mitigate asymmetric or periodic loads on blades. Nevertheless, difficulties in control synthesis remain. In order for IPC to be truly effective, the complicated dynamic coupling between turbine components has to be accounted for. Moreover, wind turbine dynamics is highly nonlinear, and significant modeling uncertainties exist. In this research, a multivariable robust IPC framework is developed, aiming at rejecting periodic loads. The inter-blade coupling is explicitly modeled to provide response characteristics in the frequency domain. Subsequently, the structured singular values (μ)-synthesis strategy is adopted, as it shows distinct capability of dealing with periodic loads. In particular, weighting functions can be tailored to suppress response peaks at periodic frequencies with guaranteed robustness. Systematic case investigations indicate that, with the proposed IPC strategy, one can achieve significant periodic load mitigation as well as fatigue alleviation in speed-varying wind fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablades 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3auncertainty 3awind 3awind turbines 0aWind turbine 0aPeriodic disturbances rejection 0aIndividual pitch control 0aRobust control 0aμ-synthesis1 aChen, Xu1 aTang, J.0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Feb., v. 146 p.329-341dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245010000211300002000311506007600331520063800407592002801045506003701073650002401110650001501134650001201149650003001161650002601191650001601217650001501233650000901248653002101257653001701278653000801295700002201303700002401325700002101349700001901370700001801389700002201407700002101429700002001450773017601470856007901646852000901725655001201734IND60172229820221207105644.0150602e20120821xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017222982DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11167381092doi7 aPMC34270702pmcid7 a228296652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMchedlishvili, Levan10aReconstitution of the central and peripheral nervous system during salamander tail regeneration  ap.

The recent 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus originated from swine and not only did it cause widespread infection in humans, but was also transmitted back to swine in Asia, Europe and America. What may be the prevailing situation in Africa, particularly in sub‐Saharan Africa, with respect to the circulation of classical swine or pandemic influenza? The ecology of influenza viruses, as well as the epidemiology of human or animal influenza, is poorly understood in the region. In particular, little is known about swine influenza in Africa despite the relevance of this production in the continent and the widespread pig husbandry operations in urban and rural areas. In this review, the gap in the knowledge of classical and pandemic swine influenza is attributed to negligence of disease surveillance, as well as to the economic and public health impact that the disease may cause in sub‐Saharan Africa. However, emerging serological and virological evidence of swine influenza virus in some countries in the region underscores the importance of integrated surveillance to better understand the circulation and epidemiology of swine influenza, a disease of global economic and public health importance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3adisease surveillance 3aecology 3aeconomics 3ahumans 3apandemic 3apublic health 3arural areas 3aswine 3aswine influenza 3aviruses 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aEurope1 aOlaleye, D.1 aCapua, I.1 aCattoli, G.0 tZoonoses and public health.g2014 June, v. 61, no. 4 p.229-237dBlackwellx1863-19597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.12068  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245008700164300001600251520134200267592002801609650001001637650001201647650001501659650001001674650001001684650000901694650004301703650001801746650001301764650001401777650001701791650001901808650002601827653002201853653001601875653002101891653001401912700001601926700001601942700001701958773011201975856008602087852000902173655001202182IND60581904720221116170200.0180905e20170915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058190472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.08.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Hua10aRelationship between the color stability and impurity profile of cefotaxime sodium  ap. 235-244.  aThe color grade, mainly introduced in the processes of semisynthesis and storage, is an important index used to evaluate the quality of cefotaxime sodium. Because the drug itself is prone to degradation under susceptible conditions, including those involving moisture, heat, ultraviolet light, acids, alkalis, and oxidants, and a series of degradation products as impurities are generated. In this study, the factors affecting color grade stability and the degradation mechanisms of cefotaxime sodium were investigated by designing different accelerated stability tests under the aforementioned conditions. The degradation extent was studied by using analytical methods, such as a solution color comparison method, ultraviolet spectrophotometry, and HPLC. The relationship between the color grade stability of cefotaxime sodium and its impurity profile has been explored, and a reasonable degradation mechanism has been proposed. The manufacturing conditions of inspection have been optimized, and a scientific basis for drug packaging, storage, and transportation conditions has been established. The results show that the color grade stability of cefotaxime sodium is related to the impurity profile to some degree, and the difference between the actual color and the standard color can reflect the levels of impurities to some extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aalkalis 3acefotaxime 3acolor 3adrugs 3aheat 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amanufacturing 3aoxidants 3apackaging 3aspectroscopy 3atransportation 3aultraviolet radiation 0aCefotaxime sodium 0aColor grade 0aImpurity profile 0aStability1 aCui, Xuejun1 aLiu, Baoshu1 aZhang, Junli0 tJournal of chromatography.g2017 Sept. 15, v. 1063 p.235-244dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2017.08.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02281naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245012400209300001600333520091600349592002801265650002101293650001501314650001201329650001501341650001801356650002101374650002501395650001701420650001001437650001301447650001901460650001801479650001101497650000901508650002501517653001401542653001701556653001501573700002001588700002201608773009901630856008501729852000901814655001201823IND60675612420221120073529.0200330e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067561242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2019.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuukkonen, Tero1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1124-775X10aPeracetic acid for conditioning of municipal wastewater sludge: Hygienization, odor control, and fertilizing properties  ap. 371-379.  aPeracetic acid (PAA) is an environmentally friendly disinfectant and oxidizer used in several water and wastewater treatment applications. In the present study, PAA was utilized for the conditioning of municipal wastewater sludge before thickening and dewatering. It was shown that PAA can effectively prevent odor formation (i.e., H₂S and NH₃) and provide hygienization (using E. coli and Salmonella as indicators). Phytotoxicity can be prevented by controlling the amount PAA-conditioned sludge that is mixed in the soil to be fertilized. The required PAA dose for hygienization was relatively high (480 mg 100% PAA perL sludge) but the results indicated that other sludge stabilization processes are not necessarily required. Therefore, the proposed process involving PAA could be feasible in cases where limited land area is available for sludge processing or quick conditioning of sludge is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aSalmonella 3aammonia 3adewatering 3adisinfectants 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amunicipal wastewater 3aodor control 3aodors 3aoxidants 3aperacetic acid 3aphytotoxicity 3asludge 3asoil 3awastewater treatment 0aBiosolids 0aDisinfection 0aFertilizer1 aProkkola, Hanna1 aPehkonen, Simo O.0 tWaste management.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 102 p.371-379dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2019.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245009100210300001600301506007600317520148200393592002801875506003701903650001301940650002701953650004101980650000902021650002002030650002602050650002002076650002602096650001302122650001202135650001102147650001502158650001102173650001602184650001202200650002402212650001002236651001202246700001702258700002102275700001802296700001902314700002102333700002002354773011702374856007702491852000902568655001202577IND60690428220221207094127.0200426e20110201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069042822DNAL7 a10.4161/psb.6.2.143362doi7 aPMC31219862pmcid7 a214156002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠpoljarević, Marija14aThe relationship of proline content and metabolism on the productivity of maize plants  ap. 251-257.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe free proline content in maize ear-leaves, silk and pollen were analyzed in field grown plants which had matured to the pollination stage. Using maize hybrids PR34F02, PR35P12 and PR36B08 field trials were set up at two locations in eastern Croatia in two different years. Two enzymes of proline metabolism were analyzed in the same leaf samples and specific activities of synthetase (P5CS) and proline dehydrogenase (PDH). Plant productivity was evaluated at harvest by the estimation of total and fully developed grain number per ear and per plant, the mean single grain mass, and the mass of grain per plant. The year in which the plants were grown had a very significant effect on the free proline content in the leaf and pollen, as well as on the enzyme activities assayed. The differences between the plants from the two localities were very significant in all tested parameters of plant grain productivity. There was a significant genotype effect on proline content and P5CS total activity in leaf and on all the productivity parameters. Some of the correlations established suggest that the rate of proline synthesis and degradation in maize ear-leaf at pollination might contribute to the final grain production of the maize plant. Multiple regression analyses was used to further analyze the relationship between proline and grain productivity, but it is clear that future work should include other environmental conditions, plant species and organs such as roots.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aamine and amino acid oxidoreductases 3acorn 3acrop production 3aenvironmental factors 3aenzyme activity 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3apollen 3apollination 3aproline 3aregression analysis 3aroots 3aCroatia1 aAgić, Dejan1 aLisjak, Miroslav1 aGumze, Andrej1 aWilson, Ian D.1 aHancock, John T.1 aTeklić, Tihana0 tPlant signaling & behavior.g2011 Feb. 1, v. 6, no. 2 p.251-257dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2184x1559-23247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/psb.6.2.143363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02393naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245013400171300001800305520123500323592002801558650001101586650001301597650001401610650001301624650002901637650001501666650001801681650001601699653002201715653002301737653002101760653002301781653002201804773009901826856008501925852000902010655001202019IND60648448720221122000025.0211017e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064844872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Satyender10aExperimental and numerical investigations of a single and double pass porous serpentine wavy wiremesh packed bed solar air heater  ap. 1361-1387.  aThis research work presents the thermal performance investigation of a porous serpentine wavy wiremesh packed bed solar air heater, experimentally and numerically. Experimental results revealed the best thermal and thermohydraulic efficiencies for 93% porous double pass serpentine packed bed solar air heater and found to be about 80% and 74%, respectively, which is about 18% and 17% high compared to single pass, respectively. Whereas, numerical investigation is carried out on a CFD tool and the results are validated with experimental data. The range of porosity from 85% to 95%, wavelength from 0.05 m to 0.075 m, amplitude from 0.012 m to 0.016 m, hydraulic diameter from 0.025 m to 0.046 m and mass flow rate from 0.01 to 0.05 kg/s is considered to obtain optimum values for geometrical and flow parameters on the basis of THPP and exergy efficiency. The numerical results present the maximum 24.33% better thermohydraulic performance for serpentine packed bed solar air heater when compared to flat packed bed solar air heater. The wavelength of 0.075 m, amplitude of 0.012 m, hydraulic diameter of 0.0835 m, porosity of 90%, and mass flow rate of 0.03 kg/s is obtained as the optimum configuration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexergy 3ageometry 3amass flow 3aporosity 3arenewable energy sources 3aserpentine 3asolar heaters 3awavelengths 0aPorous packed bed 0aSerpentine channel 0aSolar air heater 0aThermal efficiency 0aExergy efficiency0 tRenewable energy.g2020 Jan., v. 145 p.1361-1387dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2019.06.1373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01844naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006500167300001600232520055800248592002800806650001600834650001800850650002900868650003600897650001400933650002000947650001000967650004100977650001801018650001501036650002601051650001701077700002301094700002201117700002001139700003501159700001801194773011901212856008201331852000901413655001201422IND60593208920221120031339.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059320892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-018-2322-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBishay, DaoudW.10aSecondary Metabolites from the Fungus Quambalaria cyanescens  ap. 274-277.  aA phytochemical study of the fungus Quambalaria cyanescens led to the isolation of one new natural compound (1), along with four known compounds (2–5).

To achieve the optimum skin delivery for metformin, the effects of the ratio of two surfactants (Tween:Span) on nanoparticles properties and their performance were investigated. Photon correlation spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Powder X-ray Diffractometer (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize the solid state of metformin in solid lipid nanoparticles. Generally, the particle size of nanoparticles decreased by the addition of co-emulsifier (Span®60). Results showed that all formulations made by binary mixtures of surfactants had low particle size, low Polydispersity index and high zeta potential. It was interesting to note that the smallest nanoparticles (203.8 ± 15.356) was obtained when the HLB of the binary surfactants (HLB of 11.67) was closer to the HLB of beeswax (HLB of 12) used in the preparation of SLN. It was also found that by decreasing the HLB of the system from 14.9 to 10.06 the zeta potential of SLNs increased from −0.651 ± 0.315 to −6.18 ± 0.438 mV. But, a further reduction in the HLB from 10.06 to 8.45 caused a reduction in the zeta potential from −6.18 to −3.596 ± 0.255. Results showed that the highest entrapment efficiency of 45.98 ± 9.20% was obtained for formulation with larger particle size and with the highest HLB value (HLB 14.9). DSC study showed that metformin in SLN is in an amorphous form. FT-IR spectra of Met-SLN showed that the prominent functional groups existed in the formulations which could be an indication of good entrapment of metformin in a lipid matrix. FT-IR results also ruled out any chemical interaction between the drug and the excipients. The amounts of metformin detected in the skin layers and the receptor chamber at all sampling times were higher for nanogel compared to metformin gel. This is an indication of a better performance of Metformin nanogel ex-vivo and could be developed further for clinical studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3abeeswax 3aclinical trials 3acolloids 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3agels 3alipids 3ametformin 3amoieties 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3aphotons 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurfactants 3azeta potential 0aMetformin 0aSolid lipid nanoparticles 0aUltra-sonication 0aDSC 0aFT-IR 0aSkin permeation1 aAkbari, Jafar1 aSaeedi, Majid1 aMorteza-Semnani, Katayoun1 aNokhodchi, Ali1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3244-24820 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 175 p.150-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2018.11.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003200145245009400177300001600271520113800287592002801425650001201453650002201465650001901487650002301506650003101529650001101560650001301571700002501584773009801609856004801707852000901755655001201764IND4486077620221120195659.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448607762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10498-010-9109-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, S.

This ratio, which has been termed Ï, is about 0.6 in surface seawater at 25Â°C and at equilibrium with contemporary atmospheric CO2 and increases towards 1.0 as seawater cools and pCO2 increases. These conclusions are based on field observations, laboratory experiments, and equilibrium calculations for the seawater carbonate system. Yet global geochemical modeling indicates that small departures of Î¨ from 1.0 would cause dramatic, rapid, and unrealistic change in atmospheric CO2. Î¨ can be meaningfully calculated for a water sample whether or not it is in equilibrium with the atmosphere. The analysis presented here demonstrates that the atmospheric CO2 balance can be maintained constant with respect to seawater CaCO3 reactions if one considers the difference between CaCO3 precipitation and burial and differing values for Ï (both <1.0) in regions of precipitation and dissolution within the ocean.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical reactions 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3aseawater1 aGattuso, Jean-Pierre0 tAquatic geochemistry.g2011 Sept., v. 17, no. 4-5 p.327-337dSpringer-Verlagx1380-61657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10498-010-9109-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009500166300001600261520200600277592002802283650002002311650001702331650001202348650001902360650001602379650001502395650002202410650001002432650001802442650000902460650001402469650002202483650001602505650001602521650001202537650001502549650001102564651001002575700002102585700002002606700002202626700001502648773013402663856008102797852000902878655001202887IND60481589820221121135801.0160207e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048158982DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-014-9595-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanerjee, Saon10aAdaptation strategies to combat climate change effect on rice and mustard in Eastern India  ap. 249-261.  aThe negative impact of climate change on crop production is alarming as the demand for food is expected to increase in coming years, at a rate of about 2 percent a year. Wet season rice (Oryza sativa) followed by mustard (Brassica juncea) is one of the prominent cropping sequences in Eastern India. Descreases in their productivity due to climate change will not only hamper the regional food security but also affect the global economy. Considering the fact, the present study aims to assess the impact of climate change on productivity of wet-season rice and mustard and to evaluate the effectiveness of agronomic adjustment as adaptation options. Crop growth simulation model (CGSM) is a very effective tool to predict the growth and yield of a crop. One CGSM, namely InfoCrop (Generic Crop Model), was calibrated and validated for the said crops for West Bengal State, Eastern India. After validation, the model was used to predict the yield under elevated thermal condition (1 and 3 °C rise over normal temperature). Moreover, the future weather situation as predicted by PRECIS (Providing Regional Climates for Impacts Studies) model was used as weather input of the CGSM and the yield was predicted for ten selected locations of West Bengal for the year 2025 and 2050. It was observed that the average yield reduction of the wet-season rice would be in the tune of about 20.0 % for 2025 and 27.8 % for 2050. The mustard yield of West Bengal may be reduced by 20.0 to 33.9 % for the year 2025 and up to 40 % for 2050. It was concluded that the negative impact of climate change on mustard grown in winter season will be more pronounced compared to wet-season rice. Adjustment of sowing time will be the simplest and effective adaptation option for both rice and mustard. Increased rate of nutrient application can sustain the rice yield under future climate. The older seedling at the time of transplanting of wet-season rice and increased seed rate of mustard were proved less effective.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica juncea 3aOryza sativa 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3acropping sequence 3acrops 3afood security 3arice 3aseedlings 3asimulation models 3asowing date 3atemperature 3aweather 3awet season 3awinter 3aIndia1 aDas, Subharanjan1 aMukherjee, Asis1 aMukherjee, Apurba1 aSaikia, B.0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2016 Feb., v. 21, no. 2 p.249-261dSpringer Netherlandsx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-014-9595-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011700164500001400281520168700295592002801982650002202010650003002032650001102062650001702073650001502090650003002105650002102135650001102156650000902167650001702176650001002193650001802203650001502221651001102236700001802247700002402265700002502289773011902314856007402433852000902507655001202516IND60704504320221123023645.0200724e20200425xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070450432DNAL7 a10.3390/w120512222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuidolini, Janaína 10aEnvironmental Land Use Conflicts in a Macroscale River Basin: A Preliminary Study Based on the Ruggedness Number  aNAL-light  aInadequate land use planning is one of the main driving forces leading to the occurrence of erosion and environmental degradation. The negative impacts of poor planning influence soil physical quality and fertility, agricultural productivity, water quality and availability, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In some areas, actual land use is not consistent with potential use. When this occurs, the area is termed as being in environmental land use conflict. Many studies have demonstrated the efficiency of the ruggedness number (RN) method for determining land use potential in watersheds. The RN method is simple and can be carried out using geographic information systems (GIS). However, the absence of potential land use or agricultural land suitability assessments is recurrent in territorial management plans or integrated water resources plans (IWRP), especially for macroscale river basins. Therefore, the aim of this preliminary study is to identify possible environmental land use conflicts at the Rio Grande Basin (BHRG), Brazil, using the Ruggedness Number. The results indicate high agricultural use potential and the predominance of appropriate or acceptable soil use at the BHRG. However, class 1, 2 and 3 environmental conflicts were identified in some Rio Grande sub-basins, suggesting greater environmental degradation risks. The findings clearly indicate that more exhaustive studies on environmental quality (soil capability, water, biodiversity) are required at the BHRG, especially in environmental land use conflict areas. We emphasize that this is an important preliminary study which may be carried out in any other macroscale hydrographic basin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural productivity 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3aland suitability 3arivers 3asoil 3aspatial data 3awater 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aBrazil1 aOmetto, Jean 1 aArcoverde, Gustavo 1 aGiarolla, Angélica 0 tWater.g2020 Apr. 25, v. 12, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w120512223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245014500157300002000302520143900322592002801761650001501789650001101804650001101815650001001826650002201836650001201858650001601870700001401886700001901900700001401919700001601933700001701949700002001966700001901986773012302005856007402128852000902202655001202211IND60641653020221120125847.0190505e20170523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064165302DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra03963h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ziyuan10aExperimental study of a passive thermal management system for three types of battery using copper foam saturated with phase change materials  ap. 27441-27448.  aBattery thermal management (BTM) technology is vital for the development of new energy vehicle because the lithium batteries exhibit a more resistive behavior leading to extra heat generation with age. The CF/PCM (copper foam/phase change material) coupled thermal management system for different types of lithium ion batteries such as 26650, 42110 and square (105 mm × 28 mm × 71 mm) were selected comparatively to research in detail, especially at a relatively high discharge rate. To evaluate the effect of the battery generating heat close to the actual operating conditions, the thermal management system in an insulated environment were investigated at discharge rate of 5C, in comparison with a natural convection environment. Furthermore, the results show that the effect of the temperature control based PCM is improved when compared to air-based BTM under an insulated environment. Moreover, the maximum temperature of 26650, 42110 and square batteries of CF/PCM coupled with BTM can be controlled below 44.37 °C, 51.45 °C and 50.69 °C for a longer time than those of the pure PCM based case and air-based case under the same conditions, respectively. The passive system was coupled with copper foam as a skeleton net structure to improve the strength of the PCM during its melting. More importantly, a CF/PCM (copper foam/phase change material) battery thermal management system was designed and tested experimentally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconvection 3acopper 3aenergy 3afoams 3alithium batteries 3amelting 3atemperature1 aLi, Xinxi1 aZhang, Guoqing1 aLv, Youfu1 aHe, Jieshan1 aLuo, Jinghai1 aYang, Chengzhao1 aYang, Chuxiong0 tRSC advances.g2017 May 23, v. 7, no. 44 p.27441-27448dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra03963h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011800171300001200289520165600301592002801957650001201985650001201997650002402009650001302033650001202046650002102058650001102079650000902090650001602099650001202115650001402127650001402141650001102155650001502166650002602181650001902207650000702226650001502233650001402248650000902262650001702271650001702288650001702305650001402322650001102336650001402347651001102361700003602372700002902408700003302437700002802470773013602498856008202634852000902716655001202725IND60613869320221117033554.0181011e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061386932DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7830-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Freitas, Ludmila10aSoil quality indicator of oxisols grown with sugarcane and native forest in northeastern São Paulo state, Brazil  ap. 642.  aThe evaluation of soil quality is an important tool for degradation monitoring and sustainable management implementation. The objective of this study was to measure physical and chemical soil properties to set soil quality and validate a model of soil quality indicator in latosols (oxisols) under sugarcane cropping and native forest. The study was carried out in the cities of Araras, Santa Ernestina, and Guariba in São Paulo State, Brazil. We collected 24 samples of disturbed and undisturbed soil at 0.0–0.10 m layer from three areas grown with sugarcane and neighboring locations under native woodland. We assessed the following soil properties: (a) chemical—pH in CaCl₂, organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P), potassium (K⁺), calcium (Ca²⁺), magnesium (Mg²⁺), potential acidity (H + Al), aluminum (Al³⁺), and sulfur (S); (b) physical—macro- and microporosity, soil bulk density (Ds), aggregate stability, mean weight diameter (MWD), rill (Kᵣ) and interrill (Kᵢ) global erodibility, shear stress (τc), and magnetic susceptibility (MS). Data underwent multivariate statistics to identify the properties that denote soil quality and to set their weights within the functions of soil quality indicator (SQI). This study showed that the multivariate analysis was efficient in determining which physical and chemical properties were most sensitive, of which we can mention total sand, MS, clay, microporosity, Mg, Ca, pH, and OM. We can therefore conclude that the quality indicators of soils grown with sugarcane were lower than those under forest were, showing the need for adoption of conservation management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOxisols 3aacidity 3aaggregate stability 3aaluminum 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3acities 3aclay 3aerodibility 3aforests 3amagnesium 3amagnetism 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amultivariate analysis 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3asand 3ashear stress 3asoil density 3asoil quality 3asugarcane 3asulfur 3awoodlands 3aBrazil1 aFilho, Marcílio Vieira Martins1 aCasagrande, José Carlos1 ade Oliveira, Ivanildo Amorim1 aSilva, Luiz Gabriel da,0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Sept., v. 77, no. 18 p.642-642dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7830-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01185naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245007200154520031900226592002800545650001700573650001800590650001400608650001200622650001500634700002000649700002200669773012200691856007300813852000900886655001200895IND60674479820221118024904.0191025e20190924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067447982DNAL7 a10.3390/f101008372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArts, Bas 14aThe Performance of REDD+: From Global Governance to Local Practices  aWhilst &lsquo;REDD&rsquo; is the acronym for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, &lsquo;REDD+&rsquo; refers to efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, foster conservation, promote the sustainable management of forests, and enhance forest carbon stocks [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon sinks 3adeforestation 3aemissions 3aforests 3agovernance1 aIngram, Verina 1 aBrockhaus, Maria 0 tForests.g2019 Sept. 24, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f101008373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012400171300001600295520164700311592002801958650002701986650001502013650002502028650002302053650001502076650002902091650001102120650002202131650001502153650001102168650001102179653003202190653001602222653002602238653001902264653001402283653003102297700002002328700002002348700002202368773011402390856008502504961001202589852000902601655001202610IND60537764620221119111442.0190416e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053776462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsah, Stanley T.10aPerception, acquisition and use of ecosystem services: Human behavior, and ecosystem management and policy implications  ap. 180-186.  aEcosystem services, fundamental to livelihoods and well-being, are reshaping environmental management and policy. However, the behavioral dimensions of ecosystem services and the responses of ordinary people to the management of those services, is less well understood. The ecosystem services framework lends itself to understanding the relationship between ecosystems and human behavior. Ecosystem services, according to the psychological theory of motivational functionalism, are motivations—the personal and social processes that initiate, direct and sustain human action. Thus, how people perceive, acquire and use ecosystem services influences the initiation, direction, and intensity of their behaviors. Profound understanding of how people perceive, acquire and use ecosystem services can help influence behavioral compliance with management and policy prescriptions. We use focus group interviewing to illustrate how ecosystem services relate to human behavior. Results show that people perceive, acquire and use indirect benefits while acquiring direct ecosystem services. Understanding indirect benefits has implications for the constitution and regulation of human behavior through ecosystem management and policy. Perceived ecosystem benefits, expressed in people׳s own words and from their own frames of reference, can facilitate better valuation of ecosystem services and setting of prices, compliance with ecosystem management and policy directives, recruitment and retention of ecosystem stewards, development of use policies, enhancement of user experiences, and encouragement of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acompliance 3aecosystem management 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental management 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alivelihood 3apeople 3aprices 0aIndirect ecosystem services 0aMotivations 0aBehavioral compliance 0aSense of place 0aCommunity 0aPro-environmental behavior1 aGuerry, Anne D.1 aBlahna, Dale J.1 aLawler, Joshua J.0 tEcosystem services.g2014 Dec., v. 10 p.180-186dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2014.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle01765naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001700190245008800207300001600295520082800311592002801139653001601167653001401183653001801197653001901215653001001234653001201244700001801256773007301274856008301347852000901430655001201439IND60555017220221121112301.0161026s2014    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055501722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2014.06.0052doi7 aPMC40853462pmcid7 a250097822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudyk, Olena10aBiochemical methods for monitoring protein thiol redox states in biological systems  ap. 803-813.  aOxidative post-translational modifications of proteins resulting from events that increase cellular oxidant levels play important roles in physiological and pathophysiological processes.

This report is designed to explore the roles of the upstream mediators of the intrinsic pathway, such as Bak/Bax, Bim, Puma and Noxa, during RV-induced apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma (ASTC-a-1 and A549) cell lines. RV treatment remarkably induced the activation of Bak but not Bax, and silencing Bak but not Bax by shRNA almost completely prevented RV-induced cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction and also largely prevented RV-induced AIF release, demonstrating the preferential engagement of Bak but not Bax during RV-induced apoptosis. In addition, although RV treatment induced a significant degradation of Mcl-1, knockdown of Mcl-1 by shRNA only modestly increased RV-induced Bak activation. Interestingly, silencing Bim but not Puma and Noxa remarkably attenuated RV-induced cell death, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and Bak activation, suggesting the important roles of Bim. Collectively, our findings for the first time demonstrate that RV induces apoptosis dominantly via a Bak- but not Bax-mediated AIF-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway in which Bim but not Puma and Noxa may supply the force to trigger Bak activation and subsequent apoptosis in both ASTC-a-1 and A549 cell lines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenocarcinoma 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-9 3afoods 3agrapes 3ahumans 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aresveratrol 3asignal transduction1 aWang, Xiaoping1 aChen, Tongsheng0 tCellular signalling.g2012 May, v. 24, no. 5 p.1037-1046dElsevier Inc.x0898-65687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cellsig.2011.12.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001900171245009000190300001400280520138300294592002801677650001001705650001401715650001001729650002401739650001101763650001501774650001001789650002201799650002901821650004701850650004201897650001101939650001101950650000901961650002501970650003201995650003202027650003002059650001602089650001602105700001902121700002802140773008402168856008602252990002302338852000902361655001202370IND60091791320221118052642.0141103e20110921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009179132DNAL7 a218405032pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2011.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoderre, Emily10aElectrophysiological measures of conflict detection and resolution in the Stroop task  ap. 51-59.  aConflict detection and resolution is crucial in a cognitive task like the Stroop task. Previous studies have identified an early negativity component (Nᵢₙc) as a prominent marker of Stroop conflict in event-related potentials (ERPs). However, to what extent this ERP component reflects conflict detection and/or resolution is still unclear. Here, we report a Stroop task in which the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of color and word stimuli presentation was manipulated in order to disentangle the roles of conflict detection and conflict resolution in generating Stroop-related ERP components. Separating the word from the color information gives us precise control over the timing of conflict. If the Nᵢₙc is related with conflict resolution it should be absent when the word appears during response preparation, as in a long-latency positive SOA. Our data shows that the Nᵢₙc occurs in all SOAs, even after a response has been made, supporting its role in the detection of stimulus conflict rather than conflict resolution. The use of SOA manipulation therefore allows for the examination of a wider temporal spectrum of interference in order to specify the functions of this conflict-related component. These results provide insight into the neural signatures of conflict processes, and have implications for models of cognitive control mechanisms in the brain.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acognition 3acolor 3aconflict management 3amodels 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aBrainxphysiology 2aConflict, Psychological. 2aElectrophysiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aEvoked Potentials, Visualxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aModels, Neurological 2aPhotic Stimulationxmethods 2aProblem Solvingxphysiology 2aReaction Timexphysiology 2aStroop Test 2aYoung Adult1 aConklin, Kathy1 avan Heuven, Walter J.B.0 tBrain research.g2011 Sept. 21, v. 1413 p.51-59dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2011.07.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01467naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245009200163300002000255520045500275592002800730650001400758650001200772650002000784650002200804650001100826700002200837700001600859700005400875773013600929856007901065852000901144655001201153IND60712061320221117224050.0201009e20200831xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071206132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.0c016342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Jingjing10aSynthesis of Thiocarbamoyl Fluorides and Isothiocyanates Using Amines with CF₃SO₂Cl  ap. 12374-12381.  aA practical and efficient method to synthesize thiocarbamyl fluorides and isothiocyanates from amines with trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride was developed.

We introduce intramolecular isotope distributions (isotopomers) as a methodology for detecting shifts in plant carbon metabolism over long times. Trends in a deuterium isotopomer ratio allow quantification of a biogeochemically relevant shift in the metabolism of C ₃ plants toward photosynthesis, driven by increasing atmospheric CO ₂ since industrialization. Isotopomers strongly increase the information content of isotope archives, and may therefore reveal long-term acclimation or adaptations to environmental changes in general. The metabolic information encoded in isotopomers of plant archives bridges a fundamental gap between experimental plant science and paleoenvironmental studies.  aPublisher supplied data 0aisotopomer 0aacclimation 0adeuterium 0aCO2 fertilization 0aatmospheric change1 aAugusti, Angela1 aBetson, Tatiana R.1 aNilsson, Mats B.1 aMarshall, John D.1 aSchleucher, Jurgen0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Dec. 22, v. 112, no. 51 p.15585-15590dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.15044931123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010400167300001200271520220200283592002802485650001102513650001702524650001202541650001402553650002602567650001302593650000902606650002102615650001502636651000902651700002202660700002702682700002202709773013602731856008202867852000902949655001202958IND60613869420221117033256.0181011e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061386942DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7819-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmadi, Farshad10aBivariate frequency analysis of low flow using copula functions (case study: Dez River Basin, Iran)  ap. 643.  aAccurate estimation of low flow as a criterion for different objectives in water resource management, including drought is of crucial importance. Despite the complex nature of water deficits, univariate methods have often been used to analyze the frequency of low flows. In this study, low flows of Dez River basin were examined during period of 1956–2012 using copula functions at the upstream of headbranches’ junction. For this purpose, at first 7-day series of low flow was extracted at the studied stations, then their homogeneity was examined by Mann–Kendall test. The results indicated that 7-day low flow series of Dez basin were homogenous. In the next stage, 12 different distribution functions were fitted onto the low flow data. Finally, for Sepid Dasht Sezar (SDS), Sepid Dasht Zaz (SDZ), and Tang Panj Bakhtiyari (TPB) stations, logistic distribution had the best fit, while for Tang Panj Sezar (TPS) station, GEV distribution enjoyed the best fit. After specifying the best fitted marginal distributions, seven different copula functions including Ali–Mikhail–Haq (AMH), Frank, Clayton, Galambos, Farlie–Gumbel–Morgenstern (FGM), Gumbel–Hougaard (GH), and Plackett were used for bivariate frequency analysis of the 7-day low flow series. The results revealed that the GH copula had the best fitness on paired data of SDS and SDZ stations. For TPS and TPB stations, Frank copula has had the best correspondence with empirical copula values. Next, joint and conditional return periods were calculated for the low flow series at the upstream of branches’ junction. The results of this study indicated that the risk of incidence of severe drought is higher in upstream stations (SDZ and SDS) when compared with downstream stations (TPB and TPS) in Dez basin. Generally, application of multivariate analysis allows researchers to investigate hydrological events with a more comprehensive view by considering the simultaneous effect of the influencing factors on the phenomenon of interest. It also enables them to evaluate different combinations of required scenarios for integrated management of basin and planning to cope with the damages caused by natural phenomena.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acase studies 3adrought 3ahydrology 3amultivariate analysis 3aplanning 3arisk 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aIran1 aRadmaneh, Feridon1 aSharifi, Mohammad Reza1 aMirabbasi, Rasoul0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Sept., v. 77, no. 18 p.643-643dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7819-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03315naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245007900209300001200288520176600300592002802066650002102094650001302115650001302128650001102141650002302152650001602175650001402191650002502205650001402230650001602244650000902260650001102269650001102280650001302291650001102304650001502315650001302330650002002343650001202363650001202375650001802387650001702405650002002422651001102442700001702453700002202470700002102492700002102513773013602534856008202670852000902752655001202761IND60613869520221117034100.0181011e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061386952DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-018-7747-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaint-Loup, Renaud1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0844-729912aA survey of groundwater quality in Tulum region, Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico  ap. 644.  aThe city of Tulum, in the state of Quintana Roo (Mexico) depends almost exclusively on groundwater for water supply. The groundwater is exploited from a coastal aquifer which contains a karst network that is considered as one of the largest ones on earth. Given the nature of karst aquifers, the whole area is very sensitive to contaminants and bacteria transport, because flow paths, residence time and degradation rates differ significantly from what can be observed in the porous aquifer. The present study focuses on isotopes (¹⁸O and ²H), dissolved ions’ concentration and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The result of our survey points out the anthropic impact on groundwater quality. Furthermore, the chloride concentrations illustrate the influence of seawater mixing and geological heterogeneity over the study area. Due to an exponential growth of the tourism industry, the needs in terms of water supply and water treatment increase significantly. Tulum is a coastal city, facing a coral reef and is bordered by the Sian Ka’an biosphere reserve, therefore, an environmental issue is added to the sanitary issue, both being the basis of the local economic development. Our results show that E. coli remains a major issue, as several samples tested were contaminated, in particular those in the city center. Ions’ survey shows an anthropic impact through nitrate, phosphate and fluoride concentrations, but the obtained values are not alarming. Considering the saline intrusion, chloride concentrations indicate that the area below the Tulum city center seems to be less permeable (and maybe less karstified) than the surrounding areas, as groundwater is less subject to seawater mixing than other sampling sites at similar distance to the coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aaquifers 3abacteria 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3acoral reefs 3adeuterium 3aeconomic development 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3aions 3akarsts 3amixing 3anitrates 3aoxygen 3aphosphates 3aseawater 3astable isotopes 3asurveys 3atourism 3awater quality 3awater supply 3awater treatment 3aMexico1 aFelix, Théo1 aMaqueda, Axaycatl1 aSchiller, Arnulf1 aRenard, Philippe0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2018 Sept., v. 77, no. 18 p.644-644dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-018-7747-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002000165245014900185300001600334520156200350592002801912650001601940650001801956650001601974650001101990650001402001650001702015650001402032650002902046650002002075650001302095650001302108650002002121650000902141650001902150650001902169650003802188650001002226650000902236650002202245650002502267650002502292650001602317650004602333650001802379650001102397650002202408650002302430650002002453650001102473650002502484650000902509650004102518650001902559650001602578650002302594650002002617650003202637650001702669650002202686650001602708700002102724700002102745700001802766700001702784773009002801856008202891852000902973655001202982IND4471231920221122022917.0141110e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447123192DNAL7 a209375442pmid7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStarke, Juliane10aShort-term individual nutritional care as part of routine clinical setting improves outcome and quality of life in malnourished medical patients  ap. 194-201.  aBACKGROUND & AIMS: Strategies to treat malnutrition lack practicability in the hospital setting. The present study aimed at developing and evaluating a routinely manageable concept for an improved nutritional care of malnourished in-hospital patients. METHODS: A randomized controlled intervention study was conducted. 132 risk patients defined by Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, were randomized to individualised nutrition support (intervention group [n = 66]) or standard hospital care (control group [n = 66]). Body weight, plasma vitamin levels, quality of life, complications, antibiotic therapies, readmissions and mortality were assessed. RESULTS: Nutrition interventions led to higher intakes (mean [standard deviation]) in energy (1553 [341] kcal vs. 1115 [381] kcal, p < 0.001) and protein (65.4 [16.4] g vs. 43.9 [17.2] g, p < 0.001). Intervention patients (n = 66) kept their body weight in comparison to control patients (n = 66; 0.0 [2.9] kg vs. −1.4 [3.2] kg, p = 0.008). Positive effects on plasma ascorbic acid level (46.7 [26.7] μmol/l vs. 34.1 [24.2] μmol/l, p = 0.010), SF-36 function summary scale (37 [11] % vs. 32 [9] %, p = 0.030), number of complications (4/66 vs. 13/66, p = 0.035), antibiotic therapies (1/66 vs. 8/66, p = 0.033) and readmissions (17/64 vs. 28/61, p = 0.027) were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Malnourished patients profit from nutrition support regarding nutrition status and quality of life. They have fewer complications, need fewer antibiotics and are less often re-hospitalised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3aascorbic acid 3abody weight 3aenergy 3ahospitals 3amalnutrition 3amortality 3anutritional intervention 3anutritive value 3apatients 3aproteins 3aquality of life 3arisk 3arisk screening 3aweight control 2a24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3xblood 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAscorbic Acidxblood 2aBody Weight 2aElder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aGlutathionexblood 2aHospitalization 2aHumans 2aIntervention Studies 2aMale 2aMalnutritionxepidemiologyxtherapy. 2aMass Screening 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutritional Status 2aQuality of Life 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 2aTreatment Outcome 2aYoung Adult1 aSchneider, Heinz1 aAlteheld, Birgit1 aStehle, Peter1 aMeier, Rémy0 tClinical nutrition.g2011 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.194-201dElsevier Ltdx0261-56147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2010.07.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006800151245007300219520204600292592002802338650001102366650001802377650001602395650000902411650002002420650002502440650002002465650001302485650001402498650002302512650001502535650001102550650000902561650001602570650001702586653001702603653001202620653002202632653002202654653002802676653002002704653002402724653002302748653001602771700003002787700002902817773009402846856008602940852000903026655001203035IND60719820520221118051945.0210820e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071982052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e056262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkintola, George Oluwole1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5690-604510aGeotechnical evaluation of clayey materials for quality burnt bricks  aUnderstanding of clayey materials properties continues to elude brick manufacturers, hence unsure of their application for brick making purposes. The raw materials were assessed geochemically, mineralogically, physically and technologically. The geochemical result showed that the fluxing oxides K₂O, N₂O, CaO, MgO and MnO are generally low in content with average abundance ranging from 0.06% to 1.78%. The Fe₂O₃ content varies (4.8–25.5%) thus reflects heterogenous stability in tonality. Most of the studied samples have relatively high Al₂O₃ content which suggest the bauxitic composition from which kaolinite minerals might have resulted from. The XRD analysis revealed the presence of kaolinite and chlorite as the major clay minerals while quartz, feldspar, talc and hornblende were present as non-clay minerals. For DTA, the threshold of new crystallization processes were attained at 1000 °C. The SEM analysis revealed the presence of some stroma in all samples although with sizes >50 nm. These pores were suggested to constitute a capillary system where molten mineral occupy as temperature increases. The Atterberg's limit indicated that the studied materials are inorganic silts with high compressibility and organic clays properties since it plotted below the A-line of plasticity chart. The compressive strength (CS) for brick specimens made from kaolinite-rich material are relatively higher than chlorite-rich specimens. This was attributed to the ineffective pore connection within the kaolinite interstitial particles compared to the chlorite-rich specimen, hence increasing the density. The water absorption (WA) test on twenty brick specimens showed that the pore volume and capillarity for bricks which are chlorite-dominated were comparatively higher, thus absorbing more water molecules. These results revealed that majority of the studied clayey material are not suitable for double storey construction bricks but meet the requirements for single-storey construction when compared with SANS standards.  aPublisher supplied data 3abricks 3acalcium oxide 3acapillarity 3aclay 3acompressibility 3acompression strength 3acrystallization 3afeldspar 3akaolinite 3amanganese monoxide 3aplasticity 3aquartz 3atalc 3atemperature 3awater uptake 0aGeochemistry 0aGeology 0aMaterials science 0aCivil engineering 0aGeotechnical evaluation 0aClayey material 0aKaolinite-rich clay 0aChlorite-rich clay 0aBurnt brick1 aAmponsah-Dacosta, Francis1 aMhlongo, Sphiwe Emmanuel0 tHeliyon.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 12 p.e05626-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e056263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02213naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017400167300001600341520080800357592002801165650000801193650000901201650001501210650004301225650002401268650001601292650001701308650001801325650002201343650001701365650001401382650001801396650001801414650001301432650001301445651001101458700001801469700001901487700001801506700002101524773011901545856008201664852000901746655001201755IND60610271620221120090223.0180904e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061027162DNAL7 a10.1134/S19950829180302392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYushkova, E.

The level of cytogenetic damage in the blood cells of tadpoles Rana arvalis Nilsson living on the territory of the Ukhta district of the village of Vodnyi in the Komi Republic, which is contaminated with technogenic radionuclides and heavy metals, is evaluated by “Comet assay”. It is shown that, in animals that develop in water bodies with high concentrations of radionuclides and heavy metals, the frequency of alkalilabile sites and single-strand break of DNA is higher than in the control area. No significant differences have been found when estimating the level of double-strand break of DNA. AFLP analysis indicates a weak genetic differentiation of the studied populations of amphibians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRana 3aamphibians 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3aaquatic environment 3ablood cells 3acytogenetics 3aecotoxicology 3agenetic variation 3aheavy metals 3apollution 3aradionuclides 3asurface water 3atadpoles 3avillages 3aRussia1 aBodnar, I.

RESULTS: The gene chip GSE31684, including 93samples, was downloaded from the GEO datasets and co-expression network was constructed by the data. Molecular complex detection(MCODE) was used to identify hub genes. The most significant cluster including 16 genes: CDH11, COL3A1, COL6A3, COL5A1, AEBP1, COL1A2, NTM, COL11A1, THBS2, COL8A1, COL1A1, BGN, MMP2, PXDN, THY1, and TGFB1I1 was identified. After annotated by BiNGO, they were suggested associated with collagen fibril organization and blood vessel development. In addition, the Kaplan Meier curves were obtained by UALCAN. The high expression of THY1, AEBP1, CDH11, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL11A1, MMP2, PXDN, BGN, COL5A1, COL8A1, and TGFB1I1 indicated poor prognosis of the patients(P < 0.05). Finally, we examined genes’ expression between low and high tumor stage by the Wilcoxon test(P < 0.05), TGFB1I1 was excluded. CONCLUSION: THY1, AEBP1, CDH11, COL1A1, COL1A2, COL11A1, MMP2, PXDN, BGN, COL5A1, COL8A1 associated with the tumor stage as well as tumor patients’ prognosis. COL5A1, COL8A1(P < 0.01) may serve as therapeutic targets for the disease.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014QLKY16cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (CN)  aGG201703180001cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province (CN)  aZR201709230247cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA microarrays 3abiomarkers 3ablood vessels 3acollagen 3adata collection 3aprognosis 3atherapeutics 3aurinary bladder neoplasms1 aChen, Dongshan1 aYu, Wei1 aYan, Lei0 tHereditas.g2019 Dec., v. 156, no. 1 p.7-7dBioMed CentralwJournal:6164x1601-52237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41065-019-0083-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245027600163300001800439500001400457520095900471592002801430650001801458650001801476650000901494650001801503650001801521650001601539650002201555650001401577653002401591653003201615653002101647653003201668700002001700700003001720700001601750700002401766700001901790700002001809700003201829773018401861856007502045852000902120655001202129IND60691844820221118044406.0200502e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069184482DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.64.14592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNAGAFUCHI, Shinya10aDietary Nucleotides Increase the Proportion of a TCRγδ⁺ Subset of Intraepithelial Lymphocytes (IEL) and IL-7 Production by Intestinal Epithelial Cells (IEC); Implications for Modification of Cellular and Molecular Cross-talk between IEL and IEC by Dietary Nucleotides  ap. 1459-1465.  aNAL-light  aWe have investigated the effects of dietary nucleotides on intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) in weanling mice. The proportion of T-cell receptor (TCR) γδ⁺ IEL in BALB/c mice fed a diet supplemented with nucleotides (NT(+) diet) was significantly higher than that in mice fed the nucleotide-free diet, while the proportion of TCRαβ⁺ IEL in NT(+) diet-fed mice was significantly decreased. The change of the TCRαβ⁺/TCRγδ⁺ ratio was mainly observed in a CD8αα⁺ subset of IEL. IEC from NT(+) diet-fed mice produced a higher level of IL-7, which is important in the development of TCRγδ⁺ IEL, than those from control diet-fed mice. The expression levels of IL-7 and IL-2 receptors on IEL were not different between the two dietary groups. Our findings suggest that the increased population of a TCRγδ⁺ IEL subset by feeding nucleotides may be caused by the increased production of IL-7 by IEC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3abiotechnology 3adiet 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-7 3anucleotides 3apopulation growth 3aweanlings 0adietary nucleotides 0aintraepithelial lymphocytes 0aTCRγδ+ T cells 0aintestinal epithelial cells1 aTOTSUKA, Mamoru1 aHachimura, S.q(Satoshi),1 aGOTO, Masao1 aTakahashi, Takeshi,1 aYAJIMA, Takaji1 aKUWATA, Tamotsu1 aKaminogawa, S.q(Shūichi),0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2000 Jan. 1, v. 64, no. 7 p.1459-1465dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.64.14593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245008300184300001600267500001500283520096000298592002801258650001801286650001001304650001301314650001401327650002601341650002601367650001201393650001701405650004001422650002501462650005301487650001601540650002901556650002001585650002601605650002201631653001801653700002001671773010401691856008101795852000901876655001201885IND4458839620221122045602.0141110e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445883962DNAL7 a215115162pmid7 a10.1016/j.pbi.2011.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarrant, Jill M10aProgramming desiccation-tolerance: from plants to seeds to resurrection plants  ap. 340-345.  a2019-12-06  aDesiccation-tolerance (DT) evolved as the key solution to survival on land by the early algal ancestors of terrestrial plants. This ‘first’ DT involved utilizing rapidly mobilisable repair mechanisms and is still found today in mosses, such as Tortula ruralis, and ferns, such as Mohria caffrorum. The first seed plants lost vegetative DT while investing their seeds with tolerance mechanisms improving their survival in unfavourable environments. The mechanisms of DT in seeds are strongly connected to their developmentally regulated maturation programs. We propose that angiosperm resurrection plants acquired tolerance by re-activating their innate DT mechanisms in their vegetative tissues. Here we review the current hypotheses regarding the genetic evidence for the evolution of DT in resurrection plants. We also present strong evidence showing the activation of seed specific genetic elements in the vegetative tissues of resurrection plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnemia (fern) 3aseeds 3aancestry 3aevolution 3amosses and liverworts 3aferns and fern allies 3aTortula 3aAngiospermae 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxgenetics 2aBiological Evolution 2aCraterostigmaxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDesiccation 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aSeedsxgenetics 2aStress, Physiological 2aWaterxphysiology 0aMagnoliophyta1 aMoore, John P.,0 tCurrent opinion in plant biology.g2011 June, v. 14, no. 3 p.340-345dElsevier Ltdx1369-52667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbi.2011.03.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245012300166300002000289520153700309592002801846650002001874650001101894650002801905650001401933650002501947650001501972650001901987650001402006650001202020650001902032650001702051650001802068650002802086700002102114700002902135773012802164856008102292852000902373655001202382IND60535861320221117021055.0160805e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053586132DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b014872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlovic, Jelica10aEffects of Aftermarket Control Technologies on Gas and Particle Phase Oxidative Potential from Diesel Engine Emissions  ap. 10544-10552.  aParticulate matter (PM) originating from diesel combustion is a public health concern due to its association with adverse effects on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and lung cancer. This study investigated emissions from three stationary diesel engines (gensets) and varying power output (230 kW, 400 kW, and 600 kW) at 50% and 90% load to determine concentrations of gaseous (GROS) and PM reactive oxygen species (PMROS). In addition, the influence of three modern emission control technologies on ROS emissions was evaluated: active and passive diesel particulate filters (A-DPF and P-DPF) and a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC). PMROS made up 30–50% of the total ROS measured without aftermarket controls. All applied controls removed PMROS by more than 75% on average. However, the oxidative potential of PM downstream of these devices was not diminished at the same rate and particles surviving the A-PDF had an even higher oxidative potential on a per PM mass basis compared to the particles emitted by uncontrolled gensets. Further, the GROS as compared to PMROS emissions were not reduced with the same efficiency (<36%). GROS concentrations were highest with the DOC in use, indicating continued formation of GROS with this control. Correlation analyses showed that PMROS and to a lesser extent GROS have a good correlation with semivolatile organic carbon (OC1) subfraction. In addition, results suggest that chemical composition, rather than PM size, is responsible for differences in the PM oxidative potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3acarbon 3acardiovascular diseases 3acatalysts 3achemical composition 3acombustion 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3afilters 3alung neoplasms 3aparticulates 3apublic health 3areactive oxygen species1 aHolder, Amara L.1 aYelverton, Tiffany L.

This study is to assess the impact of climate change on hydrological behavior considering future land-use types and rural residential area and their propagation to NPS pollution loads. An integrated pollution load model composed of regional climate, the Semi-distributed Land Use based Runoff Processes (SLURPs) hydrological model and the improved export coefficient approach within a single framework was explored and developed to assess impacts of climate and land-use changes on NPS pollution load. Climate data for the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRESs) future scenario B2 from Met Office Hadley center were generated and used as the input data for the runoff and NPS load evaluation of the Jialing River Watershed and the Markov process was used to forecast changes of land use types, respectively. Simulations of present and future regional NPS pollution from land use, livestock and poultry breeding, and agricultural population over the Jialing River Watershed were performed to investigate the potential impacts of global climate change on river water quality using the established model. Results demonstrate that: (1) Annual pollution load would obviously change due to variations of runoff and livestock and poultry breeding, the largest growth months in one year for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) load are both in June, which is in accordance with changes of rainfall amount. (2) The impacts of global climate change on pollution load are relatively greater when compared to the impacts of future livestock and poultry breeding increase or agricultural population reduction; the effects from runoff increment leads to approximately 28.6% and 22.5% increases of TN and TP pollution load, respectively. And (3) the impacts of land-use change have shown insignificant effect due to soil conservation measures, whereas the impacts of rural residential area account for great proportion changes, of which about 5% of its increases are contributed to the increase of livestock and poultry breeding; but the biggest contribution rate is still from the output of different land use types. These data will be useful and valuable in evaluating potential NPS pollution load for the control of watershed pollution in the future and understanding its migration and transformation in a large-scale watershed where meteorological and underlying surface data are mutative.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3ahydrologic models 3aland use change 3alivestock breeding 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3apollution control 3apollution load 3apopulation growth 3arain 3ariver water 3arivers 3arunoff 3arural areas 3asoil conservation 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aLong, Tian-yu1 aLiu, Xia1 aGuo, Jin-song0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Dec. 19, v. 475 p.26-41dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03345naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245016400170300001600334520169700350592002802047650002102075650001502096650001602111650002402127650001302151650002502164650002002189650002002209650001202229650002602241650002702267650001102294650001802305650001902323650001302342650002902355653003402384653003102418653002302449653002102472700001302493700001402506700001702520700001902537700001402556700001902570700001602589773009902605856009002704852000902794655001202803IND60532357720221118013550.0190318e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053235772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Guan14aThe regulation of gluconeogenesis in the Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) affected later in life by a short-term high-glucose programming during early life  ap. 127-136.  aWe undertook this study to determine whether an acute glucose stimulus during first feeding period and dietary carbohydrates can modify the gluconeogenesis pathway in the Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii). The sturgeon larvae were fed a high glucose diet (57% glucose, 21.5% protein) or a carbohydrate-free diet (67.7% protein) from first feeding to yolk absorption (8–12days post-hatching, dph). At 13dph, each group of fish was assigned to two treatments. One group was fed a high-carbohydrate diet (35% dextrin, 39.3% protein), and the other group was fed a carbohydrate-free diet until the 20th wk. The results indicated that the high carbohydrate intake inhibited mRNA expression and activity of gluconeogenic enzymes at 13, 30dph and the 20th wk. The early high glucose stimulus depressed final body weight of sturgeon at 13, 30dph and the 20th wk. This stimulus also inhibited mRNA expressions of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase at 30dph and increased mRNA expressions of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase cytosolic forms and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), while it inhibited activities of G6Pase at 20th wk when the fish were fed a carbohydrate-free diet. Results suggested that the Siberian sturgeon could regulate gluconeogenesis pathway response to dietary carbohydrates content at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. High glucose low protein intake during first feeding disturbs gluconeogenesis regulation in later life. However, the Siberian sturgeon might have a capacity to adapt to later nutritional conditions by reversing the changes in the gluconeogenesis pathway which induced by early stimulation at the transcriptional level during the 20weeks feeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser baerii 3aabsorption 3abody weight 3acarbohydrate intake 3adextrins 3adietary carbohydrate 3agene expression 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglucose-6-phosphatase 3ahigh carbohydrate diet 3alarvae 3amessenger RNA 3aprotein intake 3asturgeon 3atranscription (genetics) 0aEarly nutritional programming 0aGluconeogenesis regulation 0aGlucose metabolism 0aAcipenser baerii1 aXue, Min1 aWang, Jia1 aWu, Xiu-feng1 aZheng, Yin-hua1 aHan, Fang1 aLiang, Xu-fang1 aSu, Xiao-ou0 tAquaculture.g2015 Jan. 20, v. 436 p.127-136dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013500170520161900305592002801924650002601952650002101978650001801999650001302017650002002030650001302050650002002063650001902083650002102102650002502123650004302148650001302191650003102204650001702235653001302252653002102265653002202286653001302308700001702321700005602338773010702394856008502501852000902586655001202595IND60684278320221118150739.0200621e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068427832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.hermed.2020.1003422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShinjyo, Noriko12aA tale of two cinnamons: A comparative review of the clinical evidence of Cinnamomum verum and C. cassia as diabetes interventions  aThis review investigates the effectiveness of two cinnamon species,Cinnamomum verum and C. cassia, in diabetes management; their impact on related health conditions and relevant parameters in healthy individuals and safety issues.PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect were searched from 2000 up to April 2018 for clinical trials using either C. verum or C. cassia in controlling blood glucose and other diabetes-related parameters and conditions.A total of twenty-five studies (n = 997) were included for reviewing clinical evidence. Among these trials, fifteen studies investigated the effects on type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients (n = 831), four investigated subjects with related clinical conditions (n = 82), and six investigated healthy individuals (n = 84). Nineteen studies used C. cassia and six used C. verum. Results suggested C. cassia helped manage diabetes at 3–6 g per day, while the effectiveness of C. verum remained inconclusive. In addition, the chemical properties of C. cassia and C. verum differ considerably. Of note, C. cassia contains high levels of the potentially hepatotoxic constituent coumarin. A skin rash was the only adverse event reported.While evidence supports the therapeutic benefit of C. cassia, interchangeability of C. cassia and C. verum remains inconclusive. Further research is warranted to address the effectiveness and safety of these cinnamon species. Given the potential hepatotoxicity of C. cassia, RCTs that include liver function tests are required. Robust RCTs on C. verum are recommended to establish if its efficacy can match its safety profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCinnamomum aromaticum 3aCinnamomum verum 3ablood glucose 3acinnamon 3aclinical trials 3acoumarin 3adisease control 3ahepatotoxicity 3aherbal medicines 3aliver function tests 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aphysicochemical properties 3atherapeutics 0aCinnamon 0aCinnamomum verum 0aCinnamomum cassia 0aDiabetes1 aWaddell, Guy1 aGreen, Julia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5994-00540 tJournal of herbal medicine.g2020 June, v. 21 p.100342-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:21606x2210-80337nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.hermed.2020.1003423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245014000169300001600309520202500325592002802350650002002378650001502398650001902413650001902432650002402451650002002475650002902495650001402524650001902538650001302557650001602570650001502586650002302601650001402624650001402638650002402652650000902676650002402685650001202709650002102721650001302742651001002755653003102765653002302796653002902819653003302848653003302881653002102914700001302935700001702948700002302965700001702988773011903005856008803124852000903212655001203221IND60626450420221121175919.0210121e20190325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062645042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.1442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aSoil available phosphorus content drives the spatial distribution of archaeal communities along elevation in acidic terrace paddy soils  ap. 723-731.  aArchaea play crucial roles in geochemical cycles and influence the emission of greenhouse gases in acidic soils. However, little is known about the distribution pattern of total archaeal diversity and community composition with increasing elevation, especially in acidic agricultural ecosystems. Terraces, characterized by vertical climate changes and unique hydrological properties, are “natural experiments” to explore the spatial distribution of microorganisms along elevation in paddy soils. Here we investigated the diversity and structure of soil archaeal communities in nine increasingly elevated acidic paddy soils of the Yunhe terrace, China. Archaeal communities were dominated by Methanomicrobia of Euryarchaeota (38.5%), Group 1.1a-associated cluster (SAGSCG-1) of Thaumarchaeota (22.0%) and Subgroup-6 (previously described as crenarchaeotal group 1.3b) of Bathyarchaeota (17.8%). The archaeal phylotype richness decreased with increasing elevation. Both the species richness and phylogenetic diversity of the archaeal communities were significantly negatively correlated with soil available phosphorus (AP) content according to linear regression analyses. The archaeal communities differed greatly between soils of increasing elevation, and were roughly clustered into three groups, mostly in relation to AP contents. A variation partitioning analysis further confirmed that edaphic factors including the content of AP (17.1%), nitrate (7.83%), soil organic carbon (4.69%), dissolved organic carbon (4.22%) and soil pH (4.07%) shaped the archaeal community. The variation of soil properties were probably induced by elevation. The co-occurrence network indicated a modular structure of the archaeal community. Overall, our results emphasized that soil AP content was the best predictor of archaeal diversity and community structure, and the impacts of elevation on soil archaeal communities were not diminished by long-term rice cultivation, although minor compared with the effects of soil properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanomicrobia 3aacid soils 3aagroecosystems 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3aedaphic factors 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahydrology 3amicroorganisms 3anitrates 3apaddy soils 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus content 3aphylogeny 3aphylotype 3aregression analysis 3arice 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pH 3aspecies richness 3aterraces 3aChina 0aAcidic terrace paddy soils 0aArchaeal diversity 0aElevational distribution 0aArchaeal community structure 0aAvailable phosphorus content 0aNetwork analysis1 aLi, Yong1 aXing, Jiajia1 aBrookes, Philip C.1 aXu, Jianming0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Mar. 25, v. 658 p.723-731dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.1443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01897naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245005200178300001800230520102600248592002801274650001501302650001001317650001701327650000901344650002101353650001101374650001501385773010201400856008401502852000901586655001201595IND60098837020221120211816.0141105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009883702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatzilyberis, Kostas S.10aDesign of an indirect heat rotary kiln gasifier  ap. 2429-2454.  aA non-ordinary type of solid fuel gasification reactor, which was under development for the few past decades and it is briefly described as indirect heat rotary kiln gasifier, seems to be capable of sufficiently satisfying the incorporated gasification needs in the most challenging contemporary power technologies using solid fuels, like IGCC and CLC combustion. The design of such a gasifier emerges in this work, while the focus is mostly on the presentation of the relevant theoretical model. Moreover, model predictions are compared and optimized with respect to experimental data that were acquired in a pilot scale gasification unit including the suggested type of gasifier. Comparisons showed successful predictions of such a marginal error that could be characterized as quite sufficient for a primary model validation. However, the model flexibility to a wide variety of different solid fuels, rotary kiln configurations and operating conditions has to be verified by assessment of further experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acombustion 3afuels 3agasification 3aheat 3amodel validation 3amodels 3aprediction0 tFuel processing technology.g2011 Dec., v. 92, no. 12 p.2429-2454dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245010700180300001400287520120600301592002801507650002501535650001101560650000901571650002601580650002101606650001601627650001001643650001101653650001201664650001701676650001601693650000901709650001001718650002601728650001701754650001001771650002601781650003001807650001701837650002201854650001301876650001301889650003301902650001401935650003201949650004001981650004202021650002202063650002302085700001802108700001602126700001602142700001502158700001602173700001702189700001502206700001402221700001502235700001702250700001602267700001702283700001802300700001702318773008002335856004802415852000902463655001202472IND4469075420221122055907.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446907542DNAL7 a218090912pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-011-1481-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMao, Bigang10aWax crystal-sparse leaf2, a rice homologue of WAX2/GL1, is involved in synthesis of leaf cuticular wax  ap. 39-52.  aEpicuticular wax in plants limits non-stomatal water loss, inhibits postgenital organ fusion, protects plants against damage from UV radiation and imposes a physical barrier against pathogen infection. Here, we give a detailed description of the genetic, physiological and morphological consequences of a mutation in the rice gene WSL2, based on a comparison between the wild-type and an EMS mutant. The mutant’s leaf cuticle membrane is thicker and less organized than that of the wild type, and its total wax content is diminished by ~80%. The mutant is also more sensitive to drought stress. WSL2 was isolated by positional cloning, and was shown to encode a homologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana genes CER3/WAX2/YRE/FLP1 and the maize gene GL1. It is expressed throughout the plant, except in the root. A transient assay carried out in both A. thaliana and rice protoplasts showed that the gene product is deposited in the endoplasmic reticulum. An analysis of the overall composition of the wax revealed that the mutant produces a substantially reduced quantity of C22–C32 fatty acids, which suggests that the function of WSL2 is associated with the elongation of very long-chain fatty acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aclones 3acorn 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepicuticular wax 3afatty acids 3agenes 3aleaves 3amutants 3aplant damage 3aprotoplasts 3arice 3aroots 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater stress 3awaxes 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aFatty Acidsxbiosynthesis 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aMutation 2aOryzaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Epidermisxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aWaxesxmetabolism 2aZea maysxgenetics1 aCheng, Zhijun1 aLei, Cailin1 aXu, Fenghua1 aGao, Suwei1 aRen, Yulong1 aWang, Jiulin1 aZhang, Xin1 aWang, Jie1 aWu, Fuqing1 aGuo, Xiuping1 aLiu, Xiaolu1 aWu, Chuanyin1 aWang, Haiyang1 aWan, Jianmin0 tPlanta.g2012 Jan., v. 235, no. 1 p.39-52dSpringer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-011-1481-1  aDNAL 7aarticle04356naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245016100173300001400334520266300348592002803011650002603039650001203065650002603077650001803103650001903121650002403140650002403164650002203188650001803210650001503228650001703243650002503260650001503285650001203300650002003312650002303332650001003355650001003365650001303375653002603388653001103414653002003425653002303445653002403468700001503492700001403507700001303521700001703534700001503551700001603566773009703582856009003679852000903769655001203778IND60532357920221118013448.0190318e20150120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053235792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianyong10aGenetic parameters and selection responses for growth and survival of the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor after four generations of successive selection  ap. 58-64.  aGenetic parameters and selection responses were estimated for growth and survival of the small abalone Haliotis diversicolor using a fully pedigreed synthetic population from two Chinese hatchery stocks and two wild stocks. About 53,300 progeny representing 533 full-sib families from the mating between 308 sires and 533 dams were tested in concrete tanks for five generations. Breeding candidates in the base generation (G0) and first generation (G1) were selected based on their estimated breeding values for growth (recorded as shell length at tagging and harvest), while those in later generations (G2–G3) were selected according to a selection index including individual breeding values for growth and family breeding values for survival traits. Variance components and genetic parameters were estimated using animal models and the restricted maximum-likelihood method. The breeding values of all animals over five generations were estimated using the best linear unbiased prediction. Within generations, the heritability estimates for square root transformed tagging shell length and harvest shell length were moderate, ranging from 0.125 to 0.237 and from 0.196 to 0.308, respectively. Across generations, the heritability estimates for the two growth traits were relatively low; 0.109 and 0.169, respectively, and the heritability of survival was low (0.069), but suggestive of a significant additive genetic component. Including all data, the effects common to full-sibs other than additive genetic effects (c2) accounted for 5.1%, 2.6% and 3.1% of the total phenotypic variance for transformed tagging shell length, harvest shell length and survival traits, respectively, and the three values were significantly different from zero (P<0.05). Genetic correlations of harvest shell length with tagging shell length and survival were favorable and significantly different from zero; 0.633 and 0.467, respectively. The predicted response was obtained from the difference in the mean breeding values between generations. When using the LS mean of the base population (G0) as a baseline for comparison, the average selection response of harvest shell length expressed as proportions ranged from 6.1% to 12.6%, with an average of 9.2%. The average estimated selection response per population for survival was 4.1%, and the accumulated selection response was 16.5% after performing four generations of selection. Based on these results, the breeding population had considerable additive genetic variation in growth traits, and the ongoing selective breeding program resulted in considerable genetic improvement in growth and survival in H. diversicolor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis diversicolor 3aabalone 3aadditive gene effects 3aanimal models 3abreeding value 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agrowth traits 3ahatcheries 3aheritability 3aphenotypic variation 3aprediction 3aprogeny 3aselection index 3aselection response 3asires 3atanks 3avariance 0aHaliotis diversicolor 0aGrowth 0aSurvival traits 0aGenetic parameters 0aSelection responses1 aLai, Zhifu1 aFu, Xueli1 aWu, Yong1 aBao, Xiufeng1 aHu, Zhiguo1 aLai, Moulie0 tAquaculture.g2015 Jan. 20, v. 436 p.58-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01941naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001700165245004800182300001600230520056200246592002800808650000900836650001800845650002100863650001700884650001200901650002100913650004000934650000900974650001100983650004800994650002101042650003201063650002001095650002701115650002201142650002301164700003001187700002201217700002901239773012301268852000901391856008301400655001201483IND4380570820221117160508.0181127e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438057082DNAL7 a163254442pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2005.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReed, Nicola10aUnusual histiocytic disease in a Somali cat  ap. 129-134.  aAn 8-year-old Somali cat presented with a 9-month history of inappetence, vomiting and weight loss.

We discuss the effect of temperature and pH on the in vitro release of curcumin and the rheological properties of a curcumin-encapsulated liquid crystal. The drug-encapsulated hexagonal phase containing relatively high WCS content (9.9 wt %) exhibited good temperature response, as indicated by three phase transformation temperature obtained by temperature scanning. The viscosity of the drug-encapsulated hexagonal phase decreased as the temperature rose, which exhibited diverse constancy and temperature sensitivity. Also, the in vitro release rate of curcumin increased as the temperature increased. After introducing WCS, the release rate of curcumin decreased obviously the pH dependence, where the release of curcumin was slower as the pH was higher. All of the results indicated that the temperature/pH-responsive hexagonal liquid crystals were proposed to be potential slow release carriers to deliver curcumin.  aPublisher supplied data 3achitosan 3acurcumin 3aliquid crystals 3aoleic acid 3apH 3aphase transition 3apolysorbates 3atemperature 3aviscosity1 aZhang, Li1 aWei, Xilian1 aLiu, Jie1 aWang, Zhongni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0777-743X0 tLangmuir.g2018 Dec. 18, v. 35, no. 2 p.453-460dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19170x1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b035593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03790naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010300171300001800274500002000292520205400312592002802366596005602394596005602450596002302506650002002529650001902549650002602568650001402594650002602608650001302634650002802647650001602675650000902691650001702700650002702717650001302744650002402757650001202781650001802793650001702811651001902828700002502847700002002872700002202892700002702914700001802941700002202959700002002981773014003001856008603141852000903227655001203236IND60786353020221118205759.0220803e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078635302DNAL7 a10.1080/00028487.2017.13700152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCary, Joshua B.10aSurvival of Upper Piedmont Stream Fishes Implanted with 8‐mm Passive Integrated Transponder Tags  ap. 1223-1232.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe studied weekly and bimonthly survival of select nongame fishes that were implanted with 8‐mm PIT tags in upper Piedmont streams of South Carolina, USA. Weekly survival in stream enclosures was assessed for a total of 350 tagged individuals and 311 control (untagged) fish (39–101 mm TL; median = 65 mm TL) belonging to six species (Bluehead Chub Nocomis leptocephalus, Creek Chub Semotilus atromaculatus, Yellowfin Shiner Notropis lutipinnis, Mottled Sculpin Cottus bairdii, Northern Hog Sucker Hypentelium nigricans, and Striped Jumprock Moxostoma rupiscartes). Weekly survival rates ranged from 93.3% to 100% among species, with Yellowfin Shiners experiencing the lowest survival rate. Only 2 of the 337 surviving tagged individuals lost their tags (0.6% tag loss). Logistic regression indicated that species and body length were statistically significant predictors of survival and tag retention. Odds ratios indicated that tagged fish were 1.718 times less likely to survive than control fish, but the tagging effect was not statistically significant. Bimonthly survival was estimated by conducting a mark–recapture study from September 2015 to May 2016, which involved tagging 1,413 unique individuals of Bluehead Chub (45–75 mm TL) in a 520‐m stream section and 431 individuals of Mottled Sculpin (45–75 mm) in another 740‐m section. Bayesian state–space analysis of Cormack–Jolly–Seber models indicated that apparent survival did not differ between newly tagged and previously tagged (i.e., recaptured) individuals in any sampling interval, suggesting that the acute and chronic effects of tagging did not differ. Mean bimonthly apparent survival rate was 0.76 (95% credible interval = 0.64–0.86) for Bluehead Chub and 0.74 (95% credible interval = 0.59–0.88) for Mottled Sculpin. Our results indicate that PIT tags can be successfully applied to study the ecology and life history of small‐bodied, nongame fish species, although caution should be exercised when selecting the species and body sizes to be tagged.  aPublisher supplied data  cCreative Inquiry program for undergraduate research  cCollege of Agriculture, Forestry, and Life Sciences  cClemson University 3aBayesian theory 3aCottus bairdii 3aHypentelium nigricans 3aMoxostoma 3aNocomis leptocephalus 3aNotropis 3aSemotilus atromaculatus 3abody length 3afish 3alife history 3amark-recapture studies 3apiedmont 3aregression analysis 3astreams 3asurvival rate 3atransponders 3aSouth Carolina1 aHolbrook, Jessica L.1 aReed, Morgan E.1 aAustin, Thomas B.1 aSteffensen, Matthew S.1 aKim, Seoghyun1 aPregler, Kasey C.1 aKanno, Yoichiro0 tTransactions of the American Fisheries Society.g2017 Nov., v. 146, no. 6 p.1223-1232dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19703x0002-84877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028487.2017.13700153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02871naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001500145245016100160300002000321520160300341592002801944650001301972650001401985650002101999650002202020650001102042650001402053650003102067700001802098700001302116700001702129700001502146700001902161700001302180700001802193700001302211700001902224773012802243856008102371852000902452655001202461IND60535861720221117021215.0160805e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053586172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b016822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGai, Yanbo10aExperimental and Theoretical Study of Reactions of OH Radicals with Hexenols: An Evaluation of the Relative Importance of the H-Abstraction Reaction Channel  ap. 10380-10388.  aC6 hexenols are one of the most significant groups of volatile organic compounds with biogenic emissions. The lack of corresponding kinetic parameters and product information on their oxidation reactions will result in incomplete atmospheric chemical mechanisms and models. In this paper, experimental and theoretical studies are reported for the reactions of OH radicals with a series of C6 hexenols, (Z)-2-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-4-hexen-1-ol, (E)-2-hexen-1-ol, (E)-3-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-4-hexen-1-ol, at 298 K and 1.01 × 10⁵ Pa. The corresponding rate constants were 8.53 ± 1.36, 10.1 ± 1.6, 7.86 ± 1.30, 8.08 ± 1.33, 9.10 ± 1.50, and 7.14 ± 1.20 (in units of 10–¹¹ cm³ molecule–¹ s–¹), respectively, measured by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID), using a relative technique. Theoretical calculations concerning the OH-addition and H-abstraction reaction channels were also performed for these reactions to further understand the reaction mechanism and the relative importance of the H-abstraction reaction. By contrast to previously reported results, the H-abstraction channel is a non-negligible reaction channel for reactions of OH radicals with these hexenols. The rate constants of the H-abstraction channel are comparable with those for the OH-addition channel and contribute >20% for most of the studied alcohols, even >50% for (E)-3-hexen-1-ol. Thus, H-abstraction channels may have an important role in the reactions of these alcohols with OH radicals and must be considered in certain atmospheric chemical mechanisms and models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aemissions 3aflame ionization 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amodels 3aoxidation 3avolatile organic compounds1 aLin, Xiaoxiao1 aMa, Qiao1 aHu, Changjin1 aGu, Xuejun1 aZhao, Weixiong1 aFang, Bo1 aZhang, Weijun1 aLong, Bo1 aLong, Zhengwen0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Sept. 01, v. 49, no. 17 p.10380-10388dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b016823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04278naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100004700139245012600186500002000312520197400332592002802306596008802334596011502422596011502537596011502652596011802767650002202885650001502907650000902922650001002931650001802941650002102959650002702980650002803007650002203035650002303057650003203080650000903112650001703121650001403138650002403152650001403176650001303190650002603203700007203229700004103301700002703342700002903369700003803398700007103436773012303507856007303630852000903703655001203712IND60636427420221118044406.0190408e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063642742DNAL7 a10.1111/jfs.126042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanto, Anna Carolina Vilhena da Cruz Silva10aEffect of UV‐C radiation on Salmonella spp. reduction and oxidative stability of caiman (Caiman crocodilus yacare) meat  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNon‐UV‐C dose and 0.005, 0.010, 0.016, 0.037, 0.065, 0.105, 0.127, and 0.199 J/cm² were applied in inoculated agar plates and in inoculated caiman (Caiman crocodilus yacare) meat to investigate the reduction of Salmonella spp. Moreover, noninoculated caiman meat was submitted to the same treatments and was evaluated for color parameters (L*, a*, b* values, and ΔE) and lipid oxidation. The most effective Salmonella spp. reductions ranged from 6.72 to 7.13 log cfu/g, and from 2.47 to 2.88 log cfu/g in inoculated agar plates and caiman meat treated with 0.105–0.199 J/cm² and 0.065–0.199 J/cm² (p < 0.05), respectively. However, these doses increased (p < 0.05) L* values and lipid oxidation, while decreased (p < 0.05) a* and b* values. Therefore, UV‐C at 0.016 J/cm² is an alternative technology to improve the bacterial quality of caiman meat without negative effects on oxidative parameters. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Salmonella spp. is a potential disease agent being the pathogen more commonly detected in meat and meat products. UV‐C has easy implementation in meat industry, low cost, rapid application, and lack of toxic wastes, which could be an alternative for food industries to produce high‐quality food products without the use of chemical agents to meet consumers demand. Otherwise, UV‐C may induce oxidation depending on type of food, lipid profile, and dose applied, which would limit the meat quality and their industrial application. In this study, eight UV‐C doses (0.005, 0.010, 0.016, 0.037, 0.065, 0.105, 0.127, and 0.199 J/cm²) were applied in inoculated agar plates and caiman meat to investigate Salmonella spp. reduction. Moreover, noninoculated caiman meat was submitted to the same treatments and was evaluated for color parameters and lipid oxidation. UV‐C at 0.016 J/cm² is an alternative technology to improve bacterial quality of caiman meat without altering the oxidative parameters.  aPublisher supplied data  a311422/2016cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq)  aE‐26/202.306/2017cFundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)  aE‐26/202.305/2017cFundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)  aE‐26/203.049/2017cFundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ)  aE‐26/010.001678/2016cFundação Carlos Chagas Filho de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) 3aCaiman crocodilus 3aSalmonella 3aagar 3acolor 3afood industry 3afood irradiation 3afood processing wastes 3aindustrial applications 3alipid composition 3alipid peroxidation 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameat 3ameat quality 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3apathogens 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet radiation1 aMonteiro, Maria Lucia Guerra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6928-13471 aCosta‐Lima, Bruno Reis Carneiro da1 aLázaro, Cesar Aquiles1 aMarsico, Eliane Teixeira1 aSilva, Teófilo José Pimentel da1 aConte‐Junior, Carlos Adam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6133-50800 tJournal of food safety.g2019 Apr., v. 39, no. 2 p.e12604-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl10993x0149-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfs.126043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01896naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002000189245008100209300001400290506007600304520050200380592002800882506003700910650003000947650002000977650001700997650001701014650002501031650001401056650001301070650002401083650001101107653001801118653002601136653001201162700002101174700001401195700001301209700001601222773010801238856008301346852000901429655001201438IND60684278720221207141725.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068427872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mmcr.2020.02.0022doi7 aPMC70163352pmcid7 a320718492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mei-Jie,10aOnychomycosis caused by Pichia guilliermondii: A case report and mini-review  ap. 72-76.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOnychomycosis has been reported to be mainly caused by dermatophytes.

Juvenile lumpfish, initial mean (± SE) weight of 54.0±0.9g, were reared in small sea cages (125m3, 5×5×5m) together with Atlantic salmon with an initial mean (± SE) weight of 619±2.5g. Lumpfish were stocked at 10 and 15% density (12 and 18 lumpfish vs. 120 salmon, respectively) in replicate sea pens. To determine the feeding preferences of lumpfish in the cages gastric lavage was performed every two weeks and the feeding items were identified and categorized as: a) consumed sea lice, b) formulated feed fragments, c) crustacean species, d) hydrozoan species, e) Mytilus edulis, f) unidentified material or no contents found. The most common food item identified in the stomachs of lumpfish throughout the study period was fragments of salmon pellets. Results indicate that lumpfish in sea pens can be classified as strongly opportunistic and the fish do not restrict themselves or rely on a single food source if others are present. Lumpfish seemed to switch their preference towards which ever food item that was most readily available to them within their environment. The present data shows temporal changes in feed choice throughout the period, seemingly linked to food availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCaligidae 3aCylopterus lumpus 3aHydrozoa 3aMytilus edulis 3aSalmo salar 3acages 3afeed formulation 3afeeding preferences 3afood availability 3ajuveniles 3anet pens 3apellets 3arearing 3asalmon 3atemporal variation 0aLumpfish 0aAtlantic salmon 0aStomach content 0aSea lice1 aReynolds, Patrick1 aEliassen, Gerhard1 aHangstad, Thor Arne1 aNytrø, Ane Vigdisdatter1 aFoss, Atle1 aVikingstad, Erik1 aElvegård, Tor Anders0 tAquaculture.g2015 Jan. 20, v. 436 p.47-51dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04594naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245014300182300001400325520225200339592002802591650002702619650002402646650001602670650001902686650003102705650001602736650001002752650001002762650002002772650001802792650001002810650001602820650001602836650002402852650002302876650000902899650002702908650001802935650001402953650001502967650001802982650002803000650001103028650001703039650001303056653002003069653001703089653001803106653001303124653002103137653002403158700002803182700002103210700003003231700002103261700002003282700002403302700002003326700002803346700006303374700002203437700002503459700003303484700006503517700002303582700002503605773009503630856009003725852000903815655001203824IND60628008120221116195034.0190325e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062800812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavares, Grasiele S.V.10aIn vitro and in vivo antileishmanial activity of a fluoroquinoline derivate against Leishmania infantum and Leishmania amazonensis species  ap. 29-37.  aNew therapeutics against leishmaniasis are desirable, since the current drugs applied against this disease complex presents problems, such as the toxicity, high cost and/or parasite resistance. In the present study, a new fluoroquinoline derivate, namely 7-chloro-N-(4-fluorophenethyl)quinolin-4-amine or GF1061, was evaluated regarding to its in vitro antileishmanial action against Leishmania infantum and L. amazonensis species, as well as by its toxicity in mammalian cells and efficacy in the treatment of infected macrophages. The mechanism of action of this molecule in L. amazonensis and the therapeutic efficacy in infected BALB/c mice were also evaluated. Results showed that GF1061 was effective against both parasite species, showing selectivity index (SI) of 38.7 and 42.7 against L. infantum and L. amazonensis promastigotes, respectively, and of 45.0 and 48.9 against the amastigotes, respectively. Amphotericin B (AmpB), used as control, showed SI values of 6.6 and 8.8 against L. infantum and L. amazonensis promastigotes, respectively, and of 2.2 and 2.7 against the amastigotes, respectively. The molecule was effective in treat infected macrophages, as well as it induced alterations in the mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in the reactive oxygen species production, and in the cell integrity of the parasites. Regarding to the in vivo experiments, BALB/c mice (n = 8 per group) were subcutaneously infected with 106L. amazonensis stationary promastigotes and, 60 days post-infection, they received saline or were treated during 10 days, once a day, with AmpB (1 mg/kg body weight) or GF1061 (5 mg/kg body weight). One day after the treatment, the infected tissue, spleen, liver, and draining lymph node (dLN) of the animals were collected, and the parasite load was evaluated. GF1061-treated mice, as compared to the saline and AmpB groups, showed significant reductions in the parasitism in the infected tissue (66% and 62%, respectively), liver (69% and 44%, respectively), spleen (71% and 38%, respectively), and dLN (72% and 48%, respectively). In conclusion, results suggested that GF1061 may be considered as a possible therapeutic target to be evaluated against leishmaniasis in other mammalian hosts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeishmania amazonensis 3aLeishmania infantum 3aamastigotes 3aamphotericin B 3aantileishmanial properties 3abody weight 3adrugs 3ahosts 3ain vivo studies 3aleishmaniasis 3aliver 3alymph nodes 3amacrophages 3amechanism of action 3amembrane potential 3amice 3amitochondrial membrane 3aparasite load 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apromastigotes 3areactive oxygen species 3aspleen 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 0aFluoroquinoline 0aChemotherapy 0aLeishmaniasis 0aToxicity 0aNatural products 0aMechanism of action1 aMendonça, Débora V.C.1 aLage, Daniela P.1 aAntinarelli, Luciana M.R.1 aSoyer, Tauane G.1 aSenna, Ana J.S.1 aMatos, Guilherme F.1 aDias, Daniel S.1 aRibeiro, Patrícia A.F.1 aBatista, João P.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9560-59121 aPoletto, Joana M.1 aBrandão, Geraldo C.1 aChávez-Fumagalli, Miguel A.1 aPereira, Guilherme R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0665-77381 aCoimbra, Elaine S.1 aCoelho, Eduardo A.F.0 tActa tropica.g2019 Mar., v. 191 p.29-37dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02123naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006100151245005600212520081400268592002801082650002301110650001101133650001501144653002501159653003001184653002001214653002001234653004101254653002001295653002401315653002501339653002001364653002201384700007601406700006601482773009401548856008601642852000901728655001201737IND60719821320221118051808.0210820e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071982132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e056432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía, Adriana,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2914-583914aThe improving sequence effect on monetary sequences  aExperimental studies reveal a preference for improving income sequences, challenging the axioms of the discounted utility model, such as the present value maximization principle. Through an experiment, we test the existence of this anomaly on short and long-term income sequences, by confirming previous experimental evidence. Although the participants are aware of the present value maximization, they select improving sequences of income mainly to cover their future spending needs, to feel motivation at work, and to receive a signal of success and status. In order to include this sequence effect in a mathematical valuation model, we propose an alternative model to value sequences which outperforms the traditional discounting model by fitting the present value with the preferences of the participants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconometric models 3aincome 3amotivation 0aIntertemporal choice 0aImproving sequence effect 0aValuation model 0aIncome sequence 0aPresent value maximization principle 0aSocial sciences 0aFinancial economics 0aBehavioral economics 0aLabor economics 0aDecision sciences1 aMuñoz Torrecillas, María José1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5853-43931 aCruz Rambaud, Salvador1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1318-12210 tHeliyon.g2020 Dec., v. 6, no. 12 p.e05643-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e056433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245010600167300002000273520130000293592002801593650001301621650001301634650000901647650001401656650001601670650001201686650001301698650001301711650001701724650001701741650001601758651003101774700002001805700002201825700001901847700002101866700002001887700002401907700001801931700002601949700002901975700002002004773012802024856008102152852000902233655001202242IND60535861820221117020753.0160805e20150901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053586182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b017552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmbrose, Jesse L.10aMercury Emission Ratios from Coal-Fired Power Plants in the Southeastern United States during NOMADSS  ap. 10389-10397.  aWe use measurements made onboard the National Science Foundation’s C-130 research aircraft during the 2013 Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) experiment to examine total Hg (THg) emission ratios (EmRs) for six coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) in the southeastern U.S. We compare observed enhancement ratios (ERs) with EmRs calculated using Hg emissions data from two inventories: the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) and the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). For four CFPPs, our measured ERs are strongly correlated with EmRs based on the 2011 NEI (r² = 0.97), although the inventory data exhibit a −39% low bias. Our measurements agree best (to within ±32%) with the NEI Hg data when the latter were derived from on-site emissions measurements. Conversely, the NEI underestimates by approximately 1 order of magnitude the ERs we measured for one previously untested CFPP. Measured ERs are uncorrelated with values based on the 2013 TRI, which also tends to be biased low. Our results suggest that the Hg inventories can be improved by targeting CFPPs for which the NEI- and TRI-based EmRs have significant disagreements. We recommend that future versions of the Hg inventories should provide greater traceability and uncertainty estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aaircraft 3acoal 3aemissions 3ainventories 3amercury 3anitrogen 3aoxidants 3apower plants 3atraceability 3auncertainty 3aSoutheastern United States1 aGratz, Lynne

Three hundred healthy gold fish (2.5 ± 0.05) juveniles were randomly distributed in 12 glass aquariums (400-L; 25 fish per aquaria) and fed experimental diets contain different levels of L. acidophilus (0, 1.5 × 108, 3 × 108 and 6 × 108) for 8 weeks. SDS-PAGE analysis of skin mucus protein profile at the end of the feeding trial revealed differences in protein profile of probiotic fed fish and control group; even three new bands were observed in L. acidophilus treated groups. Furthermore, fish fed 6 × 108 CFU g−1 supplemented diet showed up-regulation of both TNF-1α and TNF-2α gene expression (P < 0.05). Evaluation of appetite related gene expression showed down-regulation of ghrelin in probiotic fed fish compared those of control treatment (P < 0.05). However, administration of different levels of L. acidophilus had no significant effects on growth performance (P > 0.05). These results demonstrated that while no beneficial effects on growth performance, dietary L. acidophilus affects immune and appetite related genes expression as well as skin mucus protein profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarassius gibelio 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aappetite 3aaquariums 3aexperimental diets 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3aghrelin 3agoldfish 3agrowth performance 3aimmunology 3ajuveniles 3amucus 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprobiotics 3aprotein composition 3ashellfish 0aProbiotic 0aGene expression 0aProtein profile 0aSDS-PAGE 0aAppetite1 aKolangi Miandare, Hamed1 aHoseinifar, Seyed Hossein1 aYarahmadi, Peyman0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2016 Dec., v. 59 p.149-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245008600163300001800249500001400267520055600281592002800837650001800865650002800883650001300911653003100924653001500955653002600970700001900996700001901015773018401034856007501218852000901293655001201302IND60691845920221118044525.0200502e20000101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069184592DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.64.15192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSHIONO, Yoshihito10aEffect of the Azetidine and Azocine Rings of Okaramine B on Insecticidal Activity  ap. 1519-1521.  aNAL-light  aFour degraded okaramine B (2) products, 4′,5′-dihydrookaramine B (3), two azetidine ring-opened compounds (4 and 5) and 1′,2′,4′,5′-tetrahydrookaramine B (6), were prepared and their insecticidal activity was examined.

Despite their medical importance, the systematics of the subfamily is far from resolved, particularly within the tribe Triatomini. Here we employed mitochondrial genome DNA sequences to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships among 19 species of the North-Central American (NCA) clade of Triatomini and to estimate the times of origin and diversification of its main clades. Twenty-nine mitogenomes were examined for representative specimens of 25 species, including the outgroup. Phylogenetic informativeness estimated for each protein-coding gene showed that cox1, cox2 and atp6 were the most informative markers, whereas atp8 and nad4 had high saturation levels. Phylogenetic analyses excluding the latter two protein-coding genes recovered an almost fully resolved topology. The NCA clade apparently originated shortly after emergence of an initial land bridge of the Panama Isthmus, ca. 15.05–20.05 Mya. An Asian/pantropical subclade with Linshcosteus costalis, Triatoma rubrofasciata and T. migrans was nested within the NCA clade, from which it diverged ca. 12.42–17.3Mya. Uncorrected cox1 and 13 protein-coding gene distances suggest the existence of additional species within the dimidiata complex. In contrast, T. phyllosoma, T. mazzottii and T. longipennis, from the phyllosoma complex, have considerably low cox1 and 13 PCG distances among them, suggesting mitochondrial introgression or conspecificity. Our study yielded a robust phylogeny for the group, which could be tested with further phylogenetic hypotheses based on nuclear genome-wide markers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aTriatoma rubrofasciata 3aconspecificity 3agenes 3ahematophagy 3ainfection 3aintrogression 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial genome 3aphylogeny 3apublic health 3atopology 3aPanama 0aMitogenome 0aSpecies complex 0aMolecular evolution 0aChagas vector1 aMeza-Lázaro, Rubi Nelsi1 aKieran, Troy J.1 aIbarra-Cerdeña, Carlos N.1 aZaldívar-Riverón, Alejandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5837-19290 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2020 Oct., v. 84 p.104373-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.1043733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01799naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002300165245010700188300001600295520045900311592002800770650000900798650004500807650001200852650002700864650003300891650004000924650000900964650001100973650003200984650004001016650003201056650000901088650006301097650002601160773012301186852000901309856008301318655001201401IND4380636520221117160533.0181127e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438063652DNAL7 a164342252pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2005.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeiss, Douglas J.,10aAplastic anemia in cats — clinicopathological features and associated disease conditions 1996–2004  ap. 203-206.  aA retrospective study of 128 feline bone marrow reports identified 13 cases of aplastic anemia.

The karst ecosystem is prone to degradation and accounts for a large proportion of southwest China. Understanding of the response of the microbial community structure to biochar-based fertilizer application is of great significance in karst soil restoration. A field experiment located in southwest China was conducted in typical karst soil, and a high-throughput sequencing approach was used to investigate the effect of biochar-based fertilizer application on microbial community structure in karst soil. Field trials were set up for 24 months using the following treatments: control (CK), compost plus NPK fertilizer (MF), biochar (B), less biochar (half the quantity of biochar in B) plus compost and NPK fertilizer (B1MF), biochar plus compost and NPK fertilizer (BMF), and more biochar (double the quantity of biochar in B) plus compost and NPK fertilizer (B4MF). The results elucidated that BMF and B4MF treatments had higher contents of soil carbon and soil nutrients N, P, and K than the other treatments. Soil microbial abundance and diversity were significantly increased by biochar-based fertilizer amendments (BMF and B4MF), compared to CK (P < 0.05). BMF and B4MF treatments significantly increased the relative abundance of dominant microorganisms, compared to CK (P < 0.05). The difference in the composition of indicator microbes between each treated group indicated that soil amendments altered the microbial community structure. There was a strong correlation between soil properties (soil C-, N-, and P-fractions) and microbial community structure. Furthermore, network analysis revealed that the addition of biochar-based fertilizer increased the scale and complexity of the microbial co-occurrence network. To summarize, the application of biochar-based fertilizer enabled more keystone species in the soil microbial network to participate in soil carbon resource management and soil nutrient cycling, indicating that biochar-based fertilizer is beneficial for the restoration of karst-degraded soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNPK fertilizers 3abiochar 3acommunity structure 3acomposts 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3afertilizer application 3afield experimentation 3akarsts 3akeystone species 3amicrobial communities 3amountains 3aresource management 3asoil carbon 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil nutrients 3asoil restoration 3aChina 0aKarst soil 0aBiochar-based fertilizer 0aSoil properties 0aMicrobial community structure 0aMicrobial network1 aXue, Jianhui1 aZhou, Zhidong1 aWu, Yongbo0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 794 p.148757-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1487573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02273naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245021600169300001400385520091100399592002801310650001501338650002401353650001601377650003101393650001301424650001901437650001001456650002301466653001601489653004001505653001801545653002401563700001401587700001701601700001201618700001701630700001801647773008701665856009001752852000901842655001201851IND60607458820221121234400.0180904e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060745882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.11.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Zheng10aSimultaneous reduction and surface functionalization of graphene oxide with wrinkled structure by diethylenetriamine (DETA) and their reinforcing effects in the flexible poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) (P2EHA) films  ap. 64-75.  aNH2-reduced graphene oxide (NH2-rGO)/waterborne poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) (P2EHA) composites were prepared through an easy, all aqueous, electrostatic self-assembly method. GO was functionalized and reduced by diethylenetriamine (DETA) to achieve highly stable P2EHA/NH2-rGO composite colloid dispersions system, leading to the formation of composites with a self-aligned layered structure and highly anisotropic properties between the direction of alignment and that perpendicular to it. The NH2-rGO went through the structural transformation resulting in wrinkled graphene structures with many open-edge sites when N was doped into rGO sheet. The using of DETA resulted in the electrostatic interaction between the P2EHA latex and NH2-rGO and the highly aligned, ultralarged NH2-rGO sheets with surface wrinkles gave rise to the improved mechanical, electrical and thermal properties of the composites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acomposite materials 3adispersions 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3alatex 3athermal properties 0aA.

Such variation can be viewed as the sum of genetic factors and their interaction with environmental variation (e.g., soil characteristics), which lead identical genotypes to produce contrasting phenotypes in different environments, and introduced individuals to perform differently from local trees in plantations and test trials. Predicting this variation is of great interest to foresters working with commercially important species. Such is the case of sacred fir (Abies religiosa), a species that is an important source of wood and resin for communities living above 2500 m asl in central Mexico. We determined the contribution of both genetic and soil factors for predicting phenotypic performance of local naturally regenerated (NR) and introduced by reforestation (RF) seedlings in a sacred fir trial test performed by local communities in the Nevado de Toluca National Park. In spite of a low genetic differentiation between plant sources, NR seedlings outperformed RF plants in terms of height, diameter and water use. According to our models, a large part of these differences could be explained by the interaction of genetic, management and edaphic factors within the trial site, with local genotypes using more efficiently the available soil nitrogen than the introduced ones; thus indicating that planting could be changing plant microenvironment and have a measurable phenotypic effect. Association studies between genetic and edaphic variation further suggested that local adaptation might also be occurring at small within-population scales. All such traits, when correctly integrated, may result in fair genome-based phenotypic predictions for small secluded natural populations, which could be at the base of better reforestation practices, and conservation and assisted migration programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies religiosa 3aadministrative management 3aforest ecology 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3anational parks 3anitrogen 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3areforestation 3awood 3aMexico 0aAbies 0aLocal adaptation 0aForest regeneration 0aGenotype – environment interaction (G × E) 0aPlant-soil interactions1 aCampo, Julio1 aMastretta-Yanes, Alicia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2951-63531 aJaramillo-Correa, Juan Pablo0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 494 p.119293-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2021.1192933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02310naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245009000171300001600261520119600277592002801473650001401501650001401515650001901529650002201548650001101570650001501581650001301596700002201609700001901631700001701650700002101667700006001688773010901748856008201857852000901939655001201948IND60696774220221122214148.0200530e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069677422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-019-10064-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeissler, Caleb H.10aElectric Pulse Pretreatment for Enhanced Lipid Recovery from Chlorella protothecoides  ap. 499-506.  aDeveloping effective, energy-efficient methods to extract lipids from microalgae remains a challenge in bioenergy. This study assesses electric pulse (EP) pretreatments to enhance lipid extraction from Chlorella protothecoides. In tandem with solvent extraction, we applied 10, 50, 100, 200, and 300 60 kV/cm, 60 ns duration EPs or 3, 17, 33, 67, and 100 60 kV/cm, 300 ns duration EPs to match the energy density u applied to the sample for each EP duration. Lipid recovery increased with increasing u for each EP duration until reaching a maximum for 17 300 ns EPs (the second lowest u) and 100 60 ns EPs (the third lowest u) to achieve a 13.3% and 16.1% increase in lipid extraction, respectively. Lipid extraction declined at higher u due to increased cell lysis. The largest net energy released calculated from the difference between the energy available from the extracted lipids and the applied energy of the EPs occurred at the lowest u for each EP duration. Applying trains of 100 μs EPs induced qualitatively similar behavior. These results suggest that a more detailed parametric study may optimize EP parameters for net energy release for specific microalgae and solvents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella 3abioenergy 3aenergy density 3aenergy efficiency 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3asolvents1 aMulligan, Mary L.1 aZmola, Zane E.1 aRay, Shaunak1 aMorgan, John A.,1 aGarner, Allen L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5416-74370 tBioEnergy research.g2020 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.499-506dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-019-10064-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006900170300001400239520089700253592002801150650002401178650001501202650002201217650001801239650001101257650001001268650002201278650001301300650001501313650000901328650001401337650003001351650002501381650001801406650004501424650002001469650001001489650001501499650001301514651001001527653002201537653001501559653001301574653001401587653001801601700002001619700002301639700001801662700002001680773010901700856008501809852000901894655001201903IND60589666120221119075539.0190401e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058966612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.02.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBattisti, Elena10aCirculating genotypes of Toxoplasma gondii in Northwestern Italy  ap. 43-47.  aToxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite that in Europe is genetically characterized by three main clonal genotypes, with a lesser prevalence of atypical patterns.

In the present study, HopZ4, a member of the YopJ family of T3E from the cucumber pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans is described. HopZ4 shares high sequence similarity with the Xanthomonas T3E XopJ, and a functional analysis suggests a conserved virulence function between these two T3E. As has previously been shown for XopJ, HopZ4 interacts with the proteasomal subunit RPT6 in yeast and in planta to inhibit proteasome activity during infection. The inhibitory effect on the proteasome is dependent on localization of HopZ4 to the plasma membrane as well as on an intact catalytic triad of the effector protein. Furthermore, HopZ4 is able to complement loss of XopJ in Xanthomonas spp., as it prevents precocious host cell death during a compatible Xanthomonas-pepper interaction. The data presented here suggest that different bacterial species employ inhibition of the proteasome as a virulence strategy by making use of conserved T3E from the YopJ family of bacterial effector proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. lachrymans 3aXanthomonas 3acell death 3acucumbers 3apathogens 3aplasma membrane 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3aproteins 3asequence homology 3avirulence 3ayeasts1 aKönig, Patrick1 aGuttman, David S.1 aBörnke, Frederik0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2014 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.611-623dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-12-13-0363-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03746naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009300167300001200260520202900272592002802301650003202329650001102361650001102372650001302383650001502396650001002411650001902421650002102440650001702461650000902478650002002487650001802507650002102525651001002546653000902556653000802565653000802573653000802581653001902589653001802608653002702626653000802653700001702661700001902678700002002697700001202717700001702729700001402746700001802760700001702778700001602795700001502811700001902826700001302845700001702858700002002875773010702895856008503002852000903087655001203096IND60589666320221119075603.0190401e20180415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058966632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.02.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiawei10aFirst description of the pathogenicity of Babesia vogeli in experimentally infected dogs  ap. 1-7.  aBabesiosis is a tick-borne disease that occurs worldwide with the most recognized Babesia species that infect dogs being Babesia canis, B. vogeli, B. rossi and B. gibsoni. While B. vogeli is reported in dogs worldwide, clinical and laboratory data on infections is based on reports of naturally infected dogs. To provide reliable data on the clinical and laboratory abnormalities associated with acute and more chronic infections in healthy dogs free of other tick-borne diseases, we experimentally infected dogs with a Chinese strain of B. vogeli. All of the six infected Beagles, three of which were splenectomized, became infected with B. vogeli detected in blood smears taken the day following infection and the organism detected by FRET-qPCRs in most blood samples (77/86; 90%) collected about every 4 days until the end of the experiment on day 95. All the infected dogs showed fever, partial anorexia and malaise that was more severe in the splenectomized dogs that did not gain weight for three weeks in the period after initial infection. Regenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia and decreased white blood cell counts were seen in all dogs but were more severe in the splenectomized dogs, of which two had life threatening infections and had to be removed from the study for treatment. Following re-infection on day 66, none of the dogs showed clinical signs and copy numbers did not change significantly although all the dogs were negative by FRET-qPCR on at least some of the subsequent sampling days. Laboratory values in the non-splenectomized dogs were relatively unchanged while in the splenectomized dog there was a temporary small increase in the platelet and white blood cell counts and a temporary slight worsening of the anemia. In summary, our study shows dogs experimentally infected with a B. vogeli strain from China develop only mild clinical signs that are followed by asymptomatic infections that can last for least 95 days. In splenectomized dogs, however, severe life threatening signs may develop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aBeagle 3aanemia 3aanorexia 3ababesiosis 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3achronic diseases 3adog diseases 3adogs 3aleukocyte count 3apathogenicity 3athrombocytopenia 3aChina 0aFRET 0aPCR 0aALT 0aAST 0aBabesia vogeli 0aPathogenicity 0aExperimental infection 0aDog1 aZhang, Jilei1 aKelly, Patrick1 aZheng, Xiaofeng1 aLi, Min1 aYou, Jinfeng1 aHuang, Ke1 aQiu, Haixiang1 aWang, Yaoyao1 aZhang, Rong1 aLi, Jianji1 aDong, Junsheng1 aFeng, Yi1 aZhou, Jinlin1 aWang, Chengming0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2018 Apr. 15, v. 253 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.02.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245009900207520175200306592002802058650001102086650001602097650001702113650001302130650001802143650002802161650001602189650002602205650002602231650001602257650001602273650002602289650001302315653004602328653002202374653001602396653002302412653002102435653002602456653000802482700002502490700006002515700006202575773012702637856008602764852000902850655001202859IND60790571420221118150111.0220929e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079057142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1336922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Elena1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1367-195710aEnvironmental impacts of dry anaerobic biorefineries in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach  aThe organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) represents the 34% of European waste and the overall share is going to increase since separate collection will be implemented across the member states. There is still lack of studies on environmental impacts of dry anaerobic biorefineries applying innovative solvents to produce biopolymers (e.g., polyhydroxyalkanoates – PHA) from the OFMSW. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis was applied to assess the environmental impacts of a conventional management strategy to recover biomethane and compost from the OFMSW with a dry anaerobic biorefinery recovering biomethane, fertilizers and PHAs. Four approaches to recover PHAs were included in the study, comprising two innovative and environmentally sustainable extraction methods (i.e., solvent extraction with ethyl acetate (EA) and ionic liquids (ILs)). The inventory data were derived from an Italian case study plant, while the data for modelling the PHA selection/accumulation and PHA extraction processes were retrieved from the literature. The comparison revealed that, at the current technological readiness level (TRL), the conventional management strategy has better environmental performances than the novel approach producing PHAs. For example, biomethane recovery, for which a substitution with natural gas was assumed, showed the highest avoided impacts for abiotic depletion of fossil fuel (65.5%), global warming (57.4%) and ozone layer depletion (65.4%) categories. PHA recovery scenarios showed high environmental impacts in all categories linked to natural resource depletion. PHA extraction with EA proved to be the most environmentally sustainable and promising technique towards an industrial application.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3abiorefining 3acase studies 3acomposts 3aethyl acetate 3aindustrial applications 3ainventories 3alife cycle assessment 3amunicipal solid waste 3anatural gas 3aozonosphere 3apolyhydroxyalkanoates 3asolvents 0aOrganic fraction of municipal solid waste 0aPlug-flow reactor 0aBiopolymers 0aExtraction methods 0aBiogas upgrading 0aLife cycle assessment 0aLCA1 aPasciucco, Francesco1 aIannelli, Renato1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3247-37991 aPecorini, Isabella1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3027-77080 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 371 p.133692-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1336923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02376naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245012400156300001600280520110700296592002801403650001301431650001601444650001401460650001901474650000901493650001001502650003701512650001601549650001701565650002201582650001401604650001401618650002601632700001901658700001401677700001501691700002001706700001501726773011901741856007301860852000901933655001201942IND60519554720221119073908.0160504e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051955472DNAL7 a10.1111/vco.121032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViall, A.

We examined the expression and function of 5HTR1B in the COS canine osteosarcoma cell line and normal canine osteoblasts. Equal levels of 5HTR1B gene and protein expression were found between normal and malignant osteoblasts. Treatment with serotonin enhanced viability of osteosarcoma cells but not normal osteoblasts. Challenge with the 5HTR1B agonist anpirtoline caused no change in cell viability. Rather incubation with the specific receptor antagonist SB224289 caused reduction in osteoblast viability, with this effect more substantial in osteosarcoma cells. Investigation of this inhibitory activity showed 5HTR1B antagonism induces apoptosis in malignant cells. Evaluation of phosphorylated levels of CREB and ERK, transcriptional regulators associated with serotonin receptor signalling in osteoblasts, revealed aberrant 5HTR1B signalling in COS. Our results confirm the presence of 5HTR1B in a canine osteosarcoma cell line and highlight this receptor as a possible novel therapeutic target.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3acell viability 3adogs 3agenes 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aosteoblasts 3aosteosarcoma 3aprotein synthesis 3areceptors 3aserotonin 3atranscription factors1 aGoodall, C.

Increased canopy openness and increased detritus (debris) deposition are two of the most likely factors, but due to their simultaneous occurrence during a hurricane, their relative effects cannot be separated without a manipulative experiment. Hence, in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) of Puerto Rico, the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) has undertaken experimental manipulations in replicated 30×30m plots to simulate the major effects of hurricane disturbance–increased canopy openness and debris addition to the forest floor. Using a factorial experiment enabled investigation of the separate and combined effects of canopy opening and debris on this wet tropical forest; the experimental outcomes may help direct forest management decisions in similar disturbance-prone environments. In this first article of the special issue, we (1) provide details of the design and methodology for this manipulative experiment (the Canopy Trimming Experiment, CTE), (2) report some principal abiotic responses to treatments, and (3) introduce the subject areas of the 12 additional CTE manuscripts in this special issue. The physical conditions created by canopy and understory treatment and the amounts of debris added to CTE plots were similar to the LEF’s conditions following Hurricane Hugo (a category 4 storm) in 1989; although more wood and a 37% (1.5cm) deeper litter layer was present in the CTE. Our selective cutting and removal of the forest canopy above 3m, which included trimming 234 palm trees and 342 non-palm trees, greatly altered the understory micro-environment by increasing light levels and decreasing litter moisture for 18months; throughfall and soil moisture were elevated in trim plots for 3months. In plots where the canopy was trimmed and the debris (6kgm−2) was added to the forest floor, the canopy debris persisted on the forest floor for at least 4years; debris decomposed more quickly in plots with intact canopies. The diverse collection of papers in this special issue provide mechanistic understandings of response patterns of tropical forest biota (microbes, plants, animals) and processes (decomposition, herbivory, nutrient cycling, primary production) to canopy and understory disturbance that resembles a major (⩾category 3) hurricane. Although measurements for this experiment are on-going to further identify the mechanisms of long-term forest change resulting from hurricanes, we include findings up to the first seven years post-treatment at this time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArecaceae 3aanimals 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3acanopy gaps 3acutting 3aforest canopy 3aforest litter 3aforest management 3aherbivores 3ahurricanes 3amicroorganisms 3aprimary productivity 3asoil water 3athroughfall 3atrees 3atropical forests 3aunderstory 3awind damage 3awood 3aPuerto Rico 0aCanopy detritus 0aExperimental cyclone disturbance 0aForest recovery 0aLong-Term Ecological Research (LTER) 0aTropical succession 0aUnderstory light1 aGonzález de Jesús, Grizelle,0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 332 p.1-10dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2014.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FSUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01451naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245007600156300001800232520051300250592002800763650002700791650002300818650001100841650002600852700001300878700002300891700001700914773013400931856007501065852000901140655001201149IND60658879920221120113209.0190826e20110221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065887992DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05318j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Minfeng10aSite-selective metal-coordination-based patterning of silane monolayers  ap. 2802-2804.  aHerein, we report a method to pattern a derivatized nifedipine silane monolayer that aromatizes under UV irradiation.

In animals, evidence supports a causal role for PVs in the development of cutaneous and oral SCC in some species. In reptiles, three cases of papilloma or fibropapilloma have been associated with PV infection, but no association has been reported to date with SCC. Two cases of cutaneous epithelial tumours, multiple papillomas in a spiny-tailed lizard (Uromastyx acanthinura) and SCC in a Dumeril's boa (Acrantophis dumerili), were investigated by polymerase chain reaction. PV DNA was amplified from samples of both lesions. Typical microscopical features suggestive of PV infection (e.g. the presence of koilocytes) were observed in the lesions from the spiny-tailed lizard. This is the first report of an association between PV and SCC in reptiles. Further studies are needed to better clarify the role of PVs in these species and to characterize the PV strains involved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcrantophis 3aDNA 3aPapillomaviridae 3aepithelium 3alizards 3apapilloma 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asquamous cell carcinoma 0apapillomavirus 0areptile 0asnake 0asquamous cell carcinoma1 aCorteggio, A.1 aAltamura, G.1 aMeoli, R.1 aCocumelli, C.1 aRossi, G.1 aFriedrich, K.G.1 aDi Cerbo, P.1 aBorzacchiello, G.0 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2017 July, v. 157, no. 1 p.23-26dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2017.04.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245016900173300001800342520054300360592002800903650001400931650001800945650001500963650002200978650002001000700006301020700002001083700002301103700006301126773012001189856008301309852000901392655001201401IND60688933620221120033624.0200417e20200407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068893362DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.0c008572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAthawale, Paresh R.10aOverturning the Peribysin Family Natural Products Isolated from Periconia byssoides OUPS-N133: Synthesis and Stereochemical Revision of Peribysins A, B, C, F, and G  ap. 3104-3109.  aHerein we report the stereochemical revision of peribysins A, B, C, F, and G, guided by enantiospecific total synthesis starting from (+)-nootkatone.

The environmental issues, such as global warming, greenhouse effect and others, associated with non-renewable energy sources have instigated the development of technologies to harness power from vibration, solar, and thermal energy. The energy can be converted to power using small electronic devices. Vibration is a common energy source in our surroundings and can be transformed into electrical energy using different transduction mechanisms: electrostatic, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, and triboelectric generators. A piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) and triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) are two electrical power harvesting devices for converting the vibration from the surrounding to electrical energy. Several eco-friendly and biocompatible components have been employed in the fabrication of the PENG and TENG for multiple application including chemical sensors, pressure sensors, and biomedical appliances. This review elaborates the application of different smart materials as the TENG and PENG for the conversion of mechanical or vibrational energy to electrical energy for varied applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomechanics 3aelectric generators 3aelectric power 3agreenhouse effect 3anonrenewable resources 3arenewable energy sources 3athermal energy 3avibration 0aEnergy harvesting 0aNanomaterials 0aPiezoelectric nanogenerator 0aTriboelectric nanogenerator 0aVibrational energy1 aHoai Ta, Qui Thanh1 aTran, Ngo0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 371 p.133702-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1337023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01410naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011000158300001800268520032600286592002800612650002300640650001500663650002700678650002300705650002300728650001500751650002100766700001600787700001500803700001300818700001300831773013200844856007500976852000901051655001201060IND60658880220221122073207.0190826e20110503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065888022DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05323f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jia-Yi10aClean and modified substrates for direct detection of living cells by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy  ap. 5738-5740.  aIodide adsorption and electrochemical negative potential desorption were proposed and compared to obtain clean SERS substrates.

Efficiency and stability of the reactors, as well as biogas quality, were assessed, and microbial community changes were evaluated using the PCR-DGGE technique. The results showed that the air dosing point affected the H₂S concentration and that air dosing at the headspace promoted the highest H₂S removal efficiency. The airflow rate also affected the process, since H₂S concentration in the biogas was higher at 0.1 mL air.min⁻¹ than at 0.3 mL air.min⁻¹. The methane concentration in the biogas was also affected by both air dosing point and flow rate, since the lowest value was observed at the highest airflow rate of the headspace dosing point, due to dilution by the N₂ influx applied to the system. The highest productivity and operational efficiency were observed at this air dosing point, with this airflow (HD₀.₃), which corroborates with the operational results and the ecological parameters, since the microaeration at this stage promoted high bacterial and archaeal species richness and diversity, optimum functional organization, high COD and H₂S removal efficiencies.  aThe authors would like to thank the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq), an organization of the Brazilian Government for the development of Science and Technology, for the Master’s and PhD scholarships and financial support (Process 484979/2012-4 from Edital Universal) and Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP) for the financial support.  aPublisher supplied data  aProcess 484979/2012-4 from Edital Universal 3aArchaea 3aair 3aair flow 3abiogas 3achemical oxygen demand 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aheadspace analysis 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amethane 3amicrobial communities 3anitrogen 3aspecies richness 3awastewater 0aAnaerobic treatment 0abiogas 0ahydrogen sulfide 0amicroaeration 0aodour control1 aOliveira, C.

One important mechanical signal experienced by various cell types, e.g. around blood vessels, within the lung epithelia or around the intestine, is cyclic stretch. As a response, many cell types reorient their actin cytoskeleton and main cell axis almost perpendicular to the direction of stretch. Despite the vital necessity of cellular adaptation to cyclic stretch, the underlying mechanosensory signal cascades are far from being understood. Here we show an important function of Src-family kinase activity in cellular reorientation upon cyclic stretch. Deletion of all three family members, namely c-Src, Yes and Fyn (SYF), results in a strongly impaired cell reorientation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with an only incomplete reorientation upon expression of c-Src. We further demonstrate that this reorientation phenotype of SYF-depleted cells is not caused by affected protein exchange dynamics within focal adhesions or altered cell force generation. Instead, Src-family kinases regulate the reorientation in a mechanotransduction-dependent manner, since knock-down and knock-out of p130Cas, a putative stretch sensor known to be phosphorylated by Src-family kinases, also reduce cellular reorientation upon cyclic stretch. This impaired reorientation is identical in intensity upon mutating stretch-sensitive tyrosines of p130Cas only. These statistically highly significant data pinpoint early events in a Src family kinase- and p130Cas-dependent mechanosensory/mechanotransduction pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood vessels 3afibroblasts 3aintestines 3amechanotransduction 3amice 3amicrofilaments 3aphenotype 3aphosphotransferases (kinases)1 aBorn, Simone1 aHampe, Nico1 aKirchgeßner, Norbert1 aMerkel, Rudolf1 aHoffmann, Bernd0 tEuropean journal of cell biology.g2012 Feb., v. 91, no. 2 p.118-128dElsevier GmbHx0171-93357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2011.10.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245010000178506011700278520114100395592002801536506003701564650001401601650001301615650000901628650002001637650001901657650001201676653002301688653002301711653001201734653002801746653001601774653001201790653000801802653001001810653001001820653000801830653000801838653001401846653000801860653000801868653000801876653000801884653000801892653000801900653000801908653000901916653000801925653000801933653000901941653000801950653000801958653000801966653000701974653000801981700002201989700002202011700002202033700002002055700002402075773011102099856008502210852000902295655001202304IND60768868420221207064021.0220314e20220601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076886842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2022.1072202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitriadis, Athanasios10aIntegration of stabilized bio-oil in light cycle oil hydrotreatment unit targeting hybrid fuels  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aFast pyrolysis bio-oil requires upgrading in order to be used as an intermediate refinery stream as it contains various acids, oxygenates, heavy compounds and water. This work examines the potential of integrating the organic phase (called BioMates) of a hydrotreated pyrolysis bio-oil as a reliable intermediate refinery stream to be co-processed with a light cycle oil (LCO) towards the production of hybrid fuels. Three blends of BioMates with LCO were fed in a hydroprocessing pilot plant (10/90, 20/80 and 30/70 v/v BioMates/LCO). The dedicated tests aimed to study the BioMates effect on the LCO hydrodesulphurization performance, hydrogen consumption, product quality and catalyst life. The results have confirmed that over 85% per weight of the final product is between 60 and 360 °C boiling range and exhibit favorable fuel properties. The technology can process up to 30% per volume BioMates in LCO without any significant technical limitation, while reducing the hydrogen consumption up to 8.9%. Finally, based on the findings, no clogging or permanent loss of catalyst effectiveness was observed after 37 days on stream.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3ahydrogen 3aoils 3aproduct quality 3apyrolysis oils 3astreams 0aCo-hydroprocessing 0aHydrodeoxygenation 0aBio-oil 0aCatalytic pyrolysis oil 0aHybrid fuel 0aBiofuel 0aAFP 0aCERTH 0aCPERI 0aDOS 0aFBP 0aH/C ratio 0aHDA 0aHDN 0aHDO 0aHDS 0aHDT 0aIBP 0aLCO 0aLHSV 0aMCR 0aPAH 0aSRGO 0aTAN 0aTRL 0av/v 0awt 0aΔP1 aMeletidis, George1 aPfisterer, Ulrich1 aAuersvald, Miloš1 aKubička, David1 aBezergianni, Stella0 tFuel processing technology.g2022 June 01, v. 230 p.107220-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2022.1072203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02720naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008400163300001600247520144600263592002801709650001201737650001801749650001401767650002201781650002101803650001001824650001401834650001501848650001901863650003501882650002801917651001001945700001501955700001501970700001501985700001402000700001302014700001702027773015202044856008102196852000902277655001202286IND60548893320221120035512.0160905e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054889332DNAL7 a10.1094/MPMI-02-14-0046-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Weihuai10aStepwise Arms Race Between AvrPik and Pik Alleles in the Rice Blast Pathosystem  ap. 759-769.  aA stepwise mutation that occurred in both pathogens and their respective hosts has played a seminal role in the co-evolutionary arms race evolution in diverse pathosystems. The process driven by rice blast AvrPik and Pik alleles was investigated through population genetic and evolutionary approaches. The genetic diversity of the non-signal domain of AvrPik was higher than that in its signal peptide domain. Positive selection for particular AvrPik alleles in the northeastern region of China was stronger than in the south. The perfect relationship between the functional lineages and AvrPik allele-specific pathotypes was established by ruling out the nonfunctional lineages derived from additional copies. Only four alleles conditioning stepwise pathotypes were detected in natural populations, which were likely created by only one evolutionary pathway with three recognizable mutation steps. Two non-stepwise pathotypes were determined by two blocks in a network constructed by all 16 possible alleles, indicating that a natural evolution process can be artificially changed by a combination of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Assuming that AvrPik evolution has been largely driven by host selection, the co-evolutionary stepwise relationships between AvrPik and Pik was established. The experimental validation of stepwise mutation is required for the development of sustainable management strategies against plant disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3ablast disease 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3apathogens 3apathotypes 3asignal peptide 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aWang, Ling1 aZhang, Shu1 aLi, Zekang1 aZhang, Yu1 aLin, Fei1 aPan, Qinghua0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2014 Aug., v. 27, no. 8 p.759-769dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-02-14-0046-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03201naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013900166300001600305520150400321592002801825596006201853650004401915650002701959650002301986650002202009650003702031650001902068650002402087650001402111650001202125650001402137650002002151650001502171650000902186650002102195650001802216650000902234650001502243650003302258650001802291650001702309650002402326700001602350700002302366700002502389700005702414773010902471856008202580852000902662655001202671IND60696775520221120064051.0200530e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069677552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-019-10060-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWadood, Abdul10aIn situ Transesterification of Microalgae Parachlorella kessleri Biomass Using Sulfonated Rice Husk Solid Catalyst at Room Temperature  ap. 530-541.  aMicroalgae are a sustainable raw material for biodiesel production that earned a lot of consideration. Biodiesel from the conventional transesterification (liquid acid based) process of microalgae oil needs pre-treatment before its use as fuel. Moreover, the oil extraction process is energy extensive. In this study, room temperature assisted in situ transesterification method is reported using a solid acid catalyst obtained from sulfonated rice husk (RHS). The RHS catalyst was synthesized by microwave acid treatment of rice husk. The surface characterization of RHS by XRD, FT-IR, Raman, and XPS confirms the presence of −SO₃H, while the pore anatomy and pore structure analysis by FE-SEM and BET substantiate the presence of porous structure and high surface area. Furthermore, the RHS catalyst was successfully employed for the in situ transesterification of the microalgae (Parachlorella kessleri) biomass. Various experimental conditions influencing the in situ transesterification were evaluated. The optimization of catalyst dose revealed that 30 mg RHS produce highest FAME yield after 30-min reaction time at room temperature (25 °C). Performance of the catalyst was compared with rice husk-derived fluorocarbon (RHFC) and conventional acid catalyst (H₂SO₄). Moreover, in the proposed approach, there is no need for oil extraction step and pre-treatment of biodiesel after the reaction. RHS is very effective at room temperature compared with conventional transesterification.  aPublisher supplied data  aSR-161006cKing Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aParachlorella kessleri 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aacid treatment 3aambient temperature 3abiodiesel 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3afuel production 3amicroalgae 3aoils 3aperfluorocarbons 3araw materials 3arice 3arice hulls 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asulfuric acid 3asurface area 3atransesterification1 aRana, Azeem1 aBasheer, Chanbasha1 aRazzaq, Shaikh Abdur1 aFarooq, Wasif1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4882-00970 tBioEnergy research.g2020 June, v. 13, no. 2 p.530-541dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4138147x1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-019-10060-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245008600213300001400299520100100313592002801314650002801342650001501370650002201385650001401407650002401421650002201445650002201467650001601489650001301505650002501518650002001543650002501563650001001588650002101598653003201619653002201651653002201673653002501695653001801720653004301738700001801781700002201799700006701821700002201888700002701910700002201937700001601959700002001975700002201995773011402017856008502131852000902216655001202225IND60542558620221119050042.0190403e20141201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054255862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2014.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatnam, Wickneswari1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2085-643410aGenetic effects of forest management practices: Global synthesis and perspectives  ap. 52-65.  aUnderstanding the genetic impacts of forest management practices is crucial for conservation and management of forest genetic resources. Forest management practices based on selective and clear cut systems followed by natural or artificial regeneration can impact population structure and mating patterns, thus gene flow and genetic diversity. Survival and productivity of both tree and non-tree species can be compromised or, possibly, enhanced. The extent of genetic impacts depend on the management system applied, stand structure as well as species’ distribution, demography, biological attributes and ecology. The impact of management practices is reviewed and synthesized for temperate, boreal and tropical forests based on experimental and simulation studies. In addition, the effects of genetically improved planting materials and establishment of large scale plantations on natural forests are examined. Recommendations are made for genetically sustainable forest management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial regeneration 3ademography 3aforest management 3agene flow 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic resources 3agenetic variation 3aplantations 3aplanting 3apopulation structure 3astand structure 3asustainable forestry 3atrees 3atropical forests 0aForest management practices 0aTimber production 0aGenetic diversity 0aPopulation structure 0aMating system 0aTemperate, boreal and tropical forests1 aRajora, Om P.1 aFinkeldey, Reiner1 aAravanopoulos, Filippos1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7194-26421 aBouvet, Jean-Marc1 aVaillancourt, René E.1 aKanashiro, Milton1 aFady, Bruno1 aTomita, Motoshi1 aVinson, Christina0 tForest ecology and management.g2014 Dec. 01, v. 333 p.52-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2014.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03944naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245013300159300001800292520217500310592002802485650003102513650003202544650002702576650000902603650003702612650001502649650001802664650001002682650001002692650001002702650001202712650002202724650001902746650006602765650000902831650002002840650002402860650001702884650002702901650001102928650001302939653001702952653001802969653002502987653001903012700002603031700001903057700001603076700001703092700001503109773015403124856007903278852000903357655001203366IND60568529020221121001733.0190318e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056852902DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-116392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDolder, C.10aQuarter- and cow-level risk factors for intramammary infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci species in Swiss dairy cows  ap. 5653-5663.  aBacteriological status, evaluation of udder symmetry, udder hygiene, and teat end scores of 92 dairy cows were assessed on 3 Swiss dairy farms in a longitudinal 1-yr study to determine risk factors for intramammary infection (IMI) with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) species. Farm visits were performed monthly including sterile quarter milk sampling and udder evaluation of all lactating cows. Milk samples were evaluated for the presence of staphylococci using selective agar plates. Species identification was performed using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Intramammary infection was defined as milk samples having ≥100 cfu per mL of milk according to culture results. Overall, 3,151 quarter samples were included in the statistical analysis. Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus xylosus, and a Staphylococcus warneri-like species were the 4 most prevalent CNS species found. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models were built to evaluate risk factors for species-specific CNS IMI. Risk factors for Staph. chromogenes IMI were presence in herd B, the period from June 2014 to August 2014 and December 2014 to February 2015, and presence of udder edema. For Staph. haemolyticus, the relevant risk factor included coinfection with Staph. xylosus coinfection with other than the above-mentioned CNS species (“others”) and the period from June 2014 to November 2014. Coinfection with Staph. haemolyticus and “others,” the periods from June 2014 to August 2014 and December 2014 to February 2015, early phase of lactation (1–60 d in milk), and belonging to herd B were significantly associated with Staph. xylosus IMI. Mid and late lactation, coinfection with Staph. xylosus, and the period September 2014 to May 2015 were identified as significant risk factors for Staph. warneri-like IMI. For Staph. chromogenes, 60.6 and 26% of the variance was observed at the quarter and cow level, respectively, whereas for the other investigated species the highest variance was observed at the sample level. The predominant species within herds differed and was most pronounced for the Staph. warneri-like species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus chromogenes 3aStaphylococcus haemolyticus 3aStaphylococcus xylosus 3aagar 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3adairy cows 3adairy farming 3aedema 3afarms 3aherds 3ahygiene 3alactating females 3alate lactation 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amilk 3amixed infection 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3aspecies identification 3audders 3avariance 0audder health 0aspecies level 0asubclinical mastitis 0aminor pathogen1 avan den Borne, B.H.P.1 aTraversari, J.1 aThomann, A.1 aPerreten, V.1 aBodmer, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 July, v. 100, no. 7 p.5653-5663dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-116393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02847naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245013600169300001600305520151500321592002801836650001101864650001601875650004001891650003001931650001201961650001101973650001401984650001301998650001202011650002002023650001202043700002102055700002302076700002002099700002102119700003002140700002402170773010502194856008202299990002302381852000902404655001202413IND60097717320221118002726.0141104e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009771732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejcb.2011.09.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHausott, Barbara10aLeupeptin enhances cell surface localization of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 in adult sensory neurons by increased recycling  ap. 129-138.  aFibroblast growth factors (FGFs) act as trophic factors during development and regeneration of the nervous system. FGFs mediate their responses by activation of four types of FGF receptors (FGFR1–4). FGFR1 is expressed in adult sensory neurons of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and overexpression of FGFR1 enhances FGF-2-induced elongative axon growth in vitro. Ligand-induced activation of FGFR1 is followed by endocytosis and rapid lysosomal degradation. We previously reported that the lysosomal inhibitor leupeptin prevents degradation of FGFR1 and promotes FGF-2-induced elongative axon growth of DRG neurons overexpressing FGFR1. Therefore, we analyzed the effects of leupeptin on intracellular sorting of FGFR1 in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and DRG neurons. Leupeptin increased colocalization of FGFR1 with lysosomes. Furthermore, leupeptin enhanced the cell surface localization of FGFR1 by increased receptor recycling and this effect was abolished by the recycling inhibitor monensin. In addition, a lysine mutant of FGFR1, which is preferentially recycled back to the cell surface, promoted elongative axon growth of DRG neurons similar to leupeptin. In contrast, the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin had no effect on surface localization of FGFR1, inhibited axon growth of DRG neurons and abolished the effects of leupeptin on receptor recycling. Together, our results strongly imply that increased recycling of FGFR1 promotes axon elongation, but not axonal branching, of adult DRG neurons in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aendocytosis 3afibroblast growth factor receptor 1 3afibroblast growth factors 3aganglia 3alysine 3alysosomes 3amonensin 3amutants 3asensory neurons 3asorting1 aVallant, Natalie1 aHochfilzer, Margit1 aMangger, Stefan1 aIrschick, Regina1 aHaugsten, Ellen Margrethe1 aKlimaschewski, Lars0 tEuropean journal of cell biology.g2012 Feb., v. 91, no. 2 p.129-138dElsevier GmbHx0171-93357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2011.09.0093Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245006200178300001800240520182400258592002802082650002502110650001302135650001402148650001502162650002502177650001202202650001902214650002702233650001302260650001502273650001702288650003202305650002402337650001302361650001102374650000902385650001502394650001402409650001502423650001202438650002102450650001402471650002002485650001802505650001502523653001502538653001402553653002502567653001202592653001902604700001602623700002002639700002002659773012102679856008602800852000902886655001202895IND60675083720221121163212.0210428e20191219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067508372DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2018.14880032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Ana Cristina10aScenedesmus obliquus in poultry wastewater bioremediation  ap. 3735-3744.  aWastewater biological treatment with microalgae can be an effective technology, removing nutrients and other contaminants while reducing chemical oxygen demand. This can be particularly interesting for the meat producing industry which produces large volumes of wastewater from the slaughtering of animals and cleaning of their facilities. The main purpose of this research was the treatment of poultry wastewater using Scenedesmus obliquus in an economical and environmentally sustainable way. Two wastewaters were collected from a Portuguese poultry slaughterhouse (poultry raw – PR and poultry flocculated – PF) and the bioremediation was evaluated. The performance of microalga biomass growth and biochemical composition were assessed for two illumination sources (fluorescent vs LEDs). S. obliquus achieved positive results when grown in highly contaminated agro-industrial wastewater from the poultry industry, independently of the light source. The wastewater bioremediation revealed results higher than 97% for both ammonium and phosphate removal efficiency, for a cultivation time of 13 days. The saponifiable matter obtained from the biomass of the microalga cultures was, on average, 11% and 27% (m/mₐₗgₐ) with PR and PF wastewater, respectively. In opposition, higher sugar content was obtained from microalgae biomass grown in PR wastewater (average 34% m/mₐₗgₐ) in comparison to PF wastewater (average 23% m/mₐₗgₐ), independently of the illumination source. Therefore, biomass obtained with PR wastewater will be more appropriate as a raw material for bioethanol/biohydrogen production (higher sugar content) while biomass produced in PF wastewater will have a similar potential as feedstock for both biodiesel and bioethanol/biohydrogen production (similar lipid and sugar content).  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus obliquus 3aammonium 3abiodiesel 3abioethanol 3abiological treatment 3abiomass 3abioremediation 3achemical oxygen demand 3acleaning 3afeedstocks 3afluorescence 3agas production (biological) 3ahydrogen production 3alighting 3alipids 3ameat 3amicroalgae 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3apoultry 3apoultry industry 3aslaughter 3aslaughterhouses 3asugar content 3awastewater 0aWastewater 0amicroalga 0aScenedesmus obliquus 0apoultry 0abioremediation1 aBarata, Ana1 aBatista, Ana P.1 aGouveia, Luisa,0 tEnvironmental technology.g2019 Dec. 19, v. 40, no. 28 p.3735-3744dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12281x1479-487X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2018.14880033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245011800209520111700327592002801444650001401472650001101486650002001497650003101517650001501548650002101563653001901584653002201603653001001625653001101635653002001646653003401666773011301700856008601813852000901899655001201908IND60790572320221118150153.0220929e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079057232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1337052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitra, Subrata1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1391-010213aAn exploratory study of sustainability and firm performance for Indian manufacturing small and medium enterprises  aIn this paper, an exploratory study of the drivers of sustainability, sustainable environmental and social practices, and firm performance for Indian manufacturing SMEs is presented. Exploratory/confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling have been employed for data analysis. Some of the major findings of the study are as follows. The leadership and ethical orientation of owners/managers and employees has a strong positive impact on sustainable waste management and human resource management (HRM) practices, environmental benefits and firm performance. A positive association has been found between sustainable HRM practices and waste management. Although no direct relationship has been found between sustainable HRM practices and firm performance, sustainable HRM practices have an indirect positive impact on firm performance through the mediating role of environmental benefits. Further, the effects of moderating variables on the structural relationships have been explored. The study highlights the managerial implications and concludes with possible directions for future research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3aethics 3afactor analysis 3ahuman resources management 3aleadership 3awaste management 0aSustainability 0aManufacturing SME 0aIndia 0aSurvey 0aFactor analysis 0aStructural equation modelling0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 371 p.133705-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.1337053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010900171300001300280520065200293592002800945650002500973650001700998650001501015650001901030650001401049650001301063650001601076650003501092650001401127650002101141700002601162700002001188700001901208773010101227856008401328961001301412852000901425655001201434IND60084043420221121085254.0141101e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008404342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.resmic.2012.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, Kerry K.10aRe-sequencing of a virulent strain of Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168 reveals potential virulence factors  ap. 6-11.  aIn vitro passage of Campylobacter jejuni strains results in phenotypic changes and a general loss of virulence, as is the case with the genome-sequenced strain C. jejuni NCTC11168.

Despite these differences, many of the regulated genes encode effector proteins or proteins involved in the synthesis of secondary metabolites (SM), both of which can contribute to pathogenicity. Fusarium verticillioides is both an endophyte and a pathogen of maize and can grow as a saprophyte on dead plant material. During growth on live maize plants, the fungus can synthesize a number of toxic SM, including fumonisins, fusarins, and fusaric acid, that can contaminate kernels and kernel-based food and feed. In this study, the role of F. verticillioides SGE1 in pathogenicity and secondary metabolism was examined by gene deletion analysis and transcriptomics. SGE1 is not required for vegetative growth or conidiation but is required for wild-type pathogenicity and affects synthesis of multiple SM, including fumonisins and fusarins. Induced expression of SGE1 enhanced or reduced expression of hundreds of genes, including numerous putative effector genes that could contribute to growth in planta; genes encoding cell surface proteins; gene clusters required for synthesis of fusarins, bikaverin, and an unknown metabolite; as well as the gene encoding the fumonisin cluster transcriptional activator. Together, our results indicate that SGE1 has a role in global regulation of transcription in F. verticillioides that impacts but is not absolutely required for secondary metabolism and pathogenicity on maize.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium verticillioides 3aconidiation 3acorn 3aendophytes 3afumonisins 3afungi 3afusaric acid 3afusarins 3agene deletion 3alifestyle 3amultigene family 3apathogens 3aprotein synthesis 3asaprophytes 3asecondary metabolites 3aseeds 3asurface proteins 3atoxicity 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics 3avegetative growth 3avirulence1 aBusman, Mark1 aProctor, Robert H.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2014 Aug., v. 27, no. 8 p.809-823dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-09-13-0281-R3Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03587naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245014300167520206600310592002802376650001602404650001202420650001702432650001502449650001202464650001402476650002302490650001702513650000902530650001202539650001202551650001402563650001002577650001802587650001002605650001702615653002602632653001502658653003702673653001802710653001302728700002002741700001702761700001302778700001902791700002902810700001602839773010802855856008502963852000903048655001203057IND60736418920221122042930.0211003e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073641892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Vincent10aWaste tyre char-catalysed in-situ deoxygenation of volatile vapours and production of hydrogen-rich syngas during the pyrolysis of lignite  aThis paper examined the catalytic performance of tyre char, a waste-derived product on the catalytic pyrolysis of lignite at 600-900 °C, upon the use of different gas environment (i.e. argon versus steam) and different catalyst to lignite mass ratio. All the resultant products (solid, gas and liquid) and spent catalysts have been characterised intensively to elucidate the specific catalytic role of tyre char and the respective mechanisms. As has been confirmed, the tyre char rich in zinc sulphide is a strong Lewis acid that is able to catalyse the upgrading of lignite volatiles via decarbonylation and steam-reforming of the volatile vapours. The former reaction mainly refers to the conversion of aldehydes to alkanes, whilst the latter one is preferentially implemented for the long-chain heavy hydrocarbons that are prone to deposit on the tyre char surface. The presence of steam in the pyrolysis gas environment promotes the steam-reforming of volatiles and steam-gasification of char, but also enhances the acidity strength for the formation of intermediate SO active site that is responsible for the adsorption of O-bearing volatiles and the dissociation of steam. The enhancement of Lewis acid on catalyst surface is also highly sensitive to the mass of catalyst and the extent of its exposure to the O-bearing species including steam and volatile vapours. The use of large quantity such as three times larger than the lignite are essential for the tyre char to remain highly active upon cyclic usage. An extra activation is also essential after each use. In addition, it is confirmed that the catalytic effect of tyre char is profound for the upgrading of volatile vapours released from fast heating of lignite above 700 °C. At 800 °C, the resultant synthesis gas from lignite is also highly rich in H₂ and CO than that reported from the upgraded biomass volatiles based on the use of tyre char. A larger H₂ yield was also confirmed for the lignites tested here, due to the abundance of long-chain heavy hydrocarbons derived from them.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis acids 3aacidity 3aactive sites 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adissociation 3aheat 3alignite 3aliquids 3apyrolysis 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3atires 3azinc sulfide 0aWaste scrap tyre char 0aLewis acid 0aLignite volatile vapor upgrading 0aDeoxygenation 0aHydrogen1 aZhou, Qiao Qiao1 aQian, Binbin1 aShi, Lei1 aHosseini, Tara1 aAlhesan, Jameel Aljariri1 aZhang, Lian0 tFuel processing technology.g2021 July, v. 218 p.106872-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12445x0378-38207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2021.1068723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008300167300001600250500001900266520180900285592002802094596006302122650001302185650001302198650001702211650003502228650001102263650001402274650001202288650001602300650004302316650002902359650002702388700001902415700001802434700001402452700001702466700001702483700005802500773013002558856008302688852000902771655001202780IND60707090320221119084214.0200814e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070709032DNAL7 a10.1007/s11626-020-00471-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Seong Jae10aScreening of integrins localized on the surface of human epidermal melanocytes  ap. 435-443.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn vivo, melanocytes occupy three-dimensional (3D) space. Nevertheless, most experiments involving melanocytes are performed in a two-dimensional microenvironment, resulting in difficulty obtaining accurate results. Therefore, it is necessary to construct an artificial in vivo–like 3D microenvironment. Here, as a step towards engineering a precisely defined acellular 3D microenvironment supporting the maintenance of human epidermal melanocytes (HEMs), we examined the types of integrin heterodimers that are expressed transcriptionally, translationally, and functionally in HEMs. Real-time PCR and fluorescent immunoassay analyses were used to elucidate the expression of integrin α and β subunit genes at the transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. The functionality of the presumed integrin heterodimers was confirmed using attachment and antibody-inhibition assays. Among the genes encoding 12 integrin subunits (α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄, α₅, α₆, α₇, αV, β₁, β₃, β₅, and β₈) showing significantly higher transcription levels, proteins translated from the integrin α₂, α₄, α₅, β₁, β₃, and β₅ subunit genes were detected on the surface of HEMs. These HEMs showed significantly increased adhesion to collagen I, fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin, and functional blockade of the integrin α₂ subunits significantly inhibited adhesion to collagen I, fibronectin, and laminin. In addition, there was no significant inhibition of the adhesion to fibronectin or vitronectin in HEMs with functional blockade of the integrin α₄, α₅, or αV subunits. These results indicate that the active integrin α₂β₁ heterodimer and the inactive integrin α₄, α₅, αV, β₃, and β₅ subunits are all localized on the surface of HEMs.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016R1D1A3B03933811cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aadhesion 3acollagen 3afibronectins 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahumans 3aintegrins 3alaminin 3amelanocytes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aKim, Min Seong1 aPark, Hye Jin1 aLee, Hyun1 aYun, Jung Im1 aLim, Hye Won1 aLee, Seung Tae1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8952-38810 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2020 June, v. 56, no. 6 p.435-443dSpringer USwJournal:jnl50084x1071-26907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11626-020-00471-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01531naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011500161300001800276520036900294592002800663650002600691650002300717650002700740650002300767650002300790650001900813650001300832650002400845650001400869700002300883700002300906700002300929773013300952856007501085852000901160655001201169IND60658880620221122063203.0190826e20110404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065888062DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc05334a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamura, Yuichi10aEnhancement of sortase A-mediated protein ligation by inducing a β-hairpin structure around the ligation site  ap. 4742-4744.  aA Staphylococcus aureus transpeptidase, sortase A (SrtA), catalyzes selective peptide/protein ligations that have been applied to cell imaging and protein engineering, while the ligations do not proceed to completion due to their reversibility.

However, the exact mechanism by which H. pylori induces the liver damage is largely unknown. We used cultured mouse primary hepatocytes as an in vitro model to investigate different aspects of liver physiology and pathology. In this study, we show that primary hepatocytes are able to assemble actin-based cytoskeletal structures called podosomes at the ventral plasma membrane. These structures are positive for podosome markers such as cortactin, vinculin and integrins and comprise proteolytic potential. Infection with the pathogen H. pylori further stimulates the formation of podosomes in primary hepatocytes. The use of pharmacological inhibitors reveals that this response is mediated, at least in part, by TGFβ, a cytokine known to regulate podosome formation in endothelial cells. Similar results are obtained with the hepatoma cell line Huh7. Podosome formation is associated with increased hepatocyte degrading capacities but also with reduced cell motility. Therefore, podosome assembly translates into hepatocyte malfunction. Our study supports the hypothesis that hepatocytes can also assemble podosomes under pathological conditions in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicobacter pylori 3acell movement 3acytokines 3acytoskeleton 3aendothelial cells 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatoma 3aintegrins 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amice 3amodels 3apathogens 3aphysiology 3aplasma membrane 3aproteolysis 3atransforming growth factor beta1 aVaron, Christine1 aSpuul, Pirjo1 aAsencio, Corinne1 aMégraud, Francis,1 aGénot, Elisabeth0 tEuropean journal of cell biology.g2012 Mar., v. 91, no. 3 p.161-170dElsevier GmbHx0171-93357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2011.11.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03289naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245023000170520165300400592002802053650002702081650000902108650001602117650001202133650001702145650002202162650001402184650001002198650002202208650001502230650001002245650002302255650002102278650001402299650001202313650001402325650001102339650001502350650001302365650002902378653000802407653002302415653001802438653000902456700001402465700001602479700001702495700001902512773011902531856008802650852000902738655001202747IND60743669920221119012925.0220110e20211110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074366992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1487752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Caiyun10aMaternal exposure to sodium ρ-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate during pregnancy and lactation disrupts intestinal barrier and may cause obstacles to the nutrient transport and metabolism in F0 and F1 generations of mice  aSodium ρ-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS), a novel kind of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compound, has been widely detected in the environment.

Here, female C57BL/6 mice were treated OBS at dietary levels of 0.0 mg/L (CON), 0.5 mg/L (OBS-L) and 5.0 mg/L (OBS-H) during the gestation and lactation periods. The results demonstrated that OBS treatment not only induced significant changes in the mucus secretion and ionic transport, but also disrupted the expression of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) in the intestine of F0 and F1 generations. Additionally, OBS exposure altered bile acids metabolism and affected the transcriptional levels of critical genes involved in bile acids synthesis, signaling transfer, transportation and apical uptake. Together, all these results indicated that OBS exposure was perceived as a major stress by the intestinal epithelium that strongly affected the intestinal barrier function (including mucus, CFTR, AMPs, inflammation), and ultimately led to imbalance in the metabolism of bile acids (BAs). Moreover, we found that maternal OBS exposure had a more obvious toxicity effect on the male offspring in this experiment. Taken together, maternal OBS exposure during pregnancy and lactation had the intestinal and metabolism toxic effects on the dams and offspring, indicating that effects of maternal exposure on the toxicity of offspring could not be ignored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abile 3aenvironment 3afemales 3ainflammation 3aintestinal mucosa 3alactation 3amales 3amaternal exposure 3ametabolism 3amucus 3anutrient transport 3aperfluorocarbons 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3asecretion 3asodium 3asulfonates 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 0aOBS 0aIntestinal barrier 0aF1 generation 0aMice1 aWeng, You1 aTu, Wenqing1 aJin, Cuiyuan1 aJin, Yuanxiang0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Nov. 10, v. 794 p.148775-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1487753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015300171300001600324520093400340592002801274650001501302650001501317650001101332650002401343650001301367650002601380650001901406650001901425650003301444650001601477653002601493653001501519653002901534653002601563700001901589700001801608700002201626773009001648856009001738852000901828655001201837IND60607460420221121050500.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060746042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Marine10aInfluence of embedded gap and overlap fiber placement defects on the microstructure and shear and compression properties of carbon–epoxy laminates  ap. 198-207.  aThis paper presents results from an experimental study of the influence of embedded defects created during automated fiber tape placement, on the mechanical properties of carbon/epoxy composites. Two stacking sequences have been examined, [(−45°/+45°)3/−45°] and [90°4/0°3/90°4], in which gaps and overlaps have been introduced during fiber placement. These materials have been cured in an autoclave either with or without a caul plate, then analyzed by ultrasonic C-scan. The microstructures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. In-plane shear tests were performed on the ±45° laminates and showed that the use of a caul plate does not affect mechanical behavior of plies in the embedded defect region. Compression tests were performed on 0°/90° laminates and in this case the presence of a caul plate is critical during polymerization as it prevents thickness variations and allows defects to heal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoclaves 3aautomation 3acarbon 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3amechanical properties 3amicrostructure 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aultrasonics 0aStructural composites 0aB.

MD simulations are synergetic with experiments, relying on measurements to calibrate their parameters and probing “what if scenarios” for systems that are difficult to investigate experimentally. However, in certain systems, such as nanofluidics, the results of experiments and MD simulations differ by several orders of magnitude. This discrepancy may be attributed to the spatiotemporal scales and structural information accessible by experiments and simulations. Furthermore, MD simulations rely on parameters that are often calibrated semiempirically, while the effects of their computational implementation on their predictive capabilities have only been sporadically probed. In this work, we show that experimental and MD investigations can be consolidated through a rigorous uncertainty quantification framework. We employ a Bayesian probabilistic framework for large scale MD simulations of graphitic nanostructures in aqueous environments. We assess the uncertainties in the MD predictions for quantities of interest regarding wetting behavior and hydrophobicity. We focus on three representative systems: water wetting of graphene, the aggregation of fullerenes in aqueous solution, and the water transport across carbon nanotubes. We demonstrate that the dominant mode of calibrating MD potentials in nanoscale fluid mechanics, through single values of water contact angle on graphene, leads to large uncertainties and fallible quantitative predictions. We demonstrate that the use of additional experimental data reduces uncertainty, improves the predictive accuracy of MD models, and consolidates the results of experiments and simulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acarbon nanotubes 3acontact angle 3afullerene 3agraphene 3ahydrophobicity 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aprediction 3auncertainty1 aPapadimitriou, Costas1 aKoumoutsakos, Petros0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2013 Nov. 27, v. 117, no. 47 p.14808-14816dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjp40847133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245012300170300001600293520072700309592002801036650001701064650001801081650002401099650003301123650002001156650001901176650001501195653001601210653002001226653004001246653004301286700001601329700005201345700001401397700001401411700001801425773009001443856009001533852000901623655001201632IND60607460520221121050424.0180904e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060746052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compositesa.2015.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Juan10aReduced graphene oxide deposited carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites for electromagnetic interference shielding  ap. 141-150.  aReduced graphene oxide deposited carbon fiber (rGO-CF) was prepared by introducing GO onto CF surface through electrophoretic deposition method, following by reducing the GO sheets on CF with NaBH4 solution.

However, a less evident issue is the effect of climate change and drought on remnants of native forests. The objective of this work was to understand the geographic variations in resistance to drought of the Mediterranean sclerophyllous forests of central Chile. These forests have been historically reduced and fragmented and in recent years were subjected to the most prolonged drought occurred between 2010 and 2017. Using data from the MODIS satellite sensor, temporal trends in the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were quantified. We related these trends with different environmental variables to understand the effects of geographical variation and forest type as indicators of resistance to drought. We observed a significant direct effect of drought, attributable to the reduced precipitation in central Chile, and a significantly reduced NDVI in near one-third of the region forests (browning). However, NDVI and therefore forest productivity were more stable in some mesic sites such as ravine bottoms, but not on south-facing slopes. This suggests that under a regime of reduced precipitations, a greater available soil humidity would be a more important factor than the fact of receiving less solar radiation. Finally, the highest degree of browning was observed in semi-arid sclerophyllous forest dominated by species tolerant to drought. Our findings emphasize the need to consider topographic site conditions to adequately assess forest productivity and vulnerability where local wet conditions could provide drought refuges. This recent drought may be analogous to forecasted warmer and drier climate conditions with more frequent and severe droughts, so our results may serve as a general framework for climate-smart decisions in highly threatened forest restoration and conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adeforestation 3adrought 3aforest restoration 3ageographical variation 3ahumidity 3alandscapes 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3asatellites 3asclerophyll forests 3asoil 3asolar radiation 3atopography 3aChile 0aResilience 0aResistance 0aRemote sensing 0aNDVI1 aLara, Antonio1 aAltamirano, Adison1 aDi Bella, Carlos1 aGonzález Cangas, Mauro E.,1 aJulio Camarero, Jesus0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Aug., v. 115 p.106401-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1064013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01907naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245005600172300001400228500001900242520097900261592002801240650003301268650001501301650001301316650001301329700002101342700002301363773012501386856008501511852000901596655001201605IND60684276020221118153939.0200705e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068427602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2020.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGregor, Deborah10aIndigenous environmental justice and sustainability  ap. 35-40.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA distinct formulation of Indigenous environmental justice (IEJ) is required in order to address the challenges of the ecological crisis as well the various forms of violence and injustices experienced specifically by Indigenous peoples.

This approach calls into question the legitimacy and applicability of global and nationstate political and legal mechanisms, as these same states and international governing bodies continue to fail Indigenous peoples around the world.

When CPD- induced salmon sperm DNA was used as a substrate, high CPD-photolyase activities were observed in the enzyme fraction prepared from whole spinach leaf extracts, but not from chloroplast extracts.

While the persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity of some groups of contaminants have been well-studied in seabirds since the 1970s, there is less known about polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). With increased vessel traffic, and potential oil and gas development in the Arctic region, there is a need to understand existing PAC exposure in biota against which to compare potential effects of anticipated increases of PACs in the marine region. Thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) and northern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) collected in the Baffin Bay – Davis Strait region during the International Polar Year (IPY; 2007–08), and during a recent Strategic Environmental Assessment (2018; SEA) were examined for hepatic PAC concentrations. We found that fulmars generally had higher concentrations of PACs than the murres, but murres and fulmars sampled in 2007/08 had higher concentrations of most groups of PACs compared to birds from 2018. The one exception to this pattern was that the sum of the alkylated congeners of the heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing a sulfur atom (dibenzothiophene; ΣAHET) was significantly higher in murres in the more recent sampling period (2018) as compared to 2007/08. ΣAHETs likely reflect recent exposure to more refined petroleum products associated with small boats, such as diesel, gasoline and motor oil. This work highlights the need for longitudinal studies on PAC concentrations in biota for us to gain a better understanding of how Arctic biota are exposed to this group of contaminants, and the potential deleterious effects associated with PACs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFulmarus glacialis 3aUria lomvia 3aaromatic compounds 3abioaccumulation 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental assessment 3agasoline 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apollution 3aseabirds 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3atraffic 3aArctic region 3aCanada 0aOil-related contaminants 0aBenchmark levels 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aMarine birds1 aThomas, Philippe J.1 aBraune, Birgit M.1 aPauli, Bruce1 aTomy, Gregg1 aIdowu, Ifeoluwa1 aO'Hara, Patrick1 aMallory, Mark L.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 20, v. 826 p.154088-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1540883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02728naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009300162300001800255520142600273592002801699650001701727650002201744650001201766650001101778650001901789650001601808650001201824650002601836650003101862650001301893650000701906650001501913650001301928650002001941650001601961700002101977700002401998700001902022700002602041773012502067856008102192852000902273655001202282IND60535859420170613000000.0160805e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053585942DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b026022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatti, Marco10aIsotope Fractionation Associated with the Photochemical Dechlorination of Chloroanilines  ap. 9797-9806.  aIsotope fractionation associated with the photochemical transformation of organic contaminants is not well understood and can arise not only from bond cleavage reactions but also from photophysical processes. In this work, we investigated the photolytic dechlorination of 2-Cl- and 3-Cl-aniline to aminophenols to obtain insights into the impact of the substituent position on the apparent ¹³C and ¹⁵N kinetic isotope effects (AKIEs). Laboratory experiments were performed in aerated aqueous solutions at an irradiation wavelength of 254 nm over the pH range 2.0 to 7.0 in the absence and presence of Cs⁺ used as an excited singlet state quencher. Photolysis of 2-Cl-anilinium cations exhibits normal C and inverse N isotope fractionation, while neutral 2-Cl-aniline species shows inverse C and normal N isotope fractionation. In contrast, the photolysis of 3-Cl-aniline was almost insensitive to C isotope composition and the moderate N isotope fractionation points to rate-limiting photophysical processes. ¹³C- and ¹⁵N-AKIE-values of 2-Cl-aniline decreased in the presence of Cs⁺, whereas those for 3-Cl-aniline were not systematically affected by Cs⁺. Our current and previous work illustrates that photolytic dechlorinations of 2-Cl-, 3-Cl-, and 4-Cl-aniline isomers are each accompanied by distinctly different and highly variable C and N isotope fractionation due to spin selective isotope effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminophenols 3aaqueous solutions 3acations 3acesium 3adechlorination 3airradiation 3aisomers 3aisotope fractionation 3alaboratory experimentation 3anitrogen 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aspinning 3astable isotopes 3awavelengths1 aCanonica, Silvio1 aMcNeill, Kristopher1 aBolotin, Jakov1 aHofstetter, Thomas B.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 49, no. 16 p.9797-9806dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b026023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04091naa a2200877 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245011700183300001400300520150600314592002801820650000801848650002201856650001001878650001301888650002301901650001701924650001401941650001301955650001501968650001001983650002401993650001002017650001002027650001602037650002302053650001402076650001402090650003002104650002402134650001202158650001602170650001802186650001102204650004502215650001202260650002402272650002702296650002302323650001102346650001302357650002402370650003602394650003502430650004202465650000902507650004202516650004602558650001202604650002602616650005202642650006302694650002502757651000902782651001602791651003102807653001402838653001502852653001202867653002102879653001402900653001302914700001302927700001602940700001602956700001702972773011802989856008503107852000903192655001203201IND50060415420221117173009.0190401e20130218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006041542DNAL7 a232070182pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.11.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoe, W.D.13aAn atypical genotype of Toxoplasma gondii as a cause of mortality in Hector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori)  ap. 67-74.  aHector's dolphins (Cephalorhynchus hectori) are a small endangered coastal species that are endemic to New Zealand. Anthropogenic factors, particularly accidental capture in fishing nets, are believed to be the biggest threat to survival of this species. The role of infectious disease as a cause of mortality has not previously been well investigated. This study investigates Toxoplasma gondii infection in Hector's dolphins, finding that 7 of 28 (25%) dolphins examined died due to disseminated toxoplasmosis, including 2 of 3 Maui's dolphins, a critically endangered sub-species. A further 10 dolphins had one or more tissues that were positive for the presence of T. gondii DNA using PCR. Genotyping revealed that 7 of 8 successfully amplified isolates were an atypical Type II genotype. Fatal cases had necrotising and haemorrhagic lesions in the lung (n=7), lymph nodes (n=6), liver (n=4) and adrenals (n=3). Tachyzoites and tissue cysts were present in other organs including the brain (n=5), heart (n=1), stomach (n=1) and uterus (n=1) with minimal associated inflammatory response. One dolphin had a marked suppurative metritis in the presence of numerous intra-epithelial tachyzoites. No dolphins had underlying morbillivirus infection. This study provides the first evidence that infectious agents could be important in the population decline of this species, and highlights the need for further research into the route of entry of T. gondii organisms into the marine environment worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aToxoplasma gondii 3abrain 3adolphins 3aendangered species 3aendometritis 3afish nets 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aheart 3ainfectious diseases 3aliver 3alungs 3alymph nodes 3amarine environment 3amortality 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation dynamics 3astomach 3atachyzoites 3atoxoplasmosis 3auterus 2aAdrenal Glandsxparasitologyxpathology. 2aAnimals 2aBrainxparasitology 2aDolphinsxparasitology 2aEndangered Species 2aFemale 2aGenotype 2aHeartxparasitology 2aLiverxparasitologyxpathology. 2aLungxparasitologyxpathology. 2aLymph Nodesxparasitologyxpathology. 2aMale 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aSeasons 2aStomachxparasitology 2aToxoplasmaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aToxoplasmosis, Animalxmortalityxparasitologyxpathology. 2aUterusxparasitology 3aMaui 3aNew Zealand 0aNew Zealandxepidemiology. 0aProtozoan 0aToxoplasma 0aOocysts 0aHector's dolphin 0aMortality 0aCetacean1 aHowe, L.1 aBaker, E.J.1 aBurrows, L.1 aHunter, S.A.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2013 Feb. 18, v. 192, no. 1-3 p.67-74dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2012.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001400155245014700169300001600316520106000332592002801392650002701420650002101447650002501468650001301493650003201506650002001538650002201558650001301580650001501593650001401608650001301622650002001635650001601655650001401671650001101685650001401696650002501710650002501735650001201760650001601772653004001788653002401828653001101852653001701863653001401880700001401894700001701908700001401925700001501939700001601954773009901970856009002069852000902159655001202168IND60532355520221118013542.0190318e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053235552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Jue10aEffects of magnetic treatment on growth and immune and digestive enzyme activity in the juvenile sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus (Selenka)  ap. 437-441.  aRecently, magnetic biological technology is gradually applied in aquaculture for enhancing growth, speed of breeding, reducing seedling mortality, increasing immunity and breeding production. We evaluated the effect of duration of exposure and intensity of a stationary magnetic field on growth and immune and digestive enzyme levels in juvenile sea cucumbers, Apostichopus japonicus. Sea cucumbers were exposed to a 0.5T, 0.3T, or 0.1T field for 0.5 or 1h every 3d. The weight gain rate (WGR) and specific growth rate (SGR), coelomic levels of lysozyme (LZM), superoxide dismutase (SOD), acid phosphatase (ACP), and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and intestinal tissue levels of pepsin, trypsin, amylase, and lipase were significantly higher after 60d in the group exposed to 0.5T for 1h when compared with the control group (P<0.05). Thus, magnetic treatment had a positive effect on growth, immune status, and digestive enzyme levels in juvenile sea cucumbers. Our results provide insight into the utility of magnetic treatment during sea cucumber culture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApostichopus japonicus 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3abreeding 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aenzyme activity 3aexposure duration 3aimmunity 3aintestines 3ajuveniles 3alysozyme 3amagnetic fields 3amariculture 3amortality 3apepsin 3aseedlings 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atrypsin 3aweight gain 0aSea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus 0aMagnetic treatments 0aGrowth 0aImmunization 0aDigestion1 aZhao, Wen1 aChi, Jianwei1 aLiu, Gang1 aYu, Xurong1 aBian, Lujun0 tAquaculture.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 435 p.437-441dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03382naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245015300171520176700324592002802091650001302119650001302132650001202145650001302157650001602170650001402186650001302200650001002213650001202223650002002235650001502255650000702270650001302277650002302290650001402313650001602327650001202343650002402355650001602379650001902395651002102414653001402435653001802449653001602467653000902483653002102492653001202513700001902525700002002544700002602564773013302590856008402723852000902807655001202816IND60684276220221118153950.0200509e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068427622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2020.1002042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBıyıklı, Merve10aEffect of different Sous Vide cooking temperature-time combinations on the physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory properties of turkey cutlet  aIn this study, the spiced turkey breast meat (hereafter called as turkey cutlet), which is consumed at a low level in Turkey but the nutritional level of which is much closer to the red meat and which is far healthier than the meat, was cooked by means of the Sous Vide technique having many advantages. The effects of different Sous Vide cooking temperature-time combinations (65, 70, 75 °C x 20, 40, 60 min) on the physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory properties of the turkey cutlet samples were determined in detail. Based on the experimental analyzes, as the cooking temperature increased from 65 °C to 75 °C, the values of cooking yield, moisture, a*, and elasticity decreased; but, the values of cooking loss, thiobarbituric acid, pH, hardness, toughness, cohesiveness, and chewiness showed increased. At the same temperatures, as the cooking time increased from 20 to 60 min; the values of the cooking yield, moisture, L*, a*, toughness, adhesiveness and elasticity values decreased but the cooking loss, fat, pH, hardness, propensity, adhesiveness, and chewiness increased monotonously. It was observed in the microbiological analyses that the count of total mesophilic aerobic bacteria decreased approximately by 2 log CFU/g for the samples prepared in each cooking temperature-time combinations. Only in the samples cooked at 65 °C for 20 min, the presence of Listeria spp. was detected. Sensory properties of sous-vide cooked turkey cutlets such as color, brightness, fibery appearance, taste-whole impression, sensorial texture were more preferable at low temperature-time combinations. Considering all the results, it was suggested that longer cooking time at low temperature would be outstanding for product quality and safety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria 3aadhesion 3aaerobes 3abacteria 3abreast meat 3achewiness 3acohesion 3acolor 3acooking 3acooking quality 3agastronomy 3apH 3ared meat 3asensory properties 3asous vide 3atemperature 3atexture 3athiobarbituric acid 3aturkey meat 3awater hardness 3aTurkey (country) 0aSous Vide 0aTurkey cutlet 0aTemperature 0aTime 0aSensory analysis 0aTexture1 aAkoğlu, Aylin1 aKurhan, Şebnem1 aAkoğlu, İlker Turan0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2020 July, v. 20 p.100204-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2020.1002043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02513naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245009400174300001400268520137900282592002801661650001101689650001601700650003501716650002001751650001701771650001901788651002201807653001701829653001501846653002801861653001901889653000801908700002101916773010501937856008802042852000902130655001202139IND60608079320221116184029.0180831e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060807932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKordi, Moataz N.12aA spatial approach to improve coastal bioregion management of the north western Australia  ap. 26-42.  aCoral reefs are a major coastal feature of the Kimberley bioregion in north-western Australia; however, very little is known about the habitats and substrates of the reefs in this coast. Previous studies have been conducted on a broad scale, but no geomorphological, surface substrate and habitat maps of the reefs have been produced. Such maps would provide researchers and coastal zone managers with significant information and estimations of reef growth and productivity. The primary aim of this study was to obtain detailed information on reefs in the Kimberley bioregion. This study used remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), as well as multiple other data sources, to map reef geomorphic zones and the associated key habitats and substrate types of shallow nearshore reefs. Despite the macrotidal regimes and the turbid waters of the study area, remote sensing was effectively used to identify the dominant habitats and substrate types of eight reef platforms. This study provides long-term quantitative assessments of the main habitats and substrates of these reefs and offers a better understanding of reefs in the Kimberly bioregion. It is also a source of valuable information for the marine park and coastal managers investigating the coral reefs that have been targeted for conservation, but have not yet been the subject of regional analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acoral reefs 3ageographic information systems 3aland management 3amarine parks 3aremote sensing 3aWestern Australia 0aReef mapping 0aMacrotidal 0aCoastal zone management 0aRemote sensing 0aGIS1 aO'Leary, Michael0 tOcean & coastal management.g2016 July, v. 127 p.26-42dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245011600127300001400243500001400257520119300271592002801464650001801492650001901510650001001529650001001539650001401549650002401563650001001587650001901597650001401616650002001630650002101650650001501671650002101686650001501707650001101722651001001733653001101743653001501754653001301769653001001782700002101792700001701813700001701830773014401847852000901991655001202000IND60716808020221119021103.0201107e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071680802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, C.10aPerformance of summer mungbean [Vigna radiata (L.)

The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design with four levels of irrigation in main plot and four levels of boron in sub-plot. Experimental results revealed that both irrigation and boron treatments influenced crop growth characters, yield attributes and seed yield of mungbean. Significant interaction effects were observed among the treatments. Maximum seed yield of 879 kg/ha was obtained with three irrigations at branching, pre-flowering and pod filling stages and was almost 38% higher over the rainfed treatment. Among the various levels of boron, foliar spray of 0.2% borax at flowering stage consistently influenced all the growth and yield parameters. A treatment combination involving three irrigations at branching, pre-flowering and pod filling stages along with a foliar spray of 0.2% borax at flowering stage recorded maximum mungbean seed yield (898 kg/ha) which was comparatively higher over other treatment combinations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVigna radiata 3aalluvial soils 3aborax 3aboron 3abranching 3aexperimental design 3afarms 3afilling period 3aflowering 3afoliar spraying 3airrigation rates 3amung beans 3asandy loam soils 3aseed yield 3asummer 3aIndia 0aGrowth 0aIrrigation 0aMungbean 0aYield1 aBandopadhyay, P.1 aAlipatra, A.1 aBanerjee, H.0 tJournal of food legumes.g2012 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.37-40dIndian Society of Pulses Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2075x0976-24347nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001800165245010800183300001600291500001500307520102900322592002801351650002301379650000901402650001701411650002401428650002201452650002501474650001201499650004301511650000901554650005801563650007301621650001101694650000901705650004201714650002201756653001701778700002401795700001801819700001801837700001701855773012301872852000901995856008202004655001202086IND4376794320221123023826.0181127e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437679432DNAL7 a159275002pmid7 a10.1016/j.jfms.2005.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAroch, Itamar10aCentral diabetes insipidus in five cats: Clinical presentation, diagnosis and oral desmopressin therapy  ap. 333-339.  a2019-12-05  aFive cases of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) in domestic shorthair cats are described. All cats were under 3 years of age at the onset of clinical signs, and outdoor or outdoor/indoor cats, in which a prior trauma was either present or possible. The history included polydipsia and polyuria, and physical examination abnormalities included urinary bladder distention and dehydration. All cats had hyposthenuria with a urine specific gravity between 1.003 and 1.006. The diagnosis was confirmed by an observed inability to concentrate urine during a water deprivation test or compatible serum osmolality, followed by an increase in urine concentration after desmopressin administration. All cats in this report were treated successfully with oral desmopressin. The dose (25–50 μg q8–12h) and the response to therapy were variable. Oral desmopressin administration may serve as an effective alternative route for cat owners who find the conjunctival or nasal application of the solution an inconvenient mode of therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes insipidus 3acats 3acase studies 3aoral administration 3adisease diagnosis 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aCat Diseasesxdiagnosisxdrug therapy. 2aCats 2aDeamino Arginine Vasopressinxadministration & dosage 2aDiabetes Insipidus, Neurogenicxdiagnosisxdrug therapyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aRenal Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aTreatment Outcome 0adrug therapy1 aMazaki-Tovi, Michal1 aShemesh, Oved1 aSarfaty, Havi1 aSegev, Gilad0 tJournal of feline medicine and surgery.g, v. 7, no. 6 p.333-339dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl58542x1098-612X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2005.03.0083Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02526naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010300165300001800268520127700286592002801563650002201591650001201613650001901625650000901644650001501653650002001668650001001688650001601698650001901714650002901733650001401762650001201776650002101788650001701809650001801826650001901844650001101863700002301874773010201897856008401999852000902083655001202092IND60098834020221121200519.0141105e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009883402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Lufei10aCombustion of poultry-derived fuel in a coal-fired pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed combustor  ap. 2138-2144.  aPoultry farming generates large quantities of waste. The current practice is to spread this waste onto farmland as fertilizer. However, as the factory farms for poultry grow both in numbers and size, the amount of waste generated has increased significantly in recent years. In consequence, excessive application of poultry wastes on farmland is resulting in more and more nutrients entering the surface water. One of the options being considered is the use of poultry waste as power plant fuel. Since poultry-derived fuel (PDF) is biomass, its co-firing will have the added advantage of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power generation. To evaluate the combustion characteristics of co-firing PDF with coal, combustion tests were conducted in CanmetENERGY's pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed combustor (CFBC). The goal of this program was to verify that PDF can be co-fired with coal and, more importantly, that emissions from the combustion process are not adversely affected by the presence of PDF in the feed. The test results were very promising and support the idea that co-firing in an existing CFBC boiler firing coal is a good way to utilize PDF, resolving a potential waste disposal problem while reducing the amount of CO₂ released from the boiler.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abiomass 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3afarming systems 3afarms 3afertilizers 3afluidized beds 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3anutrients 3apoultry 3apower generation 3apower plants 3asurface water 3awaste disposal 3awastes1 aAnthony, Edward J.0 tFuel processing technology.g2011 Nov., v. 92, no. 11 p.2138-2144dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04277naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245015500209500001900364520243100383592002802814650001402842650002002856650001202876650002902888650001802917650001302935650001702948650001502965650002002980650001603000650001303016653002503029653001403054653001303068653001803081653002403099700005903123700002603182700002403208700002103232700006403253700006603317700006003383700006003443700005903503773010203562856008603664852000903750655001203759IND60696697420221118015538.0200804e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069669742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHájek, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5201-268210aTowards the pan-European bioindication system: Assessing and testing updated hydrological indicator values for vascular plants and bryophytes in mires  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aBioindication systems based on the occurrence of plant species are widely used in vegetation science, palaeoecology, community ecology, geographical modelling and global change biology. Although the existing systems are mostly regional, the development of large-scale vegetation databases calls for the establishment of a pan-European indication system. Here we present the first step towards this goal, by assessing indicator values for soil moisture and water table depth in European mires and associated grasslands. For each vascular plant and bryophyte species occurring in 24,091 vegetation-plot records of European mires, we developed an updated system of Ellenberg-like Ecological Indicator Values (EIVs) at the scale of 1–12 (species optimum) including ecological valences – minimum value (drought intolerance), maximum value (flooding tolerance) and range of values (tolerance), using both statistical and expert-based approaches for species co-occurrence data. Spearman correlation coefficients, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Akaike weights were used to assess the performance of the updated EIVs against measured soil moisture and water table in two Central-European datasets, and against the proportion of aquatic mollusc species in a European-scale dataset. The updated EIVs performed well in all cases, having stronger correlations with directly measured water table and the combined proportion of aquatic and wetland molluscs than the original EIVs. The original EIVs, however, performed better with soil moisture. In the Central-European datasets, the use of minimum values (drought intolerances) of the updated EIVs weighted by species covers and/or tolerances led to the highest correlations with water table in all cases. This improvement of the indication potential on the regional scale is mainly related to the inclusion of bryophytes into the updated EIVs. Our data show that the updated EIVs are beneficial not only when used in the cross-regional or pan-European datasets, but also when water table rather than soil moisture is to be indicated in the regional-scale data, as it occurs frequently in bryological, zoological and protistological research. Overall, this study demonstrates how EIVs can be updated by including previously omitted taxa of vascular plants and bryophytes and adding ecological valences to reflect accurate conditions of natural habitats at the continental scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBryophyta 3adata collection 3adrought 3aenvironmental indicators 3aglobal change 3amolluscs 3apaleoecology 3asoil water 3avascular plants 3awater table 3awetlands 0aEcological tolerance 0aEllenberg 0aPeatland 0aSoil moisture 0aVegetation database1 aDítě, Daniel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5251-99101 aHorsáková, Veronika1 aMikulášková, Eva1 aPeterka, Tomáš1 aNavrátilová, Jana,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6355-72341 aJiménez-Alfaro, Borja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6601-95971 aHájková, Petra1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1434-78251 aTichý, Lubomír1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8400-77411 aHorsák, Michal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2742-27400 tEcological indicators.g2020 Sept., v. 116 p.106527-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100004200150245010200192300001600294520164400310592002801954650001701982650001401999650001502013650001302028650002102041650002602062650000902088650001602097650001002113650001302123650002402136650001602160650001802176650001402194650001902208650000902227650001902236650001902255653001902274653001702293653002302310653002602333653002102359653002602380700003302406700002802439700002302467700003302490700002302523700003102546700002602577700005302603700002302656700002902679700002802708700003302736700002102769700003002790773014302820856008502963852000903048655001203057IND60684276420221118153958.0200330e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068427642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2020.02.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, Bruna Jacomel Favoreto de Souza10aSelective isolation of agents of chromoblastomycosis from insect-associated environmental sources  ap. 194-204.  aChromoblastomycosis is a neglected disease characterized by cutaneous, subcutaneous or disseminated lesions. It is considered an occupational infectious disease that affects mostly rural workers exposed to contaminated soil and vegetal matter. Lesions mostly arise after a traumatic inoculation of herpotrichiellaceous fungi from the Chaetothyriales order. However, the environmental niche of the agents of the disease remains obscure. Its association with insects has been predicted in a few studies. Therefore, the present work aimed to analyze if social insects, specifically ants, bees, and termites, provide a suitable habitat for the fungi concerned. The mineral oil flotation method was used to isolate the microorganisms. Nine isolates were recovered and phylogenetic analysis identified two strains as potential agents of chromoblastomycosis, i.e., Fonsecaea pedrosoi CMRP 3076, obtained from a termite nest (n = 1) and Rhinocladiella similis CMRP 3079 from an ant exoskeleton (n = 1). In addition, we also identified Fonsecaea brasiliensis CMRP 3445 from termites (n = 1), Exophiala xenobiotica CMRP 3077 from ant exoskeleton (n = 1), Cyphellophoraceae CMRP 3103 from bees (n = 1), Cladosporium sp. CMRP 3119 from bees (n = 1), Hawksworthiomyces sp. CMRP 3102 from termites (n = 1), and Cryptendoxyla sp. from termites (n = 2). The environmental isolate of F. pedrosoi CMRP 3076 was tested in two animal models, Tenebrio molitor and Wistar rat, for its pathogenic potential with fungal retention in T. molitor tissue. In the Wistar rat, the cells resembling muriform cells were observed 30 d after inoculation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladosporium 3aExophiala 3aFormicidae 3aIsoptera 3aTenebrio molitor 3aanimal disease models 3abees 3aexoskeleton 3afungi 3ahabitats 3ainfectious diseases 3amineral oil 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3apolluted soils 3arats 3asocial insects 3atermite mounds 0aAtta laevigata 0aBlack yeasts 0aFonsecaea pedrosoi 0aMelipona flavolineata 0aNasutitermes sp. 0aScaptotrigona postica1 aVoidaleski, Morgana Ferreira1 aGomes, Renata Rodrigues1 aFornari, Gheniffer1 aSoares, Jade Mariane Barbosa1 aBombassaro, Amanda1 aSchneider, Gabriela Xavier1 aSoley, Bruna da Silva1 ade Azevedo, Conceição de Maria Pedrozo e Silva1 aMenezes, Cristiano1 aMoreno, Leandro Ferreira1 aAttili-Angelis, Derlene1 aKlisiowicz, Débora do Rocio1 aHoog, Sybren de,1 aVicente, Vânia Aparecida0 tFungal biology.g2020 Mar.,  Apr., v. 124, no. 3-4 p.194-204dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2020.02.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245015400173300001600327520146300343592002801806650001901834650001201853650002201865650001001887650001801897650001201915650001301927650001301940651001001953653002801963653001201991653001602003653001902019653001302038653001802051700001702069700001702086700001402103773009902117856009002216852000902306655001202315IND60532355820221118013429.0190318e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053235582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Guo-Hua14aThe combined effects of food supply and larval density on survival, growth and metamorphosis of Chinese tiger frog (Hoplobatrachus rugulosa) tadpoles  ap. 398-402.  aThe Chinese tiger frog Hoplobatrachus rugulosa is one of the most common frog species sold in China as food. To examine the combined effects of food supply and larval density on survival, growth and metamorphosis of H. rugulosa tadpoles, we conducted a two (food supplies)×three (larval densities) factorial experiment. Tadpoles in one feeding treatment always had free access to food, and tadpoles in the other feeding treatment had free access to food for 24h every 4days. Larval densities were set at 6, 12 and 18 tadpoles per liter water, respectively. We found that: (1) metamorphosis rate decreased as larval density increased, but it did not differ between the two feeding treatments; (2) metamorphosis time and its variance increased as density increased, and insufficient food supply resulted in longer and more variable larval periods; (3) high larval density led to the production of smaller froglets, so did insufficient food supply; and (4) larval density has a more pronounced role in affecting metamorphosis rate, and food supply has a more pronounced role in affecting metamorphosis time. Based on our results, the most important thing that should be done by farmers is to avoid the rearing of H. rugulosa tadpoles under food×density conditions greatly reducing larval survival, growth and developmental synchrony rather than to rear them under conditions substantially increasing the costs due to the increased payments for food and space.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHoplobatrachus 3afarmers 3afood availability 3afrogs 3ametamorphosis 3arearing 3atadpoles 3avariance 3aChina 0aHoplobatrachus rugulosa 0aTadpole 0aFood supply 0aLarval density 0aSurvival 0aMetamorphosis1 aLin, Zhi-Hua1 aFan, Xiao-Li1 aJi, Xiang0 tAquaculture.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 435 p.398-402dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.10.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245012300162300001800285520133500303592002801638650000801666650001701674650000901691650001101700650002701711650001501738650001501753650001301768650001601781650000901797700001701806700001401823773012501837856008101962852000902043655001202052IND60535859720221119162734.0160805e20150818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053585972DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.5b027872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBi, Chenyang10aFate and Transport of Phthalates in Indoor Environments and the Influence of Temperature: A Case Study in a Test House  ap. 9674-9681.  aA case study in a test house was conducted to investigate the fate and transport of benzyl butyl phthalate (BBzP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in residential indoor environments and the influence of temperature. Total airborne concentrations of phthalates were sensitive to indoor temperatures, and their steady-state concentration levels increased by a factor of 3 with an increase in temperature from 21 to 30 °C. Strong sorption of phthalates was observed on interior surfaces, including dust, dish plates, windows, mirrors, fabric cloth, and wood. Equilibrium partitioning coefficients for phthalates adsorbed to these surfaces were determined, and their values decreased with increasing temperature. For impervious surfaces, dimensionless partitioning coefficients were calculated and found to be comparable to reported values of the octanol-air partition coefficients of phthalates, Kₒₐ, suggesting that an organic film may develop on these surfaces. In addition, sorption kinetics was studied experimentally, and the equilibration time scale for impervious surfaces was found to be faster than that of fabric cloth. Finally, using an indoor fate model to interpret the measurement results, there was good agreement between model predictions and the observed indoor air concentrations of BBzP in the test house.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acase studies 3adust 3amodels 3apartition coefficients 3aphthalates 3aprediction 3asorption 3atemperature 3awood1 aLiang, Yirui1 aXu, Ying,0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2015 Aug. 18, v. 49, no. 16 p.9674-9681dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.5b027873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04028naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100005600180245015400236300001800390500002000408506007600428520165600504592002802160596007502188596005602263506003702319650001802356650001502374650002402389650001302413650002302426650001402449650001502463650001302478650000902491650001002500650001602510650002302526650001302549650002102562650002102583650002102604650001802625650003002643650002502673650002602698650002902724650001402753650001302767650002102780650001202801650001902813650001802832650002202850650002802872650002202900650003202922700001902954700001902973700001402992700001303006700001803019700001603037773014703053856007303200852000903273655001203282IND60636425120221207103103.0190408e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063642512DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.95822doi7 aPMC65938312pmcid7 a306280862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Seidu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9515-115610aEffects of pulverized oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) on diarrhea incidence, growth performance, immunity, and microbial composition in piglets  ap. 3616-3627.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Pleurotus ostreatus mushroom (POM) is an edible mushroom with rich nutritional components and vital pharmacological properties. The present study comprised 100 cross‐bred piglets, weaned at 28 days old, who were randomly assigned to four POM diets with five replicates per diet and five piglets per pen. RESULTS: POM supplementation (P < 0.05) decreased the incidence of diarrhea, and also increased the average daily feed intake and average daily gain of pigs. Fecal acetate, butyrate and propionate increased with the addition of POM. Interleukin‐2, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, tumor necrosis factor‐α and immunoglobulin A increased (P < 0.05) with the addition of POM. The 16S rDNA sequencing results showed that the Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the dominant microbial strains in the fecal samples, irrespective of POM supplementation. Shannon diversity, whole tree phylogenetic diversity, observed species and Chao1 analysis exhibited significant variation in species richness across the treatments. Principal coordinates analysis showed a significant (P < 0.1) increase in the microbial communities amongst all of the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that the supplementation of POM in the diet of piglets might increase feed consumption, gut microbial composition and diversity, as well as short‐chain fatty acids synthesis, consequently preventing the occurrence of diarrhea and increasing the growth of piglets. © 2019 The Authors.

Given the known detrimental noise impacts on the marine environment, managing underwater noise pollution has been identified as a pressing conservation issue. Therefore, baseline underwater noise measurements from a range of vessels in the Hauraki Gulf Marine Park, a large and ecologically significant embayment (1.2 M Ha) in New Zealand, were undertaken and used to estimate detection distances for which potential auditory masking in dolphins, fish and crustaceans is expected. Sound pressure measurements and octave analyses of recorded vessel noise revealed considerable energy below 5 kHz at source levels of approximately 30 dB above the highest threshold in dolphins and fish. Measureable increases to background sound levels below 5 kHz of at least 54 ± 5.8 dB (mean ± SD) at the source were estimated to have a masking effect inside a minimum 90 m within the busy inner Gulf and 1240 m within the quieter outer Gulf. Impact zones increased considerably for dolphins with assumed detection thresholds equal to ambient sound pressures. These findings show that the sound emanating from both recreational and commercial vessels within the Hauraki Gulf will be significantly raising background sound levels and is likely to have a wide-ranging masking impact on marine life. These findings have significance for embayments worldwide for which vessel activity is a common feature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3adolphins 3aenergy 3afish 3amarine environment 3amarine parks 3anoise pollution 3ashipping 3aNew Zealand 0aAcoustics 0aAnthropogenic sound 0aBoats 0aDolphin 0aCrustacean 0aFish 0aHauraki Gulf 0aNoise 0aSound pollution 0aVessels1 aJeffs, Andrew G.1 aWang, Ding1 aRadford, Craig A.0 tOcean & coastal management.g2016 July, v. 127 p.63-73dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2016.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002500150245015300175300001600328520076000344592002801104650001201132650001201144650001701156650002501173650001801198650001401216650001901230650001501249650001101264650001101275650001101286650002301297650001401320650001701334650002101351650002001372651001101392700003601403700002601439700002101465700002501486700003101511700001901542700002701561773009001588856008601678852000901764655001201773IND4458816220221120225643.0141111e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445881622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.03.1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMedina, Aline Lisboa10aAraçá (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) fruit extracts with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities and antiproliferative effect on human cancer cells  ap. 916-922.  aAraçá or strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) is an attractive tasty small fruit native to temperate zones of Brazil.

Urdbean followed by two non-host crops mustard and wheat had reduced 54% of nematode population. When urdbean was grown as intercrop with sorghum, nematode population decreased by 26% and subsequently wheat reduced the nematode population further by 64.9%. In the cropping sequence of maize followed by potato and urdbean, although the nematode population reduced with growing of maize in the beginning but population further increased when potato was grown during rabi. Testing of two cropping sequences urdbean+sorghum-wheat and urdbean-wheat+mustard in comparison to cropping sequence urdbean-chickpea in larger plots reduced the root-knot nematode population by 82.6 and 75.6% at the end of one year sequence as compared to 137.1% increase in population when urdbean was followed by chickpea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne javanica 3achickpeas 3acorn 3acropping sequence 3aintercropping 3apopulation 3apotatoes 3aroot-knot nematodes 3atesting 3awet season 3awheat 0aNematode 0aRoot-knot nematode 0aUrdbean1 aSingh, K.K.0 tJournal of food legumes.g2012 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.58-60dIndian Society of Pulses Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2075x0976-24347nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245011900165520157100284592002801855650002101883650001601904650001501920650001401935650001301949651001001962653001001972653002101982653002402003653003802027700001502065700002002080700001602100700001602116700001602132700001602148700001502164773011902179856008802298852000902386655001202395IND60768774320221117221444.0220606e20220620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076877432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1540942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKe, Ben10aThree-dimensional building morphology impacts on PM2.5 distribution in urban landscape settings in Zhejiang, China  aThree-dimensional (3D) urban landscape patterns and building morphology are crucial for urban planning and essential for urban landscape functions. In this study, fixed and mobile monitoring sites were used to determine the spatial distribution of PM₂.₅ concentrations in Hangzhou. Six 3D metrics were selected to analyze the response of PM₂.₅ pollution to landscape patterns and building morphology, while their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts' metrics were also analyzed to contrast the differences. A variance partitioning analysis (VPA) was performed to measure the combined and relative contribution of 3D and 2D metrics to the changes in PM₂.₅ concentrations. The results showed that: (1) on the 3D scale, forming a building pattern with a combination of different building heights can eliminate the accumulation of PM₂.₅; (2) on the 2D scale, fragmentation and decentralization of landscapes and building patches alleviate PM₂.₅ pollution; and (3) 3D building morphology indicators have the highest explanatory power (40.94%) for the changes of PM₂.₅ concentrations. It turns out that the explanatory power of 3D metrics for PM₂.₅ concentrations changes is much greater than that of 2D metrics. In addition, when compared to building morphology indicators from a single dimension, the combination of 2D and 3D metrics is better able to reflect urban PM₂.₅ pollution. The results of this study expand our understanding of how PM₂.₅ pollution responds to 2D and 3D metrics and provide useful information for urban planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecentralization 3aenvironment 3alandscapes 3apollution 3avariance 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aLandscape metric 0aBuilding morphology 0aMulti-dimensional characteristics1 aHu, Wenhao1 aHuang, Dongming1 aZhang, Jing1 aLin, Xintao1 aLi, Cuihuan1 aJin, Xinjie1 aChen, Jian0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 20, v. 826 p.154094-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1540943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02542naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011400167500001400281520122400295592002801519650000801547650000801555650002301563650002401586650001901610650001401629650001701643650001601660650002301676650002501699650001801724650001301742653001901755653001101774653002101785653002401806700001401830700001401844700001701858700001601875773010001891856008401991852000902075655001202084IND60719818920221122045205.0201223e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071981892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1005562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Mingyang10aImpact of temperature on survival and spinal development of golden pompano Trachinotus ovatus (Linnaeus 1758)  aNAL-light  aThis study investigated the impact of water temperature on survival, skeletal development and the molecular mechanism of temperature-induced spinal deformity in golden pompano Trachinotus ovatus. Fish larvae were subjected to three temperatures (26, 29 and 32 °C) from 0 to 32 days post-hatch (DPH). On 32 DPH, significant higher growth rate was observed in fish cultured at 32 °C, but the survival rate and RNA/DNA ratio were significantly lower than fish culture at 26 and 29 °C. At the end of this study, the highest spinal deformity rate was observed in fish cultured at 32 °C. The ambient temperature should be kept at or below 29 °C for the best growth performance. The levels of BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, Sox9, twist and vimentin were significantly regulated by ambient temperature. High temperature may up-regulate the expression of a series of signaling factors during bone formation and down-regulate the expression of sox9, affecting the production of ECM components, thereby affecting the development of bone and cartilage and leading to spinal deformities. The results from the present study provide new evidence to understand the molecular mechanism of spinal deformities and bone development golden pompano.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRNA 3aTrachinotus ovatus 3aambient temperature 3abone formation 3acartilage 3afish culture 3afish larvae 3agrowth performance 3askeletal development 3asurvival rate 3avimentin 0aLarvae rearing 0aGrowth 0aSpinal deformity 0aMolecular mechanism1 aLuo, Ming1 aYang, Rui1 aQin, Jian G.1 aMa, Zhenhua0 tAquaculture reports.g2020 Nov., v. 18 p.100556-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1005563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245007800129300001400207500001400221520181100235592002802046650001402074650001602088650000902104650001302113650001402126650001402140650001502154650001202169650001702181650001002198650001902208650001202227650002502239650001402264650002002278650001602298650001902314650001302333650001102346650001302357650001302370650000902383651001002392653002302402653001102425653001202436653003502448700001602483700002002499700001802519700001902537700001702556773014402573852000902717655001202726IND60716808620221119020744.0201107e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071680862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurushottam,10aAssessment of technological inputs for major pulses in Bundelkhand region  ap. 61-65.  aNAL-light  aTo assess the availability of technological inputs by pulse growing farmers, three villages namely Baank, Bannki and Bilhari in Hamirpur district of Bundelkhand region in Uttar Pradesh were selected as the study area. Data was collected from 180 farmers belonging to small, marginal and large category (as per land holding) in these villages during 2008–09. The respondents were categorized into four groups so as to study the extent of availability of recommended inputs. Analysis of data revealed that the overall input availability with farmers was lowest in pigeonpea followed by chickpea and lentil. The basic inputs for chickpea such as seed cum fertilizers drill, tractor/cultivator, labour and bullocks as per recommended practice were available only with 46, 43, 36 and 33% of farmers, respectively. Other important inputs namely, pheromone traps, sprayer, Rhizobium, fungicide, insecticide and improved variety were not available with 95, 95, 93, 91, 76 and 70% of farmers, respectively growing chickpea. Even none had inputs like Trichoderma for soil treatment and sulphur for crop nutrition. For lentil, the recommended inputs such as seed cum fertilizers drill, bullocks and tractor/cultivator were available with 66, 68 and 58% of farmers, respectively. However, the inputs like sprayer, insecticide, fungicide, pump set and improved variety were not available with the majority of lentil growers (91, 86, 86, 76 and 75% of farmers, respectively). Similarly the requisite inputs for pigeonpea viz., pheromone traps, sprayer, insecticide, phosphatic fertilizer, improved variety and nitrogenous fertilizers were not available with 95, 91, 85, 76, 75 and 70% of farmers, respectively. None of these farmers had ridge maker or applied zinc, Trichoderma and Rhizobium for pigeonpea cultivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizobium 3aTrichoderma 3aarea 3abullocks 3achickpeas 3acultivars 3afungicides 3agrowers 3ainsecticides 3alabor 3aland ownership 3alentils 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrition 3apheromone traps 3apigeon peas 3asoil treatment 3asprayers 3asulfur 3atractors 3avillages 3azinc 3aIndia 0aBundelkhand region 0aPulses 0aRainfed 0aTechnological input assessment1 aSingh, S.K.1 aChaudhary, R.G.1 aKumar, Rajesh1 aPraharaj, C.S.1 aKrishna, Bal0 tJournal of food legumes.g2012 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.61-65dIndian Society of Pulses Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2075x0976-24347nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245010600207500001900313520143600332592002801768650002601796650002001822650001501842650002401857650001301881650001201894650002601906650001901932650001901951650002501970651001201995653002402007653002302031653002102054653001802075653001502093700002002108700001702128773011502145856008602260852000902346655001202355IND60696698020221118015459.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069669802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Quan T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5361-404710aEstimating nitrogen removal services of eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in Mobile Bay, Alabama  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEastern oysters have been acknowledged for their important contribution to human well-being by providing goods and services including nitrogen removal from water bodies. In this study, we integrated daily environmental data (2008–2016) and filtration rate model parameter uncertainty to estimate nitrogen removal from denitrification and nitrogen burial services provided by the current extent of oyster (Crassostrea virginica) reefs in Mobile Bay, Alabama. Oyster landing data (2008–2016) in the Bay were also used to estimate nitrogen removal through oyster harvest. A replacement cost method using an engineering solution from wastewater treatment plants was implemented to quantify the economic benefit of the nitrogen removal. The estimated total nitrogen removal services provided by oyster reefs in Mobile Bay was 34,911 ± 5,032 kg N yr⁻¹ (mean ± 1sd), in which 22,095 ± 3,305 kg N yr⁻¹ from denitrification, 11,047 ± 1,652 kg N yr⁻¹ from burial of nitrogen into sediments and 1,769 ± 876 kg N yr⁻¹ by oyster harvest. The mean economic benefit was $76,455 ± 11,020 yr⁻¹ which was estimated as $73.2 ± 11.5 ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹. This method could be used for any time period to estimate the nitrogen removal service in Mobile Bay. With proper modification of model parameters, this method could also be used elsewhere to estimate nitrogen removal services provided by oysters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea virginica 3adenitrification 3afiltration 3afinancial economics 3anitrogen 3aoysters 3aparameter uncertainty 3asocial welfare 3atotal nitrogen 3awastewater treatment 3aAlabama 0aNitrogen regulation 0aEcosystem services 0aReplacement cost 0aEaster Oyster 0aMobile Bay1 aIrwin, Elise R.1 aZhang, Yaoqi0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106541-dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245006100171300001800232520135200250592002801602650001201630650001501642650001601657650001701673650002101690650001301711650001101724700001801735700001901753700002701772773010201799856008401901852000901985655001201994IND60098834820221121200548.0141105e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009883482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.07.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Río, Daniel10aCombined PFPD–FID assessment of sulfur in liquid fuels  ap. 2278-2284.  aA pulsed flame photometric detector (PFPD) was calibrated using standard sulfur compounds present in gasoline and diesel fuels, in combination with a flame ionization detector (FID). Gasoline range standards were added to a hydrocarbon mixture simulating gasoline, with individual sulfur concentrations from 3 to 80ppm. Diesel range standards were added to a low sulfur commercial diesel fuel, with sulfur concentrations from 10 to 100ppm. In gasoline, both the chromatographic areas calculated with the linearized signal (data points elevated to a given power), and reported by the instrument were regressioned with the sulfur mass concentrations. In both cases the areas were normalized with the FID areas to reduce deviations. Results were better when using the linearized signal. Only the normalized areas calculated with the linearized signal can be used in the case of the diesel, due to significant peak coelution. Individual calibration coefficients were calculated for each standard, but overall coefficients can be used safely in each of the boiling ranges. The compliance of regulations about sulfur was verified in commercial fuels and the different sulfur compounds were inspected. The simultaneous combined FID-PFPD use allows adding the sulfur to the conventional analysis of liquid fuels (e.g. composition, simulated distillation).  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling 3acompliance 3adiesel fuel 3adistillation 3aflame ionization 3agasoline 3asulfur1 aRey, Marilín1 aSedran, Ulises1 ade la Puente, Gabriela0 tFuel processing technology.g2011 Dec., v. 92, no. 12 p.2278-2284dElsevier B.V.x0378-38207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fuproc.2011.07.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245006700217500001900284520076900303592002801072650002301100650001101123650001001134650001701144650001701161650001301178650002701191651002201218651001301240651001001253653002601263653001301289653001901302653001201321653002301333653001801356700001401374700002001388700002201408773010101430856008601531852000901617655001201626IND60696698120221118015521.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069669812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Ortegón, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0282-499X10aLeucism in the European sardine Sardina pilchardus (Clupeidae)  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe first case of abnormal leucism in the European Sardine or Pilchard Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792) is reported.

Species identification was verified using both morphological and genetic criteria. Despite the relative abundance of sardines along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, the current specimen represents the first known case of leucism in S. pilchardus. The observed colour aberration may have been caused by either heavy metal pollutants and/or a high level of endogamy in this heavily exploited local sardine stock.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSardina pilchardus 3acoasts 3acolor 3aheavy metals 3apigmentation 3asardines 3aspecies identification 3aIberian Peninsula 3aPortugal 3aSpain 0aAbnormal pigmentation 0aAlbinism 0aAtlantic coast 0aSardine 0aPopulation decline 0aGulf of Cadiz1 aDrake, P.1 aQuigley, D.T.G.1 aCuesta, José A.,0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106544-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011500171500001900286520183300305592002802138650002502166650002602191650001302217650001602230650002402246650001702270650002602287650001502313650001402328650001302342650001502355650001502370653002202385653000902407653000802416700001802424700006002442773011902502856008802621852000902709655001202718IND60693986720221119104822.0210121e20200825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069398672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1388652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallego, Sara10aTagging the vanA gene in wastewater microbial communities for cell sorting and taxonomy of vanA carrying cells  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFailure to understand the microbial ecology driving the proliferation of antibiotic resistance in the environment prevents us from developing strategies to limit the spread of antibiotic resistant infectious disease.

Significantly higher percentage tagging of cells was detected in vanA carrying pure cultures and wastewater samples spiked with vanA carrying cells as compared to vanA negative Gram positive strains and non-spiked wastewater samples respectively. qPCR analysis targeting vanZ, a regulating gene in the vanA cluster, showed its relative abundance was significantly greater in Enterococcus faecium ATCC 700221-spiked and positively sorted samples compared to the E. faecium spiked and negatively sorted samples. Phylogenetic analysis was then performed. Although further efforts are needed to overcome technical problems, we have, for the first time, demonstrated sorting bacterial-cells carrying antibiotic resistance genes from wastewater samples through a TSA-FISH-FACS protocol and provided insight into the microbial ecology of vancomycin resistant bacteria. Future potential applications using this approach will include the separation of members of an environmental microbial community (cultured and hard-to-culture) to allow for metagenomics on single cells or, in the case of clumping, targeting a smaller portion of the community with a priori knowledge that the target gene is present.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecium 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3aenvironment 3ainfectious diseases 3ametagenomics 3amicrobial communities 3amicroscopy 3aphylogeny 3ataxonomy 3avancomycin 3awastewater 0aTwo-pass TSA-FISH 0aFACs 0aVRE1 aBarkay, Tamar1 aFahrenfeld, N.L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2690-01220 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Aug. 25, v. 732 p.138865-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1388653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03914naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245011900170300001600289520248000305592002802785650002202813650002302835650001102858650001702869650001202886650001002898650002502908650002202933650001302955650002202968650004402990650002303034650001303057650002303070650002003093650002003113650002003133650002303153650001503176651001103191700002403202700002103226700002303247773009303270856004803363852000903411655001203420IND50063588520221121232759.0130325e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006358852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-012-9718-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCusack, Daniela F.10aLong-term effects of agriculture on soil carbon pools and carbon chemistry along a Hawaiian environmental gradient  ap. 229-243.  aIntensive agriculture has the potential to reduce soil carbon stocks in the years following initial cultivation, although the magnitude and direction of the effect can vary with ecosystem and management factors. Agriculture can also shift the carbon chemistry of soils via changes in crop plant chemistry, decomposition, and/or soil amendments [e.g. black carbon (i.e. charcoal)]. It is possible that soil carbon levels can recover if intensive cultivation ends, but the factors driving the extent and quality of this recovery are not well understood. Here, we examined soil carbon pool sizes and carbon chemistry >200 years after intensive cultivation by early Hawaiians. We compared soils from an extensive pre-European-contact agricultural field system with reference sites under similar modern management. Sites were selected along a climate and soil weathering gradient to investigate interactions between historic land use and ecosystem properties, such as soil mineralogy, in driving soil carbon recovery. Soil carbon content was measured from 0 to 30 cm depth, and carbon chemistry was assessed using ¹³C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Overall, we found significantly lower soil carbon stocks in pre-contact agricultural sites compared to reference sites. Radiocarbon dating of bulk soil carbon showed a trend toward older carbon in agricultural versus reference soils, suggesting decreased retention of newer C in agricultural sites. Radiocarbon dating of macroscopic charcoal particles from under agricultural field walls indicated that there were black carbon inputs concurrent with pre-contact agricultural activity. Nonetheless, black carbon and carbonyl carbon levels were lower in agricultural versus reference soils, suggesting decreased retention of specific carbon groups in cultivated sites. Proteins were the only biomolecule higher in abundance in agricultural versus reference sites. Finally, there was an interacting effect of soil mineralogy and historic land use on soil carbon stocks. Whereas short range order (SRO) minerals were positively associated with total soil carbon overall, differences in soil carbon between agricultural and reference soils were largest in soils with high concentrations of SRO minerals. Our results indicate that the negative effect of agriculture on soil carbon stocks can be long-lived, may be associated with persistent changes in soil carbon chemistry, and can vary with soil mineralogical properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aclimate 3acrops 3aecosystem management 3aintensive farming 3aland use 3along term effects 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplant biochemistry 3aproteins 3aradiocarbon dating 3asoil amendments 3asoil mineralogy 3asoil weathering 3atemporal variation 3aweathering 3aHawaii1 aChadwick, Oliver A.1 aLadefoged, Thegn1 aVitousek, Peter M.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2013 Mar., v. 112, no. 1-3 p.229-243dSpringer-Verlagx0168-25637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-012-9718-z  aDNAL 7aarticle01490naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245009700170500002000267520041100287592002800698650002600726650001300752650001900765650001400784650002800798650002300826651002100849651001000870700002000880700005400900773011600954856007301070852000901143655001201152IND60636425520221118044349.0190408e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063642552DNAL7 a10.1111/njb.021812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosha, Jaẏanta Kumāra,10aSinopodophyllum hexandrum subsp. ramgopalii subsp. nov.

To determine the response of bamboo physiology to elevated O₃ levels, three-year-old dwarf bamboo (Indocalamus decorus) clones were exposed to three O₃ concentrations (Ambient-AA, 21.3 to 80.9 ppb in the daytime; −AA+70, 70 ppb O₃ above ambient; −AA+140, 140 ppb O₃ above ambient) in open-top chambers for one growing season in Beijing, China. Gas exchange, biomass, growth, soluble sugar, and starch contents were examined at the end of the experiment. Our findings indicated that: (1) elevated O₃ treatments decreased the photosynthesis rate, total biomass, and bud numbers but increased individual bud biomass and rhizome bud to rhizome biomass ratio. The most severe reduction was observed in new rhizome biomass (35.9% reduction in AA+70 and 57.2% reduction in AA+140), whereas individual bud biomass increased by 50% and 75% in the AA+70 and AA+140 groups compared with AA, respectively; (2) the starch contents in the rhizome decreased by 28.4%, whereas soluble sugar increased by 38.1% in the AA+140 rhizome buds compared to AA; (3) only the culm numbers of pachymorph rhizomes (clumped) decreased, whereas no changes in leptomorph rhizomes were observed. However, the mean distance between two ramets was lengthened by 49.4% and 86.5% in AA+70 and AA+140, respectively. In conclusion, Indocalamus decorus allocated more nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) from the rhizome to the buds to form stronger buds and ensure the survival of newer generations as a high priority in response to O₃ exposure. Indocalamus decorus may be conducive to escaping from disadvantaged habitats and decreasing resource competition by lengthening the distance between two ramets.  aPublisher supplied data 3abamboos 3abiomass 3aclones 3aculms 3aenvironment 3agas exchange 3agrowth retardation 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3arhizomes 3astarch 3asugars 3aChina 0aElevated O3 0aNonstructural carbohydrates 0aGrowth 0aBamboo 0aIndocalamus decorus1 aLi, Jinling1 aWang, Xiaoke1 aWang, Weifeng1 aLeung, Felix1 aLiu, Xiao1 aWang, Chao0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 June 20, v. 826 p.154096-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1540963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01105naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245006400170300001600234520020200250592002800452650001500480650002300495650001200518650002700530650001300557700002000570700002100590700001900611773010400630856004800734852000900782655001200791IND4469091220221122003053.0120531e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446909122DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-012-0222-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMikhailovskii, A.

S160-S169.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA microwave‐based process to control invasive species (seeds and adult stages) in the field prior to plant community restoration is currently under development. We investigated the effect of four microwave treatment pairings of Power × Duration (2kW4min, 4kW2min, 2kW8min, and 4kW4min) on seedling emergence of (1) an abandoned field seed bank used as a model for various plant species and (2) seeds of three species invasive in Europe: Datura stramonium (Jimson weed), Reynoutria × bohemica (Bohemian knotweed), and Solidago gigantea (Giant goldenrod). In addition, we assessed whether nontreated seeds of these three invasive species could germinate on microwave‐treated soils. As microwave soil heating usually leads to nonhomogeneous temperatures within a sample, we also assessed whether the position of seeds in the soil during microwave treatment (center vs. edges) impacted seedling emergence. Results show that the most intensive microwave treatments (2kW8min and 4kW4min), enabling the soil to reach 85°C, are highly effective in inhibiting seedling emergence of invasive species and the seed bank. The 2kW8min treatment, combining lowest power and longest exposure, is the most effective, reducing seed bank seedling emergence by 98% compared to control. The results also reveal a species‐specific response to heat, and lower microwave effectiveness on seeds located at the soil surface, which may explain the incomplete effectiveness of intensive treatments. Our results also suggest that prior microwave soil treatment does not prevent a considerable proportion of newly arrived invasive species seeds from germinating, suggesting that this method should be followed by restoration of native plant cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDatura stramonium 3aReynoutria 3aSolidago gigantea 3aadults 3aheat 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3amicrowave treatment 3amodels 3aplant communities 3aplants (botany) 3aseedling emergence 3aseeds 3asoil 3asoil heating 3asoil treatment 3atemperature 3aEurope1 aDe Wilde, Mélissa1 aYavercovski, Nicole1 aWillm, Loic1 aMesléard, François1 aBuisson, Elise0 tRestoration ecology.g2018 June, v. 26 Suppl S2 p.S160-S169dWiley Periodicals, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867104x1061-29717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.126683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04245naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010600169300001600275520215700291592002802448650002702476650001502503650001902518650001802537650002902555650001602584650002802600650002502628650002102653650002202674650001502696650001502711650002102726650001702747650001202764650003902776650002102815650003202836650001802868650001802886650000902904650001202913650002402925650003702949650001002986650003302996650001703029650002203046653001703068653001803085653002703103653002503130653002503155653002803180700006003208700002103268700005903289773014103348856008503489852000903574655001203583IND60627075520221117004030.0190128e20181118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062707552DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b046082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBains, Deepak10aDevelopment of Biological Self-Cleaning Wound-Dressing Gauze for the Treatment of Bacterial Infection  ap. 969-978.  aMicroorganisms, dirt, and other air pollutants are major problems in textiles, which can generate an unpleasant odor during their growth. Herein, we have developed some novel antibacterial benzimidazolium-based dipodal ionic liquids that act as iron chelators, and they were loaded onto the wound-dressing gauze to enhance their antimicrobial properties for biomedical applications. The metal binding affinity of the synthesized ionic liquids was evaluated by UV–visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, which reveals its selectivity toward Fe (III) ion. It is well-established that almost all bacteria require Fe (III) for survival and growth. To compete successfully for this essential nutrient, bacteria developed very efficient Fe (III) uptake mechanisms based on high-affinity Fe (III) chelators, so-called siderophores. Thus, keeping this in mind, all the prepared ionic-liquid-based iron chelators have been evaluated for their in vitro antibacterial activity against various pathogenic bacterial strains by colony forming unit (CFU) assay, and the MICs were determined by a broth microdilution method. The mechanism of action has also been explored by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which reveals the bacterial cell wall deformity and cell wall rupturing that may lead to bacteria cell death. The most potent antibacterial compound, IL-3, was also investigated for its cytotoxicity against mammalian HeLa cell line and found to be nontoxic (IC₅₀ > 100 μM). Further, the IL-3-coated wound-dressing gauze has been developed, fully characterized, and investigated against some Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, the IL-3-coated gauze was also evaluated for its hemostatic potential, and results reveal that the developed gauze shortens the time period required for blood clotting in comparison to simple dressing gauze and pledget that are commonly used in clinics. Thus, the potential antibacterial and hemostatic results exhibited by developed IL-3-coated gauze make it a useful tool that can be used in wards, ICU, and particularly, by military persons in war front areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aabsorption 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacterial infections 3abinding capacity 3ablood coagulation 3acell death 3acell walls 3achelating agents 3acytotoxicity 3afabrics 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3ahuman cell lines 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-3 3aionic liquids 3airon 3amammals 3amechanism of action 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aodors 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asiderophores 3auptake mechanisms 0aIonic liquid 0aIron chelator 0aAntibacterial activity 0aWound-dressing gauze 0aHemostatic potential 0aAtomic force microscopy1 aSingh, Gagandeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0815-02681 aNawanīta Kaura,1 aSingh, Narinder1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8794-81570 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Nov. 18, v. 7, no. 1 p.969-978dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b046083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04002naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245016500165300001200330520248900342592002802831650002602859650001102885650002202896650001402918650002502932650001202957650001902969650002102988650002303009650002203032650001503054650001203069650001003081650002703091650001403118650001403132650001403146650002003160700001603180700002003196700001603216700002203232700001803254700001903272773011303291856008303404852000903487655001203496IND60712802420221118171943.0211015e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071280242DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-020-04240-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Meng-Jie14aThe genetic variation of different developmental stages of Schistosoma japonicum: do the distribution in snails and pairing preference benefit the transmission?  ap. 360.  aBACKGROUND: Schistosoma japonicum is a waterborne parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans and in more than 40 animal species. Schistosoma japonicum shows distinct genetic differentiation among geographical populations and multiple hosts, but the genetic diversity of different developmental stages of S. japonicum from is less studied. Such studies could elucidate ecological mechanisms in disease transmission by analysing feedbacks in individual physiology and population state. METHODS: After infection using cercariae from a pool of snails shedding together (Method I) and infection using mixed equal numbers of cercariae from individually shed snails (Method II), different developmental stages of S. japonicum were genotyped with microsatellite loci, including 346 cercariae, 701 adult worms and 393 miracidia. Genetic diversity and molecular variation were calculated at different population levels. Kinships (I′) among cercariae at intra-snail and inter-snail levels were evaluated. Genetic distance (Dsw) was compared between paired and unpaired worms, and partner changing was investigated through paternity identification for miracidia. RESULTS: The cercaria clones in individual snails varied from 1 to 8 and the kinship of cercariae within individual snails was significant higher (P < 0.001) than that among different snails after deleting near-identical multi-locus genotypes (niMLGs). The allelic diversity of worms in Method I was lower (P < 0.001) than that in Method II, and allele frequency among mice in Method I was also less consistent. The parents of some miracidia were worms that were not paired when collected. The Dsw between each female of paired and unpaired males was much larger (P < 0.001) than that between the female and male in each pair. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the infected snails contained multiple miracidia clones. The aggregation of genetically similar S. japonicum miracidia in individual snails and the unbalanced distribution of miracidia among snails suggests a non-uniform genetic distribution of cercariae among snails in the field. This further influenced the genetic structure of adult worms from infections with different cercariae sampling methods. Schistosoma japonicum in mice can change paired partner, preferring to mate with genetically similar worms. These characteristics provide implications for understanding the balance in genetic diversity of S. japonicum related to the transmission of schistosomiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSchistosoma japonicum 3aadults 3aallelic variation 3acercariae 3adisease transmission 3afemales 3agene frequency 3agenetic distance 3agenetic similarity 3agenetic structure 3agenotyping 3akinship 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amiracidia 3aparasites 3apaternity 3aschistosomiasis1 aLi, Yan-Wei1 aEmery, Aidan M.1 aLi, Shi-Zhu1 aJiang, Yong-Zhong1 aDong, Hui-Fen1 aZhao, Qin-Ping0 tParasites & vectors.g2020 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.360-360dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-020-04240-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245010400159300002000263520135800283592002801641650001501669650002601684650001101710650001101721650001201732650001301744650001101757653002201768653003201790653003001822653002601852653002201878653002801900700002201928700005901950700005802009700002302067700002002090700006002110773014202170856007902312852000902391655001202400IND60756068220221121000915.0211110e20210804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075606822DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c100612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ping10aXylene Recognition in Flexible Porous Coordination Polymer by Guest-Dependent Structural Transition  ap. 52144-52151.  aXylene isomers are crucial chemical intermediates in great demand worldwide; the almost identical physicochemical properties render their current separation approach energy consuming. In this study, we utilized the soft porous coordination polymer (PCP)’s isomer-specific structural transformation, realizing o-xylene (oX) recognition/separation from the binary and ternary isomer mixtures. This PCP has a flexible structure that contains flexible aromatic pendant groups, which both work as recognition sites and induce structural flexibility of the global framework. The PCP exhibits guest-triggered “breathing”-type structural changes, which are accompanied by the rearrangement of the intraframework π–π interaction. By rebuilding π–π stacking with isomer species, the PCP discriminated oX from the other isomers by its specific guest-loading configuration and separated oX from the isomer mixture via selective adsorption. The xylene-selective property of the PCP is dependent on the solvent; in diluted hexane solution, the PCP favors p-xylene (pX) uptake. The separation results combined with crystallographic analyses revealed the effect of the isomer selectivity of the PCP on xylene isomer separation via structural transition and demonstrated its potential as a versatile selective adsorptive medium for challenging separations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy 3ahexane 3aisomers 3asolvents 3axylene 0axylene separation 0aporous coordination polymer 0ametal−organic framework 0astructural transition 0astatic separation 0abreakthrough separation1 aKajiwara, Takashi1 aOtake, Ken-ichi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7904-50031 aYao, Ming-Shui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1604-26111 aAshitani, Hirotaka1 aKubota, Yoshiki1 aKitagawa, Susumu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6956-95430 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 04, v. 13, no. 44 p.52144-52151dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c100613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03208naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010000157520204200257592002802299650001202327650003002339650001102369650001202380650001902392650001402411650001602425650001002441650001502451650001502466650001102481650001602492651001002508700001502518700001502533700002002548700001802568773012802586856007502714852000902789655001202798IND60771431120221121234842.0220325e20220310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077143112DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140613512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Wenping 10aInventory and Spatiotemporal Patterns of Glacial Lakes in the HKH-TMHA Region from 1990 to 2020  aThe Himalayan, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush (HKH-TMHA) are the three main mountain ranges in the high-mountain Asia region, covering the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In this study, we identified glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region based on multitemporal Landsat images taken from 1990 to 2020. We analyzed the spatial distribution and evolution of glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region from the perspective of their elevation, size, and terrain aspect; then, we described their temporal changes. The results showed that approximately 84.56% of the glacial lakes (84.1% of the total lake area) were located at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m, and glacial lakes with areas ranging from 0.01–0.5 km² accounted for approximately 95.21% of the number and 63.01% of the total area of glacial lakes. The number (38.64%) and area (58.83%) of south-facing glacial lakes were largest in HKH-TMHA and expanded significantly over time. There were 5835 (664.84 ± 89.72 km²) glacial lakes in 1990; from 1990 to 2020, the number of glacial lakes in the HKH-TMHA region increased by 5974 (408.93 km²) in total; and the annual average increase in the area of glacial lakes reached 13.63 km² (11.15%). In 2020, the total number of glacial lake reached to 9673 (899.66 ± 120.63 km²). In addition, most glacial lakes were located in the Eastern Himalayan, China, and the Indus Basin. Based on the precipitation and temperature analyses performed in our study area, we found inconsistent climate characteristics and changes in the three mountain ranges. In general, the daily precipitation (temperature) increased by 1.0766 mm (1.0311 °C), 0.8544 mm (0.8346 °C), and 0.8245 mm (−0.1042 °C) on the yearly, summer, and winter scales, respectively. Glacial melting and climate change are common contributors to glacial lake expansion. The investigation of glacial lakes in this region can provide basic supporting data for research on glacial lake-related disasters, land cover, and climate change in the high-mountain Asia region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aatmospheric precipitation 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aevolution 3ainventories 3alakes 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3asummer 3atemperature 3aChina1 aWang, Wei 1 aGao, Xing 1 aWang, Xuecheng 1 aWang, Ruohan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Mar. 10, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140613513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02973naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245015200168300001400320520148900334592002801823650001901851650002301870650001901893650002201912650001601934650002001950650002701970650002201997650002902019650002202048650002302070650001102093650001702104650002102121650001702142651000902159653002802168653002002196653003002216653002302246653001202269700002702281773009102308856008302399852000902482655001202491IND60606896620221120222942.0180730e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060689662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2015.10.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEshraghi, Hadi13aAn initiative towards an energy and environment scheme for Iran: Introducing RAISE (Richest Alternatives for Implementation to Supply Energy) model  ap. 36-51.  aDecision making in Iran's energy and environment-related issues has always been tied to complexities. Discussing these complexities and the necessity to deal with them, this paper strives to help the country with a tool by introducing Richest Alternatives for Implementation to Supply Energy (RAISE), a mixed integer linear programming model developed by the means of GNUMathprog mathematical programming language. The paper fully elaborates authors' desired modeling mentality and formulations on which RAISE is programmed to work and verifies its structure by running a widely known sample case named “UTOPIA” and comparing the results with other works including OSeMOSYS and Temoa. The model applies RAISE model to Iranian energy sector to elicit optimal policy without and with a CO2 emission cap. The results suggest promotion of energy efficiency through investment on combined cycle power plants as the key to optimal policy in power generation sector. Regarding oil refining sector, investment on condensate refineries and advanced refineries equipped with Residual Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) units are suggested. Results also undermine the prevailing supposition that climate change mitigation deteriorates economic efficiency of energy system and suggest that there is a strong synergy between them. In the case of imposing a CO2 cap that aims at maintaining CO2 emissions from electricity production activities at 2012 levels, a shift to renewable energies occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalytic cracking 3aclimate change 3acomputer software 3acondensates 3adecision making 3aelectricity generation 3aenergy efficiency 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3alinear programming 3amodels 3aoil refining 3apower generation 3apower plants 3aIran 0aSustainable development 0aEnergy modeling 0aClimate change mitigation 0aLinear programming 0aCO2 cap1 aAhadi, Mohammad Sadegh0 tEnergy policy.g2016 Feb., v. 89 p.36-51dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.10.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009300157300002000250520158700270592002801857650004401885650002201929650001501951650001501966650002801981650002102009650003102030650001302061650001902074650001902093650001402112650002102126650002402147650001902171650002002190650001502210650002502225650002102250700001602271700001602287700001302303700001802316700001502334700001802349773012502367856007402492852000902566655001202575IND60669143020221118002747.0190920e20150908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066914302DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra12806d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Menghong10a3D welan gum–graphene oxide composite hydrogels with efficient dye adsorption capacity  ap. 75589-75599.  aAs a renewable material, welan gum is a kind of both biocompatible and biodegradable microbial polysaccharide and can be used to form polysaccharide/inorganic material composites. In this article, welan gum–graphene oxide (GO) composite hydrogels were prepared by simple self-assembly of both components in aqueous media and the effects of GO on the gelation of welan gum were systematically studied. The welan gum–GO hybrid hydrogels have been thoroughly characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and rheological measurements. It can be observed that GO is dispersed on a molecular scale in the welan gum matrix and the interactions such as hydrophobic interaction, electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding occur between the welan gum matrix and graphene oxide sheets. The addition of GO which can act as a physical cross-linker in the hydrogel and effectively promote the gelation of welan gum, can be reflected by a decrease of the critical gelation concentration (CGC). Additionally, the welan gum–GO hybrid hydrogels exhibited good adsorption properties for water-soluble dyes such as methylene blue (MB), methyl violet (MV), amido black 10B (AB10B), rhodamine 6G (R6G) and chrome azurol S (CAS). Thus, it is expected that the GO-based composite hydrogels can act as adsorbents and have promising applications in the field of waste water treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiodegradability 3aelectrostatic interactions 3agelation 3agentian violet 3agraphene oxide 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amethylene blue 3apolysaccharides 3arhodamines 3awastewater treatment 3awater solubility1 aSong, Aixin1 aXu, Guiying1 aXin, Xia1 aShen, Jinglin1 aZhang, Han1 aSong, Zhaohua0 tRSC advances.g2015 Sept. 08, v. 5, no. 92 p.75589-75599dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra12806d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02319naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245008800167300001600255520097800271592002801249650002101277650001301298650002301311650001301334650001701347650001901364650001301383650001201396650002101408650001501429650002601444650001401470653002101484653001301505653003001518653002101548700001601569700001701585700001401602700001501616700001601631773010601647856008701753852000901840655001201849IND60613579420221121151235.0200621e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061357942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2018.08.1122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Daoyi10aBiosynthesis of advanced biofuel farnesyl acetate using engineered Escherichia coli  ap. 577-580.  aDiminishing petroleum reserves and the rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases lead to increasing interest in microbial biofuels. In this study, a heterologous farnesyl acetate biosynthesis pathway was constructed in Escherichia coli for the first time. Firstly, the AtoB, ERG13, tHMG1, ERG12, ERG8, MVD1, Idi, IspA and PgpB were expressed to accumulate farnesol in the E. coli cells. Then the alcohol acetyltransferase (ATF1) was heterologous overexpressed for the subsequent esterification farnesol to farnesyl acetate. The engineered strain DG 106 accumulated 128 ± 10.5 mg/L of farnesyl acetate. Finally, the isopentenyl-diphosphate isomerase was further overexpressed, and the recombinant strain DG107 produced 201 ± 11.7 mg/L of farnesyl acetate. This study shows the novel method for the biosynthesis of the advanced biofuel farnesyl acetate directly from glucose and highlight the enormous designing strategies for metabolic engineering of bioproducts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetates 3aacetyltransferases 3abiofuels 3abiosynthesis 3aesterification 3afarnesol 3aglucose 3agreenhouse gases 3aisomerases 3ametabolic engineering 3apetroleum 0aEscherichia coli 0aFarnesol 0aAlcohol acetyltransferase 0aFarnesyl acetate1 aKong, Sijia1 aZhang, Lihua1 aPan, Hong1 aWang, Chao1 aLiu, Zhijie0 tBioresource technology.g2018 Dec., v. 269 p.577-580dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2018.08.1123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02085naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245011300177300001800290520096800308592002801276650001501304650001601319650001401335650001101349650001101360650001401371650001301385650002001398700002301418700001701441700006001458773012001518856008801638852000901726655001201735IND60788979920221118083443.0220818e20220727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078897992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c014132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarjani, Shaghayegh10aLattice-Gas Model for Asphaltene Interactions Observed at Interfaces in the Context of the Yen-Mullins Model  ap. 8778-8785.  aThe presence of asphaltene at both fluid–fluid and fluid–solid interfaces has a wide impact on petroleum recovery processes, for example, by stabilizing oil–gas–water dispersions, adsorbing on reservoir rock surfaces and thus changing their wetting properties, and forming deposits in oil–gas production systems. The Yen-Mullins model for asphaltene behavior in bulk fluids provides a framework for understanding a diverse range of phenomena related to the adsorption dynamics of asphaltene at interfaces and how the adsorbed layers are structured. In this work, we address the relatively less explored parameter, which is accounting for the size and shape of the particles on the interfacial properties and emulsion stability. We discuss our investigations of the asphaltene adsorption and its effects, focusing on oil–water interfaces, and propose a lattice-gas model to explain the experimental observations of the interfacial tension and rheology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aasphaltenes 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3amodels 3apetroleum 3arheology 3asurface tension1 aJagadisan, Archana1 aKoplik, Joel1 aBanerjee, Sanjoy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3128-85590 tEnergy & fuels.g2022 July 27, v. 36, no. 16 p.8778-8785dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.2c014133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01643naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013900165300001400304520056800318592002800886650002300914650001400937650001200951653002300963653002200986653005901008653002101067653002401088700001601112773009601128856008401224852000901308655001201317IND60601134420221118054705.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060113442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatami, M.10aMotion of a spherical particle on a rotating parabola using Lagrangian and high accuracy Multi-step Differential Transformation Method  ap. 94-98.  aIn this letter, the equation of a particle's motion on a rotating parabolic surface is introduced through Lagrange equations and is solved by Multi-step Differential Transformation Method (Ms-DTM).

The multi-agent system learns to control the components of the microgrid so as this to achieve its purposes and operate effectively, by means of a distributed, collaborative reinforcement learning method in continuous actions-states space. Stand-alone microgrids present challenges regarding guaranteeing electricity supply and increasing the reliability of the system under the uncertainties introduced by the renewable power sources and the stochastic demand of the consumers. In this article we consider a microgrid that consists of power production, power consumption and power storage units: the power production group includes a Photovoltaic source, a fuel cell and a diesel generator; the power consumption group includes an electrolyzer unit, a desalination plant and a variable electrical load that represent the power consumption of a building; the power storage group includes only the Battery bank. We conjecture that a distributed multi-agent system presents specific advantages to control the microgrid components which operate in a continuous states and actions space: For this purpose we propose the use of fuzzy Q-Learning methods for agents representing microgrid components to act as independent learners, while sharing state variables to coordinate their behavior. Experimental results highlight both the effectiveness of individual agents to control system components, as well as the effectiveness of the multi-agent system to guarantee electricity supply and increase the reliability of the microgrid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3abatteries 3adesalination 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuel cells 3agenerators (equipment) 3apower generation 3auncertainty 0aEnergy management 0aReinforcement learning (RL) 0aFuzzy Q-Learning 0aMulti-agent system (MAS) 0aMicrogrid1 aDounis, A.I.1 aVouros, G.A.0 tApplied energy.g2018 June 01, v. 219 p.53-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001700137245014400154300001600298520129400314592002801608650001701636650002201653650001201675650001301687650000901700650001401709650001701723650001001740650001501750650001401765650001501779653002101794653001401815700002001829700001901849773012701868856007101995852000902066655001202075IND60645189520221116173756.0190523s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064518952DNAL7 a10.1071/WF181162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZituni, Rami14aThe effects of post-fire forest management on soil erosion rates 3 and 4 years after a wildfire, demonstrated on the 2010 Mount Carmel fire  ap. 377-385.  aDuring 2–5 December 2010, an area of 2500ha in the Carmel forests was consumed by a severe wildfire, causing soil erosion from the exposed slopes. Whereas most studies show that post-fire erosion rates tend to decline after the second year, in this case, we aim to address the ongoing consequences that different management practices had on soil erosion 3 and 4 years after a fire. Three management operations were applied: (a) preservation management (PM) – mulching wood chips on the burned area; (b) tree-clearing management (TCM) – burned trees were cut and removed; and (c) skid-trail formation (ST) – provisional pathways were formed while trees were dragged outside. Consequently, the objectives of the study were: (1) to monitor the effects of these post-fire practices 3 and 4 years after fire; and (2) to characterise the physical features of the eroded soil. The sediments were collected after every effective rain event over two rainy seasons (2013–14, 2014–15). TCM and ST practices resulted in significantly elevated soil-erosion yields compared to PM. The sediments following PM had a high percentage of fine material. Furthermore, PM had an evident positive effect on the soil, whereas all other practices inhibited vegetation renewal and system rehabilitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeroded soils 3aforest management 3aforests 3amulching 3arain 3asediments 3asoil erosion 3atrees 3awet season 3awildfires 3awood chips 0aland degradation 0awildfires1 aWittenberg, Lea1 aMalkinson, Dan0 tInternational journal of wildland fire.g2019, v. 28, no. 5 p.377-385dCSIRO PublishingwJournal:jnl57534x1049-80017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF181163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010600173300001600279520133600295592002801631650001501659650002001674650002001694650001401714650002501728650001301753650001501766650001101781650001401792650001501806650002401821650001401845650002001859650001501879650002001894650001801914653002401932653001501956653001501971653001301986653001601999700002102015700001702036700001702053700001602070773011402086856008602200852000902286655001202295IND60613231720221120164401.0200831e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061323172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacinto, Jéssica10aRemoval and recovery of Critical Rare Elements from contaminated waters by living Gracilaria gracilis  ap. 531-538.  aThe experiments performed in this work proved the ability of Gracilaria gracilis to concentrate and recover Critical Rare Elements (CRE) from contaminated waters. The importance of recycling these elements is related to their very limited sources in Nature and progressive use in technologies. Moreover, their mining exploitation has negative environmental impact, and recent studies point them as new emerging pollutants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the application of living macroalgae for the removal and recovery of CRE. G. gracilis (2.5gL⁻¹, fresh weight) was exposed to mono- and multi-element saline solutions of 500μgL⁻¹ of Y, Ce, Nd, Eu and La. Removal was up to 70% in 48h, with bioaccumulation following Elovich kinetic model. In multi-element solutions, selectivity was not observed although removal of lanthanides improved comparatively to single-element solutions. No mortality or adverse effect on growth was registered. The subsequent macroalgae digestion allowed collecting virtually 100% of all elements in a 300-fold more concentrated solution. The overall results suggest the application of living macroalgae as a simple and effective alternative technology for removing and recovering CRE from wastewaters, contributing to an improvement of water quality and CRE recycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGracilaria 3aadverse effects 3abioaccumulation 3adigestion 3aenvironmental impact 3akinetics 3amacroalgae 3amining 3amortality 3apollutants 3arare earth elements 3arecycling 3asodium chloride 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3awater quality 0aRare earth elements 0aMacroalgae 0aBioremoval 0aRecovery 0aGrowth rate1 aHenriques, Bruno1 aDuarte, A.C.1 aVale, Carlos1 aPereira, E.0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 344 p.531-538dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02326naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014700159300002000306520099800326592002801324650004401352650002201396650001101418650001401429650002601443650001901469650000901488650001501497650001301512650002701525650002001552650001701572650002101589700001601610700001201626700001501638700001301653700001901666773012401685856007401809852000901883655001201892IND60625471420221119062122.0181208e20181129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062547142DNAL7 a10.1039/c8ra08486f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Rong-Yi10aPbᴵᴵ-catalyzed transformation of aromatic nitriles to heptanitrogen anions via sodium azide: a combined experimental and theoretical study  ap. 39929-39936.  aUnder hydrothermal conditions, an open-chain N₇³⁻ anion stabilized in a metal–organic framework (MOF) was achieved for the first time via the in situ reaction of 4-fluorobenzonitrile and sodium azide with Pb²⁺ ion as catalyst. The anion with C₂ₕ symmetry in the MOF was studied by FT-IR, single-crystal XRD and theoretical calculations. Thermal analysis results demonstrated the stability of the anion in the MOF below 430 °C and a high energy content of 8.61 kJ g⁻¹. The anion is also a good reducing agent. It can easily react with basic KMnO₄ solution. Moreover, the present study indicates that the Pb²⁺ ion activates the azide rather than nitrile in the in situ reaction of nitriles with azides to form polynitrogen and this mechanism is a distinct contradiction with the previous results in which the nitrile reacts with azide in the presence of transition metal ions. Our findings may open a new avenue towards the synthesis and capture of polynitrogen compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanions 3acatalysts 3acoordination polymers 3aenergy content 3alead 3ametal ions 3anitriles 3apotassium permanganate 3areducing agents 3asodium azide 3athermal analysis1 aZhang, Chao1 aYan, Da1 aXiong, Zhi1 aXu, Heng1 aRen, Xiao-Ming0 tRSC advances.g2018 Nov. 29, v. 8, no. 70 p.39929-39936dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ra08486f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010200167520111900269592002801388650001401416650002001430650001801450650001101468653002101479653001901500653001801519653002001537653002201557653001201579653000801591653000801599653000801607700001501615700001501630700001801645700001801663700001101681773010801692856008601800852000901886655001201895IND60772207320221119111821.0220517e20220801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077220732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1194342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Wenxuan10aElucidating the hornification mechanism of cellulosic fibers during the process of thermal drying  aDrying-induced hornification is an inevitable phenomenon of cellulosic fibers, which is used to describe internal aggregation structure changes of cellulosic fibers upon drying or water removal. To investigate the hornification process, never-dried cellulosic fibers with different components were thermally dried to different moisture contents. The results indicated that the hornification process could be divided into four stages, including the first crystallization period (>70% moisture), the cocrystallization period (70–31% moisture), the hemicellulose control period (31–11% moisture), and the second crystallization period (11–0% moisture). The decrease of water retention value (WRV) occurred in the cocrystallization period and the second crystallization period, which meant hornification happened in these two periods. Besides, hemicellulose and lignin inhibited hornification by reducing cellulose cocrystallization. The work elucidates the hornification process and mechanism of cellulosic fibers,which will be helpful to control the properties of cellulosic materials for extended utilization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3acrystallization 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 0aCellulosic fiber 0aThermal drying 0aHornification 0aCrystallization 0aCocrystallization 0aProcess 0aWRV 0aSEM 0aXRD1 aChen, Kefu1 aYang, Xuan1 aKong, Fangong1 aLiu, Jiangyan1 aLi, Bo0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2022 Aug. 01, v. 289 p.119434-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2022.1194343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245016100167300001600328520124400344592002801588650002101616650001601637650002501653650001401678650001901692650002301711650001001734650001201744700002101756773011501777852000901892856008201901655001201983IND4396379520221120034242.0190314e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439637952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-006-0874-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiraide, Masakazu14aThe smell and odorous components of dried shiitake mushroom, Lentinula edodes IV: survey of trends in consumer preferences and changes in sensory evaluation  ap. 458-461.  aThis study is part of an effort to improve the quality of dried shiitake mushrooms (Lentinula edodes) in accordance with consumer preference. Results are presented of a trend survey that examined the preferences of consumers using questionnaires combined with sensory evaluation. From the original preference (OP) survey, the distributions of OP divided by age class (AC) were statistically equal to the results obtained in 2000. The medians of OP for teenagers and twenties were “neutral” and “slightly like,” respectively. A firm preference change occurred between teenagers and those in their twenties. It is empirically realized that sensory intensity (SI) scores that were too high or too low led to a low hedonic preference (HP) score. The same tendency was seen for “neutralists” and “likers.” In addition, almost all distributions concerned with HP had no significant difference between 2000 and 2005; for example, that of SI divided by AC. These results showed that the preference for dried shiitake mushroom has been unaffected by the passage of the past 5 years. Dried shiitake mushrooms have been used from ancient times and for many dishes; therefore, the overall preference appears to have remained unchanged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLentinula edodes 3aadolescents 3aconsumer preferences 3amushrooms 3aquestionnaires 3asensory evaluation 3asmell 3asurveys1 aYokoyama, Ichiro0 tJournal of wood science.g2007 Oct., v. 53, no. 5 p.458-461dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-006-0874-43Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02506naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245012800158300002000286520113100306592002801437650001601465650002001481650001501501650001201516650001201528650002501540650002301565650001501588650001201603650001301615650000701628650002701635650003001662650001801692650001301710650002501723700001301748700001701761700001901778700001401797700001801811773012401829856007401953852000902027655001202036IND60640518220221119173136.0190504e20160616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064051822DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04129a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xinchao10aControl of pH by acetic acid and its effect on ethanol fermentation in an integrated ethanol–methane fermentation process  ap. 57902-57909.  aThe integrated ethanol-methane fermentation process employing cassava or other feedstock requires pH control to maximize yields. Sulfuric acid is currently used to adjust the pH of the recycled process water but this causes problems with sulfate-reducing bacteria. To resolve this, acetic acid was evaluated to regulate pH in the range 4.0–5.5. Significant advantages were found and acetic acid toxicity was avoided. The ethanol yield from glucose increased 4.6% on average while production of the undesired byproduct glycerol decreased 52.6%. The ethanol yield per DCW (dry cell weight) increased from 14.0 g g⁻¹ (sulfuric acid control) to 32.0 g g⁻¹ when 250 mM acetic acid was present at pH 5.0. At pH 5.5, ethanol yield per DCW increased from 10.5 g g⁻¹ to 23.0 g g⁻¹. In both cases, the ethanol yield more than doubled. Using acetic acid instead of sulfuric acid to control pH thus increased ethanol production while simultaneously reducing undesirable side effects. The results presented here could also provide a useful approach for the management of wastewater in other submerged fermentation industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3aadverse effects 3abyproducts 3acassava 3aethanol 3aethanol fermentation 3aethanol production 3afeedstocks 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3apH 3asubmerged fermentation 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfuric acid 3atoxicity 3awastewater treatment1 aWang, Ke1 aWang, Huijun1 aZhang, Jianhua1 aTang, Lei1 aMao, Zhonggui0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 16, v. 6, no. 63 p.57902-57909dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04129a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005300150245015300203300001800356500001900374520138400393592002801777650001601805650001701821650002001838650002401858650001401882650001301896650001901909650002201928650001501950700001401965700001901979700001601998700001702014700001502031700001902046773012102065856008402186852000902270655001202279IND60713732520221121032307.0201023e20200929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071373252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c016702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Quan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8794-368X10aFrom Microfibrillar Network to Lamellae during the Coagulation Process of Polyacrylonitrile Fiber: Visualization of Intermediate Structure Evolution  ap. 8663-8673.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoagulation process is one of the most important stages of the microstructure formation and evolution in polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fibers during the spinning process. The network and lamellae were fundamental superstructures of PAN nascent fibers. Nevertheless, due to complex phase transitions, the mechanism of the microstructure formation and evolution in PAN nascent fiber was not comprehensively elucidated yet. In this work, a full account of microstructure formation and transformation of PAN nascent fiber by electron microscopic analysis was presented and the underlying mechanism of their formation and transformation during the coagulation process was proposed. During the coagulation process, phase separation, gelation, crystallization, and concentration fluctuations occurred. The densified and elongated domains of the polymer-rich phase were solidified into the microfibrils, and they were cross-linked to form the microfibrillar network. The transverse domains induced by the concentration fluctuation acted as the precursors of the lamellae, and subsequently the lamellae were stacked closely and regularly. Meanwhile, crystallization occurred along the whole process, and the crystal layers formed and aggregated within the microfibrils. Our work therefore revealed the existing morphological types in PAN nascent fibers and their underlying formation mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulation 3acrosslinking 3acrystallization 3aelectron microscopy 3aevolution 3agelation 3amicrostructure 3apolyacrylonitrile 3aseparation1 aJing, Min1 aZhao, Shengyao1 aWang, Yuxia1 aQin, Jianjie1 aYu, Meijie1 aWang, Chengguo0 tMacromolecules.g2020 Sept. 29, v. 53, no. 19 p.8663-8673dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c016703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245013700170520213800307592002802445650001502473650001902488650001102507650001502518650003002533650001602563650001202579650001202591650001502603650001502618650001602633650001302649650001502662650001002677650002202687650001902709650001102728650002302739650001302762650003002775650001902805650002802824650002002852651001002872700001902882700002002901700002002921773011702941856007503058852000903133655001203142IND60649756420221119210138.0190706e20180112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064975642DNAL7 a10.3390/land70100062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaimaitiaili, Ayisulitan10aMonitoring and Analysing Land Use/Cover Changes in an Arid Region Based on Multi-Satellite Data: The Kashgar Region, Northwest China  aIn arid regions, oases ecosystems are fragile and sensitive to climate change, and water is the major limiting factor for environmental and socio-economic developments. Understanding the drivers of land use/cover change (LUCC) in arid regions is important for the development of management strategies to improve or prevent environmental deterioration and loss of natural resources. The Kashgar Region is the key research area in this study; it is a typical mountain-alluvial plain-oasis-desert ecosystem in an arid region, and is one of the largest oases in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China. In addition, the Kashgar Region is an important cotton and grain production area. This study’s main objectives are to quantify predominant LUCCs and identify their driving forces, based on the integration of multiple remote sensors and applications of environmental and socio-economic data. Results showed that LUCCs have been significant in the Kashgar Region during the last 42 years. Cultivated land and urban/built-up lands were the most changed land cover (LC), by 3.6% and 0.4% from 1972 to 10.2% and 3% in 2014, respectively. By contrast, water and forest areas declined. Grassland and snow-covered areas have fluctuated along with climate and human activities. Bare land was changed slightly from 1972 to 2014. According to the land use transfer matrix, cultivated land replaced grass- and forestland. Urban/built-up land mainly expanded over cultivated and bare land. LUCCs were triggered by the interplay of natural and social drivers. Increasing runoff, caused by regional climate changes in seasonal variation, and snow melt water, have provided water resources for LC changes. In the same way, population growth, changes in land tenure, and socio-economic development also induced LUCCs. However, expansion of cultivated land and urban/built-up land led to increased water consumption and stressed fragile water systems during on-going climate changes. Therefore, the selection of adaption strategies relating to climate change and oasis development is very important for sustainable development in the Kashgar Region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid zones 3aclimate change 3acotton 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental degradation 3aforest land 3aforests 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aland cover 3aland tenure 3aland use 3amonitoring 3aoases 3apopulation growth 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3aseasonal variation 3asnowmelt 3asocioeconomic development 3asocioeconomics 3asustainable development 3awater resources 3aChina1 aAji, Xiaokaiti1 aMatniyaz, Akbar1 aKondoh, Akihiko0 tLand.g2018 Jan. 12, v. 7, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land70100063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245011100163520097300274592002801247650001701275650001101292650002001303650002501323650001501348650001901363650003301382650002201415650001501437650002601452650001901478650001701497650001901514650001701533700002301550700002301573773011701596856007501713852000901788655001201797IND60649761220221118033220.0190706e20180730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064976122DNAL7 a10.3390/land70300912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Subham13aAn Overview of the Impacts of Land Use Land Cover Changes (1980–2014) on Urban Water Security of Kolkata  aUrban Water Security is essential in urban planning to manage cities&rsquo; water infrastructures and strengthen their water stress resilience and adaptive capacities.

Hair characteristics, body mass index, intestinal villus height, intestinal crypt depth, serum antioxidant capacity, and gut microbiota of mice were first measured and the correlation between the antioxidant capacity of mouse serum and the gut microbiota was then explored. The mice in the lactic acid bacteria group (L-group), the mixed bacteria group (LY-group), and the rice soup group (R-group) kept their weight well and had better digestion. The mice in the L-group had the better hair quality (dense), but the hair quality in the R-group and the yeast group (Y-group) was relatively poor (sparse). In addition, the inoculation of Lactobacillus paracasei H4-11 (L. paracasei H4-11) and Kluyveromyces marxianus L1-1 (K. marxianus L1-1) increased the villus height/crypt depth of the mice (3.043 ± 0.406) compared to the non-inoculation group (R-group) (2.258 ± 0.248). The inoculation of L. paracasei H4-11 and K. marxianus L1-1 in fermented rice-acid enhanced the blood antioxidant capacity of mouse serum (glutathione 29.503 ± 6.604 umol/L, malonaldehyde 0.687 ± 0.125 mmol/L, catalase 15.644 ± 4.618 U/mL, superoxide dismutase 2.292 ± 0.201 U/mL). In the gut microbiota of L-group and LY-group, beneficial microorganisms (Lactobacillus and Blautia) increased, but harmful microorganisms (Candidatus Arthromitus and Erysipelotrichales) decreased. L. paracasei H4-11 and K. marxianus L1-1 might have a certain synergistic effect on the improvement in antibacterial function since they reduced harmful microorganisms in the gut microbiota of mice.

The objective of this study was to determine if wheat-alien amphiploid and chromosome substitution lines derived from Aegilops squarrosa L. and Agropyron species could be used as new sources of root rot resistance. A series of greenhouse studies established that Agrotana, a wheat-A. trichophorum amphiploid, carried resistance to common root rot. Tests of the chromosome substitution series for the D genome in the winter wheat cultivar Winalta by chromosomes 1 to 7 of Ae. squarrosa demonstrated that the substitutions had no consistent effect on disease severity. Similarly, substitutions of chromosomes 4D, 5D, and 6D of Winalta by homoeologons chromosomes from A. elongatum and chromosome 4B for chromosome 4 from A. intermedium had no effect on root rot severity. Isolations from the subcrown internodeshowed that Agrotana had a significantly lower percentage of plants infected with C. sativus than did other exotic lines and common wheat cultivars, suggesting that it might have a different resistance mechanism against common root rot.

Development of tularemia vaccines has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the correlates of immunity. Moreover, the importance of lung cellular immunity in vaccine-mediated protection against tularemia is a controversial matter. Live attenuated vaccine strains of F. tularensis such as LVS (Live Vaccine Strain), elicit an immune response protecting mice against subsequent challenge with the virulent SchuS4 strain, yet the protective immunity against pulmonary challenge is limited in its efficacy and longevity. We established a murine intra-nasal immunization model which distinguishes between animals fully protected, challenged at 4 weeks post double-vaccination (200 inhalation Lethal Dose 50%, LD50, of SchuS4), and those which do not survive the lethal SchuS4 infection, challenged at 8 weeks post double vaccination. Early in the recall immune response in the lung (before day 3), disease progression and bacterial dissemination differed considerably between protected and non-protected immunized mice. Pre-challenge analysis, revealed that protected mice, exhibited significantly higher numbers of lung Ft-specific memory T cells compared to non-protected mice. Quantitative PCR analysis established that a higher magnitude, lung T cells response was activated in the lungs of the protected mice already at 24 h post-challenge. The data imply that an early memory response within the lung is strongly associated with protection against the lethal SchuS4 bacteria presumably by restricting the dissemination of the bacteria to internal organs. Thus, future prophylactic strategies to countermeasure F. tularensis infection may require modulation of the immune response within the lung.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFrancisella tularensis 3aT-lymphocytes 3abacteria 3abreathing 3acell-mediated immunity 3adisease course 3aimmune response 3alethal dose 50 3alive vaccines 3alongevity 3alungs 3amice 3amodels 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atularemia 3avaccination 3avirulence 0aFrancisella tularensis 0aLive attenuated vaccine 0aEarly lung protective response 0aMemory T cells response 0aCytokines1 aCohen, Hila1 aElia, Uri1 aRotem, Shahar1 aBercovich-Kinori, Adi1 aBar-Haim, Erez1 aChitlaru, Theodor1 aCohen, Ofer0 tVaccine.g2017 Dec. 15, v. 35, no. 50 p.7001-7009dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.10.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03199naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002400188245008900212300001600301500001100317506007600328520166300404592002802067596004402095506003702139650002502176650001402201650001302215650002702228650001702255650002302272650002902295650001402324650001802338650001202356650001502368650001902383650001302402650001102415650001402426650002002440700002602460773012802486856008202614852000902696655001202705IND60593440320221207103559.0210225e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059344032DNAL7 aPMC59181532pmcid7 a295726472pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-018-2821-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTolbert, Vanessa P.10aNeuroblastoma: clinical and biological approach to risk stratification and treatment  ap. 195-209.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNeuroblastoma is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor of childhood and the most common in the first year of life. It is a unique malignancy in that infants often present with either localized or metastatic disease that can spontaneously regress without intervention while older children can succumb to the disease after months to years of arduous therapy. Given this wide range of outcomes, the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group was created to stratify patients based on presenting characteristics and tumor biology in order to guide intensity of treatment strategies. The goal has been to decrease therapy for low-risk patients to avoid long-term complications while augmenting and targeting therapies for high-risk patients to improve overall survival. The international risk stratification depends on age, stage, histology, MYCN gene amplification status, tumor cell ploidy and segmental chromosomal abnormalities. Treatment for asymptomatic low-risk patients with an estimated survival of > 98% is often observation or surgical resection alone, whereas intermediate-risk patients with an estimated survival of > 90% require moderate doses of response-adjusted chemotherapy along with resection. High-risk patients undergo multiple cycles of combination chemotherapy before surgery, followed by consolidation with myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and local radiation and finally immunotherapy with differentiation therapy as maintenance phase. With this approach, outcome for patients with neuroblastoma has improved, as the field continues to expand efforts in more targeted therapies for high-risk patients.  aPublisher supplied data  aP01 CA217959cNational Cancer Institute0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell transplantation 3achildhood 3achildren 3achromosome aberrations 3adrug therapy 3agene amplification 3ahematopoietic stem cells 3ahistology 3aimmunotherapy 3ainfants 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aploidy 3aresection 3arisk assessment1 aMatthay, Katherine K.0 tCell and tissue research.g2018 May, v. 372, no. 2 p.195-209dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-018-2821-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011200154300002000266520082200286592002801108650002001136650000901156650002201165650001601187650001701203650001701220700001501237700002601252700002201278700002201300700002301322700001701345773012501362856007401487852000901561655001201570IND60669498820221118003306.0190920e20151119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066949882DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21917e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeng, Yan10aAnthanthrene dye-sensitized solar cells: influence of the number of anchoring groups and substitution motif  ap. 98643-98652.  aFour new dye molecules comprising an anthanthrene core, thiophene-cyanoacrylic acid electron acceptor and triphenylamine (TPA) electron donor units were prepared. Thereby, the substitution pattern at the anthanthrene core has been varied systematically. The molecules were fully characterized using optical spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, and their electronic structures and excitation energies were calculated by DFT and TDDFT methods. The photovoltaic properties of dye-sensitized solar cells based on these molecules were investigated. In comparison to symmetric dyes, the introduction of the organic donor TPA in asymmetric dyes leads to a remarkable improvement of the solar energy conversion efficiencies due to higher Vₒc and Jₛc values of devices, giving rise to the best overall efficiency of 5.27%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic amines 3adyes 3aenergy conversion 3asolar cells 3asolar energy 3aspectroscopy1 aYi, Chenyi1 aBircher, Martin Peter1 aDecurtins, Silvio1 aCascella, Michele1 aGrätzel, Michael,1 aLiu, Shi-Xia0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 19, v. 5, no. 119 p.98643-98652dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra21917e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100002000153245005200173300001600225520106700241592002801308650001901336650001601355700001901371700002001390700002001410773011901430852000901549856008201558655001201640991601777330742620221120045101.0181030e197806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891118862DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517578048006102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, David F.10aChemical Composition of Cotton-Processing Dusts  ap. 355-361.  aInorganic and proximate compositions were determined for total and fine (under 20 μm diameter) dusts from cotton gins, textile mills; oil mills, and cotton compresses. The ash content of fine dusts was higher than that in total dust samples but decreased with the stage of processing in textile mills and gins. Inorganic composition often differed exten sively and appeared to depend on the soil composition and growing location. Large differences in water solubility and protein content also were observed. The difference between total and fine cardroom dusts was primarily in fiber content. Numerically and gravimetrically, the vast majority of mineral particles and plant fragments in carding dust appeared to be under 20 μm diameter. Little difference was found in the relative ratios of inorganic elements and nonfiber plant fragments in total and fine gin dust samples.

The tris(chelate) complex dication in (1)(PF₆)₂ exhibits a mer configuration of pyridine and azo nitrogen atoms in an approximately octahedral arrangement at the metal. The dichlororuthenium bis(chelate) compound 2 has the halide ligands and the coordinated azo nitrogen centers in an equatorial cis arrangement whereas two pyridyl groups (one of each abpy ligand) occupy the axial positions. The bond distances from the metal to the nitrogen donor centers are systematically smaller for the stronger π accepting azo functions than for the more basic but less π acidic pyridyl groups, a result which differs from that obtained for Mo(0) and Cu(I) complexes of abpy. All Ru—N distances are shorter in the neutral dichloro complex 2. The non-coordinated pyridyl rings of the potentially tetradentate abpy ligands are tilted into approximate s-cis/(NN-trans)/s-trans positions (dihedral angle ω ≈ 145°) as to minimize steric repulsion, however, they do not coordinate to the metal (dRᵤ₋N > 327 pm). While there are no significant intermolecular interactions, the observed conformation implies that considerable structural reorganization is necessary for the formation of oligonuclear complexes.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical interactions 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3aisomers 3aligands 3amoieties 3amolybdenum 3anitrogen 3apyridines 3aruthenium1 aHausen, H.-D.1 aKaim, Wolfgang0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 50, no. 1 p.15-22dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23182x0932-07767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1995-01043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03250naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245015600169300001600325520202200341592002802363650001902391650002702410650002002437650002602457650002402483650002002507650001502527650001102542650001502553651001202568700002602580700001902606700001902625700001502644700001902659773011702678856004802795852000902843655001202852IND50074347520221121005648.0140329e200512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007434752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-005-8221-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDedecker, Andy P.10aApplication Of Artificial Neural Network Models To Analyse The Relationships Between Gammarus pulex L. (Crustacea, Amphipoda) And River Characteristics  ap. 223-241.  aThis study aimed at analysing the relationship between river characteristics and abundance of Gammarus pulex. To this end, four methods which can identify the relative contribution and/or the contribution profile of the input variables in neural networks describing the habitat preferences of this species were compared: (i) the ‘PaD‘ (‘Partial Derivatives‘) method consists of a calculation of the partial derivatives of the output in relation to the input variables; (ii) the ‘Weights‘method is a computation using the connection weights of the backpropagation Artificial Neural Networks; (iii) the ‘Perturb‘method analyses the effect of a perturbation of the input variables on the output variable; (iv) the ‘Profile‘ method is a successive variation of one input variable while the others are kept constant at a fixed set of values. The dataset consisted of 179 samples, collected over a three-year period in the Zwalm river basin in Flanders, Belgium. Twenty-four environmental variables as well as the log-transformed abundance of Gammarus pulex were used in this study. The different contribution methods gave similar results concerning the order of importance of the input variables. Moreover, the stability of the methods was confirmed by gradually removing variables. Only in a limited number of cases a shift in the relative importance of the remaining input variables could be observed. Nevertheless, differences in sensitivity and stability of the methods were detected, probably as a result of the different calculation procedures. In this respect, the ‘PaD‘method made a more severe discrimination between minor and major contributing environmental variables in comparison to the ‘Weights‘, ‘Profile‘ and ‘Perturb‘ methods. From an ecological point of view, the input variables ‘Ammonium‘ and to a smaller extent ‘COD‘, were selected by these methods as dominant river characteristics for the prediction of the abundance of Gammarus pulex in this study area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGammarus pulex 3achemical oxygen demand 3adata collection 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitat preferences 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3arivers 3awatersheds 3aBelgium1 aGoethals, Peter L.

Our researchers evaluate included studies’ quality and risk of bias via the recommended tool. This study uses meta-analyses of random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our research identified 43 cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies, including 40,141 individuals in America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident diabetes were 1.61 (1.10–2.39) for DDT, 1.67 (1.41–1.98) for DDE. The subgroup analysis indicated that the association is significantly higher in the region of Asia for both DDT (OR = 2.73) and DDE (OR = 2.62). Besides, we also tried various types of stratification to identify the more influential confounding factors, among which regional factors have a significant influence. Study evidence suggests that exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk of incident diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/DDE concentrations are more closely associated with diabetes. Further studies in specific regions will be considered in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiabetes 3ameta-analysis 3aresearch 3arisk 3asystematic review 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aEurope 0aDDT 0aDDE 0aDiabetes 0aSystematic review 0aMeta-analysis1 aZhilin, Liu1 aYuhong, Lu1 aWang, Meng,1 aHuijun, Wang1 aZhang, Su,1 aYan, Hou0 tEnvironmental research.g2022 July, v. 210 p.113018-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1130183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01718naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009300166300001600259520079100275592002801066650001801094650002501112650002001137650001001157650001501167650001901182651001301201700001701214773009001231856007401321852000901395655001201404IND60478978720221122200154.0160116e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047897872DNAL7 a10.1111/agec.121912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelesse, Mequanint B.10aDoes land registration and certification boost farm productivity?

Land titling has been at the center stage of development efforts of many African countries to boost tenure security. We investigate the productivity impacts of the Ethiopian land registration and certification program, employing propensity score matching method in an effort to create a credible counterfactual. Consistent with theory, we find land registration and certification has robust positive effects on farm productivity. More tentatively, we identify the assurance effect as one probable channel for impact. Households with land certificates are more likely to adopt soil‐fertility management strategies on their plots than households without certificates.  aPublisher supplied data 3acertification 3adevelopmental stages 3aeconomic theory 3afarms 3ahouseholds 3asoil fertility 3aEthiopia1 aBulte, Erwin0 tAgricultural economics.g2015 Nov., v. 46, no. 6 p.757-768dElsevierx0169-51507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/agec.121913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03409naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245012100164300001800285520168300303592002801986650001402014650002502028650002802053650001602081650001402097650001702111650002802128650002002156650001002176650001702186650002202203650001802225650001802243650001602261650001502277650001902292650002102311650000902332650001402341650002102355650002402376650003202400700002002432700001902452700002502471700002002496700002902516700006302545700002302608773012902631856007402760852000902834655001202843IND60638836920221121153156.0190430e20170822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063883692DNAL7 a10.1039/c7bm00341b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerschenmeyer, Anne10aAnti-oxidant and immune-modulatory properties of sulfated alginate derivatives on human chondrocytes and macrophages  ap. 1756-1765.  aDegeneration of articular cartilage represents one of the most common causes of pain and disability in our aging society. Current treatments only address the symptoms of joint disease, but not their underlying causes which include oxidative stress and inflammation in cartilage and surrounding tissues. Sulfated biopolymers that mimic aspects of the native extracellular environment of cartilage are recently gaining interest as a means to slow the inflammatory events responsible for tissue degeneration. Here we show that the natural polysaccharide alginate and particularly its sulfated derivatives have potent anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-immunogenic properties in vitro. We found that these polymers exert a free radical scavenging activity in a sulfation-dependent manner. In particular, the sulfation degree of substitution of alginate directly correlated with its ability to scavenge superoxide radicals and to chelate metal ions. We also studied the effect of sulfated alginate on the ability of IL-1β to stimulate inflammatory genes in human chondrocytes and found decreased expression of the pro-inflammatory markers IL-6 and CXCL8, which inversely correlated with the sulfation degree. Moreover, in studies testing the ability of the alginates to modulate macrophage polarization, we found that they decreased both the gene expression and synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α in human THP-1 macrophages with M1-like phenotype in a sulfation-dependent manner. To conclude, sulfated alginates effectively protect against oxidative stress and inflammation in vitro and are a promising biomaterial to be explored for treatment of osteoarthritis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3aantioxidant activity 3abiocompatible materials 3abiopolymers 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3afree radical scavengers 3agene expression 3agenes 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3amacrophages 3ametal ions 3aosteoarthritis 3aoxidative stress 3apain 3aphenotype 3asuperoxide anion 3atissue degeneration 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aArlov, Øystein1 aMalheiro, Vera1 aSteinwachs, Matthias1 aRottmar, Markus1 aManiura-Weber, Katharina1 aPalazzoloThese authors jointly supervised the work., Gemma1 aZenobi-Wong, Marcy0 tBiomaterials science.g2017 Aug. 22, v. 5, no. 9 p.1756-1765dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7bm00341b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013700172300001600309520096600325592002801291650002101319650001601340650002401356650002201380650001501402650001901417650001201436653002301448653002201471653002001493653004001513700002001553773009301573856008301666852000901749655001201758IND60606907820221119021623.0180730e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060690782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMizobuchi, Kenichi10aReplacement or additional purchase: The impact of energy-efficient appliances on household electricity saving under public pressures  ap. 137-148.  aThis study examined the influence of additional and replacement purchases of energy-efficient air-conditioners on power savings. We used a questionnaire survey and measured electricity use data from 339 Japanese households, collected from two city areas with different level of government-requested electricity-saving rates, namely, Osaka (10%) and Matsuyama (5%). The main findings of our study are as follows: (1) Households that purchased energy-efficient air-conditioners saved more electricity than those that did not. (2) “Additional-purchase households” showed significant energy savings, whereas “replacement households” did not. The rebound effect may negate the energy-saving effects of a new air-conditioner. (3) Altruistic attitude is associated with more active participation in power saving. (4) Households in Osaka saved more electricity than those in Matsuyama, probably because the government call to save electricity was more forceful.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aelectricity 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3ahouseholds 3aquestionnaires 3asurveys 0aElectricity demand 0aEnergy efficiency 0aHome appliances 0aElectricity conservation directives1 aTakeuchi, Kenji0 tEnergy policy.g2016 June, v. 93 p.137-148dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2016.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01325naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011900158300001800277520034700295592002800642650001100670650002100681650002000702650001700722650001200739700002000751700001900771700001700790773012100807856007400928852000901002655001201011IND60664751620221121034254.0190912e20131219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066475162DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45863f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Chanhoon10aMulti-functionalities of natural polysaccharide for enhancing electrochemical performance of macroporous Si anodes  ap. 3070-3074.  aHighly porous electrodes composed of natural polysaccharide act as a microporous binder and a carbon-coating source of micron-sized macroporous Si active materials was achieved.

This study evaluated the ability of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) coupled with partial least squares regression (PLSR) to rapidly predict soil properties affected by land use change from agriculture (mainly pasture) to Eucalyptus globulus plantations in south-western Australia. We measured total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (Total N), TOC/Total N (C/N ratio), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and total phosphorus (Total P). The PLSR calibration models were developed using mid-infrared (MIR) spectra (4000 to 450 cm⁻¹) and square root transformed measured soil data (n = 180) from 23 paired pasture and E. globulus plantation sites representing the soils and climate of E. globulus plantation estates in south-western Australia. The calibration models for TOC, Total N, C/N ratio and Total P showed excellent correlations between measured and predicted data with coefficient of determination (R²) exceeding 0.91 and minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE) of calibration [TOC (R² = 0.95, RMSE = 0.36), Total N (R² = 0.96, RMSE = 0.10), C/N ratio (R² = 0.92, RMSE = 0.14) and Total P (R² = 0.91, RMSE = 0.06)]. The calibration models had reasonable predictions for MBC (R² = 0.66, RMSE = 0.07) and MBN (R² = 0.63, RMSE = 0.06). The calibrated models were validated using soils from 8 independent paired pasture and E. globulus sites (n = 64). The validated predictions were excellent for TOC (R² = 0.92, RMSE = 0.40) and Total N (R² = 0.91, RMSE = 0.12), but less so for C/N ratio (R² = 0.80, RMSE = 0.35), MBC (R² = 0.70, RMSE = 0.08) and Total P (R² = 0.75, RMSE = 0.12). The results demonstrate the potential of MIRS-PLSR to rapidly, accurately and simultaneously determine several properties in land use change affected soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus globulus 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3aclimate 3acost effectiveness 3aland use change 3aleast squares 3amicrobial biomass 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aorganic carbon 3apastures 3aphosphorus 3aplantations 3aprediction 3arapid methods 3asoil properties 3aspectroscopy 3aAustralia 0aPartial least squares regression 0aTotal organic carbon 0aSoil nitrogen 0aMicrobial biomass 0aCalibration model 0aForest plantation1 aKitching, Matt1 aMendham, Daniel S.1 aWeston, Christopher J.1 aBaker, Thomas G.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 June 15, v. 175 p.67-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.03.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245008200178300001600260500000900276500001500285520117200300592002801472650001901500650002401519650001301543650001301556650002201569650002101591650001401612653001301626700001901639700001801658773012101676852000901797856009801806655001201904IND8904272120221120100226.0191122e198703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890427212DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1987.0011183X002700020047x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTyler, J.

Therefore, two sources of resistance are being combined in several wheat breeding programs. This requires the evaluation of progeny for reaction to two greenbug biotypes instead of one. Our objective was to test the efficacy of infesting seedlings in the greenhouse with green bugs of two biotypes simultaneously. Such a procedure, if feasible, could economize breeding protocols. OK81322, resistant to biotypes B and C, a ‘Largo’ derivative, resistant to biotypes C and E, and F₁, and F₂, progeny from the crosses of these genotypes were infested with a 1:1 mixture of biotypes B and E greenbugs. All plants of both parental genotypes were susceptible, all F₁, plants were resistant, and the population of F₂, plants segregated for greenbug resistance. Results indicated that evaluation of breeding material with mixed greenbug populations is reliable, and this technique should be more efficient than conducting separate biotype tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant breeding 3aSchizaphis graminum 3amixtures 3abiotypes 3aTriticum aestivum 3abreeding methods 3ascreening 0agenotype1 aWebster, J.

However, market failure often limit smallholders’ fair access to market opportunities. To address this problem, a market-oriented agroforestry action research program was implemented in six sites of Kavre and Lamjung districts of Nepal between 2013 and 2016. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the changing impacts of the market-oriented agroforestry system on improving people’s livelihoods and addressing food security issues. The net-margin analysis of five priority products of agroforestry systems indicated that farmers benefitted most by a banana-based high yielding fodder system (56%) followed by Alnus-cardamom system (48%), tomato-fodder and buffalo (36%), chilli-fodder (26%) and ginger-based (25%) systems due to facilitation of market-oriented agroforestry action research services. The impact of market-oriented agroforestry intervention from a survey of 289 households, revealed that household income was increased by 37–48%, which can provide up to six additional months of food to the poorest households. This innovation has the potential to take the majority of households (63%) out of the poverty cycle while avoiding food shortage during the year. The implications of the study are that farmers must be united for collective marketing of their production and develop marketing strategies to eliminate middle men for better return. Some key lessons learned for the success of this research include farmers’ own motivation, favorable environment, and the inclusion of social activities and incentives for cultivating priority products species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3abuffaloes 3afarm income 3afarmers 3afood security 3afood shortages 3aforage 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3alivelihood 3amarket access 3amarketing strategies 3amarkets 3amen 3amotivation 3apoverty 3aresearch programs 3asurveys 3aNepal1 aNuberg, Ian1 aShrestha, Krishna K.1 aCedamon, Edwin1 aAmatya, S.

Unfortunately, no treatment (in the form of vaccines or drugs) is available for most of these diseases and vector control is still the main form of prevention. The limitations of traditional insecticide-based strategies, particularly the development of insecticide resistance, have resulted in significant efforts to develop alternative eco-friendly methods. Biocontrol strategies aim to be sustainable and target a range of different mosquito species to reduce the current reliance on insecticide-based mosquito control. In this review, we outline non-insecticide based strategies that have been implemented or are currently being tested. We also highlight the use of mosquito behavioural knowledge that can be exploited for control strategies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBancroftian filariasis 3aCulicidae 3aDengue virus 3aZika virus 3aarboviruses 3aarthropods 3abiological control 3ahuman diseases 3ainsect vectors 3ainsecticide resistance 3amalaria 3amosquito control 3avaccines 3avector control1 aJeffries, Claire L.1 aWalker, Thomas0 tInsects.g2016 Oct. 03, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2273x2075-44507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/insects70400523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009600158300001800254520112000272592002801392650002201420650001601442650001501458650002101473650001501494650001701509650002201526650001001548650002401558650001101582700001701593700001901610700001201629700001201641700001501653700001701668700001801685700001601703773012101719856007401840852000901914655001201923IND60664751720221121034308.0190912e20131220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066475172DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45866k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Bingkun10aFacile synthesis of ZnWO₄ nanowall arrays on Ni foam for high performance supercapacitors  ap. 4212-4217.  aIn this report, ZnWO₄ nanowall arrays (NWAs) were grown on Ni foam by a hydrothermal route and investigated for application in supercapacitors for the first time. The resulting NWAs were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. ZnWO₄ NWAs exhibited high electrochemical property with a specific capacitance of 2.5 F cm⁻² at a charge and discharge current density of 20 mA cm⁻² (1250 F g⁻¹ at current density of 10 A g⁻¹). Furthermore, they showed an excellent cycling ability at different current densities up to 100 mA cm⁻², and 92% (2.3 F cm⁻²) of the initial capacitance remained after 4000 cycles. The open network structure consisting of interconnected ZnWO₄ NWAs directly grown on current collectors is advantageous for electron transport and electrolyte diffusion which can facilitate the electrochemical reaction. Our work not only demonstrated a facile hydrothermal method for ZnWO₄ NWAs directly grown on Ni foam, but also revealed ZnWO₄ to be a promising electrode for high-property supercapacitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acapacitance 3acollectors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3afoams 3ahot water treatment 3anickel1 aHu, Lingling1 aZhang, Guanhua1 aGuo, Di1 aFu, Tao1 aLi, Jidong1 aDuan, Huigao1 aLi, Chengchao1 aLi, Qiuhong0 tRSC advances.g2013 Dec. 20, v. 4, no. 9 p.4212-4217dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra45866k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245013700168520107200305592002801377650001301405650003401418650002101452650002501473650001901498650001701517650002101534653003001555653004301585653001701628653000901645653003001654700001801684700001701702700001701719700001701736700001401753700001801767700001701785700001801802700001701820700001601837700001701853773010601870856008701976852000902063655001202072IND60767909520221119110119.0220314e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076790952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2022.1268512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jiaqi10aImproving oxygen reduction reaction of microbial fuel cell by titanium dioxide attaching to dual metal organic frameworks as cathode  aIn this study, a two-step simple distributed feeding method was used to prepare the core–shell nanocomposite dual metal organic frameworks (D-MOFs, TiO₂@ZIF-67/ZIF-8).

The method has been incorporated into the Che Shift-2 protein validation Web server. To test the reliability of the provided set of (χ1/χ2) torsional angles, the side chains of all reported conformations of five NMR-determined protein models were refined by a simple routine, without using NOE-based distance restraints. The refinement of each of these five proteins leads to optimal agreement between the observed and computed ¹³C ᵅ and ¹³C ᵝ chemical shifts for ∼94% of the flaws, on average, without introducing a significantly large number of violations of the NOE-based distance restraints for a distance range ≤ 0.5 , in which the largest number of distance violations occurs. The results of this work suggest that use of the provided set of (χ1/χ2) torsional angles together with other observables, such as NOEs, should lead to a fast and accurate refinement of the side-chain conformations of protein models.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3amodels 3aproteins 3astable isotopes1 aArnautova, Yelena A.1 aIcazatti, Alejandro A.1 aScheraga, Harold Abraham,d1921-1 aVila, Jorge A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 110, no. 42 p.16826-16831dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13155251103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245008500190300001600275520183900291592002802130650001702158650001002175650002002185650001902205650002002224650001502244650001802259650002102277650002302298650001402321650002302335650001702358650001702375650001302392650003202405650001302437650002002450650001402470650001602484650005902500650003902559650001502598650004602613650001802659650002202677650002102699650001102720650004302731650002502774650005202799700001702851700002102868700002502889700002102914700002802935773008302963856008103046852000903127655001203136IND4470911420221119090205.0141112e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447091142DNAL7 a226773562pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2012.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuscaritoli, Maurizio10aNutritional and metabolic support in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  ap. 959-966.  aAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of progressive motor neuron disease and the most devastating neurodegenerative disorder. ALS is characterized by progressive paralysis and respiratory failure leading to death within 3 to 5 years after its onset. Protein–energy malnutrition is a frequent finding in ALS. The pathogenesis of protein–energy malnutrition in ALS is multifactorial. Muscle atrophy, hypophagia, dysphagia, and hypermetabolism play a role in determining the deterioration of nutritional status. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to set an appropriate plan for metabolic and nutritional support in ALS. Nutritional management incorporates a continuous assessment and implementation of dietary modifications throughout the duration of the disease. The nutritional and metabolic approaches to ALS should start when the diagnosis of ALS is made and should become an integral part of the continuous care to the patient, including nutritional surveillance, dietary counseling, management of dysphagia, and enteral nutrition when needed. Parenteral nutrition is rarely indicated. Standard polymeric enteral formulas are routinely used, usually providing 25 to 30 kcal/kg and protein 0.8 to 1.2 g /kg per day. The use of fiber-enriched formulas may help prevent constipation. However, considering the complex metabolic abnormalities of ALS, standard and/or fiber-enriched formulas might not be sufficient to achieve optimal metabolic and nutritional support. Based on the most recent clinical and experimental evidence, it is tempting to hypothesize that personalized nutritional support including specific nutritional substrates could act on disease progression and improve the quality of life and the response to the few and yet scarcely effective, currently available pharmacologic therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstipation 3adeath 3adiet counseling 3adisease course 3aenteral feeding 3amonitoring 3amotor neurons 3amuscular atrophy 3anutritional status 3aparalysis 3aparenteral feeding 3apathogenesis 3apatient care 3apatients 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3aproteins 3aquality of life 3asclerosis 3aundereating 2aAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosisxcomplicationsxtherapy. 2aConstipationxprevention & control 2aCounseling 2aDeglutition Disordersxetiologyxtherapy. 2aDietary Fiber 2aEnteral Nutrition 2aFood, Formulated 2aHumans 2aMetabolic Diseasesxetiologyxtherapy. 2aNutrition Assessment 2aProtein-Energy Malnutritionxetiologyxtherapy.1 aKushta, Irma1 aMolfino, Alessio1 aInghilleri, Maurizio1 aSabatelli, Mario1 aRossi-Fanelli, Filippo,0 tNutrition.g2012 Oct., v. 28, no. 10 p.959-966dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2012.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245012500179300001600304520096900320592002801289650001401317650001701331650001701348650001701365650001701382650001401399650001901413650001701432650000901449650001701458650002901475650004401504650001601548653001401564653002601578653001301604653002301617700001701640700001901657700001801676700002201694700001401716700002301730773010001753856008701853852000901940655001201949IND60563972620221117182325.0190402e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056397262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiró-Abella, Eugènia10aDetermination of mycotoxins in plant-based beverages using QuEChERS and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 366-372.  aA method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 11 mycotoxins in plant-based beverage matrices, using a QuEChERS extraction followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry detection (UHPLC–(ESI)MS/MS).

Here, we are reporting about the role of the copper substrate purity and its crystallographic orientation in the quality of the graphene grown using a low pressure chemical vapor deposition technique. Graphene is grown on three different (Cu-I, Cu-II and Cu-III) substrates of different purity under analogous conditions of optimized pre-growth annealing and cleaning processes. Irrespective of the purity level of all the substrates, it is demonstrated that monolayer graphene (IG′/IG ∼ 4) with different defect density is observed. The amount of defects and the defect density in the three samples is correlated with the different lattice planes of Cu, which are participating during the growth process. The size of the lattice grain advance upon annealing is observed and it is substrate purity dependent. This reveals that graphene growth is favored by either the (111) or the (100) plane or both. It is demonstrated that the substrate purity is extremely accountable for the growth of defect free monolayer graphene for device applications which require ballistic transport properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acleaning 3acopper 3agraphene 3aphotons 3avapors1 aSingh, Dilip K.1 aSubhedar, Kiran M.1 aDhakate, Sanjay R.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Aug. 13, v. 5, no. 85 p.69110-69118dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra13480c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245009100163300001800254520159600272592002801868650000801896650001201904650001401916650003701930650000901967650002101976650001101997650001102008650000902019650001302028650003302041650001602074700002402090700001902114700001802133700001802151700002502169773010302194856007502297852000902372655001202381IND60534256120170629000000.0160802e20150521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053425612DNAL7 a10.1021/ef502275j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO’Hagan, Conor
P.10aPorosity-Based Corrosion Model for Alkali Halide Ash Deposits during Biomass Co-firing  ap. 3082-3095.  aThis paper presents a physics-based model to describe accelerated corrosion because of alkali-halide-containing deposits, which form on superheater tube walls during biomass co-firing. Increased rates of corrosion during the co-firing of peat with biomass have been identified as a limiting factor on the level of biomass, which is viable to use at elevated temperatures. In the present work, a synthetic salt, representative of a 70:30 peat/biomass mix, has been applied to pure iron samples in air at 540 and 600 °C. The corrosion layers have been examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy (OM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy elemental mapping to provide insight into the material degradation and structure of the corrosion layer. Two distinct types of oxides are found to form on the iron substrate. Initially, a compact, uniform oxide layer forms over the substrate. As the process continues, this oxide layer degrades, leading to spalling, which sees the broken oxide pieces mix with the salt layer. Additional test samples were examined without deposits as controls to highlight the accelerated rate of corrosion. Two modeling techniques are examined: the widely used labyrinth factor method (LFM) and the newly proposed porosity-based corrosion method (PCM). The PCM uses measurements of porosity and pore radius, coupled with a physically based corrosion mechanism, to predict corrosion rates. Results from the two modeling techniques are compared, and both agree satisfactorily with experimental measurements for times of up to 28 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abiomass 3acorrosion 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3airon 3alight microscopy 3amodels 3aoxides 3apeat 3aporosity 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature1 aO’Brien, Barry J.1 aGriffin, Fionn1 aHooper, Barry1 aLeen, Sean B.1 aMonaghan, Rory F.

Among other blends (OC 90:10 w/w and SC 90:10 w/w), OSC (45:45:10, w/w), presented the most nutritionally interesting amounts of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids, as well as behenic acid. Interesterification caused an increase in crystallization time and a decrease in the solid fat content in all blends. The fatty acid redistribution in the TAGs caused a change in thermal behavior, leading to a decrease in the onset and end temperatures during crystallization, which indicates that new TAGs were formed. Regarding regiospecificity, Lipozyme TL IM lipase acted randomly, while Rhizopus sp. lipase was specific for the sn-1,3 position. Therefore, it was possible to synthesize SLs presenting different physical and chemical properties, compared to the original OSC blend, containing behenic acid at the sn-1,3 position and unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position, by enzymatic interesterification catalyzed either by Lipozyme TL IM or by Rhizopus sp. lipases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhizopus 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3acatalysts 3acrambe seed oil 3acrystallization 3aenzymatic interesterification 3aessential fatty acids 3alipid content 3aolive oil 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asoybean oil 3astructured lipids 3atemperature 3athermal properties 0aEnzymatic interesterification 0aRegiospecificity 0aBehenic acid1 aRact, Juliana Neves Rodrigues1 aRibeiro, Ana Paula Badan1 aMacedo, Gabriela Alves0 tFood research international.g2017 Sept., v. 99 p.713-719dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2017.06.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01936naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245013700170300001600307520068300323592002801006650001801034650001001052650002701062650002101089650002601110650002301136650001601159650002001175650002401195650003401219650001801253700002501271700002401296700002501320700002301345773011301368856004801481852000901529655001201538IND50089266220221118102158.0140503e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008926622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-005-1138-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVasiliadou, Sophia10aEffect of smoking on quality parameters of farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.) and sensory attributes of the smoked product  ap. 232-236.  aThe effect of smoking on the proximate composition, chemical parameters and microbial loads of farmed gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata L.), as well as the sensory attributes of the smoked product were investigated.

We thereby aim for the identification of FGs that are characteristic for molecules produced by living organisms. In our analysis we also include information about the natural origins of the structures investigated, allowing us to link the occurrence of specific FGs to the individual producing species. Our findings have the potential for being applied in a medicinal chemistry context concerning the synthesis of natural product-like libraries and natural product-inspired fragment collections. The results may be used also to support compound derivatization strategies and the design of “non-natural” natural products.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemoinformatics 3aderivatization 3amoieties1 aSchuhmann, Tim0 tJournal of natural products.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 82, no. 5 p.1258-1263dAmerican Chemical Society and American Society of PharmacognosywJournal:jnl11422x1520-60257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jnatprod.8b010223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04369naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008400158500001900242520313800261592002803399650001203427650001103439650001303450650002603463650001903489650004303508650001603551650000903567650001803576650001603594650001503610700001903625700002003644700001803664700002103682700001703703700001603720773012803736856007403864852000903938655001203947IND60737145220221119064849.0210514e20210427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073714522DNAL7 a10.3390/rs130916992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGu, Lingxiao 10aAngle Effect on Typical Optical Remote Sensing Indices in Vegetation Monitoring  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOptical remote sensing indices play an important role in vegetation information extraction and have been widely serving ecology, agriculture and forestry, urban monitoring, and other communities. Remote sensing indices are constructed from individual bands depending on special characteristics to enhance the typical spectral features for the identification or distinction of surface land covers. With the development of quantitative remote sensing, there is a rapid increasing requirement for accurate data processing and modeling. It is well known that the geometry-induced variation observed in surface reflectance is not ignorable, but the situation of uncertainty thereby introduced into these indices still needs further detailed understanding. We adopted the ground multi-angle hyperspectrum, spectral response function (SRF) of Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+), Operational Land Imager (OLI), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) optical sensors and simulated their sensor-like spectral reflectance; then, we investigated the potential angle effect uncertainty on optical indices that have been frequently involved in vegetation monitoring and examined the forward/backward effect over both the ground-based level and the actual Landsat TM/ETM+ overlapped region. Our results on the discussed indices and sensors show as following: (1) Identifiable angle effects exist with a more elevated influence than that introduced by band difference among sensors; (2) The absolute difference between forward and backward direction can reach up to −0.03 to 0.1 within bands of the TM/ETM+ overlapped region; (3) The investigation at ground level indicates that there are different variations of angle effect transmitted to each remote sensing index. Regarding cases of crop canopy at various growth phases, most of the discussed indices have more than a 20% relative difference to nadir value except Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) with the magnitude lower than 10%, and less than 16% of Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). For the case of wax maturity stage, the relative difference to nadir value of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Char Soil Index (CSI), NBR, Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and SWIR2/NIR exceeded 50%, while the values for NBR and NDMI can reach up to 115.8% and 206.7%, respectively; (4) Various schemes of index construction imply different propagation of angle effect uncertainty. The “difference” indices can partially suppress the directional influence, while the “ratio” indices show high potential to amplify the angle effect. This study reveals that the angle-induced uncertainty of these indices is greater than that induced by the spectrum mismatch among sensors, especially under the case of senescence. In addition, based on this work, indices with a suppressed potential of angle effect are recommended for vegetation monitoring or information retrieval to avoid unexpected effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acanopy 3aforestry 3ainformation retrieval 3amaturity stage 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3areflectance 3asoil 3athematic maps 3auncertainty 3avegetation1 aShuai, Yanmin 1 aShao, Congying 1 aXie, Donghui 1 aZhang, Qingling 1 aLi, Yaoming 1 aYang, Jian 0 tRemote Sensing.g2021 Apr. 27, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs130916993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01750naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100002600153245011500179300001600294500001500310520078500325592002801110650002001138650002401158650002301182653002101205700002401226773011901250852000901369856008201378655001201460991601777460742620221120045054.0181030e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891283362DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517578048007032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBertoniere, Noelie R.10aPrepolymers of Chloroalkyl Phosphonates and Polyethylenimine as Flame Retardants for Cotton-Containing Fabrics  ap. 385-389.  a2019-12-06  aWater-soluble prepolymers of predominantly monomeric (Antiblaze 78) and dimeric (Antiblaze 77) chloroalkyl phosphonates and polyethylenimine (PEI) were prepared and applied to lightweight cotton containing fabrics These prepolymers imparted flame resistance to all-cotton fabrics and to a lesser degree to cotton poly ester blends.

Nitrate (NO₃), nitrite (NO₂), ammonia (NH₄), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total phosphorus, chloride, total organic carbon, pH, trace metals, fecal coliform, dissolved oxygen (DO), and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) were monitored. Productivity of a dominant shrub, Iva frutescens, in the wetland was also assessed. Research results indicated that gradients of chloride and salinity concentrations showed a broad mixing of the discharged fresh water into the more saline natural brackish waters. This provided an ideal pattern for nutrient assimilation by the receiving marsh. NH₄ was reduced in the range of 50–100% when all combinations of sources and outflows were considered. For total phosphorus and TKN, reduction ranged from 0–95.1% and 11.2–89.7%, respectively. Some nutrient concentrations in the effluent outlet, NO₃ in particular, were lower than background concentrations found in the reference wetland. Sediment and water showed no significant deficiency or toxicity problems for the major nutrients and metals analyzed.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term survival of outplanted abalone 3–7 years after their release and thus determine their contribution to local population densities at three different outplanting sites. We identified outplanted abalone by genotyping epipodal tentacles sampled from wild-caught abalone for seven microsatellite loci. We then used three different pedigree reconstruction programs: one that used genotypes from hatchery-reared siblings (PEDIGREE 2.2), one that used the wild parent genotypes that were available (CERVUS 3.0), and one that used both sources of information (COLONY 2.0). Each program identified different but partially overlapping subsets of hatchery-outplanted offspring. From this we inferred that up to 26% of the individuals sampled at the main outplanting site were from hatchery spawnings. Despite this large contribution of hatchery-reared stock, the density of mature abalone at each site was below the level required for successful fertilization. More intensive outplanting efforts might increase population densities of this broadcast spawner above this minimum sustainable level. However, for supplementation to be successful, other factors that could reduce outplanted juvenile survival, including the low genetic diversity of hatchery-produced offspring and the low habitat quality of some outplanting sites, need to be monitored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHaliotis kamtschatkana 3aabalone 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahabitats 3ahatcheries 3ainformation sources 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3apedigree 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3aprogeny 3asiblings 3asounds1 aLemay, Matthew A.1 aAcheson, Stephanie1 aBoulding, Elizabeth G.0 tConservation genetics.g2012 June, v. 13, no. 3 p.801-810dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-012-0330-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01268naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011400157300001800271520030400289592002800593650002300621650002700644650002300671650002700694700002000721700001900741773013400760856007500894852000900969655001200978IND60658742620221120124957.0190826e20101012xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065874262DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc01966f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chaolong10aAmine-catalyzed (3+n) annulations of 2-(acetoxymethyl)buta-2,3-dienoates with 1,n-bisnucleophiles (n = 3–5)  ap. 7828-7830.  aA tertiary amine-catalyzed formal (3+n) annulation of 2-(acetoxymethyl)buta-2,3-dienoate with 1,n-binucleophiles has been developed, which provides a facile entry to heterocyclic compounds.

An interview was carried out through a questionnaire developed according to the reference guide of the state government. Plasma and urine samples were screened for Aluminum, Chromium, Manganese, Copper, Nickel, Cobalt, Zinc, Arsenic, Selenium, Cadmium, Antimony, Barium, Mercury, Lead and Uranium, with a technique for fast determination of these elemental contents in biological material utilizing dynamic reaction cell inductively coupled mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis was used to identify associations between these elemental contents in biological samples and the information obtained from the interviews. The farmers showed some trace elements in plasma and urine at a higher concentration than unexposed populations from other studies. This study highlights recent findings of trace elements in biological material and their association with characteristics of pesticide use. In addition, it also contributes to the gap in the literature regarding trace elements content in plasma and urine of workers exposed to pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data  a35591.433.38503.22082016cSecretaria de Ciência, Tecnologia e Ensino Superior, Governo do Estado de Parana (BR)  a001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aaluminum 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3abarium 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3across-sectional studies 3aexcretion 3amanganese 3amass spectrometry 3amercury 3anickel 3apesticides 3apollution 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquestionnaires 3aresearch 3aselenium 3astate government 3auranium 3aurine 3avineyards 3azinc 3aBrazil1 aAguera, Raul Gomes1 aHoeltgebaum, Danielle1 aPaniz, Fernanda Pollo1 aPedron, Tatiana1 aCapelari, Silvia1 aMonteiro, Lucilena Rebelo1 aMachinski Junior, Miguel1 aNerilo, Samuel Botião1 aBatista, Bruno Lemos1 ade Oliveira, Magda Lúcia Félix1 aMossini, Simone Aparecida Galerani1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9535-09830 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2021 Oct., v. 28, no. 37 p.51841-51853dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14384-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02317naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001100152245009400163300001600257520088800273592002801161650001501189650002201204650000901226650001601235650001901251650002001270650001301290650003801303650002201341650002001363650001301383650002501396653003901421653001001460653002001470653002001490653000901510653001001519700001801529700002101547700002001568700001901588700002001607773010001627856008701727852000901814655001201823IND60563973120221120030124.0190402e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056397312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Lu10aBiomimetic ELISA detection of malachite green based on molecularly imprinted polymer film  ap. 403-408.  aA highly selective and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of malachite green (MG) using a molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) film as bionic antibody. The MIP film, based on the self-polymerization of dopamine, was fabricated on the surfaces of a 96-well microplate. It showed specific recognition for MG in aqueous solution. A direct competitive ELISA method was established with the sensitivity reaching 10.31μgL−1 and the detection limit being 0.3μgL−1. The cross-reactivity of two structural analogues to MG was less than 10%. The average recovery tested by MG standard spiking was 88.8% for bass and 90.4% for water, and the relative standard deviations were less than 3.6%. All the above results indicated that the developed method could be used to detect MG in fish and water samples rapidly, specifically and accurately.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aaqueous solutions 3abass 3abiomimetics 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3adopamine 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afilms (materials) 3amalachite green 3apolymers 3astatistical analysis 0aMolecularly imprinted polymer film 0aELISA 0aMalachite green 0aBionic antibody 0aFish 0aWater1 aPeng, Ai-hong1 aLin, Zheng-zhong1 aZhong, Hui-ping1 aChen, Xiao-mei1 aHuang, Zhi-yong0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 229 p.403-408dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245012300159500001900282520145700301592002801758650001901786650002001805650001201825650001401837650002201851650001601873650001601889650001001905650001501915651001901930700001901949700001701968773011901985856007302104852000902177655001202186IND60737145720221119064900.0210514e20210421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073714572DNAL7 a10.3390/w130911432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeutscher, Jan 12aA Unique Approach on How to Work Around the Common Uncertainties of Local Field Data in the PERSiST Hydrological Model  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the last two decades, the effects of global climate change have caused a continuous drying out of temperate landscapes. One way in which drying out has manifested is as a visible decrease in the streamflow in the water recipients. This article aims to answer the questions of how severe this streamflow decrease is and what is its main cause. The article is based on the analysis of daily streamflow, temperature, and precipitation data during five years (1 November 2014 to 31 October 2019) in a spruce-dominated temperate upland catchment located in the Czech Republic. Streamflow values were modeled in the PERSiST hydrological model using precipitation and temperature values obtained from the observational E-OBS gridded dataset and calibrated against in situ measured discharge. Our modeling exercise results show that the trend of decreasing water amounts in forest streams was very significant in the five-year study period, as shown in the example of the experimental catchment Křtiny, where it reached over −65%. This trend is most likely caused by increasing temperature. An unexpected disproportion was found in the ratio of increasing temperature to decreasing discharge during the growing seasons, which can be simplified to an increasing trend in the mean daily temperature of +1% per season, effectively causing a decreasing trend in the discharge of −10% per season regardless of the increasing precipitation during the period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3aforests 3ahighlands 3ahydrologic models 3astream flow 3atemperature 3awater 3awatersheds 3aCzech Republic1 aHemr, Ondřej 1 aKupec, Petr 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 21, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130911433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014100161300001800302520186500320592002802185650002202213650002402235650001702259650001502276650002602291650002402317650001302341650002802354650001802382650001102400650001502411650001702426650001402443650003202457650001402489650000902503650001202512700002002524700002002544773009302564856007302657852000902730655001202739IND60478955320221122155439.0160116e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047895532DNAL7 a10.1111/oik.022722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLagrue, Clément,10aInterspecific differences in antipredator strategies determine the strength of non‐consumptive predator effects on stream detritivores  ap. 1589-1596.  aAnimal species differ considerably in their response to predation risks. Interspecific variability in prey behaviour and morphology can alter cascading effects of predators on ecosystem structure and functioning. We tested whether species‐specific morphological defenses may affect responses of leaf litter consuming invertebrate prey to sit‐and‐wait predators, the odonate Cordulegaster boltonii larvae, in aquatic food webs. Partly or completely blocking the predator mouthparts (mandibles and/or extensible labium), thus eliminating consumptive (i.e. lethal) predator effects, we created a gradient of predator‐prey interaction intensities (no predator < predator – no attack < predator – non‐lethal attacks < lethal predator). A field experiment was first used to assess both consumptive and non‐consumptive predator effects on leaf litter decomposition and prey abundances. Laboratory microcosms were then used to examine behavioural responses of armored and non‐armored prey to predation risk and their consequences on litter decomposition. Results show that armored and non‐armored prey responded to both acute (predator – non‐lethal attacks) and chronic (predator – no attack) predation risks. Acute predation risk had stronger effects on litter decomposition, prey feeding rate and prey habitat use than predator presence alone (chronic predation risk). Predator presence induced a reduction in feeding activity (i.e. resource consumption) of both prey types but a shift to predator‐free habitat patches in non‐armored detritivores only. Non‐consumptive predator effects on prey subsequently decreased litter decomposition rate. Species‐specific prey morphological defenses and behaviour should thus be considered when studying non‐consumptive predator effects on prey community structure and ecosystem functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic food webs 3acommunity structure 3adetritivores 3aecosystems 3afield experimentation 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ainterspecific variation 3ainvertebrates 3alarvae 3amouthparts 3aplant litter 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators 3arisk 3astreams1 aBesson, Anne A.1 aLecerf, Antoine0 tOikos.g2015 Dec., v. 124, no. 12 p.1589-1596dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.022723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02453naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003100149245016100180500002200341520126400363592002801627650002301655650001301678650001201691650002201703650001101725650002001736651001001756653003401766653002101800653002001821653002401841653001201865700002201877700001801899773005801917856008301975852000902058655001202067IND60584780220221120054553.0171028s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058478022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFalcone, Pasquale Marcello14aThe networking dynamics of the Italian biofuel industry in time of crisis: finding an effective instrument mix for fostering a sustainable energy transition  aPre-press version  aThis paper aims to design the effective instrument mixes for fostering a sustainable energy transition in times of crises. We focus on a sufficiently developed green niche – namely the Italian biofuel sector – implementing a two-step investigation: 1) a social network analysis, to study the effects of the crisis on the basic niche development mechanisms, with the aim of eliciting its development needs; 2) a fuzzy inference simulation based on a causal-effect map drawn from experts’ knowledge to identify the most effective instrument mix for the development of the niche studied. The major needs emerged in the case investigated are for an increase of actors’ expectations towards the further development of the sector, and a need for a tailored networking activity, devoted to attracting specific knowledgeable actors. The results indicate that, among others, effective policy instruments are, in this case, the cooperation that has the best outcome in terms of networking, and the public procurement, which remarkably increases the level of expectation. The analysis presented constitutes a model to evaluate single policy drivers and their combinations to find adequate policy actions to promote the green energy transition in times of crisis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioenergy industry 3abiofuels 3aexperts 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3asocial networks 3aItaly 0aSustainable Energy Transition 0aInstrument mixes 0aEconomic Crisis 0aFuzzy Cognitive Map 0aBiofuel1 aLopolito, Antonio1 aSica, Edgardo0 tEnergy Policy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005100151245014600202520164300348592002801991650001502019650002402034650002202058650001102080650001302091650001902104650001102123653002402134653003702158653003402195653003302229653002902262700006102291700001502352700001802367700001502385773011302400856008602513852000902599655001202608IND60727161020221117013454.0220103e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072716102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1261212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXin, Xu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0780-156X10aEnergy-efficient scheduling for a permutation flow shop with variable transportation time using an improved discrete whale swarm optimization  aAs environmental issues become more serious, energy-efficient scheduling has emerged as a research hotspot. Although permutation flow shop scheduling has attracted substantial research attention, practical cases that consider conveyor speed control energy-saving strategies have rarely been studied. Motivated by this gap, this paper addresses a permutation flow shop scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup time considering a novel conveyor speed control energy-saving strategy. The aim is to find the optimal processing sequence of jobs and conveyor belt speed setting scheme between any two nodes (i.e., machine or warehouse). A mixed-integer linear programming model is established to minimize both the makespan and total energy consumption. To solve such a bi-objective model, an improved discrete whale swarm optimization (IDWSO) is designed that combines differential evolution, augmented search and job-swapped mutation to enhance performance. Numerical experiments are carried out to compare the performance of the IDWSO with existing algorithms, including the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) and the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D). Sensitivity analyses on energy-saving strategies under different scale problems/alternative conveyor speeds are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the model and algorithm. The experimental results show that the IDWSO is superior to the NSGA-II and MOEA/D for this case. In addition, the proposed conveyor speed control energy-saving strategy is found to be an effective way for manufacturers to achieve green production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy conservation 3aenergy efficiency 3amodels 3amutation 3atransportation 3awhales 0aGreen manufacturing 0aPermutation flow shop scheduling 0aSequence-dependent setup time 0aVariable transportation time 0aWhale swarm optimization1 aJiang, Qiangqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8874-97261 aLi, Sihang1 aGong, Shuaiyu1 aChen, Kang0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 293 p.126121-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2021.1261213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02226naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012400174300001600298520091700314592002801231650000801259650001601267650002501283650000901308650001501317650001701332650002001349650001001369650001701379650003001396650000901426650001901435650002701454653001401481653001401495653001701509653001901526700002001545700001901565773010001584856008701684852000901771655001201780IND60563973320221120031742.0190402e20170815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056397332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.0852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Kyung-Young10aUltra-fast DNA-based multiplex convection PCR method for meat species identification with possible on-site applications  ap. 341-346.  aThe aim of this study was to develop an ultra-fast molecular detection method for meat identification using convection Palm polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene was used as a target gene. Amplicon size was designed to be different for beef, lamb, and pork. When these primer sets were used, each species-specific set specifically detected the target meat species in singleplex and multiplex modes in a 24min PCR run. The detection limit was 1pg of DNA for each meat species. The convection PCR method could detect as low as 1% of meat adulteration. The stability of the assay was confirmed using thermal processed meats. We also showed that direct PCR can be successfully performed with mixed meats and food samples. These results suggest that the developed assay may be useful in the authentication of meats and meat products in laboratory and rapid on-site applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aadulterated products 3abeef 3aconvection 3acytochrome b 3adetection limit 3agenes 3amitochondria 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apork 3aprocessed meat 3aspecies identification 0aDNA-based 0aMultiplex 0aMeat species 0aConvection PCR1 aHwang, Hyun Jin1 aKim, Jeong Hee0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Aug. 15, v. 229 p.341-346dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.02.0853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01204naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011000159520035700269592002800626650002000654650001600674650001900690650002900709773012800738856007500866852000900941655001200950IND60769834120221118061603.0220310e20220224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076983412DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140511042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalano, Mimmo 10aEditorial for the Special Issue: “Ground Deformation Patterns Detection by InSAR and GNSS Techniques”  aIn the last two decades, the rapid growth in continuous Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) networks and improvements in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) imaging allowed the acquisition of continuous and spatially extensive datasets over large regions of Earth, significantly increasing the range of geoscience applications [...]  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3adeformation 3ainterferometry 3asynthetic aperture radar0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Feb. 24, v. 14, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140511043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01484naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245009700207300001600304520055100320592002800871650002800899650001300927650001100940650001900951650001700970650001300987773010301000856008201103852000901185655001201194IND60593441720221121162311.0210214e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059344172DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-018-2548-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiglio, Gianluca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6602-209910aAnalysis of fumarate-sensitive proteins and sites by exploiting residue interaction networks  ap. 647-652.  aFumarate adduction to cysteines has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several disorders.

Land use and land cover are incorporated as elements of the human and environment system respectively. Drivers and associated processes that influence land use, land cover, and land system dynamics are incorporated within a set of sub-systems. The model includes consideration of driving sub-systems as a set of capital funds and flows, and how these are influenced by linkages between processes in the human (socio-economic) and environment systems and sub-systems. The model is consistent with existing models of the biophysical earth system used by the land change, earth system sciences, and socio-ecological systems communities. The purposes of the model are to provide (i) a holistic framework within which descriptions, models and analyses that focus on various components of land can be placed to describe and explain land systems and land system changes; and (ii) a guide for the development of more fully integrated and interdisciplinary understanding, analysis and study of land use and land cover dynamics, with explicit focus on relationships between human and natural systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEarth system science 3acapital 3aland cover 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3amodels 3asocial environment 3asocioeconomics1 aStaiano, Michele0 tLand.g2017 Nov. 16, v. 6, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land60400813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02842naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002100141245006900162520164600231592002801877650002001905650002301925650001201948650001501960650001501975650001501990650003402005650001502039650002402054700001802078700001702096700002102113700001702134700002302151700002102174700001802195700001802213773011702231856007502348852000902423655001202432IND60649761320221118033239.0190706e20180731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064976132DNAL7 a10.3390/land70300932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPasha, M.  K. S.10aSetting and Implementing Standards for Management of Wild Tigers  aTiger numbers have collapsed so dramatically that conservationists are adopting a strategy of securing populations in priority conservation landscapes. This includes improving management effectiveness in these sites. The Conservation Assured|Tiger Standards (CA|TS) are designed to help ensure effectiveness and provide a benchmark against which to measure progress. CA|TS is a distillation of best practice and a roadmap to management effectiveness, linking management to expert-driven standards covering all aspects of management, including those which are tiger-specific (monitoring, maintenance of prey, control of poaching). Sites are audited against a set of standards and if met, are accredited as CA|TS Approved. We describe CA|TS in the context of tiger conservation, describe the evolution and philosophy of the system and consider its application across the tiger range, before drawing on lessons learned from 5 years of development. Important benefits include the independence of CA|TS from existing governmental or NGO institutions, the emphasis on regional governance and the existence of active support groups. Conversely, the participatory approach has slowed implementation. CA|TS remains more attractive to well managed sites than to sites that are struggling, although building capacity in the latter is its key aim. The close connections between people working on tiger conservation make some aspects of independent assessment challenging. Finally, if CA|TS is to succeed in its long term aims, it needs to go hand in hand with secure and adequate funding to increase management capacity in many tiger conservation areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera tigris 3aconservation areas 3afunding 3agovernance 3alandscapes 3amonitoring 3anongovernmental organizations 3aphilosophy 3awildlife management1 aDudley, Nigel1 aStolton, Sue1 aBaltzer, Michael1 aLong, Barney1 aRoy, S.q(Sugoto),1 aBelecky, Michael1 aGopal, Rajesh1 aYadav, S.

Rationally design of functional materials via theoretical calculation is an emerging and appealing strategy in material science. However, exploiting of theoretical calculation for assistance of adsorbent design is rarely to be attempted despite it is usually utilized to explore the adsorption mechanism. In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculation is exploited to design an adsorbent with high adsorption capacity and selectivity. The well-known palladium ion-imprinted polymer (IIP) was used as a model adsorbent. Then, three types of given adsorption configurations (a-Pd-IIP, b-Pd-IIP and c-Pd-IIP) were optimized. Further, their adsorption energies were calculated by DFT, which were –13.978 eV for b-Pd-IIP, –8.764 eV for a-Pd-IIP and –3.587 eV for c-Pd-IIP, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R2) between the theoretical adsorption energy and the experimental adsorption capacity reached to as high as 0.985. In addition, the dynamics and selectivity experimental results further consolidated the tendency of the calculation result. All these results demonstrate that the adsorption energy derived from DFT calculations is an important factor in guiding the design of IIPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acase studies 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3amodels 3apalladium 3apolymers 0aDensity functional theory 0aIon imprinting 0aAdsorption capacity 0aSite energy 0aPalladium1 aZhang, Kai1 aShao, Penghui1 aYang, Liming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0199-22971 aDing, Lin1 aPavlostathis, Spyros G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9731-38361 aShi, Hui1 aZou, Liezhao1 aLiang, Dahao1 aLuo, Xubiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3935-12680 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2019 Nov. 05, v. 379 p.120791-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1207913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008200166300001600248520155200264592002801816650003301844650001501877650001801892650001401910650001801924650001701942650002301959650000901982650001201991650002002003650002302023650001202046650002902058650002602087650002502113700002202138700001902160700001802179700002302197700002202220700001702242700002102259700001902280700001502299700001702314700002202331773010302353856008202456852000902538655001202547IND60593441820221121162247.0210214e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059344182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-018-2550-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneko, Hiroki10aTaurine is an amino acid with the ability to activate autophagy in adipocytes  ap. 527-535.  aAlterations in adipocyte characteristics are highly implicated in the pathology of obesity. In a recent article, we demonstrated that high-fat diet-induced obesity impairs lysosomal function, thereby suppressing autophagy in mice white adipose tissue. Taurine, an amino acid naturally contained in the normal diet and existing ubiquitously in tissues, has been reported to improve insulin resistance and chronic inflammation in animal models, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. From these findings, we hypothesized that improvement of obese pathology by taurine may be mediated through recovery of autophagy. In matured 3T3-L1 mouse adipocytes, treatment with taurine-promoted autophagy. Moreover, taurine-induced nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy- and lysosome-related factors. As this translocation is regulated by several kinase pathways, including extracellular signal-related kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and mechanistic target of rapamycin protein kinase complex 1 (MTORC1), we examined related signaling elements. Consequently, taurine-reduced phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2 but did not alter the phosphorylation of MTORC1 pathway-associated adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase or ribosomal protein S6 kinase. Taken together, these results suggest that taurine may enhance TFEB nuclear translocation through ERK1/2 to accelerate autophagy. The effect discovered in this study may represent a novel mechanism for the improvement of obesity-related pathology by taurine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAMP-activated protein kinase 3aadipocytes 3aanimal models 3aautophagy 3ahigh fat diet 3ainflammation 3ainsulin resistance 3amice 3aobesity 3aphosphorylation 3aribosomal proteins 3ataurine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awhite adipose tissue1 aKobayashi, Masaki1 aMizunoe, Yuhei1 aYoshida, Maho1 aYasukawa, Hiromine1 aHoshino, Shunsuke1 aItagawa, Rei1 aFuruichi, Takuma1 aOkita, Naoyuki1 aSudo, Yuka1 aImae, Masato1 aHigami, Yoshikazu0 tAmino acids.g2018 May, v. 50, no. 5 p.527-535dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl52832x0939-44517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-018-2550-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245015300173520149400326592002801820650004401848650001501892650001501907650002201922650001301944650001301957650003801970650003702008650001802045650001402063650001302077650000902090650001102099650001302110650001902123650003302142650002302175650001402198650002102212650002502233653001302258653002702271653001202298653001802310653001502328700002402343700002002367700008002387773011402467856008602581852000902667655001202676IND60647492820221120223836.0190628e20191105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2019.1207922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIslam, Md.

Here, we designed the preparation of new adsorbents by combining chitosan and poly(1-vinylimidazole) to get the synergistic effect for the removal of hexavalent chromium. Trimethoxysilyl group terminated poly(1-vinylimidazole)-modified-chitosan composite was successfully synthesized by one-step free radical polymerization based on the grafting backbone of chitosan and vinylimidazole. The resulting adsorbents were used for the removal of Cr(VI) ions from the aqueous solution. The modified chitosan composite was characterized by ATR, FTIR, BET isotherm studies, elemental analysis, TGA, DSC, FE-SEM, and EDX. ATR. FTIR results confirmed the presence of the imidazole group in modified chitosan. The adsorption results were described by the Langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 196.1 mg/g for modified chitosan, however, the chitosan yielded 151.5 mg/g. It has been observed that the adsorption of chromium fitted better with the pseudo-second-order kinetics. The modified chitosan composite exhibited greater adsorption capacity than chitosan for hexavalent chromium and has potential application for Cr(VI) removal from aqueous solution containing other common ions with regeneration ability. This novel approach of modifying chitosan with telomerized poly(1-vinyl imidazole) offers potential application in wastewater treatment of different industries releasing Cr (VI).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3achitosan 3achromium 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afree radicals 3aimidazole 3aindustry 3aions 3amodels 3amoieties 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asynergism 3athermogravimetry 3awastewater treatment 0aChitosan 0aPoly(1-vinylimidazole) 0aSol-gel 0aChromium (VI) 0aAdsorption1 aKhan, M.

CKD was characterized by X-ray diffraction and FTIR analysis. This byproduct was investigated for its physical–chemical characters, antibacterial activities on sewage water and the presence of nematode, parasites and algae in the treated water. The efficiency of CKD-treated water was also examined on Hibiscus sabdarriffa seed germination. Total bacteria, total and fecal coliform, as well as fecal streptococci were completely inhibited by CKD. Interestingly, zinc, manganese, iron, nickel and lead were completely absent from sewage water as these metals precipitated after treatment with 10gl−1 CKD. On the other hand, among all the tested plant criteria, only root length was significantly reduced by 55% and 15% after zero and 3 days of CKD addition respectively compared to control. Furthermore, plant lipid peroxidation showed no significant differences between treated sewage water and control after zero and 3 days time addition of CKD. Catalase enzyme activity showed significant decrease by 56% and 64%, while peroxidase activity significantly increased up to 49% and 63% compared to untreated sewage after zero and 3 days of treatment, respectively. The absorption of lead, iron and copper by treated and untreated plants showed no significant differences. Chromium ions were highly absorbed (0.075mgl−1) by plants irrigated only with treated sewage water at zero time, and decreased gradually to 0.018mgl−1 after 3 days of CKD addition. This study highlighted the efficiency of cement kiln dust as an antibacterial agent and its ability of scavenging heavy metals leading to the use of treated sewage water in activities such as crop irrigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHibiscus 3aNematoda 3aStreptococcus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aabsorption 3aalgae 3aantibacterial properties 3aantibiotics 3acatalase 3acement 3achromium 3acoliform bacteria 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3aheavy metals 3aions 3airon 3airrigation 3alead 3alipid peroxidation 3amanganese 3amanufacturing 3amicrobiological quality 3amunicipal wastewater 3anickel 3aparasites 3aperoxidase 3aseed germination 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse 3azinc 3aEgypt 0aAntibacterial 0aAntioxidant enzymes 0aCement kiln dust 0aHibiscus sabdariffa 0aSewage water1 aSayed, W.F.1 aHalawy, S.A.1 aElamary, R.B.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2015 Sept., v. 119 p.155-161dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02724naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009700165500001900262520164100281592002801922650001501950650001101965650002101976650001101997650001502008650001502023650002502038650001002063700003502073700003402108700003102142773011902173856007302292852000902365655001202374IND60737146220221119070125.0210514e20210429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073714622DNAL7 a10.3390/w130912372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMateo Pérez, Vanesa 12aA Random Forest Model for the Prediction of FOG Content in Inlet Wastewater from Urban WWTPs  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe content of fats, oils, and greases (FOG) in wastewater, as a result of food preparation, both in homes and in different commercial and industrial activities, is a growing problem. In addition to the blockages generated in the sanitary networks, it also represents a difficulty for the performance of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), increasing energy and maintenance costs and worsening the performance of downstream treatment processes. The pretreatment stage of these facilities is responsible for removing most of the FOG to avoid these problems. However, so far, optimization has been limited to the correct design and initial installation dimensioning. Proper management of this initial stage is left to the experience of the operators to adjust the process when changes occur in the characteristics of the wastewater inlet. The main difficulty is the large number of factors influencing these changes. In this work, a prediction model of the FOG content in the inlet water is presented. The model is capable of correctly predicting 98.45% of the cases in training and 72.73% in testing, with a relative error of 10%. It was developed using random forest (RF) and the good results obtained (R² = 0.9348 and RMSE = 0.089 in test) will make it possible to improve operations in this initial stage. The good features of this machine learning algorithm had not been used, so far, in the modeling of pretreatment parameters. This novel approach will result in a global improvement in the performance of this type of facility allowing early adoption of adjustments to the pretreatment process to remove the maximum amount of FOG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aenergy 3afood preparation 3amodels 3aprediction 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3awater1 aMesa Fernández, José  Manuel1 aVillanueva Balsera, Joaquín 1 aAlonso Álvarez, Cristina 0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 29, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130912373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008300172300001400255520204500269592002802314650000802342650002002350650002002370650001502390650001202405650001902417650001402436650003102450650001002481650002002491650002002511650001802531650000902549653001502558653002602573653001902599653002202618653002302640653001802663700002202681700005702703773011402760856008702874852000902961655001202970IND60610204520221120152321.0200712e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061020452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Battista, D.10aFlow and thermal management of engine intake air for fuel and emissions saving  ap. 46-55.  aCharge air cooling is the typical technique to reduce temperature of the engine intake air, increasing air density and improving cylinder filling and engine volumetric efficiency in present turbocharged diesel engines. Usually, charge air is cooled by environmental air that crosses a heat exchanger placed in front of the vehicle: its cooling capacity is related to the vehicle speed and other constraints (presence of the main radiator). This leads to an intake air temperature from 30 to 80 °C, depending on engine load, external air conditions and vehicle speed again. If the intake air was more cooled down, the engine volumetric efficiency would be further increased. This can only be done by the use of a dedicated cooling fluid, operating at lower temperature with respect to external air. In this paper, therefore, an evaporator, mounted in parallel with the one of the refrigeration unit used for cabin cooling, was placed on the intake line of a turbocharged diesel engine (F1C IVECO engine), tested on a high speed dynamometer bench: the air refrigeration unit is also composed by a compressor, a condenser and a thermostatic expansion valve. The effects of the undercooling of the charge air have been experimental assessed in terms of fuel consumption and regulated emission reduction, evaluated on the most common engine operating points. Mechanical power demand of the compressor has obviously taken into account in order to assess overall benefits. Achieved net fuel consumption is in the order of 1% at fixed conditions operating the engine as a light duty type, when the intake air sub-cooling is turned on. A benefit on the regulated emissions has been observed (Nitrogen Oxides, Soot) regardless of the setup of the engine combustion processes (injection time, fuel distribution for each injection, Exhaust Gas Recirculated rate). Unburned hydrocarbon and Carbon monoxide behavior, on the other hand, deserves some more attention and call for the re-calibration of the previously cited combustion control parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3acarbon monoxide 3acombustion 3acooling 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3afuels 3aheat exchangers 3anitrogen oxides 3arefrigeration 3asoot 0aIntake air 0aVolumetric efficiency 0aFuel reduction 0aEmissions control 0aThermal management 0aRefrigeration1 aDi Bartolomeo, M.1 aCipollone, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5466-63830 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 173 p.46-55dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.07.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005900147245011600206500002200322520173900344592002802083650000802111650001602119650001902135650002702154650001802181650003002199650001302229650001802242650001302260650001502273650001002288651001002298651001702308653000902325653002602334653003002360653002502390653002202415700005502437700005502492700005802547773010602605856008202711852000902793655001202802IND60767939720221119161049.0220307e20220209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076793972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2022.02.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mingpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4628-251X10aRevisiting the Evolutionary History of Pigs via De Novo Mutation Rate Estimation in A Three-generation Pedigree  aPre-press version  aThe mutation rate used in the previous analyses of pig evolution and demographics was cursory and hence invited potential bias in inferring evolutionary history. Herein, we estimated the de novo mutation rate of pigs as 3.6 × 10⁻⁹ per site per generation using high-quality whole-genome sequencing data from nine individuals in a three-generation pedigree through stringent filtering and validation. Using this mutation rate, we re-investigated the evolutionary history of pigs. The estimated divergence time of ∼ 10 kiloyears ago (Kya) between European wild and domesticated pigs was consistent with the domestication time of European pigs based on archaeological evidence. However, other divergence events inferred here were not as ancient as previously described. Our estimates suggested that Sus speciation occurred ∼ 1.36 million years ago (Mya); European pigs split from Asian pigs only ∼ 219 Kya; South and north Chinese wild pigs split ∼ 25 Kya. Meanwhile, our results showed that the most recent divergence event between Chinese wild and domesticated pigs occurred in the Hetao plain, north China, approximately 20 Kya, supporting the possibly independent domestication in north China along the middle Yellow River. We also found the maximum effective population size of pigs was ∼ 6 times larger than the previous estimate. An archaic migration from other Sus species originating ∼ 2 Mya to European pigs was detected during western colonization of pigs; this interfered with the previous demographic inference. Our de novo mutation rate estimation and its consequences for demographic history inference reasonably provide a new vision regarding the evolutionary history of pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSus 3aarchaeology 3abioinformatics 3ademographic statistics 3adomestication 3aeffective population size 3agenomics 3amutation rate 3apedigree 3aproteomics 3aswine 3aChina 3aYellow River 0aPigs 0aDe novo mutation rate 0aThree-generation pedigree 0aEvolutionary history 0aArchaic migration1 aYang, Qiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9890-263X1 aAi, Huashui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2859-88551 aHuang, Lusheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6940-667X0 tGenomics, proteomics & bioinformatics.g2022 Feb. 09, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12107x1672-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2022.02.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02063naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245007900155300001300234520116500247592002801412650001301440650001001453650001101463650001901474650001301493700002101506700001401527773013701541856007401678852000901752655001201761IND60765230220221120083555.0220419e20120208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076523022DNAL7 a10.17221/4945-rae2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouček, J.12aA fine desintegration of plants suitable for composite biofuels production  ap. 7-11.  aIn case of pressed composite biofuels production the important part of the production process is the input row materials disintegration. In dependence on disintegrated material properties, disintegration device, grinding stage and technological process there is in practice necessary for disintegration of culm materials 0.5&ndash;7% and of wooden species even 0.75&ndash;10% of total energetical content of material. A wide range of these figures means that in this sphere of raw materials adaptation can be reached relative high savings through correct choice of technological process and device. The authors of the paper have measured energy consumption of fine disintegration of lignocellulose materials in dependence on particles size and moisture. By the realized measurement of different average size of both input and output particles and consequent statistical evaluation was proved the fiducial energy consumption increase at higher stage of disintegration and higher moisture of the input material. All measurements were carried-out for the grinding mill &Scaron;K 300 and the output particles size was limited by the exchange sieves mesh dimension.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3aculms 3aenergy 3alignocellulose 3aresearch1 aHanzlíková, I.1 aHutla, P.0 tResearch in Agricultural Engineering.g, v. 49, no. 1 p.7-11dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21420x1212-91517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4945-rae3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01295naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245005800159300001800217520036100235592002800596650001300624650002300637650002300660650002000683650002200703650000900725650001300734700001600747773013400763856007500897852000900972655001200981IND60658743620221120125049.0190826e20100907xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065874362DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc01989e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahammed, Atif10aHighly efficient catalase activity of metallocorroles  ap. 7040-7042.  aThe iron(iii) complex of a bipolar and amphiphilic corrole, which binds strongly to proteins and undergoes protein-mediated cellular uptake, catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide faster (kcₐₜ = 6400 M⁻¹ s⁻¹) and more efficiently (turnover frequency >120 s⁻¹) than previously reported synthetic compounds with catalase-like activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalase 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reactions 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrogen peroxide 3airon 3aproteins1 aGross, Zeev0 tChemical communications.g2010 Sept. 7, v. 46, no. 37 p.7040-7042dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc01989e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012200159520137900281592002801660650001601688650002801704650001301732650002001745650001201765650001801777650001601795650000901811651001001820700002901830700002401859700002401883700002201907773012201929856007402051852000902125655001202134IND60742681520221122105026.0210624e20210618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074268152DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130620832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVilla, María,10aBody Composition, Dietary Intake and the Risk of Low Energy Availability in Elite-Level Competitive Rhythmic Gymnasts  aThe aim of this study was to analyze dietary intake and body composition in a group of elite-level competitive rhythmic gymnasts from Spain. We undertook body composition and nutritional analysis of 30 elite gymnasts, divided into two groups by age: pre-teen (9–12 years) (n = 17) and teen (13–18 years) (n = 13). Measures of height, weight, and bioimpedance were used to calculate body mass index and percent body fat. Energy and nutrient intakes were assessed based on 7-day food records. The two groups had similar percentages of total body fat (pre-teen: 13.99 ± 3.83% vs. teen: 14.33 ± 5.57%; p > 0.05). The energy availability values for pre-teens were above the recommended values (>40 kcal/FFM/day) 69.38 ± 14.47 kcal/FFM/day, while those for the teens were much lower (34.7 ± 7.5 kcal/FFM/day). The distribution of the daily energy intake across the macronutrients indicates that both groups ingested less than the recommended level of carbohydrates and more than the recommended level of fat. Very low intakes of calcium and vitamin D among other micronutrients were also noted. The main finding is that teenage gymnasts do not consume as much energy as they need each day, which explains their weight and development. Moreover, they are at a high risk of developing low energy availability that could negatively impact their performance and future health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody fat 3abody mass index 3acalcium 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3arisk 3aSpain1 aVilla Vicente, José G.,1 aSeco Calvo, Jesús,1 aMielgo-Ayuso, Juan 1 aCollado, Pilar S.0 tNutrients.g2021 June 18, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130620833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01542naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245005500166300001800221520047200239592002800711650001200739650002200751650001400773650001100787650002200798653002200820653001500842653002000857653003700877700002200914700001800936773015200954856007701106852000901183655001201192IND60522035820221121223457.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052203582DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1995-07222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Viqar Uddin12aA Diosgenin Tetrasaccharide from Cestrum nocturnum  ap. 1104-1110.  aA new monodesmosidic spirostanol glycoside extracted from the fresh leaves of Cestrum nocturnum was identified as spirost-5-ene-3-ol, [3β,25R]-3-O-[{α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)- α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)}-α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→4)-β-D-glucopyranoside.

Accordingly, huge amounts of metallized plastic packaging waste are being generated due to their extensive usage and short service life. The technical difficulties associated with separation and reprocessing makes recycling of metallized plastic packaging waste quite limited. In this work, a sustainable and systematic recovering method has been developed to transform metallized plastic packaging waste into value-added Al/Al₄C₃/AlN resources. The metallized plastic packaging waste investigated is mainly composed of layers of polymers (polypropylene, polyethene, and polyethene terephthalate) and aluminum. Thermal transformations of metallized plastic waste at elevated temperatures would involve a series of complex chemical reactions leading to the generation of valuable fuel gaseous and aluminum resources. On the basis of detail studies for the chemical nature and thermal behavior of the waste, the aluminum component it contained was systematically isolated (Al) or transformed into aluminum carbide (Al₄C₃) by reacting with the carbon cracked from the polymer components or aluminum nitride (AlN) nanowires by direct nitridation or carbothermal and nitridation reaction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum nitride 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3adurability 3afuels 3aindustry 3ananowires 3apackaging 3aplastics 3apolypropylenes 3arecycling 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3avalue added 3awastes 0aMetallized plastic waste 0aMetallic aluminum 0aAluminum carbide 0aAluminum nitride 0aHydrocarbon fuel gases1 aRajarao, Ravindra1 aSahajwalla, Veena0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2018 Dec. 13, v. 7, no. 1 p.1723-1733dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.8b055033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002900147245010400176300001600280520193300296592002802229650001202257650001102269650003002280650001302310650001902323650002102342650001402363650001002377650001102387700003702398700002902435700002002464773010102484856008302585852000902668655001202677IND4477192220221118001944.0150808e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447719222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actao.2012.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes de Freitas, Cintia10aTopographic separation of two sympatric palms in the central Amazon – does dispersal play a role?  ap. 128-135.  aDespite broadly overlapping geographic distributions in the central Amazon basin, two congeneric palm species (Attalea attaleoides and Attalea microcarpa) have topographically separated distributions on a local scale in Reserva Ducke near Manaus. Our aim here was to determine if this local scale separation can be linked to (1) seedling stage specialization to different habitat conditions of the two species, and/or (2) environmentally-controlled seed dispersal. We assessed the role of these potential drivers by mapping the local distribution of the two species over a 25-km² grid and testing for correlation to seed removal and seed germination patterns using seed sowing experiments. 360 seeds of each species were sown in 30 uniformly distributed plots (12 seeds of each species in each plot), and seed removal and germination were subsequently monitored. Adult populations of the two species showed opposite distribution patterns linked to topography. However, there was little evidence for specialization to different habitat conditions at the seedling stage: after 11 months, 26.1% of seeds of A. microcarpa had germinated along the entire topographic gradient, albeit with a tendency toward higher germination in more inclined areas. For A. attaleoides, only 2.2% seeds had germinated, and again along the entire topographic gradient. In contrast, there was evidence for environmentally-controlled seed dispersal: for both species, seed removal was higher in flat areas. Presence of adults did not affect germination or seed removal. Our results suggest that topographically differentiated distributions of A. attaleoides and A. microcarpa may be reinforced by steep slope avoidance by their seed dispersers. A direct environmental control mechanism remains to be identified to explain the consistent topographic associations, but our results show that this mechanism does not work at the seed germination stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAttalea 3aadults 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3aseed dispersal 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asowing1 aCapellotto Costa, Flávia Regina1 aSvenning, Jens-Christian1 aBalslev, Henrik0 tActa oecologica.g2012 Feb., v. 39 p.128-135dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:2127x1146-609X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actao.2012.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01105naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245010800161300001600269520015500285592002800440650001900468650002300487650002300510650003300533700002000566700001500586773013000601856007500731852000900806655001200815IND60658743720221120125034.0190826e20101206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065874372DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc01998d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jiangsong10aDetecting protein interactions in live cells via complementation of a hydrolysis-deficient β-lactamase  ap. 182-184.  aProtein–fragment complementation assay using a hydrolysis-deficient β-lactamase provides a robust tool for studying protein–protein interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactamase 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3aprotein-protein interactions1 aZhang, Junxiang1 aLi, Shuwei0 tChemical communications.g2010 Dec. 6, v. 47, no. 1 p.182-184dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc01998d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02591naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010600167300001800273520108400291592002801375650001601403650001301419650002201432650001601454650001301470650001201483650001301495650001601508650000701524650001001531650001501541650000901556650001401565650001301579650001101592700002101603700001901624700003001643700002401673700001901697700002401716700002101740700005001761700006001811773012301871856008201994852000902076655001202085IND60627096520190411000000.0190128e20181102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062709652DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biomac.8b012332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagaz, Adrián10aPorous, Aligned, and Biomimetic Fibers of Regenerated Silk Fibroin Produced by Solution Blow Spinning  ap. 4542-4553.  aSolution blow spinning (SBS) has emerged as a rapid and scalable technique for the production of polymeric and ceramic materials into micro-/nanofibers. Here, SBS was employed to produce submicrometer fibers of regenerated silk fibroin (RSF) from Bombyx mori (silkworm) cocoons based on formic acid or aqueous systems. Spinning in the presence of vapor permitted the production of fibers from aqueous solutions, and high alignment could be obtained by modifying the SBS setup to give a concentrated channeled airflow. The combination of SBS and a thermally induced phase separation technique (TIPS) resulted in the production of macro-/microporous fibers with 3D interconnected pores. Furthermore, a coaxial SBS system enabled a pH gradient and kosmotropic salts to be applied at the point of fiber formation, mimicking some of the aspects of the natural spinning process, fostering fiber formation by self-assembly of the spinning dope. This scalable and fast production of various types of silk-based fibrous scaffolds could be suitable for a myriad of biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aair flow 3aaqueous solutions 3abiomimetics 3aceramics 3acocoons 3afibroins 3aformic acid 3apH 3asalts 3aseparation 3asilk 3asilkworms 3aspinning 3avapors1 aRoberts, Aled D.1 aFaraji, Sheida1 aNascimento, Tatiana R.

However, the ecological significance of seed desiccation sensitivity in temperate regions is largely unknown. Do seeds of such species suffer from drying during the period when they remain on the soil, between shedding in autumn and the return of conditions required for germination in spring? Methods To test this hypothesis, the Mediterranean holm oak (Quercus ilex) forest was used as a model system. The relationships between the climate in winter, the characteristics of microhabitats, acorn morphological traits, and the water status and viability of seeds after winter were then investigated in 42 woodlands sampled over the entire French distribution of the species. Key Results The percentages of germination and normal seedling development were tightly linked to the water content of seeds after the winter period, revealing that in situ desiccation is a major cause of mortality. The homogeneity of seed response to drying suggests that neither intraspecific genetic variation nor environmental conditions had a significant impact on the level of desiccation sensitivity of seeds. In contrast, the water and viability status of seeds at the time of collection were dramatically influenced by cumulative rainfall and maximum temperatures during winter. A significant effect of shade and of the type of soil cover was also evidenced. Conclusions The findings establish that seed desiccation sensitivity is a key functional trait which may influence the success of recruitment in temperate recalcitrant seed species. Considering that most models of climate change predict changes in rainfall and temperature in the Mediterranean basin, the present work could help foresee changes in the distribution of Q. ilex and other oak species, and hence plant community alterations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aseedlings 3atemperate forests 3amicrohabitats 3atrees 3aclimate models 3awoodlands 3aQuercus ilex 3agermination 3awinter 3aautumn 3arecalcitrant seeds 3aclimate change 3atemperate zones 3awater content 3atemperature 3amortality 3aviability 3afruits 3aplant communities 3aspring 3aenvironmental factors 3asoil types 3arain 3agenetic variation 3adrying 2aDesiccation 2aEcosystem 2aGenetic Variation 2aQuercusxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aSeedsxphysiology 2aTemperature 2aTrees 3aFrance 0aFrance 0adesiccation sensitivity 0aacorn 0adrought 0awinter rainfall 0aecological filtering 0arecruitment 0aholm oak 0aMediterranean climate 0arecalcitrance1 aOurcival, Jean-Marc1 aDussert, Stéphane0 tAnnals of botany.g2013 Apr., v. 111, no. 4 p.693-701dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mct0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005300153245012400206300001600330520115800346592002801504650002101532650001701553650001901570650000901589650002001598650001001618650004201628650002301670650002601693650001801719650002501737651001001762700005301772700001901825700001601844700001401860773011701874856008701991852000902078655001202087IND60627104020221122031351.0190128e20181204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062710402DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b027822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6848-743110aPotential and Constraints of Biogenic Methane Generation from Coals and Mudstones from Huaibei Coalfield, Eastern China  ap. 287-295.  aCoalbed methane (CBM) resources formed biogenically and thermogenically have been discovered in the Permian coalbeds of the Huaibei coalfield. Four coals, three mudstones, and five coalbed-produced water samples collected from the Linhuan, Luling, and Haizi coal mines of the Huaibei coalfield were characterized geochemically and biologically to gain an understanding of the biogenic methane generation potential and the microbial communities involved in situ and in coalbed-produced water-enriched samples. The 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing results showed that the archaeal communities from in situ and enriched cultures were dominated by Methanolobus and Methanobacterium species. The organic material of coals and mudstones could be biodegraded under an anaerobic incubation. The maximum biogenic methane generation potentials of coal and mudstones were 98.5 and 72.5 μmol/g within 123 days, respectively. Volatile matter and total organic carbon (TOC) content were the most important internal factors affecting biogenic methane generation from coals and mudstones. The Na-SO₄ water type resulted in a low methane generation potential.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethanobacterium 3aMethanolobus 3aPermian period 3acoal 3acoalbed methane 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amethane production 3amicrobial communities 3aribosomal RNA 3atotal organic carbon 3aChina1 aJu, Yiwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1574-92791 aHuang, Haiping1 aYun, Juanli1 aGuo, Chen0 tEnergy & fuels.g2018 Dec. 04, v. 33, no. 1 p.287-295dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.8b027823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03734naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012700164300001800291520203500309592002802344596006002372650001002432650002002442650001602462650001602478650001702494650001802511650001102529650002102540650001002561650001302571650001302584650002402597650001202621650001102633650002102644650002702665650001802692650001702710650001202727650001402739650001102753650001902764650001502783650001202798650001002810700002602820700001502846700005802861700002702919773012002946856008103066852000903147655001203156IND60649658220221118025242.0190705e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064965822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-018-0236-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaaz, Afshan10aSuccessful plant regeneration system via de novo organogenesis in Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels: an important medicinal tree  ap. 1285-1295.  aSyzygium cumini L. (Myrtaceae) is an evergreen medicinal tree confined to tropical and subtropical regions of the world and is mainly recognized for healing of type, two diabetes. An efficient indirect regeneration system has been standardized for this tree using cotyledonary node, inter-node, nodal and leaf segment explants excised from 10 days old aseptic seedling. For callus induction explants were incubated on Murashige and Skoog (1962) medium supplemented with different concentrations of 2, 4-Dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2, 4-D) or 2, 4, 5-Trichloro phenoxy acetic acid (2, 4, 5-T). All the tested concentrations facilitated callus initiation with different types and varying regeneration potentialities. The regenerated callus on different treatments showed variation in color and texture and best callogenesis (75%) was observed on (7.5 µM) 2, 4-D after 4 weeks. Different morphogenic response was observed when callus was transferred to a secondary organogenic medium fortified with (5.0 µM) benzyl adenine or Kinetin. The yellow white friable (YWF) callus obtained from CN explants exhibited appearance of small leafy structures on secondary medium. Not all types of calli originating from various types of explant were organogenic. Best shoot induction (93%) were observed in (YWF) type of callus obtained from CN explants on MS medium enriched with 5.0 µM BA + 0.25 µM NAA + 10 mg/l AgNO₃ with maximum mean shoot number (10.19 ± 0.05) and mean length (4.12 ± 0.32 cm) per clump after 4 weeks of transfer. However the shoot number got increased up to 48 shoots/clump on subsequent subculturing after 12 weeks. For ex vitro rooting shoot lets (4 cm) were excised and pulse treated in full or half strength MS medium augmented with varied concentrations of IBA. Best rhizogenesis (80%) was achieved on 200 µM IBA treated shootlets after 4 weeks of transfer to sterilized soilrite. The regenerants were successfully acclimatized and established in earthen pots with 90% survival.  aPublisher supplied data  aISSP#0082cInternational Scientific Partnership Program 3a2,4-D 3aSyzygium cumini 3aacclimation 3aacetic acid 3aagroforestry 3abenzyladenine 3acallus 3acallus formation 3acolor 3adiabetes 3aexplants 3aindole butyric acid 3akinetin 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aorganogenesis 3arhizogenesis 3arooting 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3asilver nitrate 3asubtropics 3atexture 3atrees1 aHussain, Sheikh Altaf1 aNaz, Ruphi1 aAnis, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6726-49381 aAlatar, Abdulrahman A.0 tAgroforestry systems.g2019 Aug., v. 93, no. 4 p.1285-1295dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl34245x0167-43667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-018-0236-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02288naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245011500159300002000274520094200294592002801236650001301264650001701277650002101294650002401315650002301339650002201362650001801384650001501402650001901417650001301436653002001449653002801469653001101497653002601508653003301534700001401567700001301581700001401594700001901608773012601627856008001753852000901833655001201842IND60583315720221122001649.0171011e20171011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058331572DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b104112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Muzhen10aFacile Fabrication of a Flexible LiNbO3 Piezoelectric Sensor through Hot Pressing for Biomechanical Monitoring  ap. 34687-34695.  aWearable pressure sensors have attracted increasing attention for biomechanical monitoring due to their portability and flexibility. Although great advances have been made, there are no facile methods to produce sensors with good performance. Here, we present a simple method for manufacturing flexible and self-powered piezoelectric sensors based on LiNbO₃ (LN) particles. The LN particles are dispersed in polypropylene (PP) doped with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by hot pressing (200 °C) to form a flexible LN/MWCNT/PP piezoelectric composite film (PCF) sensor. This cost-effective sensor has high sensitivity (8 Pa), fast response time (ca. 40 ms), and long-term stability (>3000 cycles). Measurements of pressure changes from peripheral arteries demonstrate the applicability of the LN/MWCNT/PP PCF sensor to biomechanical monitoring as well as its potential for biomechanics-related clinical diagnosis and forecasting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarteries 3abiomechanics 3acarbon nanotubes 3acomposite materials 3acost effectiveness 3afilms (materials) 3amanufacturing 3amonitoring 3apolypropylenes 3apressing 0apressure sensor 0apiezoelectric composite 0aLiNbO3 0aheart rate monitoring 0aepilepsy seizure forecasting1 aKang, Hua1 aGuan, Li1 aLi, Huayi1 aZhang, Meining0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Oct. 11, v. 9, no. 40 p.34687-34695dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b104113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01083naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245005500156300001800211520026400229592002800493650002300521650001700544700002100561700001900582773013200601856007500733852000900808655001200817IND60658828520221122105423.0190826e20110207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065882852DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc04117c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jinjing10aNew polymorphs of isonicotinamide and nicotinamide  ap. 1530-1532.  aFor each of the well-known co-crystal formers, isonicotinamide and nicotinamide, a new polymorph, obtained during attempted co-crystallisation experiments, has been fully characterized and its stability relationship with previously reported forms established.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3anicotinamide1 aBourne, Susan A.1 aCaira, Mino R.0 tChemical communications.g2011 Feb. 7, v. 47, no. 5 p.1530-1532dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc04117c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245018100166300001600347520124100363592002801604650004401632650002301676650002301699650001201722650001301734650001101747650002901758650001701787650001701804650001101821650001901832650001501851650000901866650001901875650002101894653000801915653000701923653000701930653001201937653001001949653001101959653000801970653000901978653000801987653000701995653000702002653000902009653000902018653000602027653002902033653001802062653004502080653001202125653001502137700001602152700001502168700001702183700001502200700001802215700002002233773011402253856008602367852000902453655001202462IND60613228520221119073614.0200831e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061322852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Mei10aInvestigating binding characteristics of cadmium and copper to DOM derived from compost and rice straw using EEM-PARAFAC combined with two-dimensional FTIR correlation analyses  ap. 539-548.  aThe binding of Cd and Cu to dissolved organic matter (DOM) derived from compost (CP) and rice straw (ST) was studied through an approach combining parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS). Both humic-like and protein-like substances have been observed in CP and ST. Comparing with the Cu, Cd exhibited a lower affinity to DOM, and the quenching curve of Cd failed to be fitted by the Ryan and Weber Model, indicating that the environmental risk caused by applying CP or ST to Cd-polluted soil should be considered. The stability constants (log KM) of Cu ranged from 3.87 to 5.03, and a larger value was found in CP than those in ST. Protein-like component also showed obvious fluorescence quenching with heavy metals addition. Besides, in CP, phenol-OH and carboxyl showed the fastest response to Cd and Cu, respectively; however, in ST, amide group and phenol-OH displayed the fastest response to Cd and Cu, respectively. These results provide a more detailed knowledge of the interaction mechanism of heavy metals with DOM at the molecular level, which is of great significance for reasonable application of compost and rice straw and efficient control of heavy metal in farmland soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aagricultural soils 3abinding properties 3acadmium 3acomposts 3acopper 3adissolved organic matter 3afluorescence 3aheavy metals 3amodels 3apolluted soils 3arice straw 3arisk 3asoil pollution 3asoil remediation 0aDOM 0aCP 0aST 0aPARAFAC 0a2DCOS 0alog KM 0aEEM 0aFTIR 0aDOC 0aEm 0aEx 0aR.U. 0aFmax 0af 0aDissolved organic matter 0aMetal binding 0aTwo-dimensional correlation spectroscopy 0aCompost 0aRice straw1 aLi, Zhongwu1 aHuang, Bin1 aLuo, Ninglin1 aZhang, Qiu1 aZhai, Xiuqing1 aZeng, Guangming0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 344 p.539-548dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245005800164300001600222520211400238592002802352650002002380650001102400650001502411650002102426650002402447650001302471650001402484650003302498650001502531650000902546650002102555650001602576650001002592650001102602650001602613650001302629650001102642651001102653653002402664653002202688653003302710653002102743653001402764653001102778653002802789700001902817773012502836856008602961852000903047655001203056IND60595789420221121041516.0190501e20171102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059578942DNAL7 a10.1080/17550874.2018.14308702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZani, D.10aClimatic control of germination in the genus Silene L  ap. 431-442.  aBackground: Seed germination strategies depend on a number of factors such as climatic variables, habitat, life cycle, phylogenetic affiliation and morphological seed traits. Aims: We present a novel evaluation of the ecological correlates of germination strategies focussing on plant populations drawn from a single genus and considering a number of relevant explanatory variables. Methods: Temperature and light-controlled germination experiments were carried out on 21 seed accessions belonging to 13 closely related species of the genus Silene L. Accessions were selected to tightly control the phylogenetic effect and give broad ecological and geographic coverage of the genus in Europe, with three North American and Macaronesian outgroups from climatically extreme environments. We used principal component analysis and correlation analyses to identify the correlation structure of germination traits and include multiple explanatory variables. Results: Three germination strategies were shown to be related to climatic control. (1) Seeds from arid regions with hot, dry summers germinated optimally at cool temperatures associated with the rainfall period under field conditions, whereas (2) the benefit of cold stratification was more marked in provenances characterised by cold, dry winters, and (3) seeds from mild climates preferred warm temperatures for germination. Moreover, (4) biennial populations of disturbed habitats showed synchronised and rapid seed germination over a wide thermal window. In agreement with previous findings, (5) habitat-related syndromes were observed only for wetland populations. Correlations with seed mass were significant when related to summer precipitation, but weak or absent in relation to germination traits, indicating that, though influenced by the local climate, seed mass is a poor predictor of germination strategies. Conclusions: These results suggest that whilst habitat and life cycle might shape germination patterns to a certain extent, long-term climatic differences play a substantial role in selecting specific germination traits and strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorth Americans 3aSilene 3aarid zones 3aclimatic factors 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aphylogeny 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprovenance 3arain 3aseed germination 3aseed weight 3aseeds 3asummer 3atemperature 3awetlands 3awinter 3aEurope 0acold stratification 0alight requirement 0aprincipal component analysis 0aseed germination 0aseed mass 0aSilene 0atemperature requirement1 aMüller, J.

We propose that distinct aspects of environmental change associated with N enrichment (resource limitation, asymmetric competition, and interactions with soil microbes) drive different aspects of plant response. We test this in greenhouse mesocosms, experimentally manipulating each factor across three ecosystems: tallgrass prairie, alpine tundra and desert grassland. We found that resource limitation controlled productivity responses to N enrichment in all systems. Asymmetric competition was responsible for diversity declines in two systems. Plant community composition was impacted by both asymmetric competition and altered soil microbes, with some contributions from resource limitation. Results suggest there may be generality in the mechanisms of plant community change with N enrichment. Understanding these links can help us better predict N response across a wide range of ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine tundra 3abotanical composition 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3agreenhouses 3anitrogen 3aplant communities 3aplant response 3asoil microorganisms1 aSuding, Katharine N.0 tEcology letters.g2016 Oct., v. 19, no. 10 p.1287-1296dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.126653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02207naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010400169300001600273520098100289592002801270650001101298650001601309650002701325650002501352650001901377650001101396650001701407650002001424653003001444653003101474653002101505653002001526700002101546700002301567700002601590773009801616856008601714852000901800655001201809IND60593084120221121031408.0180415e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059308412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWetser, Koen10aElectricity generation by a plant microbial fuel cell with an integrated oxygen reducing biocathode  ap. 151-157.  aIn this study we show that a chemical ferricyanide cathode can be replaced by a biological oxygen reducing cathode in a plant microbial fuel cell (PMFC) with a new record power output. A biocathode was successfully integrated in a PMFC and operated for 151days. Plants growth continued and the power density increased reaching a maximum power output of 679mW/m² plant growth area (PGA) in a 10min polarization. The two week record average power densities was 240mW/m² PGA. The new records were reached due to the high redox potential of oxygen reduction which was effectively catalyzed by microorganisms in the cathode. This resulted in a 127mV higher cathode potential of the PMFC with a biocathode than a PMFC with a ferricyanide cathode. We also found that substrate availability in the anode likely limits the current generation. This work is crucial for PMFC application as it shows that PMFC can be a completely sustainable biotechnology with an improved power output.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3abiocathodes 3aelectricity generation 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amicroorganisms 3aoxygen 3aplant growth 3aredox potential 0aPlant microbial fuel cell 0aOxygen reducing biocathode 0aSpartina anglica 0aBio-electricity1 aSudirjo, Emilius1 aBuisman, Cees J.N.1 aStrik, David P.B.T.B.0 tApplied energy.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 137 p.151-157dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03716naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245014700173300001800320520171100338592002802049650003202077650002102109650001402130650001802144650001402162650001502176650002502191650002502216650003102241650002402272650001102296650001902307650001402326650001402340650003702354650004302391650001102434650001402445650002902459650002602488653001202514653000802526653000902534653000902543653001002552653000802562653000902570653001002579653000802589653002302597653002002620653001002640653002202650653001202672700002602684700001302710700001502723700001802738700005902756773012102815856008502936852000903021655001203030IND60565537420221120113922.0180829e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056553742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDasgupta, Nirmalya10aPolo-like kinase 1 expression is suppressed by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α to mediate colon carcinoma cell differentiation and apoptosis  ap. 1777-1787.  aHuman polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase is a key player in several essential cell-cycle events. PLK1 is considered an oncogene and its overexpression often correlates with poor prognosis of cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, regulation of PLK1 expression in colorectal cells was never studied earlier and it is currently unknown if PLK1 regulates differentiation and apoptosis of CRC.PLK1 expression was analyzed by real-time PCR and western blotting. Transcriptional regulation was studied by reporter assay, gene knock-down, EMSA and ChIP.PLK1 expression was down-regulated during butyrate-induced differentiation of HT-29 and other CRC cells. Also, PLK1 down-regulation mediated the role of butyrate in CRC differentiation and apoptosis. We report here a novel transcriptional regulation of PLK1 by butyrate. Transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and Oct-1 share an overlapping binding site over the PLK1 promoter. Elevated levels of C/EBPα by butyrate treatment of CRC cells competed out the activator protein Oct-1 from binding to the PLK1 promoter and sequestered it. Binding of C/EBPα was associated with increased deacetylation near the transcription start site (TSS) of the PLK1 promoter, which abrogated transcription through reduced recruitment of RNA polymerase II. We also found a synergistic role between the synthetic PLK1-inhibitor SBE13 and butyrate on the apoptosis of CRC cells.This study offered a novel p53-independent regulation of PLK1 during CRC differentiation and apoptosis.Down-regulation of PLK1 is one of the mechanisms underlying the anti-cancer role of dietary fibre-derived butyrate in CRC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aWestern blotting 3aapoptosis 3abinding sites 3abutyrates 3acell cycle 3acell differentiation 3acolorectal neoplasms 3agene expression regulation 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3aneoplasm cells 3aoncogenes 3aprognosis 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aserine 3athreonine 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aC/EBPα 0aCRC 0aH3/4 0aHDAC 0aHDACi 0aNaB 0aPLK1 0aPOL2A 0aTSS 0aPolo-like kinase 1 0aSodium butyrate 0aSBE13 0aColorectal cancer 0aC/EBPα1 aThakur, Bhupesh Kumar1 aTa, Atri1 aDas, Sayan1 aBanik, George1 aDas, Santasabuj1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0745-469X0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 July, v. 1861, no. 7 p.1777-1787dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02373naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245019300166300001800359520088300377592002801260650001401288650002501302650001801327650002101345650001901366650001301385650002001398650001001418650001301428650001101441650004401452650001601496650001601512650000901528650002601537700002301563700001801586700002001604700001901624700001601643700002401659700001901683773009901702856008101801852000901882655001201891IND60082560020221120133622.0141029e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008256002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-014-1633-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamira, Jebahi10aCytocompatibility, gene-expression profiling, apoptotic, mechanical and ²⁹Si, ³¹P solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance studies following treatment with a bioglass-chitosan composite  ap. 2571-2579.  aThe performance therapy of chitosan (CH)-doped bioactive glass (BG) has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

The CH-BG composite may therefore prove clinically useful as a bioactive bone substitute.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abioactive properties 3abone strength 3abone substitutes 3acell viability 3achitosan 3agene expression 3aglass 3ahardness 3ahumans 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aosteocalcin 3aovariectomy 3arats 3atranscription factors1 aHassane, Oudadesse1 aMongi, Saoudi1 aFakhri, Kallabi1 aPellen, Pascal1 aTreq, Rebai1 aAbdelfatteh, Elfeki1 aHassib, Keskes0 tBiotechnology letters.g2014 Dec., v. 36, no. 12 p.2571-2579dSpringer-Verlagx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-014-1633-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011300160520125600273592002801529650001601557650002101573650001901594650003301613650001701646650002001663650001001683650001501693650001201708650001401720650002501734650001801759700001601777700001701793700001601810700001701826700001801843700001701861700001401878773012101892856007902013852000902092655001202101IND60781063420221120105132.0220623e20220609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078106342DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111215392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Meng 10aMolecular Cloning and Analysis of an Acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase Gene (EkAACT) from Euphorbia kansui Liou  aTerpenoids are the largest class of natural products and are essential for cell functions in plants and their interactions with the environment. Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (AACT, EC2.3.1.9) can catalyze a key initiation step of the mevalonate pathway (MVA) for terpenoid biosynthesis and is modulated by many endogenous and external stimuli. Here, the function and expression regulation activities of AACT in Euphorbia kansui Liou (EkAACT) were reported. Compared with wild-type Arabidopsis, the root length, whole seedling fresh weight and growth morphology of EkAACT-overexpressing plants were slightly improved. The transcription levels of AtAACT, AtMDC, AtMK, AtHMGR, and AtHMGS in the MVA pathway and total triterpenoid accumulation increased significantly in transgenic Arabidopsis. Under NaCl and PEG treatment, EkAACT-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed a higher accumulation of total triterpenoids, higher enzyme activity of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), increased root length and whole seedling fresh weight, and a decrease in the proline content, which indicated that plant tolerance to abiotic stress was enhanced. Thus, AACT, as the first crucial enzyme, plays a major role in the overall regulation of the MVA pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aEuphorbia kansui 3aabiotic stress 3aacetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 3abiosynthesis 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aperoxidase 3aproline 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atriterpenoids1 aZheng, Zhe 1 aTian, Zheni 1 aZhang, Hao 1 aZhu, Chenyu 1 aYao, Xiangyu 1 aYang, Yixin 1 aCai, Xia 0 tPlants.g2022 June 09, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111215393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02527naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245008500168520128600253592002801539650003001567650001001597650001901607650001601626650002801642650001601670650002001686650001101706650002101717650001001738651001101748700002601759700002801785700002501813700003401838700002001872700002101892773012101913856007402034852000902108655001202117IND60742691620221122060059.0210624e20210527xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074269162DNAL7 a10.3390/nu130618262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakken, Kjersti Sletten10aAdequate Urinary Iodine Concentration among Infants in the Inland Area of Norway  aConsidering the importance of iodine to support optimal growth and neurological development of the brain and central nervous system, this study aimed to assess and evaluate iodine status in Norwegian infants. We collected data on dietary intake of iodine, iodine knowledge in mothers, and assessed iodine concentration in mother’s breast milk and in infant’s urine in a cross-sectional study at two public healthcare clinics in the inland area of Norway. In the 130 mother–infant pairs, the estimated infant 24-h median iodine intake was 50 (IQR 31, 78) µg/day. The median infant urinary iodine concentration (UIC) was 146 (IQR 93, 250) µg/L and within the recommended median defined by the World Health Organization for this age group. Weaned infants had a higher UIC [210 (IQR 130, 330) µg/L] than exclusively breastfed infants [130 (IQR 78, 210) µg/L] and partially breastfed infants [135 (IQR 89, 250) µg/L], which suggest that the dietary data obtained in this study did not capture the accurate iodine intake of the included infants. The iodine status of infants in the inland area of Norway seemed adequate. Weaned infants had higher UIC compared to breastfed infants, suggesting early access and consumption of other sources of iodine in addition to breast milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3abrain 3abreast feeding 3abreast milk 3across-sectional studies 3afood intake 3ahealth services 3aiodine 3aneurodevelopment 3aurine 3aNorway1 aAarsland, Tonje Eiane1 aGroufh-Jacobsen, Synne 1 aSolvik, Beate Stokke1 aGjengedal, Elin Lovise Folven1 aHenjum, Sigrun 1 aStrand, Tor Arne0 tNutrients.g2021 May 27, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu130618263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245008200166300001800248520162700266592002801893650002101921650002801942650002101970650001601991650001402007650003502021650001502056650000902071650001102080650001902091650002002110650002102130650001402151650004302165650005202208650001702260650002702277653001802304653001102322653001002333653001702343653002402360700001602384700001902400700001502419700001902434700001602453700001502469700002002484700001702504700001602521700001602537700001802553700001702571700001202588700001702600700005602617773012102673856008502794852000902879655001202888IND60565537520221120104308.0180829e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056553752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Wenjun10aRUVBL1-ITFG1 interaction is required for collective invasion in breast cancer  ap. 1788-1800.  aThe mechanisms of breast cancer collective invasion are poorly understood limiting the metastasis therapy. The ATPase RUVBL1 is frequently overexpressed in various cancers and plays a crucial role in oncogenic process. We further investigated the role of RUVBL1 in promoting collective invasion and uncovered that targeting RUVBL1 could inhibit metastatic progression.The expression levels of RUVBL1 and ITFG1 were examined by Western blot and qRT-PCR. Co-localization and interaction of RUVBL1 and ITFG1 were determined by immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation. The invasive ability was examined by transwell assay and microfluidic assay. The metastatic and tumorigenic abilities of breast cancer cells were revealed in BALB/c nude mice by xenograft and tail vein injection.ATPase RUVBL1 is highly expressed in breast cancer and predicts the poor prognosis. Elevated expression of RUVBL1 is found in high metastatic breast cancer cells. Silencing RUVBL1 suppresses cancer cell expansion and invasion in vitro and in vivo. RUVBL1 interacts with a conserved transmembrane protein ITFG1 in cytoplasm and plasma membrane to promote the collective invasion. Using a microfluidic model, we demonstrated that silencing RUVBL1 or ITFG1 individually compromises collective invasion of breast cancer cells.RUVBL1 is a vital regulator for collective invasion. The interaction between RUVBL1 and ITFG1 is required for breast cancer cell collective invasion and progression.Targeting collective invasion promoted by RUVBL1-ITFG1 complex provides a novel therapeutic strategy to improve the prognosis of invasive breast cancer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abreast neoplasms 3acaudal vein 3acytoplasm 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ametastasis 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aplasma membrane 3aprecipitin tests 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atherapeutics 3atransmembrane proteins 0aBreast cancer 0aRUVBL1 0aITFG1 0aMicrofluidic 0aCollective invasion1 aXie, Jiajun1 aXia, Jianglong1 aZhang, Yan1 aYang, Mengying1 aWang, Hefei1 aPan, Yujia1 aZhang, Mengjuan1 aHan, Baochun1 aWu, Baitong1 aHou, Zhijie1 aLiang, Dapeng1 aWang, Chunli1 aXu, Jie1 aSong, Lijuan1 aLiu, Quentin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0999-98050 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2017 July, v. 1861, no. 7 p.1788-1800dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2017.03.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245016100164520124400325592002801569650001901597650001901616650001701635650001501652650003101667650002001698650002101718650003701739650003401776650002901810650001901839650002201858650002401880650001201904650002901916650001801945650002001963700001701983700002302000700001702023700001402040700001502054700001902069700001702088700002002105773012102125856007902246852000902325655001202334IND60781063520221120105023.0220623e20220609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078106352DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111215402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahman, Faiz Ur14aThe Promoter Analysis of VvPR1 Gene: A Candidate Gene Identified through Transcriptional Profiling of Methyl Jasmonate Treated Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.)  aMethyl jasmonate (MeJA) plays a vital role in plant disease resistance and also induces the expression of disease resistance genes in plants. In this study, a transcriptome analysis was performed on grapevine leaves after 12, 24 and 48 h of MeJA-100 μM treatment. A total of 1242 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from the transcriptome data, and the analysis of the DEGs showed that genes related to phytohormone signal transduction, jasmonic acid-mediated defense, Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and flavonoid biosynthetic pathways were upregulated. As Pathogenesis-related gene 1 (PR1) is an important marker gene in plant defense also upregulated by MeJA treatment in RNA-seq data, the VvPR1 gene was selected for a promoter analysis with β-glucuronidase (GUS) through transient expression in tobacco leaves against abiotic stress. The results showed that the region from −1837 bp to −558 bp of the VvPR1 promoter is the key region in response to hormone and wound stress. In this study, we extended the available knowledge about induced defense by MeJA in a grapevine species that is susceptible to different diseases and identified the molecular mechanisms by which this defense might be mediated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3aabiotic stress 3abiosynthesis 3aflavonoids 3agene expression regulation 3agenetic markers 3amethyl jasmonate 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aplant disease resistance 3aplant hormones 3asequence analysis 3asignal transduction 3atobacco 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aZhang, Ying 1 aKhan, Irshad Ahmad1 aLiu, Ruitao 1 aSun, Lei 1 aWu, Yandi 1 aJiang, Jianfu 1 aFan, Xiucai 1 aLiu, Chonghuai 0 tPlants.g2022 June 09, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111215403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010400162300001800266520152300284592002801807650001701835650001301852650001701865650001301882650002401895650002101919650001301940650001501953651001001968700001701978700002101995700001802016773010802034856007402142852000902216655001202225IND60478985720221119194424.0160116e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047898572DNAL7 a10.1111/maec.122412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUribe, Roberto A.10aEarly succession of micro‐periphyton communities in kelp bed and barren ground ecological systems  ap. 1415-1427.  aIn shallow sublittoral rocky habitats of the Southeast Pacific, two conspicuous ecological systems exist; kelp beds dominated by large Laminariales algae, and barren grounds dominated by crustose coralline algae and sea urchins. The aim of this study was to examine the successional development of micro‐periphyton communities in both ecological systems using a colonization experiment conducted in Northern Chile. In both ecological systems, we installed replicated ceramic plates at 10 m depth and samples were taken after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 14 days of exposure. Bacteria, diatoms, protozoans and small eukaryotes were identified, quantified and analysed. The succession of micro‐periphyton communities in both ecological systems followed a common pattern consisting of a net accumulation of functional groups and taxa over time; however, the total density of all groups was significantly higher in the kelp beds. In addition, the community structure of the developing micro‐periphytons was different and specific for each ecological system. Although previous studies have suggested that kelp beds and barren grounds are capable of switching from one state to the other without substantial changes in biodiversity, our results show that each of these ecological systems promotes its own successional development, suggesting that they are unique, self‐organized entities. This study is the first step towards an understanding of these ecological systems operating independently at this scale of organization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLaminariales 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3aceramics 3acommunity structure 3aeukaryotic cells 3ahabitats 3amacroalgae 3aChile1 aOrtiz, Marco1 aPacheco, Aldo S.1 aAraya, Ruben,0 tMarine ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 36, no. 4 p.1415-1427dPaul Parey Scientific Publishersx0173-95657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maec.122413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
